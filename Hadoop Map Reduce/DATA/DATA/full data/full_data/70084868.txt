   1  the story of william porphyry benham is the story of a man who was led into adventure by an idea it was an idea that took possession of his imagination quite early in life it grew with him and changed with him it interwove at last completely with his being his story is its story it was traceably germinating in the schoolboy it was manifestly present in his mind at the very last moment of his adventurous life he belonged to that fortunate minority who are independent of daily necessities so that he was free to go about the world under its direction it led him far it led him into situations that bordered upon the fantastic it made him ridiculous it came near to making him sublime and this idea of his was of such a nature that in several aspects he could document it its logic forced him to introspection and to the making of a record  an idea that can play so large a part in a life must necessarily have something of the complication and protean quality of life itself it is not to be stated justly in any formula it is not to be rendered by an epigram as well one might show a mans skeleton for his portrait yet essentially benhams idea was simple he had an incurable an almost innate persuasion that he had to live life nobly and thoroughly his commoner expression for that thorough living is the aristocratic life but by aristocratic he meant something very different from the quality of a russian prince let us say or an english peer he meant an intensity a clearness nobility for him was to get something out of his individual existence a flame a jewel a splendourit is a thing easier to understand than to say  one might hesitate to call this idea innate and yet it comes soon into a life when it comes at all in benhams case we might trace it back to the day nursery at seagate we might detect it stirring already at the petticoat stage in various private struttings and valiant dreamings with a helmet of pasteboard and a whitemetal sword we have most of us been at least as far as that with benham and we have died like horatius slaying our thousands for our country or we have perished at the stake or faced the levelled muskets of the firing partyno do not bandage my eyesbecause we would not betray the secret path that meant destruction to our city but with benham the vein was stronger and it increased instead of fading out as he grew to manhood it was less obscured by those earthy acquiescences those discretions that saving sense of proportion which have made most of us so satisfactorily what we are porphyry his mother had discovered before he was seventeen is an excellent boy a brilliant boy but i begin to see just a little unbalanced  the interest of him the absurdity of him the story of him is that  most of us arebalanced in spite of occasional reveries we do come to terms with the limitations of life with those desires and dreams and discretions that to say the least of it qualify our nobility we take refuge in our sense of humour and congratulate ourselves on a certain amiable freedom from priggishness or presumption but for benham that easy declension to a humorous acceptance of life as it is did not occur he found his limitations soon enough he was perpetually rediscovering them but out of these interments of the spirit he rose againremarkably when we others have decided that to be plain about it we are not going to lead the noble life at all that the thing is too ambitious and expensive even to attempt we have done so because there were other conceptions of existence that were good enough for us we decided that instead of that glorious impossible being of ourselves we would figure in our own eyes as jolly fellows or sly dogs or sane sound capable men or brilliant successes and so forthpracticable things for benham exceptionally there were not these practicable things he blundered he fell short of himself he hadas you will be toldsome astonishing rebuffs but they never turned him aside for long he went by nature for this preposterous idea of nobility as a linnet hatched in a cage will try to fly  and when he discoveredand in this he was assisted not a little by his friend at his elbowwhen he discovered that nobility was not the simple thing he had at first supposed it to be he set himself in a mood only slightly disconcerted to the discovery of nobility when it dawned upon him as it did that one cannot be noble so to speak in vacuo he set himself to discover a noble society he began with simple beliefs and fine attitudes and ended in a conscious research if he could not get through by a stride then it followed that he must get through by a climb he spent the greater part of his life studying and experimenting in the noble possibilities of man he never lost his absurd faith in that conceivable splendour at first it was always just round the corner or just through the wood to the last it seemed still but a little way beyond the distant mountains  for this reason this story has been called the research magnificent it was a real research it was documented in the rooms in westhaven street that at last were as much as one could call his home he had accumulated material forone hesitates to call it a booklet us say it was an analysis of a guide to the noble life there after his tragic death came his old friend white the journalist and novelist under a promise and found these papers he found them to the extent of a crammed bureau half a score of patent files quite distended and a writingtable drawerfull and he was greatly exercised to find them they were white declares they are still after much experienced handling an indigestible aggregation on this point white is very assured when benham thought he was gathering together a book he was dreaming white says there is no book in it  perhaps too one might hazard benham was dreaming when he thought the noble life a human possibility perhaps man like the ape and the hyaena and the tapeworm and many other of gods necessary but less attractive creatures is not for such exalted ends that doubt never seems to have got a lodgment in benhams skull though at times one might suppose it the basis of whites thought you will find in all benhams story if only it can be properly told now subdued now loud and amazed and distressed but always traceable this startled protesting question but why the devil arent we as though necessarily we ought to be he never faltered in his persuasion that behind the dingy face of this world the earthy stubbornness the baseness and dulness of himself and all of us lurked the living jewels of heaven the light of glory things unspeakable at first it seemed to him that one had only just to hammer and will and at the end after a life of willing and hammering he was still convinced there was something something in the nature of an open sesame perhaps a little more intricate than one had supposed at first a little more difficult to secure but still in that nature which would suddenly roll open for mankind the magic cave of the universe that precious cave at the heart of all things in which one must believe  and then lifelife would be the wonder it so perplexingly just isnt    2   benham did not go about the world telling people of this consuming research he was not the prophet or preacher of his idea it was too living and intricate and uncertain a part of him to speak freely about it was his secret self to expose it casually would have shamed him he drew all sorts of reserves about him he wore his manifest imperfections turned up about him like an overcoat in bitter wind he was content to be inexplicable his thoughts led him to the conviction that this magnificent research could not be any more than any other research can be a solitary enterprise but he delayed expression in a mighty writing and stowing away of these papers he found a relief from the unpleasant urgency to confess and explain himself prematurely so that white though he knew benham with the intimacy of an old schoolfellow who had renewed his friendship and had shared his last days and been a witness of his death read the sheets of manuscript often with surprise and with a sense of added elucidation  and being also a trained maker of books white as he read was more and more distressed that an accumulation so interesting should be so entirely unshaped for publication but this will never make a book said white with a note of personal grievance his hasty promise in their last moments together had bound him it seemed to a task he now found impossible he would have to work upon it tremendously and even then he did not see how it could be done  this collection of papers was not a story not an essay not a confession not a diary it wasnothing definable it went into no conceivable covers it was just white decided a proliferation a vast proliferation it wanted even a title there were signs that benham had intended to call it the aristocratic life and that he had tried at some other time the title of an essay on aristocracy moreover it would seem that towards the end he had been disposed to drop the word aristocratic altogether and adopt some such phrase as the larger life once it was life set free he had fallen away more and more from nearly everything that one associates with aristocracyat the end only its ideals of fearlessness and generosity remained  of all these titles the aristocratic life seemed at first most like a clue to white benhams erratic movements his sudden impulses his angers his unaccountable patiences his journeys to strange places and his lapses into what had seemed to be pure adventurousness could all be put into system with that before white had turned over three pages of the great fascicle of manuscript that was called book two he had found the word bushido written with a particularly flourishing capital letter and twice repeated that was inevitable said white with the comforting regret one feels for a friends banalities and it dates unreadable this was early  modern aristocracy the new aristocracy he read presently has still to be discovered and understood this is the necessary next step for mankind as far as possible i will discover and understand it and as far as i know it i will be it this is the essential disposition of my mind god knows i have appetites and sloths and habits and blindnesses but so far as it is in my power to release myself i will escape to this    3   white sat far into the night and for several nights turning over papers and rummaging in untidy drawers memories came back to him of his dead friend and pieced themselves together with other memories and joined on to scraps in this writing bold yet convincing guesses began to leap across the gaps a story shaped itself  the story began with the schoolfellow he had known at minchinghampton school  benham had come up from his fathers preparatory school at seagate he had been a boy reserved rather than florid in his acts and manners a boy with a pale face incorrigible hair and brown eyes that went dark and deep with excitement several times white had seen him excited and when he was excited benham was capable of tensely daring things on one occasion he had insisted upon walking across a field in which was an aggressive bull it had been put there to prevent the boys taking a short cut to the swimming place it had bellowed tremendously and finally charged him he had dodged it and got away at the time it had seemed an immense feat to white and the others who were safely up the field he had walked to the fence risking a second charge by his deliberation then he had sat on the fence and declared his intention of always crossing the field so long as the bull remained there he had said this with white intensity he had stopped abruptly in midsentence and then suddenly he had dropped to the ground clutched the fence struggled with heaving shoulders and been sick  the combination of apparently stout heart and manifestly weak stomach had exercised the minchinghampton intelligence profoundly  on one or two other occasions benham had shown courage of the same rather screwedup sort he showed it not only in physical but in mental things a boy named prothero set a fashion of religious discussion in the school and benham after some selfexamination professed an atheistical republicanism rather in the manner of shelley this brought him into open conflict with roddles the history master roddles had discovered these theological controversies in some mysterious way and he took upon himself to talk at benham and prothero he treated them to the common misapplication of that fool who hath said in his heart there is no god he did not perceive there was any difference between the fool who says a thing in his heart and one who says it in the dormitory he revived that delectable anecdote of the eton boy who professed disbelief and was at once soundly flogged by his head master years afterwards that boy came back to thank   gurr said prothero softly steward  your turn next benham whispered an orthodox controversialist  good lord id like to see him said benham with a forced loudness that could scarcely be ignored  the subsequent controversy led to an interview with the head from it benham emerged more whitely strung up than ever he said he would certainly swish me if i deserved it and i said i would certainly kill him if he did  and then  he told me to go away and think it over said he would preach about it next sunday well a swishing isnt a likely thing anyhow but i would there isnt a master here id stand a thrashing fromnot one and because i choose to say what i think id run amuck  for a week or so the school was exhilarated by a vain and illconcealed hope that the head might try it just to see if benham would it was tantalizingly within the bounds of possibility  these incidents came back to whites mind as he turned over the newspapers in the upper drawer of the bureau the drawer was labelled fearthe first limitation and the material in it was evidently designed for the opening volume of the great unfinished book indeed a portion of it was already arranged and written up  as white read through this manuscript he was reminded of a score of schoolboy discussions benham and he and prothero had had together here was the same old toughness of mind a kind of intellectual hardihood that had sometimes shocked his schoolfellows benham had been one of those boys who do not originate ideas very freely but who go out to them with a fierce sincerity he believed and disbelieved with emphasis prothero had first set him doubting but it was benhams own temperament took him on to denial his youthful atheism had been a matter for secret consternation in white white did not believe very much in god even then but this positive disbelieving frightened him it was going too far there had been a terrible moment in the dormitory during a thunderstorm a thunderstorm so vehement that it had awakened them all when latham the humourist and a quietly devout boy had suddenly challenged benham to deny his maker  now say you dont believe in god  benham sat up in bed and repeated his negative faith while little hopkins the bishops son being less certain about the accuracy of providence than his aim edged as far as he could away from benhams cubicle and rolled his head in his bedclothes  and anyhow said benham when it was clear that he was not to be struck dead forthwith you show a poor idea of your god to think hed kill a schoolboy for honest doubt even old roddles  i cant listen to you cried latham the humourist i cant listen to you itshorrible  well who began it asked benham  a flash of lightning lit the dormitory and showed him to white whitefaced and ablaze with excitement sitting up with the bedclothes about him oh wow wailed the muffled voice of little hopkins as the thunder burst like a giant pistol overhead and he buried his head still deeper in the bedclothes and gave way to unappeasable grief  lathams voice came out of the darkness this atheism that you and billy prothero have brought into the school  he started violently at another vivid flash and every one remained silent waiting for the thunder  but white remembered no more of the controversy because he had made a frightful discovery that filled and blocked his mind every time the lightning flashed there was a red light in benhams eyes  it was only three days after when prothero discovered exactly the same phenomenon in the school house boothole and talked of cats and cattle that whites confidence in their friend was partially restored    4   fear the first limitationhis title indicated the spirit of benhams opening book very clearly his struggle with fear was the very beginning of his souls history it continued to the end he had hardly decided to lead the noble life before he came bump against the fact that he was a physical coward he felt fear acutely fear he wrote is the foremost and most persistent of the shepherding powers that keep us in the safe fold that drive us back to the beaten track and comfort andfutility the beginning of all aristocracy is the subjugation of fear  at first the struggle was so great that he hated fear without any qualification he wanted to abolish it altogether  when i was a boy he writes i thought i would conquer fear for good and all and never more be troubled by it but it is not to be done in that way one might as well dream of having dinner for the rest of ones life each time and always i have found that it has to be conquered afresh to this day i fear little things as well as big things i have to grapple with some little dread every dayurge myself just as i have to wash and shave myself every day i believe it is so with every one but it is difficult to be sure few men who go into dangers care very much to talk about fear  later benham found some excuses for fear came even to dealings with fear he never however admits that this universal instinct is any better than a kindly but unintelligent nurse from whose fostering restraints it is mans duty to escape discretion he declared must remain a sense of proportion an adequacy of enterprise but the discretion of an aristocrat is in his head a tactical detail it has nothing to do with this visceral sinking this ebb in the nerves from top to bottom the whole spectrum of fear is bad from panic fear at one extremity down to that mere disinclination for enterprise that reluctance and indolence which is its lowest phase these are things of the beast these are for creatures that have a settled environment a life history that spin in a cage of instincts but man is a beast of that kind no longer he has left his habitat he goes out to limitless living  this idea of man going out into new things leaving securities habits customs leaving his normal life altogether behind him underlay all benhams aristocratic conceptions and it was natural that he should consider fear as entirely inconvenient treat it indeed with ingratitude and dwell upon the immense liberations that lie beyond for those who will force themselves through its remonstrances  benham confessed his liability to fear quite freely in these notes his fear of animals was ineradicable he had had an overwhelming dread of bears until he was twelve or thirteen the childs irrational dread of impossible bears bears lurking under the bed and in the evening shadows he confesses that even up to manhood he could not cross a field containing cattle without keeping a wary eye upon themhis bull adventure rather increased than diminished that dispositionhe hated a strange dog at his heels and would manoeuvre himself as soon as possible out of reach of the teeth or heels of a horse but the peculiar dread of his childhood was tigers some gaping nursemaid confronted him suddenly with a tiger in a cage in the menagerie annexe of a circus my small mind was overwhelmed  i had never thought white read that a tiger was much larger than a st bernard dog this great creature i could not believe any hunter would attack such a monster except by stealth and with weapons of enormous power  he jerked himself to and fro across his cramped rickety cage and looked over my head with yellow eyesat some phantom far away every now and then he snarled the contempt of his detestable indifference sank deeper and deeper into my soul i knew that were the cage to vanish i should stand there motionless his helpless prey i knew that were he at large in the same building with me i should be too terrorstricken to escape him at the foot of a ladder leading clear to escape i should have awaited him paralyzed at last i gripped my nurses hand take me away i whispered  in my dreams that night he stalked me i made my frozen flight from him i slammed a door on him and he thrust his paw through a panel as though it had been paper and clawed for me the paw got longer and longer  i screamed so loudly that my father came up from his study  i remember that he took me in his arms  its only a big sort of pussy poff he said felis tigris felis you know means cat  but i knew better i was in no mood then for my fathers insatiable pedagoguery  and my little son mustnt be a coward  after that i understood i must keep silence and bear my tigers alone  for years the thought of that tigers immensity haunted my mind in my dreams i cowered before it a thousand times in the dusk it rarely failed me on the landing on my way to bed there was a patch of darkness beyond a chest that became a lurking horror for me and sometimes the door of my fathers bedroom would stand open and there was a long buff and crimsonstriped shape by day indeed an ottoman but by night could an ottoman crouch and stir in the flicker of a passing candle could an ottoman come after you noiselessly and so close that you could not even turn round upon it no    5   when benham was already seventeen and as he supposed hardened against his fear of beasts his friend prothero gave him an account of the killing of an old labouring man by a stallion which had escaped out of its stable the beast had careered across a field leapt a hedge and come upon its victim suddenly he had run a few paces and stopped trying to defend his head with the horse rearing over him it beat him down with two swift blows of its fore hoofs one two lifted him up in its long yellow teeth and worried him as a terrier does a ratthe poor old wretch was still able to make a bleating sound at thatdropped him trampled and kicked him as he tried to crawl away and went on trampling and battering him until he was no more than a bloody inhuman bundle of clothes and mire for more than half an hour this continued and then its animal rage was exhausted and it desisted and went and grazed at a little distance from this misshapen hoofmarked torn and muddy remnant of a man no one it seems but a horrorstricken child knew what was happening  this picture of human indignity tortured benhams imagination much more than it tortured the teller of the tale it filled him with shame and horror for three or four years every detail of that circumstantial narrative seemed unforgettable a little lapse from perfect health and the obsession returned he could not endure the neighing of horses when he saw horses galloping in a field with him his heart stood still and all his life thereafter he hated horses    6   a different sort of fear that also greatly afflicted benham was due to a certain clumsiness and insecurity he felt in giddy and unstable places there he was more definitely balanced between the hopelessly rash and the pitifully discreet  he had written an account of a private struggle between himself and a certain path of planks and rock edges called the bisse of leysin this happened in his adolescence he had had a bad attack of influenza and his doctor had sent him to a little hotelthe only hotel it was in those daysat montana in valais there later when he had picked up his strength his father was to join him and take him mountaineering that secondrate mountaineering which is so dear to dons and schoolmasters when the time came he was ready for that but he had had his experiences he had gone through a phase of real cowardice he was afraid he confessed before even he reached montana he was afraid of the steepness of the mountains he had to drive ten or twelve miles up and up the mountainside a road of innumerable hairpin bends and precipitous banks the horse was gaunt and ugly with a disposition to shy and he confesses he clutched the side of the vehicle and speculated how he should jump if presently the whole turnout went tumbling over  and afterwards i dreamt dreams of precipices i made strides over precipices i fell and fell with a floating swiftness towards remote valleys i was assailed by eagles upon a perilous ledge that crumbled away and left me clinging by my nails to nothing  the bisse of leysin is one of those artificial watercourses which bring water from some distant source to pastures that have an insufficient or uncertain supply it is a little better known than most because of a certain exceptional boldness in its construction for a distance of a few score yards it runs supported by iron staples across the front of a sheer precipice and for perhaps half a mile it hangs like an eyebrow over nearly or quite vertical walls of pineset rock beside it on the outer side of it runs a path which becomes an offhand gangway of planking at the overhanging places at one corner which gives the favourite picture postcard from montana the rocks project so sharply above the water that the passenger on the gangway must crouch down upon the bending plank as he walks there is no handhold at all  a path from montana takes one over a pineclad spur and down a precipitous zigzag upon the middle of the bisse and thither benham came fascinated by the very fact that here was something of which the mere report frightened him he had to walk across the cold clear rush of the bisse upon a pine log and then he found himself upon one of the gentler interludes of the bisse track it was a scrambling path nearly two feet wide and below it were slopes but not so steep as to terrify at a vast distance below he saw through treestems and blue haze a twisted strand of bright whiteness the river that joins the rhone at sion it looped about and passed out of sight remotely beneath his feet he turned to the right and came to a corner that overhung a precipice he craned his head round this corner and saw the evil place of the picturepostcards  he remained for a long time trying to screw himself up to walk along the jagged sixinch edge of rock between cliff and torrent into which the path has shrunken to the sagging plank under the overhanging rock beyond  he could not bring himself to do that  it happened that close to the corner a large lump of rock and earth was breaking away a cleft was opening so that presently it seemed possible at any moment the mass would fall headlong into the blue deeps below this impending avalanche was not in my path along the bisse it was no sort of danger to me but in some way its insecurity gave a final touch to my cowardice i could not get myself round that corner  he turned away he went and examined the planks in the other direction and these he found less forbidding he crossed one precipitous place with a fall of twoscore feet or less beneath him and found worse ahead there also he managed a third place was still more disagreeable the plank was worn and thin and sagged under him he went along it supporting himself against the rock above the bisse with an extended hand halfway the rock fell back so that there was nothing whatever to hold he stopped hesitating whether he should go backbut on this plank there was no going back because no turning round seemed practicable while he was still hesitating there came a helpful intervention behind him he saw a peasant appearing and disappearing behind trees and projecting rock masses and coming across the previous plank at a vigorous trot  under the stimulus of a spectator benham got to the end of this third place without much trouble then very politely he stood aside for the expert to go ahead so that he could follow at his own pace  there were however more difficulties yet to come and a disagreeable humiliation that confounded peasant developed a parental solicitude after each crossing he waited and presently began to offer advice and encouragement at last came a place where everything was overhanging where the bisse was leaking and the plank wet and slippery the water ran out of the leak near the brim of the wooden channel and fell in a long shivering thread of silver there was no sound of its fall it just fellinto a void benham wished he had not noted that he groaned but faced the plank he knew this would be the slowest affair of all  the peasant surveyed him from the further side  dont be afraid cried the peasant in his clumsy valaisian french and returned returning along the plank that seemed quite sufficiently loaded without him extending a charitable hand  damn whispered benham but he took the hand  afterwards rather ignobly he tried to explain in his publicschool french pas de peur he said pas de peur mais la tete na pas lhabitude  the peasant failing to understand assured him again that there was no danger  damn  benham was led over all the other planks he was led as if he was an old lady crossing a glacier he was led into absolute safety and shamefacedly he rewarded his guide then he went a little way and sat down swore softly and watched the honest man go striding and plunging down towards lens until he was out of sight  now said benham to himself if i do not go back along the planks my secret honour is gone for ever  he told himself that he had not a good head that he was not well that the sun was setting and the light no longer good that he had a very good chance indeed of getting killed then it came to him suddenly as a clear and simple truth as something luminously plain that it is better to get killed than go away defeated by such fears and unsteadiness as his the change came into his mind as if a white light were suddenly turned onwhere there had been nothing but shadows and darkness he rose to his feet and went swiftly and intently the whole way back going with a kind of temperate recklessness and because he was no longer careful easily he went on beyond his starting place toward the corner and did that supreme bit to and fro that bit where the lump was falling away and he had to crouch as gaily as the rest then he recrossed the bisse upon the pine log clambered up through the pines to the crest and returned through the meadows to his own hotel  after that he should have slept the sleep of contentment but instead he had quite dreadful nightmares of hanging in frozen fear above incredible declivities of illaimed leaps across chasms to slippery footholds of planks that swayed and broke suddenly in the middle and headed him down and down  the next day in the sunshine he walked the bisse again with those dreams like trailing mists in his mind and by comparison the path of the bisse was nothing it was like walking along a kerbstone it was an exercise for young ladies    7   in his younger days benham had regarded fear as a shameful secret and as a thing to be got rid of altogether it seemed to him that to feel fear was to fall short of aristocracy and in spite of the deep dreads and disgusts that haunted his mind he set about the business of its subjugation as if it were a spiritual amputation but as he emerged from the egotism of adolescence he came to realize that this was too comprehensive an operation every one feels fear and your true aristocrat is not one who has eliminated but one who controls or ignores it brave men are men who do things when they are afraid to do them just as nelson even when he was seasick and he was frequently seasick was still master of the sea benham developed two leading ideas about fear one that it is worse at the first onset and far worse than any real experience and the other that fear is essentially a social instinct he set himself upon these lines to studywhat can we call itthe taming of fear the nature care and management of fear  fear is very like pain in this that it is a deterrent thing it is superficial just as a mans skin is infinitely more sensitive than anything inside once you have forced yourself or have been forced through the outward fear into vivid action or experience you feel very little the worst moment is before things happen rowe the african sportsman told me that he had seen cowardice often enough in the presence of lions but he had never seen any one actually charged by a lion who did not behave well i have heard the same thing of many sorts of dangers  i began to suspect this first in the case of falling or jumping down giddiness may be an almost intolerable torture and falling nothing of the sort i once saw the face of an old man who had flung himself out of a high window in rome and who had been killed instantly on the pavement it was not simply a serene face it was glad exalted i suspect that when we have broken the shell of fear falling may be delightful jumping down is after all only a steeper tobogganing and tobogganing a milder jumping down always i used to funk at the top of the cresta run i suffered sometimes almost intolerably i found it almost impossible to get away the first ten yards was like being slashed open with a sharp sword but afterwards there was nothing but joyful thrills all instinct too fought against me when i tried high diving i managed it and began to like it i had to give it up because of my ears but not until i had established the habit of stepping through that moment of disinclination  i was challoners passenger when he was killed at sheerness that was a queer unexpected experience you may have supposed it an agony of terror but indeed there was no fear in it at all at any rate i do not remember a moment of fear it has gone clean out of my memory if ever it was there we were swimming high and fast three thousand feet or so in a clear sweet air over the town of sheerness the river with a string of battleships was far away to the west of us and the endless greyblue flats of the thames to the north the sun was low behind a bank of cloud i was watching a motorcar which seemed to be crawling slowly enough though no doubt it was making a respectable pace between two hedges down below it is extraordinary how slowly everything seems to be going when one sees it from such an height  then the left wing of the monoplane came up like a door that slams some wires whistled past my head and one whipped off my helmet and then with the seat slipping away from me down we went i snatched unavailingly for the helmet and then gripped the sides it was like dropping in a boat suddenly into the trough of a waveand going on dropping we were both strapped and i got my feet against the side and clung to the locked second wheel  the sensation was as though something like an intermittent electric current was pouring through me its a ridiculous image to use i cant justify it but it was as if i was having cold blue light squirted through every pore of my being there was an astonishment a feeling of confirmation of course these things do happen sometimes i told myself i dont remember that challoner looked round or said anything at all i am not sure that i looked at him  there seemed to be a long interval of intensely excited curiosity and i remember thinking lord but we shall come a smash in a minute far ahead i saw the grey sheds of eastchurch and people strolling about apparently unaware of our disaster there was a sudden silence as challoner stopped the engine  but the point i want to insist upon is that i did not feel afraid i was simply enormously terribly interested  there came a tremendous jolt and a lunge and we were both tipped forward so that we were hanging forehead down by our straps and it looked as if the sheds were in the sky then i saw nothing but sky then came another vast swerve and we were falling sideways sideways  i was altogether out of breath and physically astonished and i remember noting quite intelligently as we hit the ground how the green grass had an effect of pouring out in every direction from below us  then i remember a jerk and a feeling that i was flying up again i was astonished by a tremendous poppingfabric wires everything seemed going pop pop pop like a machinegun and then came a flash of intense pain as my arm crumpled up it was quite impersonal pain as impersonal as seeing intense colour splinters i remember the word came into my head instantly i remember that very definitely  i thought i suppose my arm was in splinters or perhaps of the scraps and ends of rods and wires flying about us it is curious that while i remember the word i cannot recall the idea  when i became conscious again the chief thing present in my mind was that all those fellows round were young soldiers who wouldnt at all understand bad behaviour my arm wasorchestral but still far from being real suffering in me also i wanted to know what challoner had got they wouldnt understand my questions and then i twisted round and saw from the negligent way his feet came out from under the engine that he must be dead and dark red stains with bright red froth  of course  there again the chief feeling was a sense of oddity i wasnt sorry for him any more than i was for myself  it seemed to me that it was all right with us both remarkable vivid but all right    8   but though there is little or no fear in an aeroplane even when it is smashing up there is fear about aeroplanes there is something that says very urgently dont to the man who looks up into the sky it is very interesting to note how at a place like eastchurch or brooklands the necessary discretion trails the old visceral feeling with it and how men will hang about ready to go up resolved to go up but delaying men of indisputable courage will get into a state between dread and laziness and waste whole hours of flying weather on any excuse or no excuse once they are up that inhibition vanishes the man who was delaying and delaying half an hour ago will now be cutting the most venturesome capers in the air few men are in a hurry to get down again i mean that quite apart from the hesitation of landing they like being up there  then abruptly benham comes back to his theory  fear you see is the inevitable janitor but it is not the ruler of experience that is what i am driving at in all this the bark of danger is worse than its bite inside the portals there may be events and destruction but terror stays defeated at the door it may be that when that old man was killed by a horse the child who watched suffered more than he did  i am sure that was so    9   as white read benhams notes and saw how his argument drove on he was reminded again and again of those schoolboy days and benhams hardihood and his own instinctive unreasonable reluctance to follow those gallant intellectual leads if fear is an ancient instinctive boundary that the modern life the aristocratic life is bound to ignore and transcend may this not also be the case with pain we do a little adventure into the life beyond fear may we not also think of adventuring into the life beyond pain is pain any saner a warning than fear may not pain just as much as fear keep us from possible and splendid things but why ask a question that is already answered in principle in every dentists chair benhams idea however went much further than that he was clearly suggesting that in pain itself pain endured beyond a certain pitch there might come pleasure again an intensity of sensation that might have the colour of delight he betrayed a real anxiety to demonstrate this possibility he had the earnestness of a man who is sensible of dissentient elements within he hated the thought of pain even more than he hated fear his arguments did not in the least convince white who stopped to poke the fire and assure himself of his own comfort in the midst of his reading  young people and unseasoned people benham argued are apt to imagine that if fear is increased and carried to an extreme pitch it becomes unbearable one will faint or die given a weak heart a weak artery or any such structural defect and that may well happen but it is just as possible that as the stimulation increases one passes through a brief ecstasy of terror to a new sane world exalted but as sane as normal existence there is the calmness of despair benham had made some notes to enforce this view of the observed calm behaviour of men already hopelessly lost men on sinking ships men going to execution men already maimed and awaiting the final stroke but for the most part these were merely references to books and periodicals in exactly the same way he argued we exaggerate the range of pain as if it were limitless we think if we are unthinking that it passes into agony and so beyond endurance to destruction it probably does nothing of the kind benham compared pain to the death range of the electric current at a certain voltage it thrills at a greater it torments and convulses at a still greater it kills but at enormous voltages as tesla was the first to demonstrate it does no injury and following on this came memoranda on the recorded behaviour of martyrs on the selftorture of hindoo ascetics of the defiance of red indian prisoners  these things benham had written are much more horrible when one considers them from the point of view of an easychairwhite gave an assenting nodare they really horrible at all is it possible that these charred and slashed and splintered persons those indians hanging from hooks those walkers in the fiery furnace have had glimpses through great windows that were worth the price they paid for them havent we allowed those checks and barriers that are so important a restraint upon childish enterprise to creep up into and distress and distort adult life  the modern world thinks too much as though painlessness and freedom from danger were ultimate ends it is fearhaunted it is troubled by the thoughts of pain and death which it has never met except as wellguarded children meet these things in exaggerated and untestable forms in the menagerie or in nightmares and so it thinks the discovery of anaesthetics the crowning triumph of civilization and cosiness and innocent amusement those ideals of the nursery the whole purpose of mankind  mm said white and pressed his lips together and knotted his brows and shook his head    10   but the bulk of benhams discussion of fear was not concerned with this perverse and overstrained suggestion of pleasure reached through torture this exaggeration of the man resolved not to shrink at anything it was an examination of the present range and use of fear that led gradually to something like a theory of control and discipline the second of his two dominating ideas was that fear is an instinct arising only in isolation that in a crowd there may be a collective panic but that there is no real individual fear fear benham held drives the man back to the crowd the dog to its master the wolf to the pack and when it is felt that the danger is pooled then fear leaves us he was quite prepared to meet the objection that animals of a solitary habit do nevertheless exhibit fear some of this apparent fear he argued was merely discretion and what is not discretion is the survival of an infantile characteristic the fear felt by a tiger cub is certainly a social emotion that drives it back to the other cubs to its mother and the dark hiding of the lair the fear of a fully grown tiger sends it into the reeds and the shadows to a refuge that must be still reminiscent of the maternal lair but fear has very little hold upon the adult solitary animal it changes with extreme readiness to resentment and rage  like most inexperienced people ran his notes i was astonished at the reported feats of men in war i believed they were exaggerated and that there was a kind of unpremeditated conspiracy of silence about their real behaviour but when on my way to visit india for the third time i turned off to see what i could of the fighting before adrianople i discovered at once that a thousand casually selected conscripts will every one of them do things together that not one of them could by any means be induced to do alone i saw men not merely obey orders that gave them the nearly certain prospect of death but i saw them exceeding orders i saw men leap out of cover for the mere sake of defiance and fall shot through and smashed by a score of bullets i saw a number of bulgarians in the hands of the surgeon several quite frightfully wounded refuse chloroform merely to impress the english onlooker some of their injuries i could scarcely endure to see and i watched a line of infantry men go on up a hill and keep on quite manifestly cheerful with men dropping out and wriggling and men dropping out and lying still until every other man was down not one man would have gone up that hill alone without onlookers  rowe the lion hunter told benham that only on one occasion in his life had he given way to ungovernable fear and that was when he was alone many times he had been in fearful situations in the face of charging lions and elephants and once he had been bowled over and carried some distance by a lion but on none of these occasions had fear demoralized him there was no question of his general pluck but on one occasion he was lost in rocky waterless country in somaliland he strayed out in the early morning while his camels were being loaded followed some antelope too far and lost his bearings he looked up expecting to see the sun on his right hand and found it on his left he became bewildered he wandered some time and then fired three signal shots and got no reply then losing his head he began shouting he had only four or five more cartridges and no waterbottle his men were accustomed to his going on alone and might not begin to remark upon his absence until sundown it chanced however that one of the shikari noted the waterbottle he had left behind and organized a hunt for him  long before they found him he had passed to an extremity of terror the world had become hideous and threatening the sun was a pitiless glare each rocky ridge he clambered became more dreadful than the last each new valley into which he looked more hateful and desolate the cramped thorn bushes threatened him gauntly the rocks had a sinister lustre and in every blue shadow about him the night and death lurked and waited there was no hurry for them presently they would spread out again and join and submerge him presently in the confederated darkness he could be stalked and seized and slain yes this he admitted was real fear he had cracked his voice yelling as a child yells and then he had become afraid of his own voice  now this excess of fear in isolation this comfort in a crowd in support and in a refuge even when support or refuge is quite illusory is just exactly what one would expect of fear if one believed it to be an instinct which has become a misfit in the ease of the soldier fear is so much a misfit that instead of saving him for the most part it destroys him raw soldiers under fire bunch together and armies fight in masses men are mowed down in swathes because only so is the courage of the common men sustained only so can they be brave albeit spread out and handling their weapons as men of unqualified daring would handle them they would be infinitely safer and more effective  and all of us it may be are restrained by this misfit fear from a thousand bold successful gestures of mind and body we are held back from the attainment of mighty securities in pitiful temporary shelters that are perhaps in the end no better than traps  from such considerations benham went on to speculate how far the crowd can be replaced in a mans imagination how far some substitute for that social backing can be made to serve the same purpose in neutralizing fear he wrote with the calm of a man who weighs the probabilities of a riddle and with the zeal of a man lost to every material consideration his writing it seemed to white had something of the enthusiastic whiteness of his face the enthusiastic brightness of his eyes we can no more banish fear from our being at present than we can carve out the fleshy pillars of the heart or the pineal gland in the brain it is deep in our inheritance as deep as hunger and just as we have to satisfy hunger in order that it should leave us free so we have to satisfy the unconquerable importunity of fear we have to reassure our faltering instincts there must be something to take the place of lair and familiars something not ourselves but general that we must carry with us into the lonely places for it is true that man has now not only to learn to fight in open order instead of in a phalanx but he has to think and plan and act in open order to live in open order  then with one of his abrupt transitions benham had written this brings me to god  the devil it does said white roused to a keener attention  by no feat of intention can we achieve courage in loneliness so long as we feel indeed alone an isolated man an egoist an epicurean man will always fail himself in the solitary place there must be something more with us to sustain us against this vast universe than the spark of life that began yesterday and must be extinguished tomorrow there can be no courage beyond social courage the sustaining confidence of the herd until there is in us the sense of god but god is a word that covers a multitude of meanings when i was a boy i was a passionate atheist i defied god and so far as god is the mere sanction of social traditions and pressures a mere dressing up of the crowds will in canonicals i do still deny him and repudiate him that god i heard of first from my nursemaid and in very truth he is the proper god of all the nursemaids of mankind but there is another god than that god of obedience god the immortal adventurer in me god who calls men from home and country god scourged and crowned with thorns who rose in a nailpierced body out of death and came not to bring peace but a sword  with something bordering upon intellectual consternation white who was a decent selfrespecting sceptic read these last clamberings of benhams spirit they were written in pencil they were unfinished when he died  surely the man was not a christian  you may be heedless of death and suffering because you think you cannot suffer and die or you may be heedless of death and pain because you have identified your life with the honour of mankind and the insatiable adventurousness of mans imagination so that the possible death is negligible and the possible achievement altogether outweighs it  white shook his head over these pencilled fragments  he was a member of the rationalist press association and he had always taken it for granted that benham was an orthodox unbeliever but this was hopelessly unsound heresy perilous stuff almost it seemed to him a posthumous betrayal    11   one night when he was in india the spirit of adventure came upon benham he had gone with kepple of the forestry department into the jungle country in the hills above the tapti he had been very anxious to see something of that aspect of indian life and he had snatched at the chance kepple had given him but they had scarcely started before the expedition was brought to an end by an accident kepple was thrown by a pony and his ankle broken he and benham bandaged it as well as they could and a litter was sent for and meanwhile they had to wait in the camp that was to have been the centre of their jungle raids the second day of this waiting was worse for kepple than the first and he suffered much from the pressure of this amateurish bandaging in the evening benham got cool water from the well and rearranged things better the two men dined and smoked under their thatched roof beneath the big banyan and then kepple tired out by his day of pain was carried to his tent presently he fell asleep and benham was left to himself  now that the heat was over he found himself quite indisposed to sleep he felt full of life and anxious for happenings  he went back and sat down upon the iron bedstead beneath the banyan that kepple had lain upon through the day and he watched the soft immensity of the indian night swallow up the last lingering colours of the world it left the outlines it obliterated nothing but it stripped off the superficial reality of things the moon was full and high overhead and the light had not so much gone as changed from definition and the blazing glitter and reflections of solidity to a translucent and unsubstantial clearness the jungle that bordered the little encampment north south and west seemed to have crept a little nearer enriched itself with blackness taken to itself voices  surely it had been silent during the day  a warm faintlyscented breeze just stirred the dead grass and the leaves in the day the air had been still  immediately after the sunset there had been a great crying of peacocks in the distance but that was over now the crickets however were still noisy and a persistent sound had become predominant an industrious unmistakable sound a sound that took his mind back to england in midsummer it was like a watchmans rattlea nightjar  so there were nightjars here in india too one might have expected something less familiar and then came another cry from far away over the heatstripped treetops a less familiar cry it was repeated was that perhaps some craving leopard a tiger cat a panther  hunt hunt that might be a deer  then suddenly an angry chattering came from the dark trees quite close at hand a monkey  these great scarce visible sweeping movements through the air were bats  of course the day jungle is the jungle asleep this was its waking hour now the deer were arising from their forms the bears creeping out of their dens amidst the rocks and blundering down the gullies the tigers and panthers and jungle cats stalking noiselessly from their lairs in the grass countless creatures that had hidden from the heat and pitiless exposure of the day stood now awake and alertly intent upon their purposes grazed or sought water flitting delicately through the moonlight and shadows the jungle was awakening again benham heard that sound like the belling of a stag  this was the real life of the jungle this night life into which man did not go here he was on the verge of a world that for all the stuffed trophies of the sportsman and the specimens of the naturalist is still almost as unknown as if it was upon another planet what intruders men are what foreigners in the life of this ancient system  he looked over his shoulder and there were the two little tents one that sheltered kepple and one that awaited him and beyond in an irregular line glowed the ruddy smoky fires of the men one or two turbaned figures still flitted about and there was a voicelow monotonousit must have been telling a tale further sighing and stirring ever and again were tethered beasts and then a great pale space of moonlight and the clumsy outlines of the village well the clustering village itself slept in darkness beyond the mango trees and still remoter the black encircling jungle closed in one might have fancied this was the encampment of newlycome invaders were it not for the larger villages that are overgrown with thickets and altogether swallowed up again in the wilderness and for the deserted temples that are found rent asunder by the roots of trees and the ancient embankments that hold water only for the drinking of the sambur deer  benham turned his face to the dim jungle again  he had come far out of his way to visit this strange world of the ancient life that now recedes and dwindles before our new civilization that seems fated to shrivel up and pass altogether before the dry advance of physical science and material organization he was full of unsatisfied curiosities about its fierce hungers and passions its fears and cruelties its instincts and its wellnigh incommunicable and yet most precious understandings he had long ceased to believe that the wild beast is wholly evil and safety and plenty the ultimate good for men  perhaps he would never get nearer to this mysterious jungle life than he was now  it was intolerably tantalizing that it should be so close at hand and so inaccessible  as benham sat brooding over his disappointment the moon swimming on through the still circle of the hours passed slowly over him the lights and shadows about him changed by imperceptible gradations and a long pale alley where the native cart track drove into the forest opened slowly out of the darkness slowly broadened slowly lengthened it opened out to him with a quality of invitation  there was the jungle before him was it after all so inaccessible  come the road said to him  benham rose and walked out a few paces into the moonlight and stood motionless  was he afraid  even now some hungry watchful monster might lurk in yonder shadows watching with infinite still patience kepple had told him how they would sit still for hoursstaring unblinkingly as cats stare at a fireand then crouch to advance beneath the shrill overtone of the nightjars what noiseless grey shapes what deep breathings and cracklings and creepings might there not be  was he afraid  that question determined him to go  he hesitated whether he should take a gun a stick a gun he knew was a dangerous thing to an inexperienced man no he would go now even as he was with empty hands at least he would go as far as the end of that band of moonlight if for no other reason than because he was afraid now  for a moment it seemed to him as though his feet were too heavy to lift and then hands in pockets khakiclad an almost invisible figure he strolled towards the carttrack  come to that he halted for a moment to regard the distant fires of the men no one would miss him they would think he was in his tent he faced the stirring quiet ahead the carttrack was a rutted path of soft warm sand on which he went almost noiselessly a bird squabbled for an instant in a thicket a great white owl floated like a flake of moonlight across the track and vanished without a sound among the trees  along the moonlit path went benham and when he passed near trees his footsteps became noisy with the rustle and crash of dead leaves the jungle was full of moonlight twigs branches creepers grassclumps came out acutely vivid the trees and bushes stood in pools of darkness and beyond were pale stretches of misty moonshine and big rocks shining with an unearthly lustre things seemed to be clear and yet uncertain it was as if they dissolved or retired a little and then returned to solidity  a sudden chattering broke out overhead and black across the great stars soared a flying squirrel and caught a twig and ran for shelter a second hesitated in a treetop and pursued they chased each other and vanished abruptly he forgot his sense of insecurity in the interest of these active little silhouettes and he noted how much bigger and more wonderful the stars can look when one sees them through interlacing branches  ahead was darkness but not so dark when he came to it that the track was invisible he was at the limit of his intention but now he saw that that had been a childish project he would go on he would walk right into the jungle his first disinclination was conquered and the soft intoxication of the subtropical moonshine was in his blood but he wished he could walk as a spirit walks without this noise of leaves  yes this was very wonderful and beautiful and there must always be jungles for men to walk in always there must be jungles  some small beast snarled and bolted from under his feet he stopped sharply he had come into a darkness under great boughs and now he stood still as the little creature scuttled away beyond the track emerged into a dazzling whiteness  in the stillness he could hear the deer belling again in the distance and then came a fuss of monkeys in a group of trees near at hand he remained still until this had died away into mutterings  then on the verge of movement he was startled by a ripe mango that slipped from its stalk and fell out of the tree and struck his hand it took a little time to understand that and then he laughed and his muscles relaxed and he went on again  a thorn caught at him and he disentangled himself  he crossed the open space and the moon was like a great shield of light spread out above him all the world seemed swimming in its radiance the stars were like lamps in a mist of silvery blue  the track led him on across white open spaces of shrivelled grass and sand amidst trees where shadows made black patternings upon the silver and then it plunged into obscurities for a time it lifted and then on one hand the bush fell away and he saw across a vast moonlit valley wide undulations of open cultivation belts of jungle copses and a great lake as black as ebony for a time the path ran thus open and then the jungle closed in again and there were more thickets more levels of grass and in one place far overhead among the branches he heard and stood for a time perplexed at a vast deep humming of bees  presently a black monster with a hunched back went across his path heedless of him and making a great noise in the leaves he stood quite still until it had gone he could not tell whether it was a boar or hyaena most probably he thought a boar because of the heaviness of its rush  the path dropped downhill for a time crossed a ravine ascended he passed a great leafless tree on which there were white flowers on the ground also in the darkness under the tree there were these flowers they were dropping noiselessly and since they were visible in the shadows it seemed to him that they must be phosphorescent and they emitted a sweetish scent that lay heavily athwart the path presently he passed another such tree then he became aware of a tumult ahead of him a smashing of leaves a snorting and slobbering grunting and sucking a whole series of bestial sounds he halted for a little while and then drew nearer picking his steps to avoid too great a noise here were more of those whiteblossomed trees and beneath in the darkness something very black and big was going to and fro eating greedily then he found that there were two and then more of these black things three or four of them  curiosity made benham draw nearer very softly  presently one showed in a patch of moonlight startlingly big a huge black hairy monster with a long white nose on a grotesque face and he was stuffing armfuls of white blossom into his mouth with his curved fore claws he took not the slightest notice of the still man who stood perhaps twenty yards away from him he was too blind and careless he snorted and smacked his slobbering lips and plunged into the shadows again benham heard him root among the leaves and grunt appreciatively the air was heavy with the reek of the crushed flowers  for some time benham remained listening to and peering at these preoccupied gluttons at last he shrugged his shoulders and left them and went on his way for a long time he could hear them then just as he was on the verge of forgetting them altogether some dispute arose among them and there began a vast uproar squeals protests comments one voice ridiculously replete and authoritative ridiculously suggestive of a drunken judge with his mouth full and a shrill voice of grievance high above the others  the uproar of the bears died away at last almost abruptly and left the jungle to the incessant nightjars  for what end was this life of the jungle  all benhams senses were alert to the sounds and appearances about him and at the same time his mind was busy with the perplexities of that riddle was the jungle just an aimless pool of life that man must drain and clear away or is it to have a use in the greater life of our race that now begins will man value the jungle as he values the precipice for the sake of his manhood will he preserve it  man must keep hard man must also keep fierce will the jungle keep him fierce  for life thought benham there must be insecurity  he had missed the track  he was now in a second ravine he was going downward walking on silvery sand amidst great boulders and now there was a new sound in the air it was the croaking of frogs ahead was a solitary gleam he was approaching a jungle pool  suddenly the stillness was alive in a panic uproar honk cried a great voice and honk there was a clatter of hoofs a wild rusha rush as it seemed towards him was he being charged he backed against a rock a great pale shape leaped by him an antlered shape it was a herd of big deer bolting suddenly out of the stillness he heard the swish and smash of their retreat grow distant disperse he remained standing with his back to the rock  slowly the strophe and antistrophe of frogs and goatsuckers resumed possession of his consciousness but now some primitive instinct perhaps or some subconscious intimation of danger made him meticulously noiseless  he went on down a winding sounddeadening path of sand towards the drinkingplace he came to a wide white place that was almost level and beyond it under clustering palestemmed trees shone the mirror surface of some ancient tank and sharp and black a doglike beast sat on its tail in the midst of this space started convulsively and went slinking into the undergrowth benham paused for a moment and then walked out softly into the light and behold as if it were to meet him came a monster a vast dark shape drawing itself lengthily out of the blackness and stopped with a start as if it had been instantly changed to stone  it had stopped with one paw advanced its striped mask was light and dark grey in the moonlight grey but faintly tinged with ruddiness its mouth was a little open its fangs and a pendant of viscous saliva shone vivid its great roundpupilled eyes regarded him stedfastly at last the nightmare of benhams childhood had come true and he was face to face with a tiger uncaged uncontrolled  for some moments neither moved neither the beast nor the man they stood face to face each perhaps with an equal astonishment motionless and soundless in that mad indian moonlight that makes all things like a dream  benham stood quite motionless and body and mind had halted together that confrontation had an interminableness that had nothing to do with the actual passage of time then some trickle of his previous thoughts stirred in the frozen quiet of his mind  he spoke hoarsely i am man he said and lifted a hand as he spoke the thought of the world  his heart leapt within him as the tiger moved but the great beast went sideways gardant only that its head was low three noiseless instantaneous strides it made and stood again watching him  man he said in a voice that had no sound and took a step forward  wough with two bounds the monster had become a great grey streak that crackled and rustled in the shadows of the trees and then it had vanished become invisible and inaudible with a kind of instantaneousness  for some seconds or some minutes benham stood rigid fearlessly expectant and then far away up the ravine he heard the deer repeat their cry of alarm and understood with a new wisdom that the tiger had passed among them and was gone  he walked on towards the deserted tank and now he was talking aloud  i understand the jungle i understand if a few men die here what matter there are worse deaths than being killed  what is this fools trap of security  every time in my life that i have fled from security i have fled from death  let men stew in their cities if they will it is in the lonely places in jungles and mountains in snows and fires in the still observatories and the silent laboratories in those secret and dangerous places where life probes into life it is there that the masters of the world the lords of the beast the rebel sons of fate come to their own  you sleeping away there in the cities do you know what it means for you that i am here tonight  do you know what it means to you  i am just onejust the precursor  presently if you will not budge those hot cities must be burnt about you you must come out of them  he wandered now uttering his thoughts as they came to him and he saw no more living creatures because they fled and hid before the sound of his voice he wandered until the moon larger now and yellow tinged was low between the black bars of the tree stems and then it sank very suddenly behind a hilly spur and the light failed swiftly  he stumbled and went with difficulty he could go no further among these rocks and ravines and he sat down at the foot of a tree to wait for day  he sat very still indeed  a great stillness came over the world a velvet silence that wrapped about him as the velvet shadows wrapped about him the corncrakes had ceased all the sounds and stir of animal life had died away the breeze had fallen a drowsing comfort took possession of him he grew more placid and more placid still he was enormously content to find that fear had fled before him and was gone he drifted into that state of mind when one thinks without ideas when ones mind is like a starless sky serene and empty    12   some hours later benham found that the trees and rocks were growing visible again and he saw a very bright star that he knew must be lucifer rising amidst the black branches he was sitting upon a rock at the foot of a slenderstemmed leafless tree he had been asleep and it was daybreak everything was coldly clear and colourless  he must have slept soundly  he heard a cock crow and another answerjungle fowl these must be because there could be no village within earshotand then far away and bringing back memories of terraced houses and ripe walled gardens was the scream of peacocks and some invisible bird was making a hollow beating sound among the trees near at hand tunk tunk and out of the dry grass came a twittering  there was a green light in the east that grew stronger and the stars after their magnitudes were dissolving in the blue only a few remained faintly visible the sound of birds increased through the trees he saw towering up a great mauve thing like the back of a monsterbut that was nonsense it was the crest of a steep hillside covered with woods of teak  he stood up and stretched himself and wondered whether he had dreamed of a tiger  he tried to remember and retrace the course of his overnight wanderings  a flight of emerald parakeets tore screaming through the trees and then far away uphill he heard the creaking of a cart  he followed the hint of a footmark and went back up the glen slowly and thoughtfully  presently he came to a familiar place a group of trees a sheet of water and the ruins of an old embankment it was the ancient tank of his overnight encounter the pool of his dream  with doubt still in his mind he walked round its margin to the sandy level beyond and cast about and sought intently and at last found and then found clearly imposed upon the tracks of several sorts of deer and the footprints of many biggish birds first the great spoor of the tiger and then his own here the beast had halted and here it had leapt aside here his own footmarks stopped here his heels had come together  it had been no dream  there was a white mist upon the water of the old tank like the bloom upon a plum and the trees about it seemed smaller and the sandspace wider and rougher than they had seemed in the moonshine then the ground had looked like a floor of frosted silver  and thence he went on upward through the fresh morning until just as the east grew red with sunrise he reached the carttrack from which he had strayed overnight it was he found a longer way back to the camp than he remembered it to be perhaps he had struck the path further along it curved about and went up and down and crossed three ravines at last he came to that trampled place of littered white blossom under great trees where he had seen the bears  the sunlight went before him in a sheaf of golden spears and his shadow that was at first limitless crept towards his feet the dew had gone from the dead grass and the sand was hot to his dry boots before he came back into the open space about the great banyan and the tents and kepple refreshed by a nights rest and coffee was wondering loudly where the devil he had gone      the story     chapter the first  the boy grows up    1   benham was the son of a schoolmaster his father was assistant first at cheltenham and subsequently at minchinghampton and then he became head and later on sole proprietor of martindale house a highclass preparatory school at seagate he was extremely successful for some years as success goes in the scholastic profession and then disaster overtook him in the shape of a divorce his wife william porphyrys mother made the acquaintance of a rich young man named nolan who was recuperating at seagate from the sequelae of snakebite malaria and a gun accident in brazil she ran away with him and she was divorced she was however unable to marry him because he died at wiesbaden only three days after the reverend harold benham obtained his decree absolute instead therefore being a woman of great spirit enterprise and sweetness she married godfrey marayne afterwards sir godfrey marayne the great london surgeon  nolan was a dark rather melancholy and sentimental young man and he left about a third of his very large fortune entirely to mrs benham and the rest to her in trust for her son whom he deemed himself to have injured with this and a husband already distinguished she returned presently to london and was on the whole fairly well received there  it was upon the reverend gentleman at seagate that the brunt of this divorce fell there is perhaps a certain injustice in the fact that a schoolmaster who has lost his wife should also lose the more valuable proportion of his pupils but the tone of thought in england is against any association of a schoolmaster with matrimonial irregularity and also mr benham remarried it would certainly have been better for him if he could have produced a sister his school declined and his efforts to resuscitate it only hastened its decay conceiving that he could now only appeal to the broaderminded more progressive type of parent he became an educational reformer and wrote upon modernizing the curriculum with increasing frequency to the times he expended a considerable fraction of his dwindling capital upon a science laboratory and a fives court he added a london bachelor of science with a teaching diploma to the school staff and a library of about a thousand volumes including the hundred best books as selected by the late lord avebury to the school equipment none of these things did anything but enhance the suspicion of laxity his wifes escapade had created in the limited opulent and discreet class to which his establishment appealed one boy who under the influence of the hundred best books had quoted the zendavesta to an irascible but influential grandfather was withdrawn without notice or compensation in the middle of the term it intensifies the tragedy of the reverend harold benhams failure that in no essential respect did his school depart from the pattern of all other properlyconducted preparatory schools  in appearance he was near the average of scholastic english gentlemen he displayed a manifest handsomeness somewhat weakened by disregard and disuse a large moustache and a narrow high forehead his rather tired brown eyes were magnified by glasses he was an active man in unimportant things with a love for the phrase shipshape and he played cricket better than any one else on the staff he walked in wide strides and would sometimes use the tail of his gown on the blackboard like so many clergymen and schoolmasters he had early distrusted his natural impulse in conversation and had adopted the defensive precaution of a rather formal and sonorous speech which habit had made a part of him his general effect was of one who is earnestly keeping up things that might otherwise give way keeping them up by act and voice keeping up an atmosphere of vigour and success in a school that was only too manifestly attenuated keeping up a pretentious economy of administration in a school that must not be too manifestly impoverished keeping up a claim to be in the scientific van and rather a flutterer of dovecotswith its method of manual training for examplekeeping up esprit de corps and the manliness of himself and every one about him keeping up his affection for his faithful second wife and his complete forgetfulness of and indifference to that spirit of distracting impulse and insubordination away there in london who had once been his delight and insurmountable difficulty after my visits to her wrote benham he would show by a hundred little expressions and poses and acts how intensely he wasnt noting that anything of the sort had occurred  but one thing that from the outset the father seemed to have failed to keep up thoroughly was his intention to mould and dominate his son  the advent of his boy had been a tremendous event in the reverend gentlemans life it is not improbable that his disposition to monopolize the pride of this event contributed to the ultimate disruption of his family it left so few initiatives within the home to his wife he had been an early victim to that wave of philoprogenitive and educational enthusiasm which distinguished the closing decade of the nineteenth century he was full of plans in those days for the education of his boy and the thought of the youngster played a large part in the series of complicated emotional crises with which he celebrated the departure of his wife crises in which a number of old school and college friends very generously assistedspending weekends at seagate for this purpose and mingling tobacco impassioned handclasps and suchlike consolation with much patient sympathetic listening to his carefully balanced analysis of his feelings he declared that his son was now his one living purpose in life and he sketched out a scheme of moral and intellectual training that he subsequently embodied in five very stimulating and intimate articles for the school world but never put into more than partial operation  i have read my fathers articles upon this subject wrote benham and i am still perplexed to measure just what i owe to him did he ever attempt this moral training he contemplated so freely i dont think he did i know now i knew then that he had something in his mind there were one or two special walks we had together he invited me to accompany him with a certain portentousness and we would go out pregnantly making superficial remarks about the school cricket and return discussing botany with nothing said  his heart failed him  once or twice too he seemed to be reaching out at me from the school pulpit  i think that my father did manage to convey to me his belief that there were these fine things honour high aims nobilities if i did not get this belief from him then i do not know how i got it but it was as if he hinted at a treasure that had got very dusty in an attic a treasure which he hadnt himself been able to spend  the father who had intended to mould his son ended by watching him grow not always with sympathy or understanding he was an overworked man assailed by many futile anxieties one sees him striding about the establishment with his gown streaming out behind him urging on the groundsman or the gardener or dignified expounding the particular advantages of seagate to enquiring parents one sees him unnaturally cheerful and facetious at the midday dinner table one imagines him keeping up high aspirations in a rather too hastily scribbled sermon in the school pulpit or keeping up an enthusiasm for beautiful language in a badlyprepared lesson on virgil or expressing unreal indignation and unjustifiably exalted sentiments to evil doers and one realizes his disadvantage against the quiet youngster whose retentive memory was storing up all these impressions for an ultimate judgment and one understands too a certain relief that mingled with his undeniable emotion when at last the time came for young benham the one living purpose of his life to be off to minchinghampton and the next step in the mysterious ascent of the english educational system  three times at least and with an increased interval the father wrote fine fatherly letters that would have stood the test of publication then his communications became comparatively hurried and matteroffact his boys return home for the holidays was always rather a stirring time for his private feelings but he became more and more inexpressive he would sometimes lay a hand on those growing shoulders and then withdraw it they felt bracedup shoulders stiffly inflexible orthey would wince and when one has let the habit of indefinite feelings grow upon one what is there left to say if one did say anything one might be asked questions  one or two of the long vacations they spent abroad together the last of these occasions followed benhams convalescence at montana and his struggle with the bisse the two went to zermatt and did several peaks and crossed the theodule and it was clear that their joint expeditions were a strain upon both of them the father thought the son reckless unskilful and impatient the son found the fathers insistence upon guides ropes precautions the recognized way the highest point and back again before you get a chill and talk about it sagely but very very modestly over pipes tiresome he wanted to wander in deserts of ice and see over the mountains and discover what it is to be benighted on a precipice and gradually he was becoming familiar with his fathers repertory of greek quotations there was no breach between them but each knew that holiday was the last they would ever spend together  the court had given the custody of young william porphyry into his fathers hands but by a generous concession it was arranged that his mother should have him to see her for an hour or so five times a year the nolan legacy however coming upon the top of this introduced a peculiar complication that provided much work for tactful intermediaries and gave great and increasing scope for painful delicacies on the part of mr benham as the boy grew up  i see said the father over his study pipe and with his glasses fixed on remote distances above the head of the current sympathizer i see more and more clearly that the tale of my sacrifices is not yet at an end in many respects he is like her quick too quick he must choose but i know his choice yes yesim not blind shes worked upon him i have done what i could to bring out the manhood in him perhaps it will bear the strain it will be a wrench old mangod knows  he did his very best to make it a wrench    2   benhams mother whom he saw quarterly and also on the first of may because it was her birthday touched and coloured his imagination far more than his father did she was now lady marayne and a prominent successful and happy little lady her dereliction had been forgiven quite soon and whatever whisper of it remained was very completely forgotten during the brief period of moral kindliness which followed the accession of king edward the seventh it no doubt contributed to her social reinstatement that her former husband was entirely devoid of social importance while on the other hand sir godfrey maraynes temporary monopoly of the caecal operation which became so fashionable in the last decade of queen victorias reign as to be practically epidemic created a strong feeling in her favour  she was blueeyed and very delicately complexioned quickmoving witty given to little storms of clean enthusiasm she loved handsome things brave things successful things and the respect and affection of all the world she did quite what she liked upon impulse and nobody ever thought ill of her  her family were the mantons of blent quite good westcountry people she had broken away from them before she was twenty to marry benham whom she had idealized at a tennis party he had talked of his work and she had seen it in a flash the noblest work in the world him at his daily divine toil and herself a madonna surrounded by a troupe of blessed boysall of good family some of quite the best for a time she had kept it up even more than he had and then nolan had distracted her with a realization of the heroism that goes to the ends of the earth she became sick with desire for the forests of brazil and the pacific anda peak in darien immediately the school was frowsty beyond endurance and for the first time she let herself perceive how dreadfully a gentleman and a scholar can smell of pipes and tobacco only one course lay open to a woman of spirit  for a year she did indeed live like a woman of spirit and it was at nolans bedside that marayne was first moved to admiration she was plucky all men love a plucky woman  sir godfrey marayne smelt a good deal of antiseptic soap but he talked in a way that amused her and he trusted as well as adored her she did what she liked with his money her own money and her sons trust money and she did very well from the earliest benhams visits were to a gracious presence amidst wealthy surroundings the transit from the moral blamelessness of seagate had an entirely misleading effect of ascent  their earlier encounters became rather misty in his memory they occurred at various hotels in seagate afterwards he would go first taken by a governess and later going alone to charing cross where he would be met in earlier times by a maid and afterwards by a deferential manservant who called him sir and conveyed sometimes in a hansom cab and later in a smart brougham by trafalgar square lower regent street piccadilly and streets of increasing wealth and sublimity to sir godfreys house in desborough street very naturally he fell into thinking of these discreet and wellgoverned west end streets as a part of his mothers atmosphere  the house had a dignified portico and always before he had got down to the pavement the door opened agreeably and a second respectful manservant stood ready then came the large hall with its noiseless carpets and great chinese jars its lacquered cabinets and the wide staircase and floating down the wide staircase impatient to greet him light and shining as a flower petal sweet and welcoming radiating a joyfulness as cool and clear as a dewy morning came his mother well little man my son she would cry in her happy singing voice well  so he thought she must always be but indeed these meetings meant very much to her she dressed for them and staged them she perceived the bright advantages of her rarity and she was quite determined to have her son when the time came to possess him she kissed him but not oppressively she caressed him cleverly it was only on these rare occasions that he was ever kissed or caressed and she talked to his shy boyishness until it felt a more spirited variety of manhood what have you been doing she asked since i saw you last  she never said he had grown but she told him he looked tall and though the tea was a marvellous display it was never an obtrusive tea it wasnt poked at a fellow a various plenty flowed well within reach of ones arm like an agreeable accompaniment to their conversation  what have you done all sorts of brave things do you swim now i can swim oh i can swim half a mile some day we will swim races together why not and you ride  the horse boltedand you stuck on did you squeak i stick on but i have to squeak but youof course no you mustnt im just a little woman and i ride big horses  and for the end she had invented a characteristic little ceremony  she would stand up in front of him and put her hands on his shoulders and look into his face  clean eyes she would say still  then she would take his ears in her little firm hands and kiss very methodically his eyes and his forehead and his cheeks and at last his lips her own eyes would suddenly brim bright with tears  go she would say  that was the end  it seemed to benham as though he was being let down out of a sunlit fairyland to this grey world again    3   the contrast between lady maraynes pretty amenities and the good woman at seagate who urged herself almost hourly to forget that william porphyry was not her own son was entirely unfair the second mrs benhams conscientious spirit and a certain handsome ability about her fitted her far more than her predecessor for the onerous duties of a schoolmasters wife but whatever natural buoyancy she possessed was outweighed by an irrepressible conviction derived from an episcopal grandparent that the remarriage of divorced persons is sinful and by a secret but wellfounded doubt whether her husband loved her with a truly romantic passion she might perhaps have borne either of these troubles singly but the two crushed her spirit  her temperament was not one that goes out to meet happiness she had reluctant affections and suspected rather than welcomed the facility of other peoples her susceptibility to disagreeable impressions was however very ample and life was fenced about with protections for her feelings it filled young benham with inexpressible indignations that his sweet own mother so gay so brightly cheerful that even her tears were stars was never to be mentioned in his stepmothers presence and it was not until he had fully come to years of reflection that he began to realize with what honesty kindness and patience this naturally not very happy lady had nursed protected mended for and generally mothered him    4   as benham grew to look manly and bear himself with pride his mothers affection for him blossomed into a passion she made him come down to london from cambridge as often as she could she went about with him she made him squire her to theatres and take her out to dinners and sup with her at the carlton and in the summer she had him with her at chexington manor the hertfordshire house sir godfrey had given her and always when they parted she looked into his eyes to see if they were still cleanwhatever she meant by thatand she kissed his forehead and cheeks and eyes and lips she began to make schemes for his career she contrived introductions she judged would be useful to him later  everybody found the relationship charming some of the more conscientious people it is true pretended to think that the reverend harold benham was a first husband and long since dead but that was all as a matter of fact in his increasingly futile way he wasnt either at seagate or in the educational supplement of the times but even the most conscientious of us are not obliged to go to seagate or read the educational supplement of the times  lady maraynes plans for her sons future varied very pleasantly she was an industrious reader of biographies and more particularly of the large fair biographies of the recently contemporary they mentioned people she knew they recalled scenes each sowed its imaginative crop upon her mind a crop that flourished and flowered until a newer growth came to oust it she saw her son a diplomat a prancing proconsul an empire builder a trusted friend of the august the bold leader of new movements the saviour of ancient institutions the youngest brightest modernest of prime ministersor a tremendously popular poet as a rule she saw him unmarriedwith a wonderful little mother at his elbow sometimes in romantic flashes he was adored by german princesses or eloped with russian grandduchesses but such fancies were hors doeuvre the modern biography deals with the career every project was bright every project had gotremendous go and they all demanded a hero debonnaire and balanced and benham as she began to perceive wasnt balanced something of his father had crept into him a touch of moral stiffness she knew the flavour of that so well it was a stumbling an elaboration a spoilsport and weakness she tried not to admit to herself that even in the faintest degree it was there but it was there  tell me all that you are doing now she said to him one afternoon when she had got him to herself during his first visit to chexington manor how do you like cambridge are you making friends have you joined that thingthe union is itand delivered your maiden speech if youre for politics poff thats your game have you begun it  she lay among splashes of sunshine on the red cushions in the punt a little curledup figure of white with her sweet pale animated face warmed by the reflection of her red sunshade and her eyes like little friendly heavens and he lean and unconsciously graceful sat at her feet and admired her beyond measure and rejoiced that now at last they were going to be ever so much together and doubted if it would be possible ever to love any other woman so much as he did her  he tried to tell her of cambridge and his friends and the undergraduate life he was leading but he found it difficult all sorts of things that seemed right and good at trinity seemed out of drawing in the peculiar atmosphere she created about her all sorts of clumsiness and youthfulness in himself and his associates he felt she wouldnt accept couldnt accept that it would be wrong of her to accept before they could come before her they must wear a bravery he couldnt for instance tell her how billy prothero renouncing vanity and all social pretension had worn a straw hat into november and the last stages of decay and how it had been burnt by a special commission ceremonially in the great court he couldnt convey to her the long sessions of beer and tobacco and high thinking that went on in protheros rooms into the small hours a certain gothic greyness and flatness and muddiness through which the cambridge spirit struggles to its destiny he concealed from her what remained to tell wasattenuated he could not romance so she tried to fill in his jejune outlines she tried to inspire a son who seemed most unaccountably up to nothing  you must make good friends she said isnt young lord breeze at your college his mother the other day told me he was and sir freddy quentons boy and there are both the young baptons at cambridge  he knew one of the baptons  poff she said suddenly has it ever occurred to you what you are going to do afterwards do you know you are going to be quite well off  benham looked up with a faint embarrassment my father said something he was rather vague it wasnt his affairthat kind of thing  you will be quite well off she repeated without any complicating particulars you will be so well off that it will be possible for you to do anything almost that you like in the world nothing will tie you nothing  buthow well off  you will have several thousands a year  thousands  yes why not  butmother this is rather astounding does this mean there are estates somewhere responsibilities  it is just money investments  you know ive imagined ive thought always i should have to do something  you must do something poff but it neednt be for a living the world is yours without that and so you see youve got to make plans youve got to know the sort of people wholl have things in their hands youve got to keep out ofholes and corners youve got to think of parliament and abroad theres the army theres diplomacy theres the empire you can be a cecil rhodes if you like you can be a winston    5   perhaps it was only the innate eagerness of lady marayne which made her feel disappointed in her sons outlook upon life he did not choose among his glittering possibilities he did not say what he was going to be proconsul ambassador statesman for days and he talked vaguely of wanting to do something fine but all in a fog a boy of nearly nineteen ought to have at least the beginnings of savoir faire  was he in the right set was he indeed in the right college trinity by his account seemed a huge featureless placeand might he not conceivably be lost in it in those big crowds one had to insist upon oneself poff never insisted upon himselfexcept quite at the wrong moment and there was this billy prothero billy like a goat or something people called william dont get their christian name insisted upon unless they are vulnerable somewhere any form of william stamps a weakness willie willy will billy bill its a fearful handle for ones friends at any rate poff had escaped that but this prothero  but who is this billy prothero she asked one evening in the walled garden  he was at minchinghampton  but who is he who is his father where does he come from  benham sought in his mind for a space i dont know he said at last billy had always been rather reticent about his people she demanded descriptions she demanded an account of billys furniture billys clothes billys form of exercise it dawned upon benham that for some inexplicable reason she was hostile to billy it was like the unmasking of an ambuscade he had talked a lot about protheros ideas and the discussions of social reform and social service that went on in his rooms for billy read at unknown times and was open at all hours to any argumentative caller to lady marayne all ideas were obnoxious a form of fogging all ideas she held were queer ideas and does he call himself a socialist she asked i thought he would  poff she cried suddenly youre not a socialist  such a vague term  but these friends of yoursthey seem to be all socialists red ties and everything complete  they have ideas he evaded he tried to express it better they give one something to take hold of  she sat up stiffly on the gardenseat she lifted her finger at him very seriously i hope she said with all her heart that you will have nothing to do with such ideas nothing socialism  they make a case  pooh any one can make a case  but  theres no sense in them what is the good of talking about upsetting everything just disorder how can one do anything then you mustnt you mustnt no its nonsense little poff its absurd and you may spoil so much i hate the way you talk of it as if it wasnt allabsolutelyrubbish  she was earnest almost to the intonation of tears  why couldnt her son go straight for his ends clear tangible ends as she had always done this thinking about everything she had never thought about anything in all her life for more than half an hourand it had always turned out remarkably well  benham felt baffled there was a pause how on earth could he go on telling her his ideas if this was how they were to be taken  i wish sometimes his mother said abruptly with an unusually sharp note in her voice that you wouldnt look quite so like your father  but im not like my father said benham puzzled  no she insisted and with an air of appealing to his soberer reason so why should you go looking like him that concerned expression  she jumped to her feet poff she said i want to go and see the evening primroses pop you and i are talking nonsense they dont have ideas anyhow they just popas god meant them to do what stupid things we human beings are  her philosophical moments were perhaps the most baffling of all    6   billy prothero became the symbol in the mind of lady marayne for all that disappointed her in benham he had to become the symbol because she could not think of complicated or abstract things she had to make things personal and he was the only personality available she fretted over his existence for some days therefore once she awakened and thought about him in the night and then suddenly she determined to grasp her nettle she decided to seize and obliterate this prothero he must come to chexington and be thoroughly and conclusively led on examined ransacked shown up and disposed of for ever at once she was not quite clear how she meant to do this but she was quite resolved that it had to be done anything is better than inaction  there was a little difficulty about dates and engagements but he came and through the season of expectation benham who was now for the first time in contact with the feminine nature was delighted at the apparent change to cordiality so that he talked of billy to his mother much more than he had ever done before  billy had been his particular friend at minchinghampton at least during the closing two years of his school life billy had fallen into friendship with benham as some of us fall in love quite suddenly when he saw benham get down from the fence and be sick after his encounter with the bull already billy was excited by admiration but it was the incongruity of the sickness conquered him he went back to the school with his hands more than usually in his pockets and no eyes for anything but this remarkable strungup fellowcreature he felt he had never observed benham before and he was astonished that he had not done so  billy prothero was a sturdy sort of boy generously wanting in good looks his hair was rough and his complexion muddy and he walked about with his hands in his pockets long flexible lips protruded in a whistle and a rather shapeless nose well up to show he didnt care providence had sought to console him by giving him a keen eye for the absurdity of other people he had a suggestive tongue and he professed and practised cowardice to the scandal of all his acquaintances he was said never to wash behind his ears but this report wronged him there had been a time when he did not do so but his mother had won him to a promise and now that operation was often the sum of his simple hasty toilet his desire to associate himself with benham was so strong that it triumphed over a defensive reserve it enabled him to detect accessible moments do inobtrusive friendly services and above all amuse his quarry he not only amused benham he stimulated him they came to do quite a number of things together in the language of schoolboy stories they became inseparables  protheros first desire so soon as they were on a footing that enabled him to formulate desires was to know exactly what benham thought he was up to in crossing a field with a bull in it instead of going round and by the time he began to understand that he had conceived an affection for him that was to last a lifetime  i wasnt going to be bullied by a beast said benham  suppose it had been an elephant prothero cried a mad elephant a pack of wolves  benham was too honest not to see that he was entangled well suppose in your case it had been a wild cat a fierce mastiff a mastiff a terrier a lap dog  yes but my case is that there are limits  benham was impatient at the idea of limits with a faintly malicious pleasure prothero lugged him back to that idea  we both admit there are limits prothero concluded but between the absolutely impossible and the altogether possible theres the region of risk you think a man ought to take that risk he reflected i thinknoi think not  if he feels afraid cried benham seeing his one point if he feels afraid then he ought to take it  after a digestive interval prothero asked why why should he  the discussion of that momentous question that why which benham perhaps might never have dared ask himself and which prothero perhaps might never have attempted to answer if it had not been for the clash of their minds was the chief topic of their conversation for many months from why be brave it spread readily enough to why be honest why be cleanall the great whys of life because one believes but why believe it left to himself benham would have felt the mere asking of this question was a thing ignoble not to be tolerated it was as it were treason to nobility but prothero put it one afternoon in a way that permitted no high dismissal of their doubts you cant build your honour on fudge benham like committing sacrilegein order to buy a cloth for the altar  by that benham was slipped from the recognized code and launched upon speculations which became the magnificent research  it was not only in complexion and stature and ways of thinking that billy and benham contrasted benham inclined a little to eloquence he liked very clean hands he had a dread of ridiculous outlines prothero lapsed readily into ostentatious slovenliness when his hands were dirty he pitied them sooner than scrubbed them he would have worn an overcoat with one tail torn off rather than have gone cold moreover prothero had an earthy liking for animals he could stroke and tickle strange cats until they wanted to leave father and mother and all earthly possessions and follow after him and he mortgaged a terms pocket money and bought and kept a small terrier in the school house against all law and tradition under the baseless pretence that it was a stray animal of unknown origin benham on the other hand was shy with small animals and faintly hostile to big ones beasts he thought were just beasts and prothero had a gift for caricature while benhams aptitude was for music  it was protheros eyes and pencil that first directed benham to the poor indolences and evasions and insincerities of the masters it was protheros wicked pictures that made him see the shrivelled absurdity of the vulgar theology but it was benham who stood between prothero and that rather coarsely conceived epicureanism that seemed his logical destiny when quite early in their cambridge days protheros revolt against foppery reached a nadir of personal neglect and two philanthropists from the rooms below him goaded beyond the normal tolerance of trinity and assisted by two sportsmen from trinity hall burnt his misshapen straw hat after partly filling it with gunpowder and iron filings and sought to duck him in the fountain in the court it was benham in a state between distress and madness and armed with a hornhandled cane of exceptional size who intervened turned the business into a blend of wrangle and scuffle introduced the degrading topic of duelling into a simple wholesome rag of four against one carried him off under the cloud of horror created by this impropriety and so saved him still only slightly wetted not only from this indignity but from the experiment in rationalism that had provoked it  because benham made it perfectly clear what he had thought and felt about this hat  such was the illuminating young man whom lady marayne decided to invite to chexington into the neighbourhood of herself sir godfrey and her circle of friends    7   he was quite anxious to satisfy the requirements of benhams people and to do his friend credit he was still in the phase of being a penitent pig and he inquired carefully into the needs and duties of a summer guest in a country house he knew it was quite a considerable country house and that sir godfrey wasnt benhams father but like most people he was persuaded that lady marayne had divorced the parental benham he arrived dressed very neatly in a brown suit that had only one fault it had not the remotest suggestion of having been made for him it fitted his body fairly well it did annex his body with only a few slight incompatibilities but it repudiated his hands and face he had a conspicuously old gladstone bag and a conspicuously new despatch case and he had forgotten black ties and dress socks and a hair brush he arrived in the late afternoon was met by benham in tennis flannels looking smartened up and a little unfamiliar and taken off in a spirited dogcart driven by a typical groom he met his host and hostess at dinner  sir godfrey was a rationalist and a residuum very much of him too much perhaps had gone into the acquirement and perfect performance of the caecal operation the man one met in the social world was what was left over it had the effect of being quiet but in its unobtrusive way knobby he had a knobby brow with an air about it of having recently been intent and his conversation was curiously spotted with little knobby arrested anecdotes if any one of any distinction was named he would reflect and say of courseah yes i know him i know him yes i did him a little servicein 96  and something in his manner would suggest a satisfaction or a dissatisfaction with confidential mysteries  he welcomed billy prothero in a colourless manner and made conversation about cambridge he had known one or two of the higher dons one he had done at cambridge quite recently the inns are better than they are at oxford which is not saying very much but the place struck me as being changed the men seemed younger  the burden of the conversation fell upon lady marayne she looked extraordinarily like a flower to billy a little diamond buckle on a black velvet band glittered between the two masses of buttercoloured hair that flowed back from her forehead her head was poised on the prettiest neck conceivable and her shapely little shoulders and her shapely little arms came decidedly but pleasantly out of a softness and sparkle of white and silver and old rose she talked what sounded like innocent commonplaces a little spiced by whim though indeed each remark had an exploratory quality and her soft blue eyes rested ever and again upon billys white tie it seemed she did so by the merest inadvertency but it made the young man wish he had after all borrowed a black one from benham but the manservant who had put his things out had put it out and he hadnt been quite sure also she noted all the little things he did with fork and spoon and glass she gave him an unusual sense of being brightly accurately and completely visible  chexington it seemed to billy was done with a large and costly and easy completeness the table with its silver and flowers was much more beautifully done than any table he had sat at before and in the dimness beyond the brightness there were two men to wait on the four of them the old grey butler was really wonderfully good  you shoot mr prothero  you hunt mr prothero  you know scotland well mr prothero  these questions disturbed prothero he did not shoot he did not hunt he did not go to scotland for the grouse he did not belong and lady marayne ought to have seen that he did not belong to the class that does these things  you ride much mr prothero  billy conceived a suspicion that these innocent inquiries were designed to emphasize a contrast in his social quality but he could not be sure one never could be sure with lady marayne it might be just that she did not understand the sort of man he was and in that case ought he to maintain the smooth social surface unbroken by pretending as far as possible to be this kind of person or ought he to make a sudden gap in it by telling his realities he evaded the shooting question anyhow he left it open for lady marayne and the venerable butler and sir godfrey and every one to suppose he just happened to be the sort of gentleman of leisure who doesnt shoot he disavowed hunting he made it appear he travelled when he travelled in directions other than scotland but the fourth question brought him to bay he regarded his questioner with his small rufous eye  i have never been across a horse in my life lady marayne  tut tut said sir godfrey whyits the best of exercise every man ought to ride good for the health keeps him fit prevents lodgments most trouble due to lodgments  ive never had a chance of riding and i think im afraid of horses  thats only an excuse said lady marayne everybodys afraid of horses and nobodys really afraid of horses  but im not used to horses you seei live on my mother and she cant afford to keep a stable  his hostess did not see his expression of discomfort her pretty eyes were intent upon the peas with which she was being served  does your mother live in the country she asked and took her peas with fastidious exactness  prothero coloured brightly she lives in london  all the year  all the year  but isnt it dreadfully hot in town in the summer  prothero had an uncomfortable sense of being very red in the face this kept him red were suburban people he said  but i thoughtisnt there the seaside  my mother has a business said prothero redder than ever  ooh said lady marayne what fun that must be for her  its a real business and she has to live by it sometimes its a worry  but a business of her own she surveyed the confusion of his visage with a sweet intelligence is it an amusing sort of business mr prothero  prothero looked mulish my mother is a dressmaker he said in brixton she doesnt do particularly badlyor well i live on my scholarship i have lived on scholarships since i was thirteen and you see lady marayne brixton is a poor hunting country  lady marayne felt she had unmasked prothero almost indecently whatever happened there must be no pause there must be no sign of a hitch  but its good at tennis she said you do play tennis mr prothero  ii gesticulate said prothero  lady marayne still in flight from that pause went off at a tangent  poff my dear she said ive had a divingboard put at the deep end of the pond  the remark hung unanswered for a moment the transition had been too quick for benhams state of mind  do you swim mr prothero the lady asked though a moment before she had determined that she would never ask him a question again but this time it was a lucky question  prothero mopped up the lot of us at minchinghampton with his diving and swimming benham explained and the tension was relaxed  lady marayne spoke of her own swimming and became daring and amusing at her difficulties with local feeling when first she swam in the pond the high road ran along the far side of the pondand it didnt wear a hedge or anything said lady marayne that was what they didnt quite like swimming in an undraped pond  prothero had been examined enough now he must be entertained she told stories about the village people in her brightest manner the third story she regretted as soon as she was fairly launched upon it it was how she had interviewed the village dressmaker when sir godfrey insisted upon her supporting local industries it was very amusing but technical the devil had put it into her head she had to go through with it she infused an extreme innocence into her eyes and fixed them on prothero although she felt a certain deepening pinkness in her cheeks was betraying her and she did not look at benham until her unhappy but otherwise quite amusing anecdote was dead and gone and safely buried under another  but people ought not to go about having dressmakers for mothers  and coming into other peoples houses and influencing their sons    8   that night when everything was over billy sat at the writingtable of his sumptuous bedroomthe bed was gilt wood the curtains of the three great windows were tremendous and there was a cheval glass that showed the full length of him and seemed to look over his head for moreand meditated upon this visit of his it was more than he had been prepared for it was going to be a great strain the sleek young manservant in an alpaca jacket who said sir whenever you looked at him and who had seized upon and unpacked billys most private gladstone bag without even asking if he might do so and put away and displayed billys things in a way that struck billy as faintly ironical was unexpected and it was unexpected that the brown suit with its pockets stuffed with billys personal and confidential sundries had vanished and apparently a bath in a bathroom far down the corridor was prescribed for him in the morning he hadnt thought of a dressinggown and after one had dressed what did one do did one go down and wander about the house looking for the breakfastroom or wait for a gong would sir godfrey read family prayers and afterwards did one go out or hang about to be entertained he knew now quite clearly that those wicked blue eyes would mark his every slip she did not like him she did not like him he supposed because he was common stuff he didnt play up to her world and her he was a discord in this rich cleverly elaborate household you could see it in the servants attitudes and he was committed to a week of this  billy puffed out his cheeks to blow a sigh and then decided to be angry and say damn  this way of living which made him uncomfortable was clearly an irrational and objectionable way of living it was in a cumbersome way luxurious but the waste of life of it the servants the observances all concentrated on the mere detail of existence there came a rap at the door benham appeared wearing an expensivelooking dressingjacket which lady marayne had bought for him he asked if he might talk for a bit and smoke he sat down in a capacious chintzcovered easy chair beside prothero lit a cigarette and came to the point after only a trivial hesitation  prothero he said you know what my father is  i thought he ran a preparatory school  there was the profoundest resentment in protheros voice  and all the same im going to be a rich man  i dont understand said prothero without any shadow of congratulation  benham told prothero as much as his mother had conveyed to him of the resources of his wealth her version had been adapted to his tender years and the delicacies of her position the departed nolan had become an eccentric godfather benhams manner was apologetic and he made it clear that only recently had these facts come to him he had never suspected that he had had this eccentric godfather it altered the outlook tremendously it was one of the reasons that made benham glad to have prothero there one wanted a man of ones own age who understood things a little to try over ones new ideas prothero listened with an unamiable expression  what would you do prothero if you found yourself saddled with some thousands a year  godfathers dont grow in brixton said prothero concisely  well what am i to do prothero  does all this belong to you  no this is my mothers  godfather too  ive not thought i suppose so or her own  prothero meditated  this life he said at last this large expensiveness  he left his criticism unfinished  i agree it suits my mother somehow i cant understand her living in any other way butfor me  what can one do with several thousands a year  protheros interest in this question presently swamped his petty personal resentments i suppose he said one might have rather a lark with money like that one would be free to go anywhere to set all sorts of things going its clear you cant sell all you have and give it to the poor that is pauperization nowadays you might run a tremendously revolutionary paper a real upsetting paper how many thousands is it  i dont know some  protheros interest was growing as he faced the possibilities  ive dreamt of a paper he said a paper that should tell the brute truth about things  i dont know that im particularly built to be a journalist benham objected  youre not said billy you might go into parliament as a perfectly independent member only you wouldnt get in  im not a speaker said benham  of course said billy if you dont decide on a game youll just go on like this youll fall into a groove youllyoull hunt youll go to scotland for the grouse  for the moment prothero had no further suggestions  benham waited for a second or so before he broached his own idea  why first of all at any rate billy shouldnt one use ones money to make the best of oneself to learn things that men without money and leisure find it difficult to learn by an accident however unjust it is one is in the position of a leader and a privileged person why not do ones best to give value as that  benham thats the thin end of aristocracy  why not  i hate aristocracy for you it means doing what you like while you are energetic you will kick about and then you will come back to this  thats ones own lookout said benham after reflection  no its bound to happen  benham retreated a little from the immediate question  well we cant suddenly at a blow change the world if it isnt to be plutocracy today it has to be aristocracy  prothero frowned over this and then he made a sweeping proposition  you cannot have aristocracy he said because you seeall men are ridiculous democracy has to fight its way out from under plutocracy there is nothing else to be done  but a man in my position  its a ridiculous position you may try to escape being ridiculous you wont succeed  it seemed to benham for a moment as though prothero had got to the bottom of the question and then he perceived that he had only got to the bottom of himself benham was pacing the floor  he turned at the open window held out a long forefinger and uttered his countervailing faith  even if he is ridiculous prothero a man may still be an aristocrat a man may anyhow be as much of an aristocrat as he can be  prothero reflected no he said it sounds all right but its wrong i hate all these advantages and differences and distinctions a mans a man what you say sounds well but its the beginning of pretension of pride  he stopped short  better pride than dishonour said benham better the pretentious life than the sordid life what else is there  a life isnt necessarily sordid because it isnt pretentious said prothero his voice betraying a defensive disposition  but a life with a large income must be sordid unless it makes some sort of attempt to be fine    9   by transitions that were as natural as they were complicated and untraceable prothero found his visit to chexington developing into a tangle of discussions that all ultimately resolved themselves into an antagonism of the democratic and the aristocratic idea and his part was he found to be the exponent of the democratic idea the next day he came down early his talk with benham still running through his head and after a turn or so in the garden he was attracted to the front door by a sound of voices and found lady marayne had been up still earlier and was dismounting from a large effective black horse this extorted an unwilling admiration from him she greeted him very pleasantly and made a kind of introduction of her steed there had been trouble at a gate he was a young horse and fidgeted at gates the dispute was still bright in her benham she declared was still in bed wait till i have a mount for him she reappeared fitfully in the breakfastroom and then he was left to benham until just before lunch they read and afterwards as the summer day grew hot they swam in the nude pond she joined them in the water splashing about in a costume of some elaboration and being very careful not to wet her hair then she came and sat with them on the seat under the big cedar and talked with them in a wrap that was pretty rather than prudish and entirely unmotherly and she began a fresh attack upon him by asking him if he wasnt a socialist and whether he didnt want to pull down chexington and grow potatoes all over the park  this struck prothero as an inadequate statement of the socialist project and he made an unsuccessful attempt to get it amended  the engagement thus opened was renewed with great energy at lunch sir godfrey had returned to london and the inmost aspect of his fellowcreatures but the party of three was supplemented by a vague young lady from the village and an alert agent from the neighbouring tentington estate who had intentions about a cottage lady marayne insisted upon regarding socialism as a proposal to reinaugurate the first french revolution as an inversion of society so that it would be bottom upward as an attack upon rule order direction and what good are all these proposals if you had the poor dear king beheaded youd only get a napoleon if you divided all the property up between everybody youd have rich and poor again in a year  billy perceived no way of explaining away this version of his socialism that would not involve uncivil contradictionsand nobody ever contradicted lady marayne  but lady marayne dont you think there is a lot of disorder and injustice in the world he protested  there would be ever so much more if your socialists had their way  but still dont you think  it is unnecessary even to recapitulate these universal controversies of our time the lunchtable and the dinnertable and the general talk of the house drifted more and more definitely at its own level in the same direction as the private talk of prothero and benham towards the antagonism of the privileged few and the many of the trained and traditioned against the natural and undisciplined of aristocracy against democracy at the weekend sir godfrey returned to bring fresh elements he said that democracy was unscientific to deny aristocracy is to deny the existence of the fittest it is on the existence of the fittest that progress depends  but do our social conditions exalt the fittest asked prothero  that is another question said benham  exactly said sir godfrey that is another question but speaking with some special knowledge i should say that on the whole the people who are on the top of things ought to be on the top of things i agree with aristotle that there is such a thing as a natural inferior  so far as i can understand mr prothero said lady marayne he thinks that all the inferiors are the superiors and all the superiors inferior its quite simple  it made prothero none the less indignant with this that there was indeed a grain of truth in it he hated superiors he felt for inferiors    10   at last came the hour of tipping an embarrassed and miserable prothero went slinking about the house distributing unexpected gold  it was stupid it was damnable he had had to borrow the money from his mother  lady marayne felt he had escaped her the controversy that should have split these two young men apart had given them a new interest in each other when afterwards she sounded her son very delicately to see if indeed he was aware of the clumsiness the social ignorance and uneasiness the complete unsuitability of his friend she could get no more from him than that exasperating phrase he has ideas  what are ideas england may yet be ruined by ideas  he ought never to have gone to trinity that monster packet of everything he ought to have gone to some little good college good all through she ought to have asked some one who knew    11   one glowing afternoon in october as these two young men came over magdalen bridge after a long disputatious and rather tiring walk to draytonthey had been talking of eugenics and the familybenham was almost knocked down by an american trotter driven by lord breeze whup there said lord breeze in a voice deliberately brutal and benham roused from that abstraction which is partly fatigue had to jump aside and stumbled against the parapet as the gaunt pacer went pounding by  lord breeze grinned the sort of grin a man remembers and passed  damnation said benham with a face that had become suddenly very white  then presently any fool can do that who cares to go to the trouble  that said prothero taking up their unquenchable issue that is the feeling of democracy  i walk because i choose to said benham  the thing rankled  this equestrianism he began is a matter of time and moneytime even more than money i want to read i want to deal with ideas  any fool can drive  exactly said prothero  as for riding it means no more than the elaborate study and cultivation of your horse you have to know him all horses are individuals a made horse perhaps goes its round like an omnibus but for the rest  prothero made a noise of sympathetic assent  in a country where equestrianism is assertion i suppose one must be equestrian  that night some malignant spirit kept benham awake and great american trotters with vast widestriding feet and long yellow teeth uncontrollable hardmouthed american trotters pounded over his angry soul  prothero he said in hall next day we are going to drive tomorrow  next day so soon as they had lunched he led the way towards maltbys in crosshampton lane something in his bearing put a question into protheros mind benham he asked have you ever driven before  never said benham  well  im going to now  something between pleasure and alarm came into protheros eyes he quickened his pace so as to get alongside his friend and scrutinize his pale determination why are you doing this he asked  i want to do it  benham is itequestrian  benham made no audible reply they proceeded resolutely in silence  an air of expectation prevailed in maltbys yard in the shafts of a high bleaklooking vehicle with vast side wheels a thronelike vehicle that impressed billy prothero as being a gig a very large angular black horse was being harnessed  this is mine said benham compactly  this is yours sir said an ostler  he looksquiet  youll find him fresh enough sir  benham made a complicated ascent to the drivers seat and was handed the reins come on he said and prothero followed to a less exalted seat at benhams side they seemed to be at a very great height indeed the horse was then led out into crosshampton lane faced towards trinity street and discharged check said benham and touched the steed with his whip they started quite well and the ostlers went back into the yard visibly unanxious it struck prothero that perhaps driving was less difficult than he had supposed  they went along crosshampton lane that highwalled gulley with dignity with only a slight suggestion of the inaccuracy that was presently to become apparent until they met a little old bearded don on a bicycle then some misunderstanding arose between benham and the horse and the little bearded don was driven into the narrow pavement and had to get off hastily he made no comment but his face became like a gargoyle sorry said benham and gave his mind to the corner there was some difficulty about whether they were to turn to the right or the left but at last benham it seemed carried his point and they went along the narrow street past the grey splendours of kings and rather in the middle of the way  prothero considered the beast in front of him and how proud and disrespectful a horse in a dogcart can seem to those behind it moreover unaccustomed as he was to horses he was struck by the strong resemblance a birdseye view of a horse bears to a fiddle a fiddle with devils ears  of course said prothero this isnt a trotter  i couldnt get a trotter said benham  i thought i would try this sort of thing before i tried a trotter he added  and then suddenly came disaster  there was a butchers cart on the right and benham mistrusting the intelligence of his steed insisted upon an excessive amplitude of clearance he did not reckon with the handbarrow on his left piled up with dirty plates from the lunch of trinity hall it had been left there its custodian was away upon some mysterious errand heaven knows why trinity hall exhibited the treasures of its crockery thus stained and deified in the cambridge streets but it didfor benhams and protheros undoing prothero saw the great wheel over which he was poised entangle itself with the little wheel of the barrow god he whispered and craned fascinated the little wheel was manifestly intrigued beyond all selfcontrol by the great wheel it clung to it it went before it heedless of the barrow of which it was an inseparable part the barrow came about with an appearance of unwillingness it locked against the great wheel it reared itself towards prothero and began smash smash smash to shed its higher plates it was clear that benham was grappling with a crisis upon a basis of inadequate experience a number of people shouted haphazard things then too late the barrow had persuaded the little wheel to give up its fancy for the great wheel and there was an enormous crash  whoa cried benham whoa but also unfortunately he sawed hard at the horses mouth  the animal being in some perplexity danced a little in the narrow street and then it had come about and it was backing backing on the narrow pavement and towards the plateglass window of a book and newspaper shop benham tugged at its mouth much harder than ever prothero saw the window bending under the pressure of the wheel a sense of the profound seriousness of life and of the folly of this expedition came upon him with extreme nimbleness he got down just as the window burst it went with an explosion like a pistol shot and then a clatter of falling glass people sprang it seemed from nowhere and jostled about prothero so that he became a peripheral figure in the discussion he perceived that a man in a green apron was holding the horse and that various people were engaged in simultaneous conversation with benham who with a pale serenity of face and an awful calm of manner dealt with each of them in turn  im sorry he was saying somebody ought to have been in charge of the barrow here are my cards i am ready to pay for any damage  the barrow ought not to have been there  yes i am going on of course im going on thank you  he beckoned to the man who had held the horse and handed him halfacrown he glanced at prothero as one might glance at a stranger check he said the horse went on gravely benham lifted out his whip he appeared to have clean forgotten prothero perhaps presently he would miss him he went on past trinity past the ruddy brick of st johns the curve of the street hid him from protheros eyes  prothero started in pursuit he glimpsed the dogcart turning into bridge street he had an impression that benham used the whip at the corner and that the dogcart went forward out of sight with a startled jerk prothero quickened his pace  but when he got to the fork between the huntingdon road and the cottenham road both roads were clear  he spent some time in hesitation then he went along the huntingdon road until he came upon a roadmender and learnt that benham had passed that way going pretty fast e was said the roadmender and whipping is orse else you might a thought e was a boltin with im prothero decided that if benham came back at all he would return by way of cottenham and it was on the cottenham road that at last he encountered his friend again  benham was coming along at that good pace which all experienced horses when they are fairly turned back towards cambridge display and there was something odd about benham as though he had a large circular halo with a thick rim this it seemed had replaced his hat he was certainly hatless the warm light of the sinking sun shone upon the horse and upon benhams erect figure and upon his face and gleams of fire kept flashing from his head to this rim like the gleam of drawn swords seen from afar as he drew nearer this halo detached itself from him and became a wheel sticking up behind him a large clumsylooking bicycle was attached to the dogcart behind the expression of benhams golden face was still a stony expression he regarded his friend with hard eyes  you all right benham cried prothero advancing into the road  his eye examined the horse it looked all right if anything it was a trifle subdued there was a little foam about its mouth but not very much  whoa said benham and the horse stopped are you coming up prothero  prothero clambered up beside him i was anxious he said  there was no need to be  youve broken your whip  yes it broke get up  they proceeded on their way to cambridge  something has happened to the wheel said prothero trying to be at his ease  merely a splinter or so and a spoke perhaps  and what is this behind  benham made a halfturn of the head its a motorbicycle  prothero took in details  some of it is missing  no the front wheel is under the seat  oh  did you find it prothero asked after an interval  you mean  he ran into a motorcaras i was passing i was perhaps a little to blame he asked me to bring his machine to cambridge he went on in the car it is all perfectly simple  prothero glanced at the splinters in the wheel with a renewed interest  did your wheel get into it he asked benham affected not to hear he was evidently in no mood for storytelling  why did you get down prothero he asked abruptly with the note of suppressed anger thickening his voice  prothero became vividly red i dont know he said after an interval  i do said benham and they went on in a rich and active silence to cambridge and the bicycle repair shop in bridge street and trinity college at the gate of trinity benham stopped and conveyed rather by acts than words that prothero was to descend he got down meekly enough although he felt that the return to maltbys yard might have many points of interest but the spirit had gone out of him    12   for three days the two friends avoided each other and then prothero went to benhams room benham was smoking cigaretteslady marayne in the first warmth of his filial devotion had prohibited his pipeand reading webbs industrial democracy hello he said coldly scarcely looking up and continued to read that absorbing work  i keep on thinking how i jumped down from that damned dogcart said prothero without any preface  it didnt matter in the least said benham distantly  oh rot said prothero i behaved like a coward  benham shut his book  benham said prothero you are right about aristocracy and i am wrong ive been thinking about it night and day  benham betrayed no emotion but his tone changed billy he said there are cigarettes and whiskey in the corner dont make a fuss about a trifle  no whiskey said billy and lit a cigarette and it isnt a trifle  he came to benhams hearthrug that business he said has changed all my views nodont say something polite i see that if one hasnt the habit of pride one is bound to get off a dogcart when it seems likely to smash you have the habit of pride and i havent so far as the habit of pride goes i come over to the theory of aristocracy  benham said nothing but he put down sidney and beatrice webb and reached out for and got and lit a cigarette  i give up go as you please i give up the natural man i admit training i perceive i am lax and flabby unguarded i funk too much i eat too much and i drink too much and yet what i have always liked in you benham is just thisthat you dont  i do said benham  do what  funk  benham i believe that naturally you funk as much as i do youre more a thing of nerves than i am far more but you keep yourself up to the mark and i have let myself get flabby youre so right youre so utterly right these last nights ive confessed italoud i had an inkling of itafter that rag but now its as clear as daylight i dont know if you mean to go on with me after whats happened but anyhow i want you to know whether you end our friendship or not  billy dont be an old ass said benham  both young men paused for a moment they made no demonstrations but the strain was at an end between them  ive thought it all out billy went on with a sudden buoyancy we two are both of the same kind of men only you see benham you have a natural pride and i havent you have pride but we are both intellectuals we both belong to what the russians call the intelligentsia we have ideas we have imagination that is our strength and that is our weakness that makes us moral lightweights we are flimsy and uncertain people all intellectuals are flimsy and uncertain people its not only that they are critical and fastidious they are weakhanded they look about them their attention wanders unless they have got a habit of controlling themselves and forcing themselves and holding themselves together  the habit of pride  yes and thenthen we are lords of the world  all this billy said benham i steadfastly believe  ive seen it all now said prothero lord how clearly i see it the intellectual is either a prince or he is a greek slave in a roman household hes got to hold his chin up or else he becomeseven as these dons we see about usa thing that talks appointments a toady a portwine bibber a mass of detail a conscious maker of neat sayings a growing belly under a dwindling brain their gladness is drink or gratified vanity or gratified malice their sorrow is indigestion orold maids melancholy they are the lords of the world who will not take the sceptre and what i want to say to you benham more than anything else is you go onyou make yourself equestrian you drive your horse against breezes and go through the fire and swim in the icecold water and climb the precipice and drink little and sleep hard andi wish i could do so too  but why not  because i cant now i admit ive got shame in my heart and pride in my head and im strung up i might do somethingthis afternoon but it wont last youyou have pride in your bones my pride will vanish at a laugh my honour will go at a laugh im just exalted by a crisis thats all im an animal of intelligence soul and pride are weak in me my mouth waters my cheek brightens at the sight of good things and ive got a lickerish tail benham you dont know you dont begin to imagine im secretive but i quiver with hot and stirring desires and im indolentdirty indolent benham there are days when i splash my bath about without getting into it there are days when i turn back from a walk because theres a cow in the field but i spare you the viler details and its that makes me hate fine people and try so earnestly to persuade myself that any man is as good as any man if not a trifle better because i know it isnt so  billy said benham youve the boldest mind that ever i met  protheros face lit with satisfaction then his countenance fell again i know im better there he said and yet see how i let in a whole system of lies to cover my secret humiliations there at least i will cling to pride i will at least think free and clean and high but you can climb higher than i can youve got the grit to try and live high there you are benham  benham stuck one leg over the arm of his chair billy he said come and beequestrian and stop this nonsense  no  damn ityou dive  youd go in before me if a woman was drowning  nonsense im going to ride come and ride too youve a cleverer way with animals than i have why that horse i was driving the other day would have gone better alone i didnt drive it i just fussed it i interfered if i ride for ever i shall never have decent hands i shall always hang on my horses mouth at a gallop i shall never be sure at a jump but at any rate i shall get hard come and get hard too  you can said billy you can but not i heavens the trouble of it the ridingschool the getting up early nofor me the trumpington road on foot in the afternoon four miles an hour and panting and my fellowship and the combinationroom port and besides benham theres the expense i cant afford the equestrian order  its not so great  not so great i dont mean the essential expense butthe incidentals i dont know whether any one can realize how a poor man is hampered by the dread of minor catastrophes it isnt so much that he is afraid of breaking his neck benham as that he is afraid of breaking something he will have to pay for for instance benham how much did your little expedition the other day  he stopped short and regarded his friend with round eyes and raised eyebrows  a reluctant grin overspread benhams face he was beginning to see the humour of the affair  the claim for the motorbicycle isnt sent in yet the repair of the mudguards of the car is in dispute trinity halls crockery the plateglass window the whiplash and wheel and so forth the hire of the horse and trap sundry gratuities i doubt if the total will come very much under fifty pounds and i seem to have lost a hat somewhere  billy regarded his toes and cleared his throat  depending as i do on a widowed mother in brixton for all the expenditure that isnt covered by my pothunting  of course said benham it wasnt a fair sample afternoon  still  theres footer said benham we might both play footer  or boxing  and anyhow you must come with me when i drive again im going to start a trotter  if i miss another drive may i belost for ever said billy with the utmost sincerity never more will i get down benham wherever you may take me short of muffing my fellowship im with you always will it be an american trotter  it will be the rawest gauntest ungainliest brute that ever scared the motorbicycles on the northampton road it will have the legs and stride of an ostrich it will throw its feet out like dealing cards it will lift its head and look the sun in the eye like a vulture it will have teeth like the english spinster in a french comic paper and we will fly  i shall enjoy it very much said prothero in a small voice after an interval for reflection i wonder where we shall fly it will do us both a lot of good and i shall insure my life for a small amount in my mothers interest benham i think i will after all take a whiskey life is short  he did so and benham strolled to the window and stood looking out upon the great court  we might do something this afternoon said benham  splendid idea reflected billy over his whiskey living hard and thinking hard a sort of intelligentsia that is blooded i shall of course come as far as i can with you    13   in one of the bureau drawers that white in this capacity of literary executor was examining there were two documents that carried back right to these early days they were both products of this long wide undergraduate argumentation that had played so large a part in the making of benham one recorded the phase of maximum opposition and one was the outcome of the concluding approach of the antagonists they were debating club essays one had been read to a club in pembroke a club called the enquirers of which white also had been a member and as he turned it over he found the circumstances of its reading coming back to his memory he had been present and carnacs share in the discussion with his shrill voice and stumpy gestures would alone have sufficed to have made it a memorable occasion the later one had been read to the daughter club of the enquirers the social enquirers in the year after white had gone down and it was new to him  both these papers were folded flat and neatly docketed they were rather yellow and a little dogeared and with the outer sheet pencilled over with puzzling or illegible scribblings benhams memoranda for his reply white took the earlier essay in his hand at the head of the first page was written in large letters go slowly speak to the man at the back it brought up memories of his own experiences of rows of gaslit faces and of a friendly helpful voice that said speak up  of course this was what happened to every intelligent contemporary this encounter with ideas this restatement and ventilation of the old truths and the old heresies only in this way does a man make a view his own only so does he incorporate it these are our real turning points the significant the essential moments in the life of any one worth consideration are surely these moments when for the first time he faces towards certain broad ideas and certain broad facts life nowadays consists of adventures among generalizations in classrooms after the lecture in studies in the small hours among books or during solitary walks the drama of the modern career begins suddenly a man sees his line his intention yet though we are all of us writing long novelswhites world was the literary world and that is how it looked to himwhich profess to set out the lives of men this part of the journey this crucial passage among the sphinxes is still donewhen it is done at allslightly evasively why  white fell back on his professionalism it does not make a book it makes a novel into a treatise it turns it into a dissertation  but even as white said this to himself he knew it was wrong and it slid out of his thoughts again was not this objection to the play of ideas merely the expression of that conservative instinct which fights for every old convention the traditional novel is a love story and takes ideas for granted it professes a hero but presents a heroine and to begin with at least novels were written for the reading of heroines miss lydia languish sets no great store upon the contents of a mans head that is just the stuffing of the doll eyes and heart are her game and so there is never any more sphinx in the story than a lady may impersonate and as inevitably the heroine meets a man in his own first success white reflected the hero before he had gone a dozen pages met a very pleasant young woman very pleasantly in a sunlit thicket the second opened at once with a bicycle accident that brought two young people together so that they were never afterwards disentangled the third failing to produce its heroine in thirty pages had to be rearranged the next  white returned from an unprofitable digression to the matter before him    14   the first of benhams early essays was written in an almost boyish hand it was youthfully amateurish in its nervous disposition to definitions and distinctions and in the elaborate linking of part to part it was called true democracy manifestly it was written before the incident of the trinity hall plates and most of it had been done after protheros visit to chexington white could feel that now inaudible interlocutor and there were even traces of sir godfrey maraynes assertion that democracy was contrary to biology from the outset it was clear that whatever else it meant true democracy following the analogy of true politeness true courage true honesty and true marriage did not mean democracy at all benham was in fact taking protheros word and trying to impose upon it his own solidifying and crystallizing opinion of life  they were not as yet very large or wellformed crystals the proposition he struggled to develop was this that true democracy did not mean an equal share in the government it meant an equal opportunity to share in the government men were by nature and in the most various ways unequal true democracy aimed only at the removal of artificial inequalities  it was on the truth of this statement that men were by nature unequal that the debate had turned prothero was passionately against the idea at that time it was he felt separating himself from benham more and more he spoke with a personal bitterness and he found his chief ally in a rigorous and voluble frenchman named carnac an aggressive roman catholic who opened his speech by saying that the first aristocrat was the devil and shocked prothero by claiming him as probably the only other sound christian in the room several biologists were present and one tall fair youth with a wearisome forefinger tried to pin carnac with questions  but you must admit some men are taller than others  then the others are broader  some are smaller altogether  nimblerits notorious  some of the smaller are less nimble than the others  then they have better nightmares how can you tell  the biologist was temporarily incapacitated and the talk went on over his prostrate attempts to rally and protest  a second biologist seemed to benham to come nearer the gist of the dispute when he said that they were not discussing the importance of men but their relative inequalities nobody was denying the equal importance of everybody but there was a virtue of this man and a virtue of that nobody could dispute the equal importance of every wheel in a machine of every atom in the universe prothero and carnac were angry because they thought the denial of absolute equality was a denial of equal importance that was not so every man mattered in his place but politically or economically or intellectually that might be a lowly place  at this point carnac interrupted with a whooping and great violence and a volley of obscure french colloquialisms  he was understood to convey that the speaker was a jew and did not in the least mean what he was saying   15   the second paper was an altogether maturer and more characteristic production it was no longer necessary to answer prothero prothero had been incorporated and benham had fairly got away with his great idea it was evident to white that this paper had been worked over on several occasions since its first composition and that benham had intended to make it a part of his book there were corrections in pencil and corrections in a different shade of ink and there was an unfinished new peroration that was clearly the latest addition of all yet its substance had been there always it gave the youth just grown to manhood but anyhow fully grown it presented the fardreaming intellectualist shaped  benham had called it aristocracy but he was far away by now from political aristocracy  this time he had not begun with definitions and generalizations but with a curiously subjective appeal he had not pretended to be theorizing at large any longer he was manifestly thinking of his own life and as manifestly he was thinking of life as a matter of difficulty and unexpected thwartings  we see life he wrote not only life in the world outside us but life in our own selves as an immense choice of possibilities indeed for us in particular who have come up here who are not under any urgent necessity to take this line or that life is apparently pure choice it is quite easy to think we are all going to choose the pattern of life we like best and work it out in our own way and meanwhile there is no great hurry  i want to begin by saying that choice isnt so easy and so necessary as it seems we think we are going to choose presently and in the end we may never choose at all choice needs perhaps more energy than we think the great multitude of older people we can observe in the world outside there havent chosen either in the matter of the world outside where they shall go what they shall do what part they shall play or in the matter of the world within what they will be and what they are determined they will never be they are still in much the same state of suspended choice as we seem to be in but in the meanwhile things happen to them and things are happening to us things will happen to us while we still suppose ourselves in the wings waiting to be consulted about the casting of the piece  nevertheless this immense appearance of choice which we get in the undergraduate community here is not altogether illusion it is more reality than illusion even if it has not the stable and complete reality it appears to have and it is more a reality for us than it was for our fathers and much more a reality now than it was a few centuries ago the world is more confused and multitudinous than ever it was the practicable world far wider and ourselves far less under the pressure of inflexible moulding forces and inevitable necessities than any preceding generations i want to put very clearly how i see the new world the present world the world of novel choice to which our youth and inexperience faces and i want to define to you a certain selection of choices which i am going to call aristocratic and to which it is our manifest duty and destiny as the elect and favoured sons of our race to direct ourselves  it isnt any choice of hercules i mean any mere alternative whether we will be how shall i put itthe bridegrooms of pleasure or the bridegrooms of duty it is infinitely vaster and more subtly moral than that there are a thousand good lives possible of which we may have one lives which are soundly good or a thousand bad lives if you like lives which are thoroughly badthats the old and perpetual choice that has always beenbut what is more evident to me and more remarkable and disconcerting is that there are nowadays ten thousand muddled lives lacking even so much moral definition even so much consistency as is necessary for us to call them either good or bad there are planless indeterminate lives more and more of them opening out as the possible lives before us a perfect wilderness between salvation and damnation a wilderness so vast and crowded that at last it seems as though the way to either hell or heaven would be lost in its interminable futility such planless indeterminate lives plebeian lives mere lives fill the world and the spectacle of whole nations our whole civilization seems to me to reecho this planlessness this indeterminate confusion of purpose plain issues are harder and harder to find it is as if they had disappeared simple living is the countryman come to town we are deafened and jostled and perplexed there are so many things afoot that we get nothing  that is what is in my mind when i tell you that we have to gather ourselves together much more than we think we have to clench ourselves upon a chosen end we have to gather ourselves together out of the swill of this brimming world  orwe are lost  swill of this brimming world said white some of this sounds uncommonly like prothero he mused for a moment and then resumed his reading  that is what i was getting at when three years ago i made an attack upon democracy to the mother society of this society an attack that i expressed ill and failed to drive home that is what i have come down now to do my best to make plainer this age of confusion is democracy it is all that democracy can ever give us democracy if it means anything means the rule of the planless man the rule of the unkempt mind it means as a necessary consequence this vast boiling up of collectively meaningless things  what is the quality of the common man i mean of the man that is common to all of us the man who is the standard for such men as carnac the man who seems to be the ideal of the catholic democrat he is the creature of a few fundamental impulses he begins in blind imitation of the life about him he lusts and takes a wife he hungers and tills a field or toils in some other way to earn a living a mere aimless living he fears and so he does not wander he is jealous and stays by his wife and his job is fiercely yet often stupidly and injuriously defensive of his children and his possessions and so until he wearies then he dies and needs a cemetery he needs a cemetery because he is so afraid of dissolution that even when he has ceased to be he still wants a place and a grave to hold him together and prevent his returning to the all that made him our chief impression of long ages of mankind comes from its cemeteries and this is the life of man as the common man conceives and lives it beyond that he does not go he never comprehends himself collectively at all the state happens about him his passion for security his gregarious selfdefensiveness makes him accumulate upon himself until he congests in cities that have no sense of citizenship and states that have no structure the clumsy inconsecutive lying and chatter of his newspapers his hoardings and musichalls gives the measure of his congested intelligences the confusion of ugly half empty churches and chapels and meetinghalls gauge the intensity of his congested souls the tricks and slow blundering dishonesties of diet and congress and parliament are his statecraft and his wisdom  i do not care if this instant i am stricken dead for pride i say here now to you and to high heaven that this life is not good enough for me i know there is a better life than this muddle about us a better life possible now i know it a better individual life and a better public life if i had no other assurances if i were blind to the glorious intimations of art to the perpetually widening promise of science to the mysterious beckonings of beauty in form and colour and the inaccessible mockery of the stars i should still know this from the insurgent spirit within me  now this better life is what i mean when i talk of aristocracy this idea of a life breaking away from the common life to something better is the consuming idea in my mind  constantly recurrently struggling out of the life of the farm and the shop the inn and the market the street and the crowd is something that is not of the common life its way of thinking is science its dreaming is art its will is the purpose of mankind it is not the common thing but also it is not an unnatural thing it is not as common as a rat but it is no less natural than a panther  for it is as natural to be an explorer as it is to be a potato grower it is rarer but it is as natural it is as natural to seek explanations and arrange facts as it is to make love or adorn a hut or show kindness to a child it is a folly i will not even dispute about that mans only natural implement is the spade imagination pride exalted desire are just as much man as are hunger and thirst and sexual curiosities and the panic dread of unknown things  now you see better what i mean about choice now you see what i am driving at we have to choose each one for himself and also each one for the race whether we will accept the muddle of the common life whether we ourselves will be muddled weakly nothings children of luck steering our artful courses for mean success and tawdry honours or whether we will be aristocrats for that is what it amounts to each one in the measure of his personal quality an aristocrat refusing to be restrained by fear refusing to be restrained by pain resolved to know and understand up to the hilt of his understanding resolved to sacrifice all the common stuff of his life to the perfection of his peculiar gift a purged man a trained selected artificial man not simply free but lordly free filled and sustained by pride whether you or i make that choice and whether you or i succeed in realizing ourselves though a great matter to ourselves is i admit a small matter to the world but the great matter is this that the choice is being made that it will continue to be made and that all around us so that it can never be arrested and darkened again is the dawn of human possibility  white could also see his dead friends face with its enthusiastic paleness its disordered hair and the glowing darknesses in the eyes on such occasions benham always had an expression of escape temporary escape and thus would his hand have clutched the readingdesk thus would his long fingers have rustled these dry papers  man has reached a point when a new life opens before him  the old habitual life of man is breaking up all about us and for the new life our minds our imaginations our habits and customs are all unprepared  it is only now after some years of study and living that i begin to realize what this tremendous beginning we call science means to mankind every condition that once justified the rules and imperatives the manners and customs the sentiments the morality the laws and limitations which make up the common life has been or is being destroyed two or three hundred years more and all that life will be as much a thing past and done with as the life that was lived in the age of unpolished stone  man is leaving his ancestral shelters and going out upon the greatest adventure that ever was in space or time he is doing it now he is doing it in us as i stand here and read to you     chapter the second  the young man about town    1   the oldest novel in the world at any rate white reflected was a story with a hero and no love interest worth talking about it was the story of tobias and how he came out from the shelters of his youth into this magic and intricate world its heroine was incidental part of the spoil a seven times relict  white had not read the book of tobit for many years and what he was really thinking of was not that ancient story at all but botticellis picture that picture of the sunlit morning of life when you say tobias that is what most intelligent people will recall perhaps you will remember how gaily and confidently the young man strides along with the armoured angel by his side absurdly enough benham and his dream of high aristocracy reminded white of that  we have all been tobias in our time said white  if white had been writing this chapter he would have in all probability called it the tobias stage forgetful that there was no tobit behind benham and an entirely different sara in front of him    2   from cambridge benham came to london for the first time he was to live in london never before had he been in london for more than a few days at a time but now guided by his mothers advice he was to have a flat in finacue street just round the corner from desborough street a flat very completely and delightfully furnished under her supervision it had an admirable study in which she had arranged not only his books but a number of others in beautiful old leather bindings that it had amused her extremely to buy it had a splendid bureau and businesslike letterfiling cabinets a neat little drawingroom and a diningroom wellplaced abundant electric lights and a man called merkle whom she had selected very carefully and who she felt would not only see to benhams comfort but keep him if necessary up to the mark  this man merkle seemed quite unaware that humanity here and noweven as he was engaged in meticulously putting out benhams clotheswas leaving its ancestral shelters and going out upon the greatest adventure that ever was in space or time if he had been told as much by benham he would probably have said indeed sir and proceeded accurately with his duties and if benhams voice had seemed to call for any additional remark he would probably have added its igh time sir something of the sort was done will you have the white wesket as before sir or a fresh one this evening unless its a very special occasion sir exactly sir thank you sir  and when her son was properly installed in his apartments lady marayne came round one morning with a large experiencedlooking portfolio and rendered an account of her stewardship of his estate that was already some months overdue it was all very confused and confusing and there were inexplicable incidents a heavy overdraft at the bank for example but this was sir godfreys fault she explained he never would help me with any of this business she said ive had to add sometimes for hours but of course you are a man and when youve looked through it all i know youll understand  he did look through it enough to see that it was undesirable that he should understand too explicitly and anyhow he was manifestly very well off indeed and the circumstances of the case even as he understood them would have made any businesslike bookkeeping ungracious the bankers submitted the corroborating account of securities and he found himself possessed of his unconditional six thousand a year with as she put it the world at his feet on the whole it seemed more wonderful to him now than when he had first heard of it he kissed her and thanked her and left the portfolio open for merkles entirely honest and respectful but very exact inspection and walked back with her to desborough street and all the while he was craving to ask the one tremendous question he knew he would never ask which was just how exactly this beneficent nolan came in  once or twice in the small hours and on a number of other occasions this unspeakable riddle assumed a portentous predominance in his mind he was forced back upon his inner consciousness for its consideration he could discuss it with nobody else because that would have been discussing his mother  probably most young men who find themselves with riches at large in the world have some such perplexity as this mixed in with the gift such men as the cecils perhaps not because they are in the order of things the rich young jews perhaps not because acquisition is their principle but for most other intelligent inheritors there must be this twinge of conscientious doubt why particularly am i picked out for so tremendous an advantage if the riddle is not nolan then it is rent or it is the social mischief of the business or the particular speculative coup that established their fortune  pecunia non olet benham wrote and it is just as well or the westends of the world would reek with deodorizers restitution is inconceivable how and to whom and in the meanwhile here we are lifted up by our advantage to a fantastic appearance of opportunity whether the world looks to us or not to do tremendous things it ought to look to us and above all we ought to look to ourselves richesse oblige    3   it is not to be supposed that benham came to town only with a general theory of aristocracy he had made plans for a career indeed he had plans for several careers none of them when brought into contrast with the great spectacle of london retained all the attractiveness that had saturated them at their inception  they were all more or less political careers whatever a democratic man may be prothero and he had decided that an aristocratic man is a public man he is made and protected in what he is by laws and the state and his honour goes out to the state the aristocrat has no right to be a voluptuary or a mere artist or a respectable nonentity or any such purely personal things responsibility for the aim and ordering of the world is demanded from him as imperatively as courage  benhams deliberate assumption of the equestrian role brought him into contact with a new set of acquaintances conscious of political destinies they were amiable hard young men almost affectedly unaffected they breakfasted before dawn to get in a days hunting and they saw to it that benhams manifest determination not to discredit himself did not lead to his breaking his neck their bodies were beautifully tempered and their minds were as flabby as protheros body among them were such men as lord breeze and peter westerton and that current set of corinthians who supposed themselves to be resuscitating the young england movement and tory democracy poor movements which indeed have never so much lived as suffered chronic resuscitation these were days when tariff reform was only an inglorious possibility for the tory party and young england had yet to demonstrate its mental quality in an antisocialist campaign seen from the perspectives of cambridge and chexington the tory party was still a credible basis for the adventure of a young man with an aristocratic theory in his mind  these were the days when the strain and extremity of a dangerous colonial war were fresh in peoples minds when the quality of the public consciousness was braced up by its recent response to unanticipated demands the conflict of stupidities that had caused the war was overlaid and forgotten by a hundred thousand devotions by countless heroic deaths and sufferings by a pacification largely conceived and broadly handled the nation had displayed a belated regard for its honour and a sustained passion for great unities it was still possible for benham to regard the empire as a splendid opportunity and london as the conceivable heart of the world he could think of parliament as a career and of a mingling of aristocratic socialism based on universal service with a civilizing imperialism as a purpose  but his thoughts had gone wider and deeper than that  already when benham came to london he had begun to dream of possibilities that went beyond the accidental states and empires of today protheros mind replete with historical detail could find nothing but absurdity in the alliances and dynasties and loyalties of our time patched up things benham temporary pretentious all very well for the undignified man the democratic man to take shelter under all very well for the humourist to grin and bear all very well for the crowd and the quack but not for the aristocratnohis mind cuts like steel and burns like fire lousy sheds they are plastered hoardings and such a damned nuisance too for any one who wants to do honourable things with their wars and their diplomacies their tariffs and their encroachments all their humbugging struggles their bloody and monstrous struggles that finally work out to no end at all if you are going for the handsome thing in life then the world has to be a united world benham as a matter of course that was settled when the railways and the telegraph came telephones wireless telegraphy aeroplanes insist on it weve got to mediatise all this stuff all these little crowns and boundaries and creeds and so on that stand in the way just as italy had to be united in spite of all the rotten little dukes and princes and republics just as germany had to be united in spite of its scores of kingdoms and duchies and liberties so now the world things as they are may be fun for lawyers and politicians and court people anddouaniers they may suit the loanmongers and the armaments shareholders they may even be more comfortable for the middleaged but what except as an inconvenience does that matter to you or me  prothero always pleased benham when he swept away empires there was always a point when the rhetoric broke into gesture  weve got to sweep them away benham he said with a wide gesture of his arm weve got to sweep them all away  prothero helped himself to some more whiskey and spoke hastily because he was afraid some one else might begin he was never safe from interruption in his own room the other young men present sucked at their pipes and regarded him doubtfully they were never quite certain whether prothero was a prophet or a fool they could not understand a mixed type and he was so manifestly both  the only sane political work for an intelligent man is to get the worldstate ready for that we have to prepare an aristocracy  your worldstate will be aristocratic some one interpolated  of course it will be aristocratic how can uninformed men think all round the globe democracy dies five miles from the parish pump it will be an aristocratic republic of all the capable men in the world  of course he added pipe in mouth as he poured out his whiskey its a big undertaking its an affair of centuries  and then as a further afterthought all the more reason for getting to work at it  in his moods of inspiration prothero would discourse through the tobacco smoke until that great worldstate seemed imminentand part two in the tripos a thing relatively remote he would talk until the dimlylit room about him became impalpable and the young men squatting about it in elaborately careless attitudes caught glimpses of cities that are still to be bridges in wild places deserts tamed and oceans conquered mankind no longer wasted by bickerings going forward to the conquest of the stars  an aristocratic worldstate this political dream had already taken hold of benhams imagination when he came to town but it was a dream something that had never existed something that indeed may never materialize and such dreams though they are vivid enough in a study at night fade and vanish at the rustle of a daily newspaper or the sound of a passing band to come back again so it was with benham sometimes he was set clearly towards this worldstate that prothero had talked into possibility sometimes he was simply abreast of the patriotic and socially constructive british imperialism of breeze and westerton and there were moods when the two things were confused in his mind and the glamour of world dominion rested wonderfully on the slack and straggling british empire of edward the seventhand mr rudyard kipling and mr chamberlain he did go on for a time honestly entertaining both these projects in his mind each at its different level the greater impalpable one and the lesser concrete one within it in some unimaginable way he could suppose that the one by some miracle of ennoblementand neglecting the frenchman the russian the german the american the indian the chinaman and indeed the greater part of mankind from the problemmight become the other  all of which is recorded here without excess of comment as it happened and as in a mood of astonished reminiscences he came finally to perceive it and set it down for whites meditative perusal    4   but to the enthusiasm of the young dreams have something of the substance of reality and realities something of the magic of dreams the london to which benham came from cambridge and the disquisitions of prothero was not the london of a mature and disillusioned vision it was london seen magnified and distorted through the young mans crystalline intentions it had for him a quality of multitudinous unquenchable activity himself filled with an immense appetite for life he was unable to conceive of london as fatigued he could not suspect these statesmen he now began to meet and watch of jaded wills and petty spites he imagined that all the important and influential persons in this large world of affairs were as frank in their private lives and as unembarrassed in their financial relationships as his untainted self and he had still to reckon with stupidity he believed in the statecraft of leaderwriters and the sincerity of political programmes and so regarded what an avenue to empire was whitehall how momentous was the sunrise in st jamess park and how significant the clustering knot of listeners and speakers beneath the tall column that lifts our nelson to the windy sky  for a time benham was in love with the idea of london he got maps of london and books about london he made plans to explore its various regions he tried to grasp it all from the conscious picturesqueness of its garden suburbs to the factories of croydon from the clerkvilladoms of ealing to the inky streams of bow in those days there were passenger steamboats that would take one from the meadows of hampton court past the whole spectacle of london out to the shipping at greenwich and the towed liners the incessant tugs the heaving portals of the sea his time was far too occupied for him to carry out a tithe of these expeditions he had planned but he had many walks that bristled with impressions northward and southward eastward and westward a dreaming young man could wander into a wilderness of population polite or sombre poor rich or middleclass but all ceaselessly active all urgently pressing as it seemed to their part in the drama of the coming years he loved the late afternoon when every artery is injected and gorged with the multitudinous homegoing of the daily workers he loved the time of lighting up and the clustering excitements of the late hours and he went out southward and eastward into gaunt regions of reeking toil as yet he knew nothing of the realities of industrialism he saw only the beauty of the great chimneys that rose against the sullen smokebarred sunsets and he felt only the romance of the lurid shuddering flares that burst out from squat stacks of brickwork and lit the emptiness of strange and slovenly streets  and this london was only the foreground of the great scene upon which he as a prosperous wellbefriended young englishman was free to play whatever part he could this narrow turbid tidal river by which he walked ran out under the bridges eastward beneath the greyblue clouds towards germany towards russia and towards asia which still seemed in those days so largely the englishmans asia and when you turned about at blackfriars bridge this sense of the round world was so upon you that you faced not merely westminster but the icy atlantic and america which one could yet fancy was a land of englishmenenglishmen a little estranged at any rate they assimilated they kept the tongue the shipping in the lower reaches below the tower there carried the flags of every country under the sky as he went along the riverside he met a group of dusky students chinese or japanese cambridge had abounded in indians and beneath that tall clock tower at westminster it seemed as though the world might centre the background of the englishmans world reached indeed to either pole it went about the earth his background it wasfor all that he was capable of doing all this had awaited him  is it any wonder if a young man with an excitable imagination came at times to the pitch of audible threats if the extreme indulgence of his opportunity and his sense of ability and vigour lifted his vanity at moments to the kingly pitch if he ejaculated and made a gesture or so as he went along the embankment    5   in the disquisition upon choice that opened benhams paper on aristocracy he showed himself momentarily wiser than his daydreams for in these daydreams he did seem to himself to be choosing among unlimited possibilities yet while he dreamt other influences were directing his movements there were for instance his mother lady marayne who saw a very different london from what he did and his mother dame nature who cannot see london at all she was busy in his blood as she is busy in the blood of most healthy young men common experience must fill the gaps for us and patiently and thoroughly she was preparing for the entrance of that heroine whom not the most selfcentred of heroes can altogether avoid  and then there was the power of every day benham imagined himself at large on his liberating steed of property while indeed he was mounted on the made horse of civilization while he was speculating whither he should go he was already starting out upon the round one hesitates upon the magnificent plan and devotion of ones lifetime and meanwhile there is usage there are engagements every morning came merkle the embodiment of the established routine the herald of all that the world expected and required benham to be and do usually he awakened benham with the opening of his door and the soft tinkle of the curtain rings as he let in the morning light he moved softly about the room gathering up and removing the crumpled hulls of yesterday that done he reappeared at the bedside with a cup of admirable tea and one thin slice of breadandbutter reported on the days weather stood deferential for instructions you will be going out for lunch sir very good sir white slips of course sir you will go down into the country in the afternoon will that be the serge suit sir or the brown  these matters settled the new aristocrat could yawn and stretch like any aristocrat under the old dispensation and then as the sound of running water from the bathroom ceased stick his toes out of bed  the day was tremendously indicated worldstates and aristocracies of steel and fire things that were as real as coalscuttles in billys rooms away there at cambridge were now remoter than sirius  he was expected to shave expected to bath expected to go in to the bright warmth and white linen and silver and china of his breakfasttable and there he found letters and invitations loaded with expectation and beyond the coffeepot neatly folded lay the times and the daily news and the telegraph all with an air of requiring his attention there had been more fighting in thibet and mr ritchie had made a free trade speech at croydon the japanese had torpedoed another russian ironclad and a british cruiser was ashore in the east indies a man had been found murdered in an empty house in hoxton and the king had had a conversation with general booth tadpole was in for north winchelsea beating taper by nine votes and there had been a new cut in the atlantic passenger rates he was expected to be interested and excited by these things  presently the telephone bell would ring and he would hear the clear little voice of his mother full of imperative expectations he would be round for lunch yes he would be round to lunch and the afternoon had he arranged to do anything with his afternoon noput off chexington until tomorrow there was this new pianist it was really an experience and one might not get tickets again and then tea at pantons it was rather fun at pantons ohweston massinghay was coming to lunch he was a useful man to know so clever so long my dear little son till i see you  so life puts out its merkle threads as the poacher puts his hair noose about the pheasants neck and while we theorize takes hold of us  it came presently home to benham that he had been down from cambridge for ten months and that he was still not a step forward with the realization of the new aristocracy his political career waited he had done a quantity of things but their net effect was incoherence he had not been merely passive but his efforts to break away into creative realities had added to rather than diminished his accumulating sense of futility  the natural development of his position under the influence of lady marayne had enormously enlarged the circle of his acquaintances he had taken part in all sorts of social occasions and sat and listened to a representative selection of political and literary and social personages he had been several times to the opera and to a great number and variety of plays he had been attentively inconspicuous in several really good weekend parties he had spent a golden october in north italy with his mother and escaped from the glowing lassitude of venice for some days of climbing in the eastern alps in january in an outbreak of enquiry he had gone with lionel maxim to st petersburg and had eaten zakuska brightened his eyes with vodka talked with a number of charming people of the war that was then imminent listened to gipsy singers until dawn careered in sledges about the most silent and stately of capitals and returned with lionel discoursing upon autocracy and assassination japan the russian destiny and the government of peter the great that excursion was the most after his heart of all the dispersed employments of his first year through the rest of the winter he kept himself very fit and still further qualified that nervous dislike for the horse that he had acquired from prothero by hunting once a week in essex he was incurably a bad horseman he rode without sympathy he was unready and convulsive at hedges and ditches and he judged distances badly his white face and rigid seat and a certain joylessness of bearing in the saddle earned him the singular nickname which never reached his ears of the galvanized corpse he got through however at the cost of four quite trifling spills and without damaging either of the horses he rode and his physical selfrespect increased  on his writingdesk appeared a few sheets of manuscript that increased only very slowly he was trying to express his cambridge view of aristocracy in terms of finacue street west  the artistic and intellectual movements of london had made their various demands upon his time and energies art came to him with a noble assumption of his interest and an intention that presently became unpleasantly obvious to sell him pictures that he did not want to buy and explain away pictures that he did he bought one or two modern achievements and began to doubt if art and aristocracy had any necessary connection at first he had accepted the assumption that they had after all he reflected one lives rather for life and things than for pictures of life and things or pictures arising out of life and things this art had an air of saying something but when one came to grips with it what had it to say unless it was yah the drama and more particularly the intellectual drama challenged his attention in the hands of shaw barker masefield galsworthy and hankin it too had an air of saying something but he found it extremely difficult to join on to his own demands upon life anything whatever that the intellectual drama had the air of having said he would sit forward in the front row of the dresscircle with his cheek on his hand and his brow slightly knit his intentness amused observant people the drama that did not profess to be intellectual he went to with lady marayne and usually on first nights lady marayne loved a big first night at st jamess theatre or his majestys afterwards perhaps sir godfrey would join them at a supper party and all sorts of clever and amusing people would be there saying keen intimate things about each other he met yeats who told amusing stories about george moore and afterwards he met george moore who told amusing stories about yeats and it was all he felt great fun for the people who were in it but he was not in it and he had no very keen desire to be in it it wasnt his stuff he had though they were nowadays rather at the back of his mind quite other intentions in the meanwhile all these things took up his time and distracted his attention  there was as yet no practicable aviation to beguile a young man of spirit but there were times when benham found himself wondering whether there might not be something rather creditable in the possession and control of a motorcar of exceptional power only one might smash people up should an aristocrat be deterred by the fear of smashing people up if it is a selfish fear of smashing people up if it is nerves rather than pity at any rate it did not come to the car    6   among other things that delayed benham very greatly in the development of his aristocratic experiments was the advice that was coming to him from every quarter it came in extraordinary variety and volume but always it had one unvarying feature it ignored and tacitly contradicted his private intentions  we are all of us disposed to be propagandists of our way of living and the spectacle of a wealthy young man quite at large is enough to excite the most temperate of us without distinction of age or sex if i were you came to be a familiar phrase in his ear this was particularly the case with political people and they did it not only from the natural infirmity of humanity but because when they seemed reluctant or satisfied with him as he was lady marayne egged them on  there was a general assumption that he was to go into parliament and most of his counsellors assumed further that on the whole his natural sympathies would take him into the conservative party but it was pointed out to him that just at present the liberal party was the party of a young mans opportunity sooner or later the swing of the pendulum which would weed the conservatives and proliferate liberals was bound to come there was always more demand and opportunity for candidates on the liberal side the tariff reformers were straining their ministerial majority to the splitting point and most of the old liberal leaders had died off during the years of exile the party was no longer dominated it would tolerate ideas a young man who took a distinctive lineprovided it was not from the party point of view a vexatious or impossible linemight go very rapidly far and high on the other hand it was urged upon him that the tariff reform adventure called also for youth and energy but there perhaps there was less scope for the distinctive lineand already they had garvin quite a number of benhams friends pointed out to him the value of working out some special aspect of our national political interests a very useful speciality was the balkans mr pope the wellknown publicist whose very sound and considerable reputation was based on the east purblow labour experiment met benham at lunch and proposed to go with him in a spirit of instructive association to the balkans rub up their greek together and settle the problem of albania he wanted he said a foreign speciality to balance his east purblow interest but lady beach mandarin warned benham against the balkans the balkans were getting to be too handy for easter and summer holidays and now that there were several good hotels in servia and montenegro and sofia they were being overdone everybody went to the balkans and came back with a pet nationality she loathed pet nationalities she believed most people loathed them nowadays it was stale it was gladstonian she was all for specialization in social reform she thought benham ought to join the fabian society and consult the webbs quite a number of able young men had been placed with the assistance of the webbs they were she said a perfect fount two other people independently of each other pointed out to benham the helpfulness of a few articles in the halfcrown monthlies  what are the assumptions underlying all this benham asked himself in a phase of lucidity  and after reflection good god the assumptions what do they think will satisfy me  everybody however did not point to parliament several people seemed to think travel with a large t was indicated one distant cousin of sir godfreys the kind of man of the world who has long moustaches was for big game shooting get right out of all this while you are young he said theres nothing to compare with stopping a charging lion at twenty yards ive done it my boy you can come back for all this powwow afterwards he gave the diplomatic service as a second choice there you are he said firstrate social position nothing to do theatres operas pretty women colour life the best of good times barring washington that is but washington they say isnt as bad as it used to besince teddy has europeanized em  even the reverend harold benham took a subdued but thoughtful share in his sons admonition he came up to the flatdue precautions were taken to prevent a painful encounterhe lunched at his sons new club and he was visibly oppressed by the contrast between the young mans youthful fortunes and his own as visibly he bore up bravely there are few men poff who would not envy you your opportunities he said you have the feast of life spread out at your feet i hope you have had yourself put up for the athenaeum they say it takes years when i was a young manand ambitiousi thought that some day i might belong to the athenaeum one has to learn    7   and with an effect of detachment just as though it didnt belong to the rest of him at all there was beginning a sort of backstairs and underside to benhams life there is no need to discuss how inevitable that may or may not be in the case of a young man of spirit and large means nor to embark upon the discussion of the temptations and opportunities of large cities several ladies of various positions and qualities had reflected upon his manifest need of education there was in particular mrs skelmersdale a very pretty little widow with hazel eyes black hair a mobile mouth and a pathetic history who talked of old music to him and took him to a dolmetsch concert in cliffords inn and expanded that common interest to a general participation in his indefinite outlook she advised him about his probable politicseverybody did thatbut when he broke through his usual reserve and suggested views of his own she was extraordinarily sympathetic she was so sympathetic and in such a caressing way that she created a temporary belief in her understanding and it was quite imperceptibly that he was drawn into the discussion of modern ethical problems she herself was a rather stimulating instance of modern ethical problems she told him something of her own story and then their common topics narrowed down very abruptly he found he could help her in several ways there is unhappily a disposition on the part of many people who ought to know better to regard a role played by joseph during his earlier days in egypt as a ridiculous one this point of view became very inopportunely dominant in benhams mind when he was lunching tete a tete with mrs skelmersdale at her flat  the ensuing intimacy was of an entirely concealed and respectable nature but a certain increased preoccupation in his manner set lady marayne thinking he had as a matter of fact been taken by surprise  still he perceived that it is no excuse for a man that he has been taken by surprise surprises in ones own conduct ought not to happen when they do happen then an aristocrat ought to stick to what he had done he was now in a subtle and complicated relationship to mrs skelmersdale a relationship in which her pride had become suddenly a matter of tremendous importance once he had launched himself upon this affair it was clear to him that he owed it to her never to humiliate her and to go back upon himself now would be a tremendous humiliation for her you see he had helped her a little financially and she looked to him she wanted him  she wasnt he knew altogether respectable indeed poor dear her ethical problems already a little worn made her seem at times anything but respectable he had met her first one evening at jimmy glucksteins when he was forming his opinion of art her manifest want of interest in pictures had attracted him and that had led to music and to the mention of a clementi piano that short gentle sad old little sort of piano people will insist upon calling a spinet in her flat  and so to this  it was very wonderful and delicious this first indulgence of sense  it was shabby and underhand  the great god pan is a glorious god and so was swinburne and what can compare with the warmth of blood and the sheen of sunlit limbs  but priapus  she was the most subtle delightful and tender of created beings  she had amazing streaks of vulgarity  and some astonishing friends  once she had seemed to lead the talk deliberately to money matters  she loved him and desired him there was no doubt of it  there was a curious effect about her as though when she went round the corner she would become somebody else and a curious recurrent feeling that round the corner there was somebody else  he had an extraordinary feeling that his mother knew about this business this feeling came from nothing in her words or acts but from some indefinable change in her eyes and bearing towards him but how could she know  it was unlikely that she and mrs skelmersdale would ever meet and it seemed to him that it would be a particularly offensive incident for them to meet  there were times now when life took on a grey and boring quality such as it had never had before he met mrs skelmersdale and the only remedy was to go to her she could restore his nervous tranquillity his feeling of solidity and reality his pride in himself for a time that is  nevertheless his mind was as a whole pervaded by the feeling that he ought not to have been taken by surprise  and he had the clearest conviction in his mind that if now he could be put back again to the day before that lunch  no he should not have gone there to lunch  he had gone there to see her clementi piano  had he or had he not thought beforehand of any other possibility  on a point so vital his memory was curiously unsure    8   the worry and disorganization of benhams life and thoughts increased as the spring advanced his need in some way to pull things together became overpowering he began to think of billy prothero more and more did it seem desirable to have a big talk with billy and place everything that had got disturbed benham thought of going to cambridge for a week of exhaustive evenings small engagements delayed that expedition  then came a day in april when all the world seemed wrong to benham he was irritable his will was unstable whatever presented itself to be done presented itself as undesirable he could settle to nothing he had been keeping away from mrs skelmersdale and in the morning there came a little note from her designed to correct this abstention she understood the art of the attractive note but he would not decide to go to her he left the note unanswered  then came his mother at the telephone and it became instantly certain to benham that he could not play the dutiful son that evening he answered her that he could not come to dinner he had engaged himself where  with some men  there was a pause and then his mothers voice came flattened by disappointment very well then little poff perhaps i shall see you tomorrow  he replaced the receiver and fretted back into his study where the notes on aristocracy lay upon his desk the notes he had been pretending to work over all the morning  damned liar he said and then dirty liar he decided to lunch at the club and in the afternoon he was moved to telephone an appointment with his siren and having done that he was bound to keep it  about one oclock in the morning he found himself walking back to finacue street he was no longer a fretful conflict of nerves but if anything he was less happy than he had been before it seemed to him that london was a desolate and inglorious growth  london ten years ago was much less nocturnal than it is now and not so brightly lit down the long streets came no traffic but an occasional hansom here and there a cat halted or bolted in the road near piccadilly a policeman hovered artfully in a doorway and then came a few belated prostitutes waylaying the passersby and a few youths and men wearily lust driven  as he turned up new bond street he saw a figure that struck him as familiar surelyit was billy prothero or at any rate it was astonishingly like billy prothero he glanced again and the likeness was more doubtful the man had his back to benham he was halting and looking back at a woman  by some queer flash of intuition it came to benham that even if this was not prothero still prothero did these things it might very well be prothero even though as he now saw it wasnt everybody did these things  it came into benhams head for the first time that life could be tiresome  this bond street was a tiresome place with its shops all shut and muffled its shops where in the crowded daytime one bought costly furniture costly clothes costly scent sweets bibelots pictures jewellery presents of all sorts clothes for mrs skelmersdale sweets for mrs skelmersdale presents for mrs skelmersdale all the elaborate fittings and equipage ofthat  good night dear a woman drifted by him  ive said good night he cried ive said good night and so went on to his flat the unquenchable demand the wearisome insatiability of sex when everything else has gone then it shows itself bare in the bleak small hours and at first it had seemed so light a matter he went to bed feeling dogtired he went to bed at an hour and with a finished completeness that merkle would have regarded as entirely becoming in a young gentleman of his position  and a little past three oclock in the morning he awoke to a mood of indescribable desolation he awoke with a start to an agony of remorse and selfreproach    9   for a time he lay quite still staring at the darkness then he groaned and turned over then suddenly like one who fancies he hears a strange noise he sat up in bed and listened oh god he said at last  and then oh the dirtiness of life the dirty muddle of life  what are we doing with life what are we all doing with life  it isnt only this poor milly business this only brings it to a head of course she wants money  his thoughts came on again  but the ugliness  why did i begin it  he put his hands upon his knees and pressed his eyes against the backs of his hands and so remained very still a blankness beneath his own question  after a long interval his mind moved again  and now it was as if he looked upon his whole existence he seemed to see in a large clear cold comprehensiveness all the wasted days the fruitless activities the futilities the perpetual postponements that had followed his coming to london he saw it all as a joyless indulgence as a confusion of playthings and undisciplined desires as a succession of days that began amiably and weakly that became steadily more crowded with ignoble and trivial occupations that had sunken now to indignity and uncleanness he was overwhelmed by that persuasion which only freshly soiled youth can feel in its extreme intensity that life was slipping away from him that the sands were running out that in a little while his existence would be irretrievably lost  by some trick of the imagination he saw life as an interminable bond street lit up by night lamps desolate full of rubbish full of the very best rubbish trappings temptations and down it all he drove as the damned drive wearily inexplicably  what are we up to with life what are we making of life  but hadnt he intended to make something tremendous of life hadnt he come to london trailing a glory  he began to remember it as a project it was the project of a great worldstate sustained by an aristocracy of noble men he was to have been one of those men too fine and farreaching for the dull manoeuvers of such politics as rule the world today the project seemed still large still whitely noble but now it was unlit and dead and in the foreground he sat in the flat of mrs skelmersdale feeling dissipated and fumbling with his white tie and she was looking tired god he said how did i get there  and then suddenly he reached out his arms in the darkness and prayed aloud to the silences  oh god give me back my visions give me back my visions  he could have imagined he heard a voice calling upon him to come out into life to escape from the body of this death but it was his own voice that called to him    10   the need for action became so urgent in him that he got right out of his bed and sat on the edge of it something had to be done at once he did not know what it was but he felt that there could be no more sleep no more rest no dressing nor eating nor going forth before he came to decisions christian before his pilgrimage began was not more certain of this need of flight from the life of routine and vanities  what was to be done  in the first place he must get away and think about it all think himself clear of all thesethese immediacies these associations and relations and holds and habits he must get back to his vision get back to the god in his vision and to do that he must go alone  he was clear he must go alone it was useless to go to prothero one weak man going to a weaker prothero he was convinced could help him not at all and the strange thing is that this conviction had come to him and had established itself incontestably because of that figure at the street corner which had for just one moment resembled prothero by some fantastic intuition benham knew that prothero would not only participate but excuse and he knew that he himself could endure no excuses he must cut clear of any possibility of qualification this thing had to be stopped he must get away he must get free he must get clean in the extravagance of his reaction benham felt that he could endure nothing but solitary places and to sleep under the open sky  he wanted to get right away from london and everybody and lie in the quiet darkness and stare up at the stars  his plans grew so definite that presently he was in his dressinggown and turning out the maps in the lower drawer of his study bureau he would go down into surrey with a knapsack wander along the north downs until the guildford gap was reached strike across the weald country to the south downs and then beat eastward the very thought of it brought a coolness to his mind he knew that over those southern hills one could be as lonely as in the wilderness and as free to talk to god and there he would settle something he would make a plan for his life and end this torment  when merkle came in to him in the morning he was fast asleep  the familiar curtain rings awakened benham he turned his head over stared for a moment and then remembered  merkle he said i am going for a walking tour i am going off this morning havent i a rucksack  you ave a sort of canvas bag sir with pockets to it said merkle will you be needing the very eavy boots with obnailsswiss i fancy siror your ordinary shooting boots  and when may i expect you back sir asked merkle as the moment for departure drew near  god knows said benham i dont  then will there be any address for forwarding letters sir  benham hadnt thought of that for a moment he regarded merkles scrupulous respect with a transient perplexity  ill let you know merkle he said ill let you know  for some days at least notes telephone messages engagements all this fuss and clamour about nothing should clamour for him in vain    11   but how closely cried white in a mood of cultivated enthusiasm how closely must all the poor little stories that we tell today follow in the footsteps of the great exemplars a little while ago and the springtime freshness of tobias irradiated the page now see it is christian  indeed it looked extremely like christian as benham went up across the springy turf from epsom downs station towards the crest of the hill was he not also fleeing in the morning sunlight from the city of destruction was he not also seeking that better city whose name is peace and there was a bundle on his back it was the bundle i think that seized most firmly upon the too literary imagination of white  but the analogy of the bundle was a superficial one benham had not the slightest desire to lose it from his shoulders it would have inconvenienced him very greatly if he had done so it did not contain his sins our sins nowadays are not so easily separated it contained a light warm capecoat he had bought in switzerland and which he intended to wrap about him when he slept under the stars and in addition merkle had packed it with his silk pyjamas an extra pair of stockings toothbrush brush and comb a safety razor and there were several sheets of the ordnance map    12   the urgency of getting away from something dominated benham to the exclusion of any thought of what he might be getting to that muddle of his london life had to be left behind first escape  over the downs great numbers of larks were singing it was warm april that year and early all the cloud stuff in the sky was gathered into great towering slowsailing masses and the rest was blue of the intensest the air was so clean that benham felt it clean in the substance of his body the chestnuts down the hill to the right were flowering the beeches were luminously green and the oaks in the valley foaming gold and sometimes it was one lark filled his ears and sometimes he seemed to be hearing all the larks for miles about him presently over the crest he would be out of sight of the grand stand and the men exercising horses and that brace of redjacketed golfers  what was he to do  for a time he could think of nothing to do except to keep up and out of the valley his whole being seemed to have come to his surfaces to look out at the budding of the year and hear the noise of the birds and then he got into a long road from which he had to escape and trespassing southward through plantations he reached the steep edge of the hills and sat down over above a great chalk pit somewhere near dorking and surveyed all the tumbled wooded spaces of the weald it is after all not so great a country this sussex nor so hilly from deepest valley to highest crest is not six hundred feet yet what a greatness of effect it can achieve there is something in those downland views which like sea views lifts a mind out to the skies all england it seemed was there to benhams vision and the purpose of the english and his own purpose in the world for a long time he surveyed the large delicacy of the detail before him the crests the treeprotected houses the fields and farmsteads the distant gleams of water and then he became interested in the men who were working in the chalk pit down below  they at any rate were not troubled with the problem of what to do with their lives    13   benham found his mind was now running clear and so abundantly that he could scarcely he felt keep pace with it as he thought his flow of ideas was tinged with a fear that he might forget what he was thinking in an instant for the first time in his mental existence he could have imagined he had discovered labour and seen it plain a little while ago and he had seemed a lonely man among the hills but indeed he was not lonely these men had been with him all the time and he was free to wander to sit here to think and choose simply because those men down there were not free he was spending their leisure not once but many times with prothero had he used the phrase richesse oblige now he remembered it he began to remember a mass of ideas that had been overlaid and stifling within him this was what merkle and the club servants and the entertainments and engagements and his mother and the artistic touts and the theatrical touts and the hunting and the elaboration of games andmrs skelmersdale and all that had clustered thickly round him in london had been hiding from him those men below there had not been trusted to choose their work they had been given it and he had been trusted  and now to grapple with it now to get it clear what work was he going to do that settled he would deal with his distractions readily enough until that was settled he was lax and exposed to every passing breeze of invitation  what work am i going to do what work am i going to do he repeated it  it is the only question for the aristocrat what amusement that for a footman on holiday that for a silly child for any creature that is kept or led or driven that perhaps for a tired invalid for a toiler worked to a rag but ablebodied amusement the arms of mrs skelmersdale were no worse than the solemn aimlessness of hunting and an evening of dalliance not an atom more reprehensible than an evening of chatter it was the waste of him that made the sin his life in london had been of a piece together it was well that his intrigue had set a light on it put a point to it given him this saving crisis of the nerves that indeed is the chief superiority of idle lovemaking over other more prevalent forms of idleness and selfindulgence it does at least bear its proper label it is reprehensible it brings your careless honour to the challenge of concealment and shabby evasions and lies  but in this pellucid air things took their proper proportions again  and now what was he to do  politics he said aloud to the turf and the sky  is there any other work for an aristocratic man science one could admit science in that larger sense that sweeps in history or philosophy beyond that whatever work there is is work for which men are paid art art is nothing aristocratic except when it is a means of scientific or philosophical expression art that does not argue nor demonstrate nor discover is merely the craftsmans impudence  he pulled up at this and reflected for a time with some distinguished instances in his mind they were so distinguished so dignified they took their various arts with so admirable a gravity that the soul of this young man recoiled from the verdicts to which his reasoning drove him its not for me to judge them he decided except in relation to myself for them there may be tremendous significances in art but if these do not appear to me then so far as i am concerned they do not exist for me they are not in my world so far as they attempt to invade me and control my attitudes or my outlook or to judge me in any way there is no question of their impudence impudence is the word for it my world is real i want to be really aristocratic really brave really paying for the privilege of not being a driven worker the things the artist makes are like the things my private dreamartist makes relaxing distracting what can art at its greatest be pure art that is but a more splendid more permanent transmissible reverie the very essence of what i am after is not to be an artist  after a large and serious movement through his mind he came back to science philosophy or politics as the sole three justifications for the usurpation of leisure  so far as devotion to science went he knew he had no specific aptitude for any departmentalized subject and equally he felt no natural call to philosophy he was left with politics  or else why shouldnt i go down there and pick up a shovel and set to work to make leisure for my betters  and now it was that he could take up the real trouble that more than anything else had been keeping him ineffective and the prey of every chance demand and temptation during the last ten months he had not been able to get himself into politics and the reason why he had not been able to do so was that he could not induce himself to fit in statecraft was a remote and faded thing in the political life of the time politics was a choice of two sides in a game and either side he found equally unattractive since he had come down from cambridge the tariff reform people had gone far to capture the conservative party there was little chance of a candidature for him without an adhesion to that and he could find nothing he could imagine himself working for in the declarations of the tariff reform people he distrusted them he disliked them they took all the light and pride out of imperialism they reduced it to a shabby conspiracy of the british and their colonies against foreign industrialism they were violent for armaments and hostile to education they could give him no assurance of any scheme of growth and unification and no guarantees against the manifest dangers of economic disturbance and political corruption a tariff involves imperialism without noble imaginations it seemed to him was simply nationalism with megalomania it was swaggering it was greed it was german its enthusiasm was forced its nobility a vulgar lie no and when he turned to the opposite party he found little that was more attractive they were prepared it seemed if they came into office to pull the legislature of the british isles to pieces in obedience to the irish demand for home rule and they were totally unprepared with any scheme for doing this that had even a chance of success in the twenty years that had elapsed since gladstones hasty and disastrous essay in political surgery they had studied nothing learnt nothing produced no ideas whatever in the matter they had not had the time they had just negotiated like the mere politicians they were for the nationalist vote they seemed to hope that by a marvel god would pacify ulster lord dunraven plunkett were voices crying in the wilderness the sides in the party game would as soon have heeded a poet but unless benham was prepared to subscribe either to home rule or tariff reform there was no way whatever open to him into public life he had had some decisive conversations he had no illusions left upon that score  here was the real barrier that had kept him inactive for ten months here was the problem he had to solve this was how he had been left out of active things a prey to distractions excitements idle temptationsand mrs skelmersdale  running away to shoot big game or explore wildernesses was no remedy that was just running away aristocrats do not run away what of his debt to those men down there in the quarry what of his debt to the unseen men in the mines away in the north what of his debt to the stokers on the liners and to the clerks in the city he reiterated the cardinal article of his creed the aristocrat is a privileged man in order that he may be a public and political man  but how is one to be a political man when one is not in politics  benham frowned at the weald his ideas were running thin  he might hammer at politics from the outside and then again how he would make a list of all the things that he might do for example he might write he rested one hand on his knee and lifted one finger and regarded it could he write there were one or two men who ran papers and seemed to have a sort of independent influence strachey for example with his spectator maxse with his national review but they were grown up they had formed their ideas he had to learn first  he lifted a second finger how to learn for it was learning that he had to do  when one comes down from oxford or cambridge one falls into the mistake of thinking that learning is over and action must begin but until one perceives clearly just where one stands action is impossible  how is one with no experience of affairs to get an experience of affairs when the door of affairs is closed to one by ones own convictions outside of affairs how can one escape being flimsy how can one escape becoming merely an intellectual like those wordy fabians those writers poseurs and sham publicists whose wrangles he had attended and moreover there is danger in the leisure of your intellectual one cannot be always reading and thinking and discussing and inquiring would it not be better after all to make a concession swallow home rule or tariff reform and so at least get his hands on things  and then in a little while the party conflict would swallow him up  still it would engage him it would hold him if perhaps he did not let it swallow him up if he worked with an eye open for opportunities of selfassertion  the party game had not altogether swallowed mr arthur  but every one is not a balfour  he reflected profoundly on his left knee his left hand rested with two fingers held up by some rapid mental alchemy these fingers had now become home rule and tariff reform his right hand which had hitherto taken no part in the controversy had raised its index finger by imperceptible degrees it had been raised almost subconsciously and by still obscurer processes this finger had become mrs skelmersdale he recognized her sudden reappearance above the threshold of consciousness with mild surprise he had almost forgotten her share in these problems he had supposed her dismissed to an entirely subordinate position  then he perceived that the workmen in the chalk pit far below had knocked off and were engaged upon their midday meal he understood why his mind was no longer moving forward with any alacrity  food  the question where he should eat arose abruptly and dismissed all other problems from his mind he unfolded a map here must be the chalk pit here was dorking that village was brockham green should he go down to dorking or this way over box hill to the little inn at burford bridge he would try the latter    14   the april sunset found our young man talking to himself for greater emphasis and wandering along a turfy carttrack through a wilderness mysteriously planted with great bushes of rhododendra on the downs above shere he had eaten a belated lunch at burford bridge he had got some tea at a little inn near a church with a splendid yew tree and for the rest of the time he had wandered and thought he had travelled perhaps a dozen or fifteen miles and a good way from his first meditations above the dorking chalk pit  he had recovered long ago from that remarkable conception of an active if dishonest political career as a means of escaping mrs skelmersdale and all that mrs skelmersdale symbolized that would be just louting from one bad thing to another he had to settle mrs skelmersdale clean and right and he had to do as exquisitely right in politics as he could devise if the public life of the country had got itself into a stupid antagonism of two undesirable things the only course for a sane man of honour was to stand out from the parties and try and get them back to sound issues again there must be endless people of a mind with himself in this matter and even if there were not if he was the only man in the world he still had to follow his lights and do the right and his business was to find out the right  he came back from these imaginative excursions into contemporary politics with one idea confirmed in his mind an idea that had been indeed already in his mind during his cambridge days this was the idea of working out for himself thoroughly and completely a political scheme a theory of his work and duty in the world a plan of the worlds future that should give a rule for his life the research magnificent was emerging it was an alarmingly vast proposal but he could see no alternative but submission a plebeians submission to the currents of life about him  little pictures began to flit before his imagination of the way in which he might build up this tremendous inquiry he would begin by hunting up people everybody who seemed to have ideas and promise ideas he would get at he would travel farand exhaustively he would so soon as the ideas seemed to indicate it hunt out facts he would learn how the world was governed he would learn how it did its thinking he would live sparingly not too sparingly something interpolated he would work ten or twelve hours a day such a course of investigation must pass almost of its own accord into action and realization he need not trouble now how it would bring him into politics inevitably somewhere it would bring him into politics and he would travel almost at once he would travel it is the manifest duty of every young aristocrat to travel here he was ruling india at any rate passively through the mere fact of being english he was ruling india and he knew nothing of india he knew nothing indeed of asia so soon as he returned to london his preparations for this travel must begin he must plot out the men to whom he would go and so contrive that also he would go round the world perhaps he would get lionel maxim to go with him or if maxim could not come then possibly prothero some one surely could be found some one thinking and talking of statecraft and the larger idea of life all the world is not swallowed up in every day    15   his mind shifted very suddenly from these large proposals to an entirely different theme these mental landslips are not unusual when men are thinking hard and wandering he found himself holding a trial upon himself for presumptuousness for setting himself up against the wisdom of the ages and the decisions of all the established men in the world for being in short a presumptuous sort of ass he was judge and jury and prosecutor but rather inexplicably the defence was conducted in an irregular and undignified way by some inferior stratum of his being  at first the defence contented itself with arguments that did at least aim to rebut the indictment the decisions of all the established men in the world were notoriously in conflict however great was the gross wisdom of the ages the net wisdom was remarkably small was it after all so very immodest to believe that the liberals were right in what they said about tariff reform and the tories right in their criticism of home rule  and then suddenly the defence threw aside its mask and insisted that benham had to take this presumptuous line because there was no other tolerable line possible for him  better die with the excelsior chap up the mountains the defence interjected  than what  consider the quality benham had already betrayed he was manifestly incapable of a decent modest mediocre existence already he had ceased to beif one may use so fine a word for genteel abstinencevirtuous he didnt ride well he hadnt good hands and he hadnt good hands for life he must go hard and harsh high or low he was a man who needed bite in his life he was exceptionally capable of boredom he had been bored by london social occasions irritated him several times he had come near to gross incivilities art annoyed him sport was an effort wholesome perhaps but unattractive music he loved but it excited him the defendant broke the sunset calm by uttering amazing and improper phrases  i cant smug about in a state of falsified righteousness like these crampton chaps  i shall roll in women i shall rollick in women if that is i stay in london with nothing more to do than i have had this year past  ive been sliding fast to it  no im damned if i do    16   for some time he had been bothered by a sense of something something else awaiting his attention now it came swimming up into his consciousness he had forgotten he was of course going to sleep out under the stars  he had settled that overnight that was why he had this cloak in his rucksack but he had settled none of the details now he must find some place where he could lie down here perhaps in this strange forgotten wilderness of rhododendra  he turned off from the track and wandered among the bushes one might lie down anywhere here but not yet it was as yet barely twilight he consulted his watch halfpast seven  nearly dinnertime  no doubt christian during the earlier stages of his pilgrimage noticed the recurrence of the old familiar hours of his life of emptiness and vanity or rather of vanitysimply why drag in the thought of emptiness just at this point  it was very early to go to bed  he might perhaps sit and think for a time here for example was a mossy bank a seat and presently a bed so far there were only three stars visible but more would come he dropped into a reclining attitude damp  when one thinks of sleeping out under the stars one is apt to forget the dew  he spread his swiss cloak out on the soft thick carpeting of herbs and moss and arranged his knapsack as a pillow here he would lie and recapitulate the thoughts of the day that squealing might be a young fox at the club at present men would be sitting about holding themselves back from dinner excellent the clear soup always was at the club then perhaps a chateaubriand thatwhat was that soft and large and quite near and noiseless an owl  the damp feeling was coming through his cloak and this april night air had a knife edge early ice coming down the atlantic perhaps it was wonderful to be here on the top of the round world and feel the icebergs away there or did this wind come from russia he wasnt quite clear just how he was oriented he had turned about so much which was east anyhow it was an extremely cold wind  what had he been thinking suppose after all that ending with mrs skelmersdale was simply a beginning so far he had never looked sex in the face  he sat up and sneezed violently  it would be ridiculous to start out seeking the clue to ones life and be driven home by rheumatic fever one should not therefore incur the risk of rheumatic fever  something squealed in the bushes  it was impossible to collect ones thoughts in this place he stood up the night was going to be bitterly cold savagely cruelly cold  no there was no thinking to be done here no thinking at all he would go on along the track and presently he would strike a road and so come to an inn one can solve no problems when one is engaged in a struggle with the elements the thing to do now was to find that track again  it took benham two hours of stumbling and walking with a little fence climbing and some barbed wire thrown in before he got down into shere to the shelter of a friendly little inn and then he negotiated a satisfying meal with beefsteak as its central fact and stipulated for a fire in his bedroom  the landlord was a pleasantfaced man he attended to benham himself and displayed a fine sense of comfort he could produce wine a halfbottle of australian hock big tree brand no 8 a virile wine he thought of sardines to precede the meal he provided a substantial welsh rarebit by way of a savoury he did not mind in the least that it was nearly ten oclock he ended by suggesting coffee and a liqueur  benham had some benedictine  one could not slight such sympathetic helpfulness the benedictine was genuine and then came the coffee  the cup of coffee was generously conceived and honestly made  a night of clear melancholy ensued    17   hitherto benham had not faced in any detail the problem of how to break with mrs skelmersdale now he faced it pessimistically she would he knew be difficult to break with he ought never to have gone there to lunch there would be something ridiculous in breaking off in all sorts of ways she might resist and face to face with her he might find himself a man divided against himself that opened preposterous possibilities on the other hand it was out of the question to do the business by letter a letter hits too hard it lies too heavy on the wound it has made and in money matters he could be generous he must be generous at least financial worries need not complicate her distresses of desertion but to suggest such generosities on paper in cold ink would be outrageous and in briefhe ought not to have gone there to lunch after that he began composing letters at a great rate delicateexplanatory was it on the whole best to be explanatory  it was going to be a tremendous job this breaking with her and it had begun so easily  there was he remembered with amazing vividness a little hollow he had found under her ear and how when he kissed her there it always made her forget her worries and ethical problems for a time and turn to him  no he said grimly it must end and rolled over and stared at the black  like an insidious pedlar that old rascal whom young literary gentlemen call the great god pan began to spread his wares in the young mans memory  after long and feverish wanderings of the mind and some talking to himself and walking about the room he did at last get a little away from mrs skelmersdale  he perceived that when he came to tell his mother about this journey around the world there would be great difficulties she would object very strongly and if that did not do then she would become extremely abusive compare him to his father cry bitterly and banish him suddenly and heartbrokenly from her presence for ever she had done that twice alreadyonce about going to the opera instead of listening to a lecture on indian ethnology and once about a weekend in kent he hated hurting his mother and he was beginning to know now how easily she was hurt it is an abominable thing to hurt ones motherwhether one has a justification or whether one hasnt  recoiling from this he was at once resumed by mrs skelmersdale who had in fact an effect of really never having been out of the room but now he became penitent about her his penitence expanded until it was on a nightmare scale at last it blotted out the heavens he felt like one of those unfortunate victims of religious mania who are convinced they have committed the sin against the holy ghost why had he gone there to lunch that was the key to it why had he gone there to lunch he began to have remorse for everything for everything he had ever done for everything he had ever not done for everything in the world in a moment of lucidity he even had remorse for drinking that stout honest cup of black coffee  and so on and so on and so on  when daylight came it found benham still wide awake things crept mournfully out of the darkness into a reproachful clearness the sound of birds that had been so delightful on the yesterday was now no longer agreeable the thrushes he thought repeated themselves a great deal  he fell asleep as it seemed only a few minutes before the landlord accompanied by a great smell of frying bacon came to call him    18   the second day opened rather dully for benham there was not an idea left in his head about anything in the world it wassolid he walked through bramley and godalming and witley and so came out upon the purple waste of hindhead he strayed away from the road and found a sunny place of turf amidst the heather and lay down and slept for an hour or so he arose refreshed he got some food at the huts inn on the hindhead crest and went on across sunlit heathery wildernesses variegated by patches of spruce and fir and silver birch and then suddenly his mental inanition was at an end and his thoughts were wide and brave again he was astonished that for a moment he could have forgotten that he was vowed to the splendid life  continence by preoccupation he tried the phrase  a man must not give in to fear neither must he give in to sex its the same thing really the misleading of instinct  this set the key of his thought throughout the afternoonuntil amanda happened to him     chapter the third  amanda    1   amanda happened to benham very suddenly  from haslemere he had gone on to further heaths and gorse beyond liphook and thence he had wandered into a pretty district beset with hartings he had found himself upon a sandy ridge looking very beautifully into a sudden steep valley that he learnt was harting coombe he had been through a west harting and a south harting and read fingerposts pointing to others of the clan and in the evening at the foot of a steep hill where two roads met he sat down to consider whether he should go back and spend the night in one of the two kindlylooking inns of the latter place or push on over the south downs towards the unknown luck of singleton or chichester as he sat down two big retrievers black and brown came headlong down the road the black carried a stick the brown disputed and pursued as they came abreast of him the foremost a little relaxed his hold the pursuer grabbed at it and in an instant the rivalry had flared to rage and a firstclass dogfight was in progress  benham detested dogfights he stood up pale and distressed lie down he cried shut up you brutes and was at a loss for further action  then it was amanda leapt into his world a light tall figure of a girl fluttering a short petticoat hatless she was brown flushed and her dark hair tossing loose and in a moment she had the snarling furious dogs apart each gripped firmly by its collar then with a wriggle black was loose and had closed again inspired by the best traditions of chivalry benham came to her assistance he was not expert with dogs he grasped the black dog under its ear he was bitten in the wrist rather in excitement than malice and with a certain excess of zeal he was strangling the brute before you could count ten  amanda seized the fallen stick and whacked the dog she held reasonably but effectively until its yelps satisfied her there she said pitching her victim from her and stood erect again she surveyed the proceedings of her helper for the first time  you neednt she said choke sultan anymore  ugh she said as though that was enough for sultan and peace was restored  im obliged to you but i say he didnt bite you did he oh sultan  sultan tried to express his disgust at the affair rotten business when a fellow is fighting one cant be meticulous and if people come interfering stillsorry so sultan by his code of eye and tail  may i see something ought to be done to this  she took his wrist in her hand and her cheek and eyelashes came within a foot of his face  some observant element in his composition guessed and guessed quite accurately that she was nineteen    2   she had an eyebrow like a quick stroke of a camelshair brush she had a glowing face half childish imp half woman she had honest hazel eyes a voice all music a manifest decision of character and he must have this bite seen to at once she lived not five minutes away he must come with her  she had an aunt who behaved like a mother and a mother who behaved like a genteel visitor and they both agreed with amanda that although mr walter long and his dreadful muzzles and everything did seem to have stamped out rabies yet you couldnt be too careful with a dog bite a dog bite might be injurious in all sorts of waysparticularly sultans bite he was they had to confess a dog without refinement a coarseminded omnivorous dog both the elder ladies insisted upon regarding benhams wound as clear evidence of some gallant rescue of amanda from imminent dangershes always so reckless with those dogs as though amanda was not manifestly capable of taking care of herself and when he had been listerined and bandaged they would have it that he should join them at their supperdinner which was already prepared and waiting they treated him as if he were still an undergraduate they took his arrangements in hand as though he was a favourite nephew he must stay in harting that night both the ship and the coach and horses were excellent inns and over the downs there would be nothing for miles and miles  the house was a little long house with a verandah and a garden in front of it with flintedged paths the room in which they sat and ate was long and low and equipped with pieces of misfitting good furniture an accidentallooking gilt tarnished mirror and a sprinkling of old and middleaged books some one had lit a fire which cracked and spurted about cheerfully in a motherly fireplace and a lamp and some candles got lit mrs wilder amandas aunt a comfortable dark broadbrowed woman directed things and sat at the end of the table and placed benham on her right hand between herself and amanda amandas mother remained undeveloped a watchful little woman with at least an eyebrow like her daughters her name it seemed was morris no servant appeared but two cousins of a vague dark picturesqueness and with a stamp of thirty upon them the first young women benham had ever seen dressed in djibbahs sat at the table or moved about and attended to the simple needs of the service the reconciled dogs were in the room and shifted inquiring noses from one human being to another  amandas people were so easy and intelligent and friendly and benham after his thirty hours of silence so freshly ready for human association that in a very little while he could have imagined he had known and trusted this household for years he had never met such people before and yet there was something about them that seemed familiarand then it occurred to him that something of their easygoing freedom was to be found in russian novels a photographic enlargement of somebody with a vegetarian expression of face and a special kind of slouch hat gave the atmosphere a flavour of socialism and a press and tools and stamps and pigments on an oak table in the corner suggested some such socialistic art as bookbinding they were clearly advanced people and amanda was tremendously important to them she was their light their pride their most living thing they focussed on her when he talked to them all in general he talked to her in particular he felt that some introduction of himself was due to these welcoming people he tried to give it mixed with an itinerary and a sketch of his experiences he praised the heather country and harting coombe and the hartings he told them that london had suddenly become intolerablein the spring sunshine  you live in london said mrs wilder  yes and he had wanted to think things out in london one could do no thinking  here we do nothing else said amanda  except dogfights said the elder cousin  i thought i would just wander and think and sleep in the open air have you ever tried to sleep in the open air  in the summer we all do said the younger cousin amanda makes us we go out on to the little lawn at the back  you see amanda has some friends at limpsfield and there they all go out and camp and sleep in the woods  of course reflected mrs wilder in april it must be different  it is different said benham with feeling the night comes five hours too soon and it comes wet he described his experiences and his flight to shere and the kindly landlord and the cup of coffee and after that i thought with a vengeance  do you write things asked amanda abruptly and it seemed to him with a note of hope  no no it was just a private puzzle it was something i couldnt get straight  and you have got it straight asked amanda  i think so  you were making up your mind about something  amanda dear cried her mother  oh i dont mind telling you said benham  they seemed such unusual people that he was moved to unusual confidences they had that effect one gets at times with strangers freshly met as though they were not really in the world and there was something about amanda that made him want to explain himself to her completely  what i wanted to think about was what i should do with my life  havent you any work asked the elder cousin  none that im obliged to do  thats where a man has the advantage said amanda with the tone of profound reflection you can choose and what are you going to do with your life  amanda her mother protested really you mustnt  im going round the world to think about it benham told her  id give my soul to travel said amanda  she addressed her remark to the salad in front of her  but have you no ties asked mrs wilder  none that hold me said benham im one of those unfortunates who neednt do anything at all im independent you see my riddles east and west and north and south its all my way for the taking theres not an indication  if i were you said amanda and reflected then she half turned herself to him i should go first to india she said and i should shoot one two three yes three tigers and then i would see farukhabad sikrii was reading in a book about it yesterdaywhere the jungle grows in the palaces and then i would go right up the himalayas and then then i would have a walking tour in japan and then i would sail in a sailing ship down to borneo and java and set myself up as a ranee and then i would think what i would do next  all alone amanda asked mrs wilder  only when i shoot tigers you and mother should certainly come to japan  but mr benham perhaps doesnt intend to shoot tigers amanda said amandas mother  not at once my way will be a little different i think i shall go first through germany and then down to constantinople and then ive some idea of getting across asia minor and persia to india that would take some time one must ride  asia minor ought to be fun said amanda but i should prefer india because of the tigers it would be so jolly to begin with the tigers right away  it is the towns and governments and peoples i want to see rather than tigers said benham tigers if they are in the programme but i want to find out aboutother things  dont you think theres something to be found out at home said the elder cousin blushing very brightly and speaking with the effort of one who speaks for conscience sake  bettys a socialist amanda said to benham with a suspicion of apology  well were all rather that mrs wilder protested  if you are free if you are independent then dont you owe something to the workers betty went on getting graver and redder with each word  its just because of that said benham that i am going round the world    3   he was as free with these odd people as if he had been talking to prothero they werealert and he had been alone and silent and full of thinking for two clear days he tried to explain why he found socialism at once obvious and inadequate  presently the supper things got themselves put away and the talk moved into a smaller room with several armchairs and a fire mrs wilder and the cousins and amanda each smoked a cigarette as if it were symbolical and they were joined by a grave greybearded man with a hyphenated name and slightly socratic manner dressed in a very blue linen shirt and collar a very woolly mustardcoloured suit and loose tie and manifestly devoted to one of those branches of exemplary domestic decoration that grow upon socialist soil in england he joined betty in the opinion that the duty of a free and wealthy young man was to remain in england and give himself to democratic socialism and the abolition of profiteering consider that chair he said but benham had little feeling for the craftsmanship of chairs  under crossexamination mr rathbonesanders became entangled and prophetic it was evident he had never thought out his democratic he had rested in some vague tangle of idealism from which benham now set himself with the zeal of a specialist to rout him such an argument sprang up as one meets with rarely beyond the happy undergraduates range everybody lived in the discussion even amandas mother listened visibly betty said she herself was certainly democratic and mrs wilder had always thought herself to be so and outside the circle round the fire amanda hovered impatiently not quite sure of her side as yet but eager to come down with emphasis at the first flash of intimation  she came down vehemently on benhams  and being a very clearcutting personality with an instinct for the material rendering of things she also came and sat beside him on the little squarecornered sofa  of course mr rathbonesanders she said of course the world must belong to the people who dare of course people arent all alike and dull people as mr benham says and spiteful people and narrow people have no right to any voice at all in things    4   in saying this she did but echo benhams very words and all she said and did that evening was in quick response to benhams earnest expression of his views she found benham a delightful novelty she liked to argue because there was no other talk so lively and she had perhaps a lurking intellectual grudge against mr rathbonesanders that made her welcome an ally everything from her that night that even verges upon the notable has been told and yet it sufficed together with something in the clear long line of her limbs in her voice in her general physical quality to convince benham that she was the freest finest bravest spirit that he had ever encountered  in the papers he left behind him was to be found his perplexed endeavours to explain this mental leap that after all his efforts still remained unexplained he had been vividly impressed by the decision and courage of her treatment of the dogs it was just the sort of thing he could not do and there was a certain contagiousness in the petting admiration with which her family treated her but she was young and healthy and so was he and in a second mystery lies the key of the first he had fallen in love with her and that being so whatever he needed that instantly she was he needed a companion clean and brave and understanding  in his bed in the ship that night he thought of nothing but her before he went to sleep and when next morning he walked on his way over the south downs to chichester his mind was full of her image and of a hundred pleasant things about her in his confessions he wrote i felt there was a sword in her spirit i felt she was as clean as the wind  love is the most chastening of powers and he did not even remember now that two days before he had told the wind and the twilight that he would certainly roll and rollick in women unless there was work for him to do she had a peculiarly swift and easy stride that went with him in his thoughts along the turf by the wayside halfway and more to chichester he thought always of the two of them as being side by side his imagination became childishly romantic the open down about him with its scrub of thorn and yew became the wilderness of the world and through it they wentin armour weightless armourand they wore long swords there was a breeze blowing and larks were singing and something something dark and tortuous dashed suddenly in headlong flight from before their feet it was an ethical problem such as those mrs skelmersdale nursed in her bosom but at the sight of amanda it had straightened outand fled  and interweaving with such imaginings he was some day to record there were others she had brought back to his memory the fancies that had been aroused in his first reading of platos republic she made him think of those women guardians who were the friends and mates of men he wanted now to reread that book and the laws he could not remember if the guardians were done in the laws as well as in the republic he wished he had both these books in his rucksack but as he had not he decided he would hunt for them in chichester when would he see amanda again he would ask his mother to make the acquaintance of these very interesting people but as they did not come to london very much it might be some time before he had a chance of seeing her again and besides he was going to america and india the prospect of an exploration of the world was still noble and attractive but he realized it would stand very much in the way of his seeing more of amanda would it be a startling and unforgivable thing if presently he began to write to her girls of that age and spirit living in outoftheway villages have been known to marry  marriage didnt at this stage strike benham as an agreeable aspect of amandas possibilities it was an inconvenience his mind was running in the direction of pedestrian tours in armour of no particular weight amidst scenery of a romantic wildness  when he had gone to the house and taken his leave that morning it had seemed quite in the vein of the establishment that he should be received by amanda alone and taken up the long garden before anybody else appeared to see the daffodils and the early appletrees in blossom and the peartrees white and delicious  then he had taken his leave of them all and made his social tentatives did they ever come to london when they did they must let his people know he would so like them to know his mother lady marayne and so on with much gratitude  amanda had said that she and the dogs would come with him up the hill she had said it exactly as a boy might have said it she had brought him up to the corner of up park and had sat down there on a heap of stones and watched him until he was out of sight waving to him when he looked back come back again she had cried  in chichester he found a little greenbound republic in a secondhand bookshop near the cathedral but there was no copy of the laws to be found in the place then he was taken with the brilliant idea of sleeping the night in chichester and going back next day via harting to petersfield station and london he carried out this scheme and got to south harting neatly about four oclock in the afternoon he found mrs wilder and mrs morris and amanda and the dogs entertaining mr rathbonesanders at tea and they all seemed a little surprised and except mr rathbonesanders they all seemed pleased to see him again so soon his explanation of why he hadnt gone back to london from chichester struck him as a little unconvincing in the cold light of mr rathbonesanders eye but amanda was manifestly excited by his return and he told them his impressions of chichester and described the entertainment of the evening guest at a country inn and suddenly produced his copy of the republic i found this in a bookshop he said and i brought it for you because it describes one of the best dreams of aristocracy there has ever been dreamt  at first she praised it as a pretty book in the dearest little binding and then realized that there were deeper implications and became grave and said she would read it through and through she loved such speculative reading  she came to the door with the others and stayed at the door after they had gone in again when he looked back at the corner of the road to petersfield she was still at the door and waved farewell to him  he only saw a light slender figure but when she came back into the sittingroom mr rathbonesanders noted the faint flush in her cheek and an unwonted abstraction in her eye  and in the evening she tucked her feet up in the armchair by the lamp and read the republic very intently and very thoughtfully occasionally turning over a page    5   when benham got back to london he experienced an unwonted desire to perform his social obligations to the utmost  so soon as he had had some dinner at his club he wrote his south harting friends a most agreeable letter of thanks for their kindness to him in a little while he hoped he should see them again his mother too was most desirous to meet them that done he went on to his flat and to various aspects of life for which he was quite unprepared  but here we may note that amanda answered him her reply came some four days later it was written in a square schoolgirl hand it covered three sheets of notepaper and it was a very intelligent essay upon the republic of plato of course she wrote the guardians are inhuman but it was a glorious sort of inhumanity they had a spiritlike sharp knives cutting through life  it was her best bit of phrasing and it pleased benham very much but indeed it was not her own phrasing she had culled it from a disquisition into which she had led mr rathbonesanders and she had sent it to benham as she might have sent him a flower    6   benham reentered the flat from which he had fled so precipitately with three very definite plans in his mind the first was to set out upon his grand tour of the world with as little delay as possible to shut up this finacue street establishment for a long time and get rid of the souldestroying perfections of merkle the second was to end his illadvised intimacy with little mrs skelmersdale as generously and cheerfully as possible the third was to bring lady marayne into social relations with the wilder and morris menage at south harting it did not strike him that there was any incompatibility among these projects or any insurmountable difficulty in any of them until he was back in his flat  the accumulation of letters packages and telephone memoranda upon his desk included a number of notes and slips to remind him that both mrs skelmersdale and his mother were ladies of some determination even as he stood turning over the pile of documents the mechanical vehemence of the telephone filled him with a restored sense of the adverse will in things yes mam he heard merkles voice yes mam i will tell him mam will you keep possession mam and then in the doorway of the study mrs skelmersdale sir upon the telephone sir  benham reflected with various notes in his hand then he went to the telephone  you wicked boy where have you been hiding  ive been away i may have to go away again  not before you have seen me come round and tell me all about it  benham lied about an engagement  then tomorrow in the morning impossible  in the afternoon you dont want to see me benham did want to see her  come round and have a jolly little evening tomorrow night ive got some more of that harpsichord music and im dying to see you dont you understand  further lies look here said benham can you come and have a talk in kensington gardens you know the place near that chinese garden paddington gate  the ladys voice fell to flatness she agreed but why not come to see me here she asked  benham hung up the receiver abruptly  he walked slowly back to his study phew he whispered to himself it was like hitting her in the face he didnt want to be a brute but short of being a brute there was no way out for him from this entanglement why oh why the devil had he gone there to lunch  he resumed his examination of the waiting letters with a ruffled mind the most urgent thing about them was the clear evidence of gathering anger on the part of his mother he had missed a lunch party at sir godfreys on tuesday and a dinner engagement at philip magnets quite an important dinner in its way with various promising young liberals on wednesday evening and she was furious at this stupid mystery of course youre bound to be found out and of course there will be a scandal he perceived that this last note was written on his own paper merkle he cried sharply  yessir  merkle had been just outside on call  did my mother write any of these notes here he asked  two sir her ladyship was round here three times sir  did she see all these letters  not the telephone calls sir i ad put them on one side but its a little thing sir  he paused and came a step nearer you see sir he explained with the faintest flavour of the confidential softening his mechanical respect yesterday when er ladyship was ere sir some one rang up on the telephone  but you merkle  exactly sir but er ladyship said ill go to that merkle and just for a moment i couldnt exactly think ow i could manage it sir and there er ladyship was at the telephone what passed sir i couldnt ear i eard her say any message and i fancy sir i eard er say im the ousemaid but that sir i think must have been a mistake sir  must have been said benham certainlymust have been and the call you think came from  there again sir im quite in the dark but of course sir its usually mrs skelmersdale sir just about her time in the afternoon on an average sir    7   i went out of london to think about my life  it was manifest that lady marayne did not believe him  alone she asked  of course alone  stuff said lady marayne  she had taken him into her own little sittingroom she had thrown aside gloves and fan and theatre wrap curled herself comfortably into the abundantly cushioned corner by the fire and proceeded to a mixture of crossexamination and tirade that he found it difficult to make head against she was vibrating between distressed solicitude and resentful anger she was infuriated at his going away and deeply concerned at what could have taken him away i was worried he said london is too crowded to think in i wanted to get myself alone  and there i was while you were getting yourself alone as you call it wearing my poor little brains out to think of some story to tell people i had to stuff them up you had a sprained knee at chexington and for all i knew any of them might have been seeing you that morning besides what has a boy like you to worry about its all nonsense poff  she awaited his explanations benham looked for a moment like his father  im not getting on mother he said im scattering myself im getting no grip i want to get a better hold upon life or else i do not see what is to keep me from going to piecesand wasting existence its rather difficult sometimes to tell what one thinks and feels  she had not really listened to him  who is that woman she interrupted suddenly mrs flybynight or some such name who rings you up on the telephone  benham hesitated blushed and regretted it  mrs skelmersdale he said after a little pause  its all the same who is she  shes a woman i met at a studio somewhere and i went with her to one of those dolmetsch concerts  he stopped  lady marayne considered him in silence for a little while all men she said at last are alike husbands sons and brothers they are all alike sons one expects them to be different they arent different why should they be i suppose i ought to be shocked poff but im not she seems to be very fond of you  shesshes very goodin her way shes had a difficult life  you cant leave a man about for a moment lady marayne reflected poff i wish youd fetch me a glass of water  when he returned she was looking very fixedly into the fire put it down she said anywhere poff is this mrs helterskelter a discreet sort of woman do you like her she asked a few additional particulars and benham made his grudging admission of facts what i still dont understand poff is why you have been away  i went away said benham because i want to clear things up  but why is there some one else  no  you went alone all the time  ive told you i went alone do you think i tell you lies mother  everybody tells lies somehow said lady marayne easy lies or stiff ones dont flourish poff dont start saying things like a moral windmill in a whirlwind its all a muddle i suppose every one in london is getting in or out of these entanglementsor something of the sort and this seems a comparatively slight one i wish it hadnt happened they do happen  an expression of perplexity came into her face she looked at him why do you want to throw her over  i want to throw her over said benham  he stood up and went to the hearthrug and his mother reflected that this was exactly what all men did at just this phase of a discussion then things ceased to be sensible  from overhead he said to her i want to get away from this complication this servitude i want to do somesome work i want to get my mind clear and my hands clear i want to study government and the big business of the world  and shes in the way  he assented  you men said lady marayne after a little pause what queer beasts you are here is a woman who is kind to you shes fond of you i could tell shes fond of you directly i heard her and you amuse yourself with her and then its gobble gobble gobble great work hands clear big business of the world why couldnt you think of that before poff why did you begin with her  it was unexpected  stuff said lady marayne for a second time well she said well your mrs flybynightoh it doesnt matterwhatever she calls herself must look after herself i cant do anything for her im not supposed even to know about her i daresay shell find her consolations i suppose you want to go out of london and get away from it all i can help you there perhaps im tired of london too its been a tiresome season oh tiresome and disappointing i want to go over to ireland and travel about a little the pothercareys want us to come theyve asked us twice  benham braced himself to face fresh difficulties it was amazing how different the world could look from his mothers little parlour and from the crest of the north downs  but i want to start round the world he cried with a note of acute distress i want to go to egypt and india and see what is happening in the east all this wonderful waking up of the east i know nothing of the way the world is going  india cried lady marayne the east poff what is the matter with you has something happenedsomething else have you been having a love affaira real love affair  oh damn love affairs cried benham motherim sorry mother but dont you see theres other things in the world for a man than having a good time and making love im for something else than that youve given me the splendidest time  i see cried lady marayne i see ive bored you i might have known i should have bored you  youve not bored me cried benham  he threw himself on the rug at her feet oh mother he said little dear gallant mother dont make life too hard for me ive got to do my job ive got to find my job  ive bored you she wept  suddenly she was weeping with all the unconcealed distressing grief of a disappointed child she put her pretty beringed little hands in front of her face and recited the accumulation of her woes  ive done all i can for you planned for you given all my time for you and ive bored you  mother  dont come near me poff dont touch me all my plans all my ambitions friendsevery one you dont know all ive given up for you  he had never seen his mother weep before her selfabandonment amazed him her words were distorted by her tears it was the most terrible and distressing of crises  go away from me how can you help me all ive done has been a failure failure failure    8   that night the silences of finacue street heard benhams voice again i must do my job he was repeating i must do my job anyhow  and then after a long pause like a watchword and just a little unsurely aristocracy  the next day his resolution had to bear the brunt of a second ordeal mrs skelmersdale behaved beautifully and this made everything tormentingly touching and difficult she convinced him she was really in love with him and indeed if he could have seen his freshness and simplicity through her experienced eyes he would have known there was sound reason why she should have found him exceptional and when his clumsy hints of compensation could no longer be ignored she treated him with a soft indignation a tender resentment that left him soft and tender she looked at him with pained eyes and a quiver of the lips what did he think she was and then a little less credibly did he think she would have given herself to him if she hadnt been in love with him perhaps that was not altogether true but at any rate it was altogether true to her when she said it and it was manifest that she did not for a moment intend him to have the cheap consolation of giving her money but and that seemed odd to benham she would not believe just as lady marayne would not believe that there was not some other woman in the case he assured her and she seemed reassured and then presently she was back at exactly the same question would no woman ever understand the call of asia the pride of duty the desire for the world  one sort of woman perhaps  it was odd that for the first time now in the sunshine of kensington gardens he saw the little gossamer lines that tell that thirty years and more have passed over a face a little wrinkling of the eyelids a little hardening of the mouth how slight it is how invisible it has been how suddenly it appears and the sunshine of the warm april afternoon heightened it may be by her determined unmercenary pose betrayed too the faintest hint of shabbiness in her dress he had never noticed these shadows upon her or her setting before and their effect was to fill him with a strange regretful tenderness  perhaps men only begin to love when they cease to be dazzled and admire he had thought she might reproach him he had felt and feared she might set herself to stir his senses and both these expectations had been unjust to her he saw now that he saw her beside him a brave rather illadvised and unlucky little struggler stung and shamed he forgot the particulars of that first lunch of theirs together and he remembered his mothers second contemptuous stuff  indeed he knew now it had not been unexpected why hadnt he left this little sensitive soul and this little sensitive body alone and since he hadnt done so what right had he now to back out of their common adventure he felt a sudden wild impulse to marry mrs skelmersdale in a mood between remorse and love and selfimmolation and then a sunlit young woman with a leaping stride in her paces passed across his heavens pointing to asia and utopia and forbidding even another thought of the banns  you will kiss me goodbye dear wont you said mrs skelmersdale brimming over you will do that  he couldnt keep his arm from her little shoulders and as their lips touched he suddenly found himself weeping also  his spirit went limping from that interview she chose to stay behind in her chair and think she said and each time he turned back she was sitting in the same attitude looking at him as he receded and she had one hand on the chair back and her arm drawn up to it the third time he waved his hat clumsily and she started and then answered with her hand then the trees hid her  this sex business was a damnable business if only because it made one hurt women  he had trampled on mrs skelmersdale he had hurt and disappointed his mother was he a brute was he a coldblooded prig what was this aristocracy was his belief anything more than a theory was he only dreaming of a debt to the men in the quarry to the miners to the men in the stokeholes to the drudges on the fields and while he dreamt he wounded and distressed real living creatures in the sleepwalk of his dreaming  so long as he stuck to his dream he must at any rate set his face absolutely against the establishment of any further relations with women  unless they were women of an entirely different type women hardened and tempered who would understand    9   so benham was able to convert the unfortunate mrs skelmersdale into a tender but for a long time an entirely painful memory but mothers are not so easily disposed of and more particularly a mother whose conduct is coloured deeply by an extraordinary persuasion of having paid for her offspring twice over nolan was inexplicable he was benham understood quite clearly never to be mentioned again but somehow from the past his shadow and his legacy cast a peculiar and perplexing shadow of undefined obligation upon benhams outlook his resolution to go round the world carried on his preparations rapidly and steadily but at the same time his mothers thwarted and angry bearing produced a torture of remorse in him it was constantly in his mind like the suit of the importunate widow that he ought to devote his life to the little ladys happiness and pride and his reason told him that even if he wanted to make this sacrifice he couldnt the mere act of making it would produce so entirely catastrophic a revulsion he could as soon have become a croquet champion or the curate of chexington church lines of endeavour which for him would have led straightly and simply to sacrilegious scandal or manslaughter with a mallet  there is so little measure in the wild atonements of the young that it was perhaps as well for the research magnificent that the remorses of this period of benhams life were too complicated and scattered for a cumulative effect in the background of his mind and less subdued than its importance could seem to warrant was his promise to bring the wildermorris people into relations with lady marayne they had been so delightful to him that he felt quite acutely the slight he was putting upon them by this delay lady maraynes moods however had been so uncertain that he had found no occasion to broach this trifling matter and when at last the occasion came he perceived in the same instant the fullest reasons for regretting it  ah she said hanging only for a moment and then you told me you were alone  her mind leapt at once to the personification of these people as all that had puzzled and baffled her in her son since his flight from london they were the enemy they had got hold of him  when i asked you if you were alone you pretended to be angry she remembered with a flash you said do i tell lies  i was alone until it was an accident on my walk i was alone  but he flinched before her accusing her almost triumphant forefinger  from the instant she heard of them she hated these south harting people unrestrainedly she made no attempt to conceal it her valiant bantam spirit caught at this quarrel as a refuge from the rare and uncongenial ache of his secession and who are they what are they what sort of people can they be to drag in a passing young man i suppose this girl of theirs goes out every eveningwas she painted poff  she whipped him with her questions as though she was slashing his face he became deadwhite and grimly civil answering every question as though it was the sanest most justifiable inquiry  of course i dont know who they are how should i know what need is there to know  there are ways of finding out she insisted if i am to go down and make myself pleasant to these people because of you  but i implore you not to  and five minutes ago you were imploring me to of course i shall  oh wellwell  one has to know something of the people to whom one commits oneself surely  they are decent people they are wellbehaved people  ohill behave well dont think ill disgrace your casual acquaintances but who they are what they are i will know  on that point lady marayne was to score beyond her utmost expectations  come round she said over the telephone two mornings later ive something to tell you  she was so triumphant that she was sorry for him when it came to telling him she failed from her fierceness  poff my little son she said im so sorry i hardly know how to tell you poff im sorry i have to tell youand its utterly beastly  but what he asked  these people are dreadful people  but how  youve heard of the great kent and eastern bank smash and the marlborough building society frauds eight or nine years ago  vaguely but what has that to do with them  that man morris  she stopped short and benham nodded for her to go on  her father said lady marayne  but who was morris really mother i dont remember  he was sentenced to seven yearsten yearsi forget he had done all sorts of dreadful things he was a swindler and when he went out of the dock into the waitingroom he had a signet ring with prussic acid in it  i remember now he said  a silence fell between them  benham stood quite motionless on the hearthrug and stared very hard at the little volume of henleys poetry that lay upon the table  he cleared his throat presently  you cant go and see them then he said after allsince i am going abroad so soon it doesnt so very much matter    10   to benham it did not seem to be of the slightest importance that amandas father was a convicted swindler who had committed suicide never was a resolved and conscious aristocrat so free from the hereditary delusion good parents he was convinced are only an advantage in so far as they have made you good stuff and bad parents are no discredit to a son or daughter of good quality conceivably he had a bias against too close an examination of origins and he held that the honour of the children should atone for the sins of the fathers and the questionable achievements of any intervening testator not half a dozen rich and established families in all england could stand even the most conventional inquiry into the foundations of their pride and only a universal amnesty could prevent ridiculous distinctions but he brought no accusation of inconsistency against his mother she looked at things with a lighter logic and a kind of genius for the acceptance of superficial values she was condoned and forgiven a rescued lamb reestablished notoriously bright and nice and the morrises were damned that was their status exclusion damnation as fixed as colour in georgia or caste in bengal but if his mothers mind worked in that way there was no reason why his should so far as he was concerned he told himself it did not matter whether amanda was the daughter of a swindler or the daughter of a god he had no doubt that she herself had the spirit and quality of divinity he had seen it  so there was nothing for it in the failure of his mothers civilities but to increase his own he would go down to harting and take his leave of these amiable outcasts himself with a certain effusion he would do this soon because he was now within sight of the beginning of his world tour he had made his plans and prepared most of his equipment little remained to do but the release of merkle the wrappering and locking up of finacue street which could await him indefinitely and the buying of tickets he decided to take the opportunity afforded by a visit of sir godfrey and lady marayne to the blights big iron people in the north of england of so austere a morality that even benham was ignored by it he announced his invasion in a little note to mrs wilder he parted from his mother on friday afternoon she was already he perceived a little reconciled to his project of going abroad and contrived his arrival at south harting for that sunset hour which was for his imagination the natural halo of amanda  im going round the world he told them simply i may be away for two years and i thought i would like to see you all again before i started  that was quite the way they did things  the supperparty included mr rathbonesanders who displayed a curious tendency to drift in between benham and amanda a literary youth with a byronic visage very dark curly hair and a number of extraordinarily mature chins a girlfriend of bettys who had cycled down from london and who it appeared maintained herself at large in london by drawing for advertisements and a silent colourless friend of mr rathbonesanders the talk lit by amandas enthusiasm circled actively round benhams expedition it was clear that the idea of giving some years to thinking out ones possible work in the world was for some reason that remained obscure highly irritating to both mr rathbonesanders and the byronic youth betty too regarded it as levity when there was so much to be done and the topic whacked about and rose to something like a wrangle and sat down and rested and got up again reinvigorated with a continuity of interest that benham had never yet encountered in any london gathering he made a good case for his modern version of the grand tour and he gave them something of his intellectual enthusiasm for the distances and views the cities and seas the multitudinous wide spectacle of the world he was to experience he had been reading about benares and north china as he talked amanda who had been animated at first fell thoughtful and silent and then it was discovered that the night was wonderfully warm and the moon shining they drifted out into the garden but mr rathbonesanders was suddenly entangled and drawn back by mrs wilder and the young woman from london upon some technical point and taken to the worktable in the corner of the diningroom to explain he was never able to get to the garden  benham found himself with amanda upon a side path a little isolated by some swaggering artichokes and a couple of apple trees and so forth from the general conversation they cut themselves off from the continuation of that by a little silence and then she spoke abruptly and with the quickness of a speaker who has thought out something to say and fears interruption why did you come down here  i wanted to see you before i went  you disturb me you fill me with envy  i didnt think of that i wanted to see you again  and then you will go off round the world you will see the tropics you will see india you will go into chinese cities all hung with vermilion you will climb mountains oh men can do all the splendid things why do you come here to remind me of it i have never been anywhere anywhere at all i never shall go anywhere never in my life have i seen a mountain those downs therelook at themare my highest and while you are travelling i shall think of youand think of you  would you like to travel he asked as though that was an extraordinary idea  do you think every girl wants to sit at home and rock a cradle  i never thought you did  then what did you think i wanted  what do you want  she held her arms out widely and the moonlight shone in her eyes as she turned her face to him  just what you want she said the whole world  life is like a feast she went on it is spread before everybody and nobody must touch it what am i just a prisoner in a cottage garden looking for ever over a hedge i should be happier if i couldnt look i remember once only a little time ago there was a cheap excursion to london our only servant went she had to get up at an unearthly hour and ii got up too i helped her to get off and when she was gone i went up to my bedroom again and cried i cried with envy for any one any one who could go away ive been nowhereexcept to school at chichester and three or four times to emsworth and bognorfor eight years when you gothe tears glittered in the moonlighti shall cry it will be worse than the excursion to london ever since you were here before ive been thinking of it  it seemed to benham that here indeed was the very sister of his spirit his words sprang into his mind as one thinks of a repartee but why shouldnt you come too he said  she stared at him in silence the two whitelit faces examined each other both she and benham were trembling  come too she repeated  yes with me  buthow  then suddenly she was weeping like a child that is teased her troubled eyes looked out from under puckered brows you dont mean it she said you dont mean it  and then indeed he meant it  marry me he said very quickly glancing towards the dark group at the end of the garden and we will go together  he seized her arm and drew her to him i love you he said i love your spirit you are not like any one else  there was a moments hesitation  both he and she looked to see how far they were still alone  then they turned their dusky faces to each other he drew her still closer  oh she said and yielded herself to be kissed their lips touched and for a moment he held her lithe body against his own  i want you he whispered close to her you are my mate from the first sight of you i knew that  they embracedalertly furtive  then they stood a little apart some one was coming towards them amandas bearing changed swiftly she put up her little face to his confidently and intimately  dont tell any one she whispered eagerly shaking his arm to emphasize her words dont tell any onenot yet not for a few days  she pushed him from her quickly as the shadowy form of betty appeared in a little path between the artichokes and raspberry canes  listening to the nightingales cried betty  yes arent they said amanda inconsecutively  thats our very own nightingale cried betty advancing do you hear it mr benham no not that one that is a quite inferior bird that performs in the vicarage trees    11   when a man has found and won his mate then the best traditions demand a lyrical interlude it should be possible to tell in that ecstatic manner which melts words into moonshine makes prose almost uncomfortably rhythmic and brings all the freshness of every spring that ever was across the page of the joyous exaltation of the happy lover this at any rate was what white had always done in his novels hitherto and what he would certainly have done at this point had he had the telling of benhams story uncontrolledly in his hands but indeed indeed in real life in very truth the heart has not this simplicity only the heroes of romance and a few strong simple cleanshaven americans have that much emotional integrity and even the americans do at times seem to an observant eye to be putting in work at the job and keeping up their gladness benham was excited that night but not in the proper brighteyed redcheeked way he did not dance down the village street of harting to his harbour at the ship and the expression in his eyes as he sat on the edge of his bed was not the deep elemental wonder one could have wished there but amazement do not suppose that he did not love amanda that a rich majority of his being was not triumphantly glad to have won her that the image of the two armourclad lovers was not still striding and flourishing through the lit wilderness of his imagination for three weeks things had pointed him to this they would do everything together now he and his mate they would scale mountains together and ride side by side towards ruined cities across the deserts of the world he could have wished no better thing but at the same time even as he felt and admitted this and rejoiced at it the sky of his mind was black with consternation  it is remarkable white reflected as he turned over the abundant but confused notes upon this perplexing phase of benhams development that lay in the third drawer devoted to the second limitation how dependent human beings are upon statement man is the animal that states a case he lives not in things but in expressed ideas and what was troubling benham inordinately that night a night that should have been devoted to purely blissful and exalted expectations was the sheer impossibility of stating what had happened in any terms that would be tolerable either to mrs skelmersdale or lady marayne the thing had happened with the suddenness of a revelation whatever had been going on in the less illuminated parts of his mind his manifest resolution had been merely to bid south harting goodbye and in short they would never understand they would accuse him of the meanest treachery he could see his mothers face he could hear her voice saying and so because of this sudden infatuation for a swindlers daughter a girl who runs about the roads with a couple of retrievers hunting for a man you must spoil all my plans ruin my year tell me a lot of pretentious stuffy lies and mrs skelmersdale too would say of course he just talked of the world and duty and all that rubbish to save my face  it wasnt so at all  but it looked so frightfully like it  couldnt they realize that he had fled out of london before ever he had seen amanda they might be able to do it perhaps but they never would it just happened that in the very moment when the edifice of his noble resolutions had been ready she had stepped into itout of nothingness and nowhere she wasnt an accident that was just the point upon which they were bound to misjudge her she was an embodiment if only he could show her to them as she had first shown herself to him swift light a little flushed from running but not in the least out of breath quick as a leopard upon the dogs but even if the improbable opportunity arose he perceived it might still be impossible to produce the amanda he loved the amanda of the fluttering short skirt and the clear enthusiastic voice because already he knew she was not the only amanda there was another there might be others there was this perplexing person who had flashed into being at the very moment of their mutual confession who had produced the entirely disconcerting demand that nobody must be told then betty had intervened but that subamanda and her carneying note had to be dealt with on the first occasion because when aristocrats love they dont care a rap who is told and who is not told they just step out into the light side by side  dont tell any one she had said not for a few days  this subamanda was perceptible next morning again flitting about in the background of a glad and loving adventuress a preoccupied amanda who had put her head down while the real amanda flung her chin up and contemplated things on the asiatic scale and who was apparently engaged in disentangling something obscure connected with mr rathbonesanders that ought never to have been entangled  a human being white read the simplest human being is a clustering mass of aspects no man will judge another justly who judges everything about him and of love in particular is this true we love not persons but revelations the woman one loves is like a goddess hidden in a shrine for her sake we live on hope and suffer the kindred priestesses that make up herself the art of love is patience till the gleam returns  sunday and monday did much to develop this idea of the intricate complexity of humanity in benhams mind on monday morning he went up from the ship again to get amanda alone and deliver his ultimatum against a further secrecy so that he could own her openly and have no more of the interventions and separations that had barred him from any intimate talk with her throughout the whole of sunday the front door stood open the passage hall was empty but as he hesitated whether he should proclaim himself with the knocker or walk through the door of the little drawingroom flew open and a blackclad cylindrical clerical person entirely unknown to benham stumbled over the threshold blundered blindly against him made a sound like moo and a pitiful gesture with his arm and fled forth  it was a curate and he was weeping bitterly  benham stood in the doorway and watched a clumsy brokenhearted flight down the village street  he had been partly told and partly left to infer and anyhow he was beginning to understand about mr rathbonesanders that he could dismiss butwhy was the curate in tears    12   he found amanda standing alone in the room from which this young man had fled she had a handful of daffodils in her hand and others were scattered over the table she had been arranging the big bowl of flowers in the centre he left the door open behind him and stopped short with the table between them she looked up at himintelligently and calmly her pose had a divine dignity  i want to tell them now said benham without a word of greeting  yes she said tell them now  they heard steps in the passage outside betty cried amanda  her mothers voice answered do you want betty  we want you all answered amanda we have something to tell you  carrie they heard mrs morris call her sister after an interval and her voice sounded faint and flat and unusual there was the soft hissing of some whispered words outside and a muffled exclamation then mrs wilder and mrs morris and betty came into the room mrs wilder came first and mrs morris with an alarmed face as if sheltering behind her we want to tell you something said amanda  amanda and i are going to marry each other said benham standing in front of her  for an instant the others made no answer they looked at each other  but does he know mrs morris said in a low voice  amanda turned her eyes to her lover she was about to speak she seemed to gather herself for an effort and then he knew that he did not want to hear her explanation he checked her by a gesture  i know he said and then i do not see that it matters to us in the least  he went to her holding out both his hands to her  she took them and stood shyly for a moment and then the watchful gravity of her face broke into soft emotion oh she cried and seized his face between her hands in a passion of triumphant love and kissed him  and then he found himself being kissed by mrs morris  she kissed him thrice with solemnity with thankfulness with relief as if in the act of kissing she transferred to him precious and entirely incalculable treasures     chapter the fourth  the spirited honeymoon    1   it was a little after sunrise one bright morning in september that benham came up on to the deck of the sturdy austrian steamboat that was churning its way with a sedulous deliberation from spalato to cattaro and lit himself a cigarette and seated himself upon a deck chair save for a yawning greek sailor busy with a mop the firstclass deck was empty  benham surveyed the haggard beauty of the illyrian coast the mountains rose gaunt and enormous and barren to a jagged fantastic silhouette against the sun their almost vertical slopes still plunged in blue shadow broke only into a little cold green and white edge of olive terraces and vegetation and houses before they touched the clear blue water an occasional church or a house perched high upon some seemingly inaccessible ledge did but accentuate the vast barrenness of the land it was a land desolated and destroyed at ragusa at salona at spalato and zara and pola benham had seen only variations upon one persistent theme a dwindled and uncreative human life living amidst the giant ruins of preceding times as worms live in the sockets of a skull forward an unsavoury group of passengers still slumbered amidst fruitpeel and expectorations a few soldiers some squalid brigands armed with preposterous red umbrellas a group of curledup human lumps brooded over by an aquiline individual caparisoned with brass like a horse his head wrapped picturesquely in a shawl benham surveyed these last products of the life force and resumed his pensive survey of the coast the sea was deserted save for a couple of little lateen craft with suns painted on their gaudy sails sea butterflies that hung motionless as if unawakened close inshore  the travel of the last few weeks had impressed benhams imagination profoundly for the first time in his life he had come face to face with civilization in defeat from venice hitherward he had marked with cumulative effect the clustering evidences of effort spent and power crumbled to nothingness he had landed upon the marble quay of pola and visited its deserted amphitheatre he had seen a weak provincial life going about ignoble ends under the walls of the great venetian fortress and the still more magnificent cathedral of zara he had visited spalato clustered in sweltering grime within the ample compass of the walls of diocletians villa and a few troublesome sellers of coins and iridescent glass and fragments of tessellated pavement and suchlike loot was all the population he had found amidst the fallen walls and broken friezes and columns of salona down this coast there ebbed and flowed a mean residual life a life of violence and dishonesty peddling trades vendettas and war for a while the unstable austrian ruled this land and made a sort of order that the incalculable chances of international politics might at any time shatter benham was drawing near now to the utmost limit of that extended peace ahead beyond the mountain capes was montenegro and further albania and macedonia lands of lawlessness and confusion amanda and he had been warned of the impossibility of decent travel beyond cattaro and cettinje but this had but whetted her adventurousness and challenged his spirit they were going to see albania for themselves  the three months of honeymoon they had been spending together had developed many remarkable divergences of their minds that had not been in the least apparent to benham before their marriage then their common resolve to be as spirited as possible had obliterated all minor considerations but that was the limit of their unanimity amanda loved wild and picturesque things and benham strong and clear things the vines and brushwood amidst the ruins of salona that had delighted her had filled him with a sense of tragic retrogression salona had revived again in the acutest form a dispute that had been smouldering between them throughout a fitful and lengthy exploration of north and central italy she could not understand his disgust with the mediaeval colour and confusion that had swamped the pride and state of the roman empire and he could not make her feel the ambition of the ruler the essential discipline and responsibilities of his aristocratic idea while his adventurousness was conquest hers it was only too manifest was brigandage his thoughts ran now into the form of an imaginary discourse that he would never deliver to her on the decay of states on the triumphs of barbarians over rulers who will not rule on the relaxation of patrician orders and the return of the robber and assassin as lordship decays this coast was no theatrical scenery for him it was a shattered empire and it was shattered because no men had been found united enough magnificent and steadfast enough to hold the cities and maintain the roads keep the peace and subdue the brutish hates and suspicions and cruelties that devastated the world  and as these thoughts came back into his mind amanda flickered up from below light and noiseless as a sunbeam and stood behind his chair  freedom and the sight of the world had if possible brightened and invigorated her her costume and bearing were subtly touched by the romance of the adriatic there was a flavour of the pirate in the cloak about her shoulders and the light knitted cap of scarlet she had stuck upon her head she surveyed his preoccupation for a moment glanced forward and then covered his eyes with her hands in almost the same movement she had bent down and nipped the tip of his ear between her teeth  confound you amanda  youd forgotten my existence you stargazing cheetah and then you see these things happen to you  i was thinking  welldont i distrust your thinking this coast is wilder and grimmer than yesterday its glorious  she sat down on the chair he unfolded for her  is there nothing to eat she asked abruptly  it is too early    2   this coast is magnificent she said presently  its hideous he answered its as ugly as a heap of slag  its nature at its wildest  thats amanda at her wildest  well isnt it  no this land isnt nature its waste not wilderness its the other end those hills were covered with forests this was a busy civilized coast just a little thousand years ago the venetians wasted it they cut down the forests they filled the cities with a mixed mud of population that stuff look at ithe indicated the sleepers forward by a movement of his head  i suppose they were rather feeble people said amanda  who  the venetians  they were tradersand nothing more just as we are and when they were rich they got splendid clothes and feasted and rested much as we do  amanda surveyed him we dont rest  we idle  we are seeing things  dont be a humbug amanda we are making love just as they did and it has beenripping in salona they made love tremendously they did nothing else until the barbarians came over the mountains  well said amanda virtuously we will do something else  he made no answer and her expression became profoundly thoughtful of course this wandering must end he had been growing impatient for some time but it was difficult she perceived to decide just what to do with him  benham picked up the thread of his musing  he was seeing more and more clearly that all civilization was an effort and so far always an inadequate and very partially successful effort always it had been aristocratic aristocratic in the sense that it was the work of minorities who took power who had a common resolution against the inertia the indifference the insubordination and instinctive hostility of the mass of mankind and always the setbacks the disasters of civilization had been failures of the aristocratic spirit why had the roman purpose faltered and shrivelled every order every brotherhood every organization carried with it the seeds of its own destruction must the idea of statecraft and rule perpetually reappear reclothe itself in new forms age die even as life doesmaking each time its almost infinitesimal addition to human achievement now the world is crying aloud for a renascence of the spirit that orders and controls human affairs sway at a dizzy height of opportunity will they keep their footing there or stagger we have got back at last to a time as big with opportunity as the early empire given only the will in men and it would be possible now to turn the dazzling accidents of science the chancy attainments of the nineteenth century into a sane and permanent possession a new starting point what a magnificence might be made of life  he was aroused by amandas voice  when we go back to london old cheetah she said we must take a house  for some moments he stared at her trying to get back to their point of divergence  why he asked at length  we must have a house she said  he looked at her face her expression was profoundly thoughtful her eyes were fixed on the slumbering ships poised upon the transparent water under the mountain shadows  you see she thought it out youve got to tell in london you cant just sneak back there youve got to strike a note of your own with all these things of yours  but how  theres a sort of little house i used to see them when i was a girl and my father lived in london about brook street and that part not too far north you see going back to london for us is just another adventure weve got to capture london weve got to scale it weve got advantages of all sorts but at present were outside weve got to march in  her clear hazel eyes contemplated conflicts and triumphs  she was roused by benhams voice  what the deuce are you thinking of amanda  she turned her level eyes to his london she said for you  i dont want london he said  i thought you did you ought to i do  but to take a house make an invasion of london  you dear old cheetah you cant be always frisking about in the wilderness staring at the stars  but im not going back to live in london in the old way theatres dinnerparties chatter  oh no we arent going to do that sort of thing we arent going to join the ruck well go about in holiday times all over the world i want to see fusiyama i mean to swim in the south seas with you well dodge the sharks but all the same we shall have to have a house in london we have to be felt there  she met his consternation fairly she lifted her fine eyebrows her little face conveyed a protesting reasonableness  well mustnt we  she added if we want to alter the world we ought to live in the world  since last they had disputed the question she had thought out these new phrases  amanda he said i think sometimes you havent the remotest idea of what i am after i dont believe you begin to suspect what i am up to  she put her elbows on her knees dropped her chin between her hands and regarded him impudently she had a characteristic trick of looking up with her face downcast that never failed to soften his regard  look here cheetah dont you give way to your early morning habit of calling your own true love a fool she said  simply i tell you i will not go back to london  you will go back with me cheetah  i will go back as far as my work calls me there  it calls you through the voice of your mate and slave and doormat to just exactly the sort of house you ought to have it is the privilege and duty of the female to choose the lair  for a space benham made no reply this controversy had been gathering for some time and he wanted to state his view as vividly as possible the benham style of connubial conversation had long since decided for emphasis rather than delicacy  i think he said slowly that this wanting to take london by storm is a beastly vulgar thing to want to do  amanda compressed her lips  i want to work out things in my mind he went on i do not want to be distracted by social things and i do not want to be distracted by picturesque things this lifeits all very well on the surface but it isnt real im not getting hold of reality things slip away from me god but how they slip away from me  he got up and walked to the side of the boat  she surveyed his back for some moments then she went and leant over the rail beside him  i want to go to london she said  i dont  where do you want to go  where i can see into the things that hold the world together  i have loved this wanderingi could wander always but cheetah i tell you i want to go to london  he looked over his shoulder into her warm face no he said  but i ask you  he shook his head  she put her face closer and whispered cheetah big beast of my heart do you hear your mate asking for something  he turned his eyes back to the mountains i must go my own way  havent i so far invented things made life amusing cheetah cant you trust the leopards wisdom  he stared at the coast inexorably  i wonder she whispered  what  you are that cheetah that lank long eager beast  suddenly with a nimble hand she had unbuttoned and rolled up the sleeve of her blouse she stuck her pretty blueveined arm before his eyes look here sir it was you wasnt it it was your powerful jaw inflicted this bite upon the arm of a defenceless young leopardess  amanda  well she wrinkled her brows  he turned about and stood over her he shook a finger in her face and there was a restrained intensity in his voice as he spoke  look here amanda he said if you think that you are going to make me agree to any sort of project about london to any sort of complication of our lives with houses in smart streets and a campaign of social assertionby that then may i be damned for an uxorious fool  her eyes met his and there was mockery in her eyes  this cheetah is the morning mood she remarked  this is the essential mood listen amanda  he stopped short he looked towards the gangway they both looked the magic word breakfast came simultaneously from them  eggs she said ravenously and led the way  a smell of coffee as insistent as an heralds trumpet had called a truce between them    3   their marriage had been a comparatively inconspicuous one but since that time they had been engaged upon a honeymoon of great extent and variety their wedding had taken place at south harting church in the marked absence of lady marayne and it had been marred by only one untoward event the reverend amos pugh who in spite of the earnest advice of several friends had insisted upon sharing in the ceremony had suddenly covered his face with the sleeves of his surplice and fled with a swift rustle to the vestry whence an uproar of inadequately smothered sorrow came as an obligato accompaniment to the more crucial passages of the service amanda appeared unaware of the incident at the time but afterwards she explained things to benham curates she said are such pentup men one ought i suppose to remember that but he never had anything to go upon at allnot anythingexcept his own imaginations  i suppose when you met him you were nice to him  i was nice to him of course  they drove away from harting as it were over the weeping remains of this infatuated divine his sorrow made them thoughtful for a time and then amanda nestled closer to her lover and they forgot about him and their honeymoon became so active and entertaining that only very rarely and transitorily did they ever think of him again  the original conception of their honeymoon had been identical with the plans benham had made for the survey and study of the world and it was through a series of modifications replacements and additions that it became at last a prolonged and very picturesque tour in switzerland the austrian tyrol north italy and down the adriatic coast amanda had never seen mountains and longed she said to climb this took them first to switzerland then in spite of their exalted aims the devotion of their lives to noble purposes it was evident that amanda had no intention of scamping the detail of love and for that what background is so richly beautiful as italy an important aspect of the grand tour round the world as benham had planned it had been interviews inquiries and conversations with every sort of representative and understanding person he could reach an unembarrassed young man who wants to know and does not promise to bore may reach almost any one in that way he is as impersonal as pure reason and as mobile as a letter but the presence of a lady in his train leaves him no longer unembarrassed his approach has become a social event the wife of a great or significant personage must take notice or decide not to take notice of course amanda was prepared to go anywhere just as benhams shadow it was the world that was unprepared and a second leading aspect of his original scheme had been the examination of the ways of government in cities and the shifting and mixture of nations and races it would have led to back streets and involved and complicated details and there was something in the fine flame of girlhood beside him that he felt was incompatible with those shadows and that dust and also they were lovers and very deeply in love it was amazing how swiftly that draggled shameful london sparrowgamin eros took heart from amanda and became wonderful beautiful glowing lifegiving confident cleareyed how he changed from flesh to sweet fire and grew until he filled the sky so that you see they went to switzerland and italy at last very like two ordinary young people who were not aristocrats at all had no theory about the world or their destiny but were simply just ardently delighted with the discovery of one another  nevertheless benham was for some time under a vague impression that in a sort of way still he was going round the world and working out his destinies  it was part of the fascination of amanda that she was never what he had supposed her to be and that nothing that he set out to do with her ever turned out as they had planned it her appreciations marched before her achievement and when it came to climbing it seemed foolish to toil to summits over which her spirit had flitted days before their swiss expeditions which she had foreseen as glorious wanderings amidst the blue ice of crevasses and nights of exalted hardihood became a walking tour of fitful vigour and abundant fun and delight they spent a long day on the ice of the aletsch glacier but they reached the inn on its eastward side with magnificent appetites a little late for dinner  amanda had revealed an unexpected gift for nicknames and pretty fancies she named herself the leopard the spotless leopard in some obscure way she intimated that the colour was black but that was never to be admitted openly there was supposed to be some lurking traces of a rusty brown but the word was spotless and the implication white a dazzling white she would play a thousand variations on the theme in moments of despondency she was only a black cat a common lean black cat and sacks and halfbricks almost too good for her but benham was always a cheetah that had come to her as a revelation from heaven but so clearly he was a cheetah he was a hunting leopard the only beast that has an upcast face and dreams and looks at you with absentminded eyes like a man she laced their journeys with a fantastic monologue telling in the third person what the leopard and the cheetah were thinking and seeing and doing and so they walked up mountains and over passes and swam in the warm clear water of romantic lakes and loved each other mightily always in chestnut woods and olive orchards and flowerstarred alps and pine forests and awningcovered boats and by sunset and moonlight and starshine and out of these agreeable solitudes they came brown and dusty striding side by side into sunlit entertaining fruitpiled marketplaces and envious hotels for days and weeks together it did not seem to benham that there was anything that mattered in life but amanda and the elemental joys of living and then the research magnificent began to stir in him again he perceived that italy was not india that the clue to the questions he must answer lay in the crowded new towns that they avoided in the packed bookshops and the talk of men and not in the picturesque and flowery solitudes to which their lovemaking carried them  moods began in which he seemed to forget amanda altogether  this happened first in the certosa di pavia whither they had gone one afternoon from milan that was quite soon after they were married they had a bumping journey thither in a motorcar a little doubtful if the excursion was worth while and they found a great amazement in the lavish beauty and decorative wealth of that vast church and its associated cloisters set far away from any population as it seemed in a flat wilderness of reedy ditches and patchy cultivation the distilleries and outbuildings were desertedtheir white walls were covered by one monstrously great and old wisteria in flowerthe soaring marvellous church was in possession of a knot of unattractive guides one of these conducted them through the painted treasures of the gold and marble chapels he was an elderly but animated person who evidently found amanda more wonderful than any church he poured out great accumulations of information and compliments before her benham dropped behind went astray and was presently recovered dreaming in the great cloister the guide showed them over two of the cells that opened thereupon each a delightful house for a solitary bookish and clean and each with a little secret walled garden of its own he was covertly tipped against all regulations and departed regretfully with a beaming dismissal from amanda she found benham wondering why the carthusians had failed to produce anything better in the world than a liqueur one might have imagined that men would have done something in this beautiful quiet that there would have come thought from here or will from here  in these dear little nests they ought to have put lovers said amanda  oh of course you would have made the place thelema  but as they went shaking and bumping back along the evil road to milan he fell into a deep musing suddenly he said work has to be done because this order or that has failed there is no reason why we should fail and look at those ragged children in the road ahead of us and those dirty women sitting in the doorways and the foul ugliness of these gaunt nameless towns through which we go they are what they are because we are what we areidlers excursionists in a world we ought to rule  amanda weve got to get to work  that was his first display of this new mood which presently became a common one he was less and less content to let the happy hours slip by more and more sensitive to the reminders in giant ruin and deserted cell in a chance encounter with a string of guns and soldiers on their way to manoeuvres or in the sight of a stale newspaper of a great world process going on in which he was now playing no part at all and a curious irritability manifested itself more and more plainly whenever human pettiness obtruded upon his attention whenever some trivial dishonesty some manifest slovenliness some spiritless failure a cheating waiter or a wayside beggar brought before him the shiftless selfish aimless elements in humanity that war against the great dream of life made glorious accursed things he would say as he flung some importunate cripple at a church door a tencentime piece why were they born why do they consent to live they are no better than some chance fungus that is because it must  it takes all sorts to make a world said amanda  nonsense said benham where is the megatherium that sort of creature has to go our sort of creature has to end it  then why did you give it money  because i dont want the thing to be more wretched than it is but if i could prevent more of them what am i doing to prevent them  these beggars annoy you said amanda after a pause they do me let us go back into the mountains  but he fretted in the mountains  they made a ten days tour from macugnaga over the monte moro to sass and thence to zermatt and back by the theodule to macugnaga the sudden apparition of douaniers upon the monte moro annoyed benham and he was also irritated by the solemn english mountain climbers at saas fee they were as bad as golfers he said and reflected momentarily upon his father amanda fell in love with monte rosa she wanted to kiss its snowy forehead she danced like a young goat down the path to mattmark and rolled on the turf when she came to gentians and purple primulas benham was tremendously in love with her most of the time but one day when they were sitting over the findelen glacier his perceptions blundered for the first time upon the fundamental antagonism of their quality she was sketching out jolly things that they were to do together expeditions entertainments amusements and adventures with a voluble swiftness and suddenly in a flash his eyes were opened and he saw that she would never for a moment feel the quality that made life worth while for him he saw it in a flash and in that flash he made his urgent resolve not to see it from that moment forth his bearing was poisoned by his secret determination not to think of this not to admit it to his mind and forbidden to come into his presence in its proper form this conflict of intellectual temperaments took on strange disguises and the gathering tension of his mind sought to relieve itself along grotesque irrelevant channels  there was for example the remarkable affair of the drive from macugnaga to piedimulera  they had decided to walk down in a leisurely fashion but with the fatigues of the precipitous clamber down from switzerland still upon them they found the white road between rock above and gorge below wearisome and the valley hot in the late morning sunshine and already before they reached the inn they had marked for lunch amanda had suggested driving the rest of the way the inn had a number of brigandlike customers consuming such sustenance as garlic and salami and wine it received them with an indifference that bordered on disrespect until the landlord who seemed to be something of a beauty himself discovered the merits of amanda then he became markedly attentive he was a large fat curlyheaded person with beautiful eyes a cherished moustache and an air of great gentility and when he had welcomed his guests and driven off the slatternly waitingmaid and given them his best table and consented at amandas request to open a window he went away and put on a tie and collar it was an attention so conspicuous that even the group of men in the far corner noticed and commented on it and then they commented on amanda and benham assuming an ignorance of italian in the visitors that was only partly justifiable bellissima bravissima signorina inglesa one need not be born in italy to understand such words as these also they addressed sly comments and encouragements to the landlord as he went to and fro  benham was rather still and stiff during the meal but it ill becomes an english aristocrat to discuss the manners of an alien population and amanda was amused by the effusion of the landlord and a little disposed to experiment upon him she sat radiating light amidst the shadows  the question of the vehicle was broached the landlord was doubtful then an idea it was manifestly a questionable idea occurred to him he went to consult an obscure brownfaced individual in the corner disappeared and the world without became eloquent presently he returned and announced that a carozza was practicable it had been difficult but he had contrived it and he remained hovering over the conclusion of their meal asking questions about amandas mountaineering and expressing incredulous admiration  his bill which he presented with an uneasy flourish was large and included the carozza  he ushered them out to the carriage with civilities and compliments it had manifestly been difficult and contrived it was dusty and blistered there had been a hasty effort to conceal its recent use as a henroost the harness was mended with string the horse was gaunt and scandalous a dirty white and carried its head apprehensively the driver had but one eye through which there gleamed a concentrated hatred of god and man  no wonder he charged for it before we saw it said benham  its better than walking said amanda  the company in the inn gathered behind the landlord and scrutinized amanda and benham intelligently the young couple got in avanti said benham and amanda bestowed one last ineradicable memory on the bowing landlord  benham did not speak until just after they turned the first corner and then something portentous happened considering the precipitous position of the road they were upon a small boy appeared sitting in the grass by the wayside and at the sight of him the white horse shied extravagantly the driver rose in his seat ready to jump but the crisis passed without a smash cheetah cried amanda suddenly this isnt safe ah said benham and began to act with the vigour of one who has long accumulated force he rose in his place and gripped the oneeyed driver by the collar aspetto he said but he meant stop the driver understood that he meant stop and obeyed  benham wasted no time in parleying with the driver he indicated to him and to amanda by a comprehensive gesture that he had business with the landlord and with a gleaming appetite upon his face went running back towards the inn  the landlord was sitting down to a little game of dominoes with his friends when benham reappeared in the sunlight of the doorway there was no misunderstanding benhams expression  for a moment the landlord was disposed to be defiant then he changed his mind benhams earnest face was within a yard of his own and a threatening forefinger was almost touching his nose  albergo cattivissimo said benham cattivissimo pranzo cattivissimo orrido cavallo cattivissimo dangerousissimo gioco abominablissimo damnissimo capisce eh         this is vile italian it maywith a certain charity to      benhambe rendered the beastliest inn the beastliest      the beastliest most awful lunch the vilest horse most      dangerous abominable trick understand   the landlord made deprecatory gestures  you understand all right said benham da me il argento per il carozzo subito          give me back the money for the carriage quickly   the landlord was understood to ask whether the signor no longer wished for the carriage  subito cried benham and giving way to a longrestrained impulse seized the padrone by the collar of his coat and shook him vigorously  there were dissuasive noises from the company but no attempt at rescue benham released his hold  adesso said benham         now  the landlord decided to disgorge it was at any rate a comfort that the beautiful lady was not seeing anything of this and he could explain afterwards to his friends that the englishman was clearly a lunatic deserving pity rather than punishment he made some sound of protest but attempted no delay in refunding the money benham had prepaid outside sounded the wheels of the returning carriage they stopped amanda appeared in the doorway and discovered benham dominant  he was a little short of breath and as she came in he was addressing the landlord with much earnestness in the following compact sentences  attendez ecco adesso noi andiamo con questa cattivissimo cavallo a piedimulera si noi arrivero in safety securo that is pagaremo non altro si noi abbiamo accidento diodio have mercy on your sinful soul see capisce thats all         now we will go with this beastly horse to piedimulera if      we get there safely i will pay if we have an accident      then  he turned to amanda get back into the thing he said we wont have these stinking beasts think we are afraid of the job ive just made sure he wont have a profit by it if we smash up thats all i might have known what he was up to when he wanted the money beforehand he came to the doorway and with a magnificent gesture commanded the perplexed driver to turn the carriage  while that was being done he discoursed upon his adjacent fellowcreatures a man who pays beforehand for anything in this filthy sort of life is a fool you see the standards of the beast they think of nothing but their dirty little tricks to get profit their garlic their sour wine their games of dominoes their moments of lust they crawl in this place like cockroaches in a warm corner of the fireplace until they die look at the scabby frontage of the house look at the mens faces yes so adequato aspettate get back into the carriage amanda  you know its dangerous cheetah the horse is a shier that man is blind in one eye  get back into the carriage said benham whitely angry i am going to drive  but  just for a moment amanda looked scared then with a queer little laugh she jumped in again  amanda was never a coward when there was excitement afoot well smash she cried by no means woefully  get up beside me said benham speaking in english to the driver but with a gesture that translated him power over men radiated from benham in this angry mood he took the drivers seat the little driver ascended and then with a grim calmness that brooked no resistance benham reached over took and fastened the apron over their knees to prevent any repetition of the jumping out tactics  the recovering landlord became voluble in the doorway  in piedimulera pagero said benham over his shoulder and brought the whip across the white outstanding ribs get up said benham  amanda gripped the sides of the seat as the carriage started into motion  he laid the whip on again with such vigour that the horse forgot altogether to shy at the urchin that had scared it before  amanda said benham leaning back if we do happen to go over on that side jump out its all clear and wide for you this side wont matter so  mind screamed amanda and recalled him to his duties he was off the road and he had narrowly missed an outstanding chestnut true  no you dont said benham presently and again their career became erratic for a time as after a slight struggle he replaced the apron over the knees of the deposed driver it had been furtively released after that benham kept an eye on it that might have been better devoted to the road  the road went down in a series of curves and corners now and then there were pacific interludes when it might have been almost any road then again it became specifically an italian mountain road now and then only a row of all too infrequent granite stumps separated them from a sheer precipice some of the corners were miraculous and once they had a wheel in a ditch for a time they shaved the parapet of a bridge over a gorge and they drove a cyclist into a patch of maize they narrowly missed a goat and jumped three gullies thrice the horse stumbled and was jerked up in time there were sickening moments and withal they got down to piedimulera unbroken and unspilt it helped perhaps that the brake with its handle like a barrel organ had been screwed up before benham took control and when they were fairly on the level outside the town benham suddenly pulled up relinquished the driving into the proper hands and came into the carriage with amanda  safe now he said compactly  the driver appeared to be murmuring prayers very softly as he examined the brake  amanda was struggling with profound problems why didnt you drive down in the first place she asked without going back  the landlord annoyed me he said i had to go back i wish i had kicked him hairy beast if anything had happened you see he would have had his mean money i couldnt bear to leave him  and why didnt you let him drive she indicated the driver by a motion of the head  i was angry said benham i was angry at the whole thing  still  you see i think i did that because he might have jumped off if i hadnt been up there to prevent himi mean if we had had a smash i didnt want him to get out of it  but you too  you see i was angry  its been as good as a switchback said amanda after reflection but werent you a little careless about me cheetah  i never thought of you said benham and then as if he felt that inadequate you seei was so annoyed its odd at times how annoyed one gets suddenly when that horse shied i realized what a beastly business life wasas those brutes up there live it i want to clear out the whole hot dirty little aimless nest of them  no im sure he repeated after a pause as though he had been digesting something i wasnt thinking about you at all    4   the suppression of his discovery that his honeymoon was not in the least the great journey of world exploration he had intended but merely an impulsive pleasure hunt was by no means the only obscured and repudiated conflict that disturbed the mind and broke out upon the behaviour of benham beneath that issue he was keeping down a far more intimate conflict it was in those lower still less recognized depths that the volcanic fire arose and the earthquakes gathered strength the amanda he had loved the amanda of the gallant stride and fluttering skirt was with him still she marched rejoicing over the passes and a dearer amanda a soft whispering creature with dusky hair who took possession of him when she chose a soft creature who was nevertheless a fierce creature was also interwoven with his life but but there was now also a multitude of other amandas who had this in common that they roused him to opposition that they crossed his moods and jarred upon his spirit and particularly there was the conquering amanda not so much proud of her beauty as eager to test it so that she was not unmindful of the stir she made in hotel lounges nor of the magic that may shine memorably through the most commonplace incidental conversation this amanda was only too manifestly pleased to think that she made peasant lovers discontented and hotel porters unmercenary she let her light shine before men we lovers who had deemed our own subjugation a profound privilege love not this further expansiveness of our ladys empire but benham knew that no aristocrat can be jealous jealousy he held to be the vice of the hovel and farmstead and suburban villa and at an enormous expenditure of will he ignored amandas waving flags and roving glances so too he denied that amanda who was sharp and shrewd about money matters that flash of an amanda who was greedy for presents and possessions that restless amanda who fretted at any cessation of excitement and that darkly thoughtful amanda whom chance observations and questions showed to be still considering an account she had to settle with lady marayne he resisted these impressions he shut them out of his mind but still they worked into his thoughts and presently he could find himself asking even as he and she went in step striding side by side through the redscarred pinewoods in the most perfect outward harmony whether after all he was so happily mated as he declared himself to be a score of times a day whether he wasnt catching glimpses of reality through a veil of delusion that grew thinner and thinner and might leave him disillusioned in the face of a relationship  sometimes a man may be struck by a thought as though he had been struck in the face and when the name of mrs skelmersdale came into his head he glanced at his wife by his side as if it were something that she might well have heard was this indeed the same thing as that wonderful fresh as the day of creation clean as flame yet the same was amanda indeed the sister of mrs skelmersdalewrought of clean fire but her sister  but also beside the inimical aspects which could set such doubts afoot there were in her infinite variety yet other amandas neither very dear nor very annoying but for the most part delightful who entertained him as strangers might amandas with an odd twist which made them amusing to watch jolly amandas who were simply irrelevant there was for example amanda the dog mistress with an astonishing tact and understanding of dogs who could explain dogs and the cock of their ears and the droop of their tails and their vanity and their fidelity and why they looked up and why they suddenly went off round the corner and their pride in the sound of their voices and their dastardly thoughts and sniffing satisfactions so that for the first time dogs had souls for benham to see and there was an amanda with a striking passion for the sleekness and soft noses of horses and there was an amanda extremely garrulous who was a biographical dictionary and critical handbook to all the girls in the school she had attended at chichesterthey seemed a very girlish lot of girls and an amanda who was very knowingknowing was the only word for itabout pictures and architecture and these and all the other amandas agreed together to develop and share this one quality in common that altogether they pointed to no end they converged on nothing she was it grew more and more apparent a miscellany bound in a body she was an animated discursiveness that passion to get all things together into one aristocratic aim that restraint of purpose that imperative to focus which was the structural essential of benhams spirit was altogether foreign to her composition  there were so many amandas they were as innumerable as the venusescytherea cypria paphia popularia euploea area verticordia etaira basilea myrtea libertina freya astarte philommedis telessigamma anadyomene and a thousand others to whom men have bowed and built temples a thousand and the same and yet it seemed to benham there was still one wanting  the amanda he had loved most wonderfully was that amanda in armour who had walked with him through the wilderness of the world along the road to chichesterand that amanda came back to him no more    5   amanda too was making her observations and discoveries  these moods of his perplexed her she was astonished to find he was becoming irritable she felt that he needed a firm but gentle discipline in his deportment as a lover at first he had been perfect  but amanda was more prepared for human inconsecutiveness than benham because she herself was inconsecutive and her dissatisfaction with his irritations and preoccupation broadened to no general discontent he had seemed perfect and he wasnt so nothing was perfect and he had to be managed just as one must manage a dog or a cousin or a mother or a horse anyhow she had got him she had no doubt that she held him by a thousand ties the spotless leopard had him between her teeth he was a prisoner in the dusk of her hair and the world was all one vast promise of entertainment    6   but the raid into the balkans was not the tremendous success she had expected it to be they had adventures but they were not the richly coloured mediaeval affairs she had anticipated for the most part until benham broke loose beyond ochrida they were adventures in discomfort in those remote parts of europe inns die away and cease and it had never occurred to amanda that inns could die away anywhere she had thought that they just became very simple and natural and quaint and she had thought that when benighted people knocked at a door it would presently open hospitably she had not expected shots at random from the window and it is not usual in albania generally for women whether they are christian or moslem to go about unveiled when they do so it leads to singular manifestations the moral sense of the men is shocked and staggered and they show it in many homely ways small boys at that age when feminine beauty does not yet prevail with them pelt also in mahometan districts they pelt men who do not wear fezzes while occasionally christians of the shawlheaded or skullcap persuasions will pelt a fez sketching is always a peltable or mobable offence as being contrary to the koran and sitting down tempts the pelter generally they pelt the dogs of albania are numerous big dirty white dogs large and hostile and they attack with little hesitation the women of albania are secluded and remote and indisposed to be of service to an alien sister roads are infrequent and most bridges have broken down no bridge has been repaired since the later seventeenth century and no new bridge has been made since the decline and fall of the roman empire there are no shops at all the scenery is magnificent but precipitous and many of the high roads are difficult to trace and there is rain in albania there is sometimes very heavy rain  yet in spite of these drawbacks they spent some splendid hours in their exploration of that wild lost country beyond the adriatic headlands there was the approach to cattaro for example through an arm of the sea amazingly beautiful on either shore that wound its way into the wild mountains and ended in a deep blue bay under the tremendous declivity of montenegro the quay with its trees and lateen craft ran along under the towers and portcullised gate of the old venetian wall within clustered the town and then the fortifications zigzagged up steeply to a monstrous fantastic fortress perched upon a great mountain headland that overhung the town behind it the rocks slashed to and fro with the road to cettinje continued to ascend into blue haze upward and upward until they became a purple curtain that filled half the heavens the paved still town was squalid by day but in the evening it became theatrically incredible with an outdoor cafe amidst flowers and creepers a hungarian military band a rabble of promenaders like a stage chorus in gorgeous costumes and a great gibbous yellow moon  and there was kroia which benham and amanda saw first through the branches of the great trees that bordered the broad green track they were following the town and its castle were poised at a tremendous height sunlit and brilliant against a sombre mass of storm cloud over vast cliffs and ravines kroia continued to be beautiful through a steep laborious approach up to the very place itself a clustering group of houses and bazaars crowned with a tower and a minaret and from a painted corridor upon this crest they had a wonderful view of the great seaward levels and even far away the blue sea itself stretching between scutari and durazzo the eye fell in succession down the stages of a vast and various descent on the bazaars and tall minarets of the town on jagged rocks and precipices on slopes of oak forest and slopes of olive woods on blue hills dropping away beyond blue hills to the coast and behind them when they turned they saw great mountains sullenly magnificent cleft into vast irregular masses dense with woods below and grim and desolate above  these were unforgettable scenes and so too was the wild lonely valley through which they rode to ochrida amidst walnut and chestnut trees and scattered rocks and the first vision of that place itself with its fertile levels dotted with sheep and cattle its castle and clustering mosques its spacious blue lake and the great mountains rising up towards olympus under the sun and there was the first view of the blue lake of presba seen between silvery beech stems and that too had olympus in the far background plain now and clear and unexpectedly snowy and there were midday moments when they sat and ate under vines and heard voices singing very pleasantly and there were forest glades and forest tracks in a great variety of beauty with mountains appearing through their parted branches there were ilex woods chestnut woods beech woods and there were strings of heavilyladen mules staggering up torrentworn tracks and strings of blueswathed mysteriouseyed women with burthens on their heads passing silently and white remote houses and ruins and deep gorges and precipices and ancient halfruinous bridges over unruly streams and if there was rain there was also the ending of rain rainbows and the piercing of clouds by the suns incandescence and sunsets and the moon first full then new and then growing full again as the holiday wore on  they found tolerable accommodation at cattaro and at cettinje and at a place halfway between them it was only when they had secured a guide and horses and pushed on into the southeast of montenegro that they began to realize the real difficulties of their journey they aimed for a place called podgoritza which had a partially justifiable reputation for an inn they missed the road and spent the night in the open beside a fire rolled in the blankets they had very fortunately bought in cettinje they supped on biscuits and benhams brandy flask it chanced to be a fine night and drawn like moths by the fire four heavilyarmed mountaineers came out of nowhere sat down beside benham and amanda rolled cigarettes achieved conversation in bad italian through the muleteer and awaited refreshment they approved of the brandy highly they finished it and towards dawn warmed to song they did not sing badly singing in chorus but it appeared to amanda that the hour might have been better chosen in the morning they were agreeably surprised to find one of the englishmen was an englishwoman and followed every accessible detail of her toilette with great interest they were quite helpful about breakfast when the trouble was put to them two vanished over a crest and reappeared with some sour milk a slabby kind of bread goats cheese young but hardened and coffee and the means of making coffee and they joined spiritedly in the ensuing meal it ought to have been extraordinarily good fun this camp under the vast heavens and these wild visitors but it was not such fun as it ought to have been because both amanda and benham were extremely cold stiff sleepy grubby and cross and when at last they were back in the way to podgoritza and had parted after some presentgiving from their chance friends they halted in a sunlit grassy place rolled themselves up in their blankets and recovered their arrears of sleep  podgoritza was their first experience of a khan those oriental substitutes for hotels and it was a deceptively good khan indeed it was not a khan at all it was an inn it provided meals it had a kind of bar or at any rate a row of bottles and glasses it possessed an upper floor with rooms separate rooms opening on to a gallery the room had no beds but it had a shelf about it on which amanda and benham rolled up in their blankets and slept we can do this sort of thing all right said amanda and benham but we mustnt lose the way again  in scutari said benham we will get an extra horse and a tent  the way presently became a lake and they reached scutari by boat towards the dawn of the next day  the extra horse involved the addition of its owner a small suspicious latin christian to the company and of another horse for him and an ugly almost hairless boy attendant moreover the british consul prevailed with benham to accept the services of a picturesque arnaut cavasse complete with a rifle knives and other implements and the name of giorgio and as they got up into the highlands beyond scutari they began to realize the deceitfulness of podgoritza and the real truth about khans their next one they reached after a rainy evening and it was a cavernous room with a floor of indurated mud and full of eyestinging woodsmoke and wind and the smell of beasts unpartitioned with a weakly hostile custodian from whom no food could be got but a little goats flesh and bread the meat giorgio stuck upon a skewer in gobbets like catsmeat and cooked before the fire for drink there was coffee and raw spirits against the wall in one corner was a slab of wood rather like the draining board in a scullery and on this the guests were expected to sleep the horses and the rest of the party camped loosely about the adjacent corner after a bitter dispute upon some unknown point between the horse owner and the custodian  amanda and benham were already rolled up on their slanting board like a couple of chrysalids when other company began to arrive through the open door out of the moonlight drawn thither by the report of a travelling englishwoman  they were sturdy men in light coloured garments adorned ostentatiously with weapons they moved mysteriously about in the firelit darknesses and conversed in undertones with giorgio giorgio seemed to have considerable powers of exposition and a gift for social organization presently he came to benham and explained that raki was available and that hospitality would do no harm benham and amanda sat up and various romantic figures with splendid moustaches came forward and shook hands with him modestly ignoring amanda there was drinking in which benham shared incomprehensible compliments much ineffective saying of buona notte and at last amanda and benham counterfeited sleep this seemed to remove a check on the conversation and a heated discussion in tense undertones went on it seemed interminably probably very few aspects of benham and amanda were ignored towards morning the twanging of a string proclaimed the arrival of a querulousfaced minstrel with a sort of embryonic onestringed horseheaded fiddle and after a brief parley singing began a long highpitched solo the fiddle squealed pitifully under the persuasion of a semicircular bow two heads were lifted enquiringly  the singer had taken up his position at their feet and faced them it was a compliment  oh said amanda rolling over  the soloist obliged with three songs and then just as day was breaking stopped abruptly and sprawled suddenly on the floor as if he had been struck asleep he was vocal even in his sleep a cock in the far corner began crowing and was answered by another outside  but this does not give a full account of the animation of the khan oh said amanda rolling over again with the suddenness of accumulated anger  theyre worse than in scutari said benham understanding her trouble instantly  it isnt days and nights we are having said benham a few days later its days and nightmares  but both he and amanda had one quality in common the deeper their discomfort the less possible it was to speak of turning back from the itinerary they had planned  they met no robbers though an excited little english levantine in scutari had assured them they would do so and told a vivid story of a ride to ipek a delay on the road due to a sudden inexplicable lameness of his horse after a halt for refreshment a political discussion that delayed him his hurry through the still twilight to make up for lost time the coming on of night and the sudden silent apparition out of the darkness of the woods about the road of a dozen armed men each protruding a gun barrel sometimes they will wait for you at a ford or a broken bridge he said in the mountains they rob for arms they assassinate the turkish soldiers even it is better to go unarmed unless you mean to fight for it have you got arms  just a revolver said benham  but it was after that that he closed with giorgio  if they found no robbers in albania they met soon enough with bloodshed they came to a village where a friend of a friend of giorgios was discovered and they slept at his house in preference to the unclean and crowded khan here for the first time amanda made the acquaintance of albanian women and was carried off to the womans region at the top of the house permitted to wash closely examined shown a baby and confided in as generously as gesture and some fragments of italian would permit benham slept on a rug on the first floor in a corner of honour beside the wood fire there had been much confused conversation and some singing he was dogtired and slept heavily and when presently he was awakened by piercing screams he sat up in a darkness that seemed to belong neither to time nor place  near his feet was an ashen glow that gave no light  his first perplexity gave way to dismay at finding no amanda by his side amanda he cried  her voice floated down through a chink in the floor above what can it be cheetah  then its coming nearer  the screaming continued heartrending eviscerating shrieks benham still confused lit a match all the men about him were stirring or sitting up and listening their faces showing distorted and ugly in the flicker of his light che e he tried no one answered then one by one they stood up and went softly to the ladder that led to the stableroom below benham struck a second match and a third  giorgio he called  the cavasse made an arresting gesture and followed discreetly and noiselessly after the others leaving benham alone in the dark  benham heard their shuffling patter one after the other down the ladder the sounds of a door being unbarred softly and then no other sound but that incessant shrieking in the darkness  had they gone out were they standing at the door looking out into the night and listening  amanda had found the chink and her voice sounded nearer  its a woman she said  the shrieking came nearer and nearer long repeated throattearing shrieks far off there was a great clamour of dogs and there was another sound a whisper  rain  the shrieks seemed to turn into a side street and receded the tension of listening relaxed mens voices sounded below in question and answer dogs close at hand barked shortly and then stopped enquiringly  benham seemed to himself to be sitting alone for an interminable time he lit another match and consulted his watch it was four oclock and nearly dawn  then slowly and stumbling up the ladder the men began to return to benhams room  ask them what it is urged amanda  but for a time not even giorgio would understand benhams questions there seemed to be a doubt whether he ought to know the shrieking approached again and then receded giorgio came and stood a vague thoughtful figure by the embers of the fire explanation dropped from him reluctantly it was nothing some one had been killed that was all it was a vendetta a man had been missing overnight and this morning his brother who had been prowling and searching with some dogs had found him or rather his head it was on this side of the ravine thrown over from the other bank on which the body sprawled stiffly wet through and now growing visible in the gathering daylight yesthe voice was the mans wife it was raining hard there would be shrieking for nine days yes nine days confirmation with the fingers when benham still fought against the facts her friends and relatives would come and shriek too two of the dead mans aunts were among the best keeners in the whole land they could keen marvellously it was raining too hard to go on the road would be impossible in rain yes it was very melancholy her house was close at hand perhaps twenty or thirty women would join her it was impossible to go on until it had stopped raining it would be tiresome but what could one do    7   as they sat upon the parapet of a broken bridge on the road between elbassan and ochrida benham was moved to a dissertation upon the condition of albania and the politics of the balkan peninsula  here we are he said not a week from london and you see the sort of life that men live when the forces of civilization fail we have been close to two murders  two  that little crowd in the square at scutari that was a murder i didnt tell you at the time  but i knew it was said amanda  and you see the filth of it all the toiling discomfort of it all there is scarcely a house here in all the land that is not filthier and viler than the worst slum in london no man ventures far from his village without arms everywhere there is fear the hills are impassable because of the shepherds dogs over those hills a little while ago a stranger was torn to pieces by dogsand partially eaten amanda these dogs madden me i shall let fly at the beasts the infernal indignity of it but that is by the way you see how all this magnificent country lies waste with nothing but this crawling ugly mockery of human life  they sing said amanda  yes said benham and reflected they do sing i suppose singing is the last thing left to men when there is nothing else you can still sit about and sing miners who have been buried in mines will sing people going down in ships  the sussex labourers dont sing said amanda these people sing well  they would probably sing as well if they were civilized even if they didnt i shouldnt care all the rest of their lives is muddle and cruelty and misery look at the women there was that party of bent creatures we met yesterday carrying great bundles carrying even the mens cloaks and pipes while their rascal husbands and brothers swaggered behind look at the cripples we have seen and the mutilated men if we have met one man without a nose we have met a dozen and stunted people all these people are like evil schoolboys they do nothing but malicious mischief there is nothing adult about them but their voices they are like the heroic dreams of young ruffians in a penitentiary you saw that man at scutari in the corner of the bazaar the gorgeous brute you admired him  the man with the gold inlaid pistols and the diamonds on his yataghan he wanted to show them to us  yes you let him see you admired him  i liked the things on his stall  well he has killed nearly thirty people  in duels  good lord no assassinations his shoemaker annoyed him by sending in a bill he went to the mans stall found him standing with his child in his arms and blew out his brains he blundered against a passerby in the road and shot him those are his feats sometimes his pistols go off in the bazaar just by accident  does nobody kill him  i wanted to said benham and became thoughtful for a time i think i ought to have made some sort of quarrel but then as i am an englishman he might have hesitated he would have funked a strange beast like me and i couldnt have shot him if he had hesitated and if he hadnt  but doesnt a blood feud come down on him  it only comes down on his family the shoemakers son thought the matter over and squared accounts by putting the muzzle of a gun into the small of the back of our bullys uncle it was easier that way you see youre dealing with men of thirteen years old or thereabouts the boy who doesnt grow up  but doesnt the law  theres no law only custom and the turkish tax collector  you see this is what men are where there is no power no discipline no ruler no responsibility this is a masterless world this is pure democracy this is the natural state of men this is the world of the bully and the brigand and assassin the world of the mudpelter and brawler the world of the bent woman the world of the flea and the fly the open drain and the baying dog this is what the british sentimentalist thinks a noble state for men  they fight for freedom  they fight among each other there are their private feuds and their village feuds and above all that great feud religion in albania there is only one religion and that is hate but there are three churches for the better cultivation of hate and cruelty the latin the greek and the mahometan  but no one has ever conquered these people  any one could the servians the bulgarians the greeks the italians the austrians why they cant even shoot its just the balance of power and all that foolery keeps this country a roadless wilderness good god how i tire of it these men who swagger and stink their brawling dogs their greasy priests and dervishes the downatheel soldiers the bribery and robbery the cheating over the money  he slipped off the parapet too impatient to sit any longer and began to pace up and down in the road  one marvels that no one comes to clear up this country one itches to be at the job and then one realizes that before one can begin here one must get to work back there where the fools and pedants of welt politik scheme mischief one against another this country frets me i cant see any fun in it cant see the humour of it and the people away there know no better than to play off tribe against tribe sect against sect one peasant prejudice against another over this pass the foolery grows grimmer and viler we shall come to where the servian plots against the bulgarian and the greek against both and the turk with spasmodic massacres and indulgences broods over the brew every division is subdivided there are two sorts of greek church exarchic patriarchic both teaching by threat and massacre and there is no one no one with the sense to override all these squalid hostilities all those fools away there in london and vienna and st petersburg and rome take sides as though these beastly tribes and leagues and superstitions meant anything but blank black damnable ignorance one fool stands up for the catholic albanians another finds heroes in the servians another talks of brave little montenegro or the sturdy bulgarian or the heroic turk there isnt a religion in the whole balkan peninsula there isnt a tribal or national sentiment that deserves a moments respect from a sane man theyre things like niggers noserings and chinese secret societies childish things idiot things that have to go yet there is no one who will preach the only possible peace which is the peace of the worldstate the open conspiracy of all the sane men in the world against the things that break us up into wars and futilities and here am iwho have the lightwandering just wandering  he shrugged his shoulders and came to stare at the torrent under the bridge  youre getting ripe for london cheetah said amanda softly  i want somehow to get to work to get my hands on definite things  how can we get back  she had to repeat her question presently  we can go on over the hills is ochrida and then over another pass is presba and from there we go down into monastir and reach a railway and get back to the world of our own times again    8   but before they reached the world of their own times macedonia was to show them something grimmer than albania  they were riding through a sunlit walnut wood beyond ochrida when they came upon the thing  the first they saw of it looked like a man lying asleep on a grassy bank but he lay very still indeed he did not look up he did not stir as they passed the pose of his hand was stiff and when benham glanced back at him he stifled a little cry of horror for this man had no face and the flies had been busy upon him  benham caught amandas bridle so that she had to give her attention to her steed  ahead he said ahead look a village  why the devil didnt they bury the man why and that fool giorgio and the others were pulling up and beginning to chatter after all she might look back  through the trees now they could see houses he quickened his pace and jerked amandas horse forward  but the village was a still one not a dog barked  here was an incredible village without even a dog  and then then they saw some more people lying about a woman lay in a doorway near her was something muddy that might have been a child beyond were six men all spread out very neatly in a row with their faces to the sky  cheetah cried amanda with her voice going up theyve been killed some one has killed them  benham halted beside her and stared stupidly its a band he said itspropaganda greeks or turks or bulgarians  but their feet and hands are fastened and what have they been doing to them  i want to kill cried benham oh i want to kill people come on amanda it blisters ones eyes come away come away come  her face was white and her eyes terrorstricken she obeyed him mechanically she gave one last look at those bodies  down the deeprutted soil of the village street they clattered they came to houses that had been set on fire  what is that hanging from a tree cried amanda oh oh  come on  behind them rode the others scared and hurrying  the sunlight had become the light of hell there was no air but horror across benhams skies these flyblown trophies of devilry dangled mockingly in the place of god he had no thought but to get away  presently they encountered a detachment of turkish soldiers very greasy and ragged with wornout boots and yellow faces toiling up the stony road belatedly to the village amanda and benham riding one behind the other in a stricken silence passed this labouring column without a gesture but presently they heard the commander stopping and questioning giorgio  then giorgio and the others came clattering to overtake them  giorgio was too full to wait for questions he talked eagerly to benhams silence  it must have happened yesterday he explained they were bulgarianstraitors they had been converted to the patriarchists by the greeksby a greek band that is to say they had betrayed one of their own people now a bulgarian band had descended upon them bulgarian bands it seemed were always particularly rough on bulgarianspeaking patriarchists    9   that night they slept in a dirty little room in a peasants house in resnia and in the middle of the night amanda woke up with a start and heard benham talking he seemed to be sitting up as he talked but he was not talking to her and his voice sounded strange  flies he said in the sunlight  he was silent for a time and then he repeated the same words  then suddenly he began to declaim oh brutes together apes apes with knives have they no lord no master to save them from such things this is the life of men when no man rules when no man rules not even himself it is because we are idle because we keep our wits slack and our wills weak that these poor devils live in hell these things happen here and everywhere when the hand that rules grows weak away in china now they are happening persia africa russia staggers and i who should serve the law i who should keep order wander and make love my god may i never forget may i never forget flies in the sunlight that mans face and those six men  grip the savage by the throat  the weak savage in the foreign office the weak savage at the party headquarters feud and indolence and folly it is all one world this and that are all one thing the spites of london and the mutilations of macedonia the maggots that eat mens faces and the maggots that rot their minds rot their minds rot their minds rot their minds  to amanda it sounded like delirium  cheetah she said suddenly between remonstrance and a cry of terror  the darkness suddenly became quite still he did not move  she was afraid cheetah she said again  what is it amanda  i thought are you all right  quite  but do you feel well  ive got this cold i caught in ochrida i suppose im feverish butyes im well  you were talking  silence for a time  i was thinking he said  you talked  im sorry he said after another long pause    10   the next morning benham had a pink spot on either cheek his eyes were feverishly bright he would touch no food and instead of coffee he wanted water in monastir there will be a doctor he said monastir is a big place in monastir i will see a doctor i want a doctor  they rode out of the village in the freshness before sunrise and up long hills and sometimes they went in the shade of woods and sometimes in a flooding sunshine benham now rode in front preoccupied intent regardless of amanda a stranger and she rode close behind him wondering  when you get to monastir young man she told him inaudibly you will go straight to bed and well see what has to be done with you  ammalato said giorgio confidentially coming abreast of her  medico in monastir said amanda  simolti medici monastir giorgio agreed  then came the inevitable dogs big white brutes three in full cry charging hard at benham and a younger less enterprising beast running along the high bank above yapping and making feints to descend  the goatherd reclining under the shadow of a rock awaited benhams embarrassment with an indolent malice  you uncivilized beasts cried benham and before amanda could realize what he was up to she heard the crack of his revolver and saw a puff of blue smoke drift away above his right shoulder the foremost beast rolled over and the goatherd had sprung to his feet he shouted with something between anger and dismay as benham regardless of the fact that the other dogs had turned and were running back let fly a second time then the goatherd had clutched at the gun that lay on the grass near at hand giorgio was bawling in noisy remonstrance and also getting ready to shoot and the horseowner and his boy were clattering back to a position of neutrality up the stony road bang came a flight of lead within a yard of benham and then the goatherd was in retreat behind a rock and giorgio was shouting avanti avanti to amanda  she grasped his intention and in another moment she had benhams horse by the bridle and was leading the retreat giorgio followed close driving the two baggage mules before him  i am tired of dogs benham said tired to death of dogs all savage dogs must be shot all through the world i am tired  their road carried them down through the rocky pass and then up a long slope in the open far away on the left they saw the goatherd running and shouting and other armed goatherds appearing among the rocks behind them the horseowner and his boy came riding headlong across the zone of danger  dogs must be shot said benham exalted dogs must be shot  unless they are good dogs said amanda keeping beside him with an eye on his revolver  unless they are good dogs to every one said benham  they rushed along the road in a turbulent dusty huddle of horses and mules and riders the horseowner voluble in albanian was trying to get past them his boy pressed behind him giorgio in the rear had unslung his rifle and got it across the front of his saddle far away they heard the sound of a shot and a kind of shudder in the air overhead witnessed to the flight of the bullet they crested a rise and suddenly between the tree boughs monastir was in view a wide stretch of white town with many cypress and plane trees a winding river with many wooden bridges clustering minarets of pink and white a hilly cemetery and scattered patches of soldiers tents like some queer white crop to supplement its extensive barracks  as they hurried down towards this city of refuge a long string of mules burthened with great bales of green stuff appeared upon a convergent track to the left besides the customary muleteers there were by way of an escort a couple of tattered turkish soldiers all these men watched the headlong approach of benhams party with apprehensive inquiry giorgio shouted some sort of information that made the soldiers brighten up and stare up the hill and set the muleteers whacking and shouting at their convoy it struck amanda that giorgio must be telling lies about a bulgarian band in another moment benham and amanda found themselves swimming in a torrent of mules presently they overtook a small flock of fortunately nimble sheep and picked up several dogs dogs that happily disregarded benham in the general confusion they also comprehended a small springless cart two old women with bundles and an elderly greek priest before their dusty barking shouting cavalcade reached the outskirts of monastir the two soldiers had halted behind to cover the retreat  benhams ghastly face was now bedewed with sweat and he swayed in his saddle as he rode this is not civilization amanda he said this is not civilization  and then suddenly with extraordinary pathos  oh i want to go to bed i want to go to bed a bed with sheets  to ride into monastir is to ride into a maze the streets go nowhere in particular at least that was the effect on amanda and benham it was as if monastir too had a temperature and was slightly delirious but at last they found an hotelquite a civilized hotel  the doctor in monastir was an armenian with an ambition that outran his capacity to speak english he had evidently studied the language chiefly from books he thought these was pronounced theser and those was pronounced thoser and that every english sentence should be taken at a rush he diagnosed benhams complaint in various languages and failed to make his meaning clear to amanda one combination of words he clung to obstinately having clearly the utmost faith in its expressiveness to amanda it sounded like may ah slays and it seemed to her that he sought to intimate a probable fatal termination of benhams fever but it was clear that the doctor was not satisfied that she understood he came again with a queer little worn book a parallel vocabulary of halfadozen european languages  he turned over the pages and pointed to a word may ah slays he repeated reproachfully almost bitterly  oh measles cried amanda  so the spirited honeymoon passed its zenith    11   the benhams went as soon as possible down to smyrna and thence by way of uskub tortuously back to italy they recuperated at the best hotel of locarno in golden november weather and just before christmas they turned their faces back to england  benhams plans were comprehensive but entirely vague amanda had not so much plans as intentions     chapter the fifth  the assize of jealousy    1   it was very manifest in the disorder of papers amidst which white spent so many evenings of interested perplexity before this novel began to be written that benham had never made any systematic attempt at editing or revising his accumulation at all there were not only overlapping documents in which he had returned again to old ideas and restated them in the light of fresh facts and an apparent unconsciousness of his earlier effort but there were mutually destructive papers new views quite ousting the old had been tossed in upon the old and the very definition of the second limitation as it had first presented itself to the writer had been abandoned to begin with this second division had been labelled sex in places the heading remained no effective substitute had been chosen for some time but there was a closelywritten memorandum very much erased and written over and amended which showed benhams early dissatisfaction with that crude rendering of what he had in mind this memorandum was tacked to an interrupted fragment of autobiography a manuscript soliloquy in which benham had been discussing his married life  it was not until i had been married for the better part of a year and had spent more than six months in london that i faced the plain issue between the aims i had set before myself and the claims and immediate necessities of my personal life for all that time i struggled not so much to reconcile them as to serve them simultaneously  at that the autobiography stopped short and the intercalary note began  this intercalary note ran as follows  i suppose a mind of my sort cannot help but tend towards simplification towards making all life turn upon some one dominant idea complex perhaps in its reality but reducible at last to one consistent simple statement a dominant idea which is essential as nothing else is essential which makes and sustains and justifies this is perhaps the innate disposition of the human mind at least of the european mindfor i have some doubts about the chinese theology drives obstinately towards an ultimate unity in god science towards an ultimate unity in law towards a fundamental element and a universal material truth from which all material truths evolve and in matters of conduct there is the same tendency to refer to a universal moral law now this may be a simplification due to the need of the human mind to comprehend and its inability to do so until the load is lightened by neglecting factors william james has suggested that on account of this theology may be obstinately working away from the truth that the truth may be that there are several or many in compatible and incommensurable gods science in the same search for unity may follow divergent methods of inquiry into ultimately uninterchangeable generalizations and there may be not only not one universal moral law but no effective reconciliation of the various rights and duties of a single individual at any rate i find myself doubtful to this day about my own personal systems of right and wrong i can never get all my life into one focus it is exactly like examining a rather thick section with a microscope of small penetration sometimes one level is clear and the rest foggy and monstrous and sometimes another  now the ruling me i do not doubt is the man who has set his face to this research after aristocracy and from the standpoint of this research it is my duty to subordinate all other considerations to this work of clearing up the conception of rule and nobility in human affairs this is my aristocratic self what i did not grasp for a long time and which now grows clearer and clearer to me is firstly that this aristocratic self is not the whole of me it has absolutely nothing to do with a pain in my ear or in my heart with a scar on my hand or my memory and secondly that it is not altogether mine whatever knowledge i have of the quality of science whatever will i have towards right is of it but if from without from the reasoning or demonstration or reproof of some one else there comes to me clear knowledge clarified will that also is as it were a part of my aristocratic self coming home to me from the outside how often have i not found my own mind in prothero after i have failed to find it in myself it is to be paradoxical my impersonal personality this being that i have in common with all scientificspirited and aristocraticspirited men this it is that i am trying to get clear from the great limitations of humanity when i assert a truth for the sake of truth to my own discomfort or injury there again is this incompatibility of the aristocratic self and the accepted confused conglomerate self of the unanalyzed man the two have a separate system of obligations ones affections compounded as they are in the strangest way of physical reactions and emotional associations ones implicit pledges to particular people ones involuntary reactions ones pride and jealousy all that one might call the dramatic side of ones life may be in conflict with the definitely seen rightnesses of ones higher use  the writing changed at this point  all this seems to me at once as old as the hills and too new to be true this is like the conflict of the superior man of confucius to control himself it is like the christian battle of the spirit with the flesh it savours of that eternal wrangle between the general and the particular which is metaphysics it was for this aristocratic self for righteousness sake that men have hungered and thirsted and on this point men have left father and mother and child and wife and followed after salvation this worldwide everreturning antagonism has filled the world in every age with hermits and lamas recluses and teachers devoted and segregated lives it is a perpetual effort to get above the simplicity of barbarism whenever men have emerged from the primitive barbarism of the farm and the tribe then straightway there has emerged this conception of a specialized life a little lifted off the earth often for the sake of freedom celibate usually disciplined sometimes directed having a generalized aim beyond personal successes and bodily desires so it is that the philosopher the scientifically concentrated man has appeared often i admit quite ridiculously at first setting out upon the long journey that will end only when the philosopher is king  at first i called my second limitation sex but from the outset i meant more than mere sexual desire lust and lustful imaginings more than personal reactions to beauty and spirited living more even than what is called love on the one hand i had in mind many appetites that are not sexual yet turn to bodily pleasure and on the other there are elements of pride arising out of sex and passing into other regions all the elements of rivalry for example that have strained my first definition to the utmost and i see now that this second limitation as i first imagined it spreads out without any definite boundary to include ones rivalries with old schoolfellows for example ones generosities to beggars and dependents ones desire to avenge an injured friend ones point of honour ones regard for the good opinion of an aunt and ones concern for the health of a pet cat all these things may enrich but they may also impede and limit the aristocratic scheme i thought for a time i would call this illdefined and miscellaneous wilderness of limitation the personal life but at last i have decided to divide this vast territory of difficulties into two subdivisions and make one of these indulgence meaning thereby pleasurable indulgence of sense or feeling and the other a great mass of selfregarding motives that will go with a little stretching under the heading of jealousy i admit motives are continually playing across the boundary of these two divisions i should find it difficult to argue a case for my classification but in practice these two groupings have a quite definite meaning for me there is pride in the latter group of impulses and not in the former the former are always a little apologetic fear indulgence jealousy these are the first three limitations of the soul of man and the greatest of these is jealousy because it can use pride over them the life aristocratic as i conceive it marches to its end it saves itself for the truth rather than sacrifices itself romantically for a friend it justifies vivisection if thereby knowledge is won for ever it upholds that brutus who killed his sons it forbids devotion to women courts of love and all such decay of the chivalrous idea and it resignsso many things that no common man of spirit will resign its intention transcends these things over all the world it would maintain justice order a noble peace and it would do this without indignation without resentment without mawkish tenderness or individualized enthusiasm or any queen of beauty it is of a cold austere quality commanding sometimes admiration but having small hold upon the affections of men so that it is among its foremost distinctions that its heart is steeled  there this odd fragment ended and white was left to resume the interrupted autobiography    2   what moods what passions what nights of despair and gathering storms of anger what sudden cruelties and amazing tendernesses are buried and hidden and implied in every love story what a waste is there of exquisite things so each spring sees a million glorious beginnings a sunlit heaven in every opening leaf warm perfection in every stirring egg hope and fear and beauty beyond computation in every forest tree and in the autumn before the snows come they have all gone of all that incalculable abundance of life of all that hope and adventure excitement and deliciousness there is scarcely more to be found than a soiled twig a dirty seed a dead leaf black mould or a rotting feather  white held the ten or twelve pencilled pages that told how benham and amanda drifted into antagonism and estrangement and as he held it he thought of the laughter and delight they must have had together the exquisite excitements of her eye the racing colour of her cheek the gleams of light upon her skin the flashes of wit between them the sense of discovery the high rare paths they had followed the pools in which they had swum together and now it was all gone into nothingness there was nothing left of it nothing at all but just those sheets of statement and it may be stored away in one single mind like things forgotten in an attic a few neglected faded memories  and even those few sheets of statement were more than most love leaves behind it for a time white would not read them they lay neglected on his knee as he sat back in benhams most comfortable chair and enjoyed an entirely beautiful melancholy  white too had seen and mourned the spring  indeed poor dear he had seen and mourned several springs  with a sigh he took up the manuscript and read benhams desiccated story of intellectual estrangement and how in the end he had decided to leave his wife and go out alone upon that journey of inquiry he had been planning when first he met her    3   amanda had come back to england in a state of extravagantly vigorous womanhood benhams illness though it lasted only two or three weeks gave her a sense of power and leadership for which she had been struggling instinctively ever since they came together for a time at locarno he was laxminded and indolent and in that time she formed her bright and limited plans for london benham had no plans as yet but only a sense of divergence as though he was being pulled in opposite directions by two irresistible forces to her it was plain that he needed occupation some distinguished occupation and she could imagine nothing better for him than a political career she perceived he had personality that he stood out among men so that his very silences were effective she loved him immensely and she had tremendous ambitions for him and through him  and also london the very thought of london filled her with appetite her soul thirsted for london it was like some enormous juicy fruit waiting for her pretty white teeth a place almost large enough to give her avidity the sense of enough she felt it waiting for her household servants a carriage shops and the jolly delight of buying and possessing things the opera firstnights picture exhibitions great dinnerparties brilliant lunch parties crowds seen from a point of vantage the carriage in a long string of fine carriages with the lamplit multitude peering amanda in a thousand bright settings in a thousand various dresses she had had love it had been glorious it was still glorious but her lovemaking became now at times almost perfunctory in the contemplation of these approaching delights and splendours and excitements  she knew indeed that ideas were at work in benhams head but she was a realist she did not see why ideas should stand in the way of a career ideas are a brightness the good looks of the mind one talks ideas but the thing that is is the thing that is and though she believed that benham had a certain strength of character of his own she had that sort of confidence in his love for her and in the power of her endearments that has in it the assurance of a faint contempt she had mingled pride and sense in the glorious realization of the power over him that her wit and beauty gave her she had held him faint with her divinity intoxicated with the pride of her complete possession and she did not dream that the moment when he should see clearly that she could deliberately use these ultimate delights to rule and influence him would be the end of their splendour and her power her nature which was just a nest of vigorous appetites was incapable of suspecting his gathering disillusionment until it burst upon her  now with her attention set upon london ahead he could observe her in the beginning he had never seemed to be observing her at all they dazzled one another it seemed extraordinary now to him to note how much he had been able to disregard there were countless times still when he would have dropped his observation and resumed that mutual exaltation very gladly but always now other things possessed her mind  there was still an immense pleasure for him in her vigour there was something delightful in her pounce even when she was pouncing on things superficial vulgar or destructive she made him understand and share the excitement of a big night at the opera the glitter and prettiness of a smart restaurant the clustering little acute adventures of a great reception of gay people just as she had already made him understand and sympathize with dogs she picked up the art world where he had laid it down and she forced him to feel dense and slow before he rebelled against her multitudinous enthusiasms and admirations south harting had had its little group of artistic people it is not one of your sleepy villages and she slipped back at once into the movement those were the great days of john the days before the post impressionist outbreak john orpen tonks she bought them with vigour artistic circles began to revolve about her very rapidly she was in possession and among other desirable things she had it seemed pounced upon and captured lady marayne  at any rate it was clear that that awful hostile silence and aloofness was to end benham never quite mastered how it was done but amanda had gone in one morning to desborough street very sweetly and chastely dressed had abased herself and announced a possible though subsequently disproved grandchild and she had appreciated the little lady so highly and openly she had so instantly caught and reproduced her tone that her success though only temporary in its completeness was immediate in the afternoon benham was amazed by the apparition of his mother amidst the scattered unsettled furnishings of the new home amanda had chosen in lancaster gate he was in the hall the door stood open awaiting packingcases from a van without in the open doorway she shone looking the smallest of dainty things there was no effect of her coming but only of her having arrived there as a little blue butterfly will suddenly alight on a flower  well poff said lady marayne ignoring abysses what are you up to now poff come and embrace me  no not so she said stiffest of sons  she laid hold of his ears in the old fashion and kissed one eye  congratulations dear little poff oh congratulations in heaps im so glad  now what was that for  and then amanda came out upon the landing upstairs saw the encounter with an involuntary cry of joy and came downstairs with arms wide open it was the first intimation he had of their previous meeting he was for some minutes a stunned entirely inadequate benham    4   at first amanda knew nobody in london except a few people in the hampstead garden suburb that she had not the slightest wish to know and then very quickly she seemed to know quite a lot of people the artistic circle brought in people lady marayne brought in people they spread it was manifest the benhams were a very bright young couple he would certainly do something considerable presently and she was bright and daring jolly to look at and excellent fun and when you came to talk to her astonishingly well informed they passed from one hostesss hand to another they reciprocated the clynes people and the rushtones took her up mr evesham was amused by her lady beach mandarin proclaimed her charm like a trumpet the young liberal people made jealous advances lord moggeridge found she listened well she lit one of the brightest weekend parties lady marayne had ever gathered at chexington and her descriptions of recent danger and adventure in albania not only entertained her hearers but gave her just that flavour of personal courage which completes the fascination of a young woman people in the gaps of a halting dinnertable conversation would ask have you met mrs benham  meanwhile benham appeared to be talking a smiling and successful young woman who a year ago had been nothing more than a leggy girl with a good lot of miscellaneous reading in her head and vaguely engaged or at least friendly to the pitch of engagement to mr rathbonesanders may be forgiven if in the full tide of her success she does not altogether grasp the intention of her husbands discourse it seemed to her that he was obsessed by a responsibility for civilization and the idea that he was aristocratic secretly she was inclined to doubt whether he was justified in calling himself aristocratic at the best his mother was countystuff but still if he did there was no great harm in it nowadays clearly his line was torydemocracy social reform through the house of lords and friendly intimacy with the more spirited young peers and it was only very slowly and reluctantly that she was forced to abandon this satisfactory solution of his problem she reproduced all the equipment and comforts of his finacue street study in their new home she declared constantly that she would rather forego any old social thing than interfere with his work she never made him go anywhere with her without first asking if his work permitted it to relieve him of the burthen of such social attentions she even made a fag or so the making of fags out of manifestly stricken men the keeping of tamed and hopeless admirers seemed to her to be the most natural and reasonable of feminine privileges they did their useful little services until it pleased the lord cheetah to come to his own that was how she put it  but at last he was talking to her in tones that could no longer be ignored he was manifestly losing his temper with her there was a novel austerity in his voice and a peculiar whiteness about his face on certain occasions that lingered in her memory  he was indeed making elaborate explanations he said that what he wanted to do was to understand the collective life of the world and that this was not to be done in a westend study he had an extraordinary contempt it seemed for both sides in the drama of british politics he had extravagant ideas of beginning in some much more fundamental way he wanted to understand this collective life of the world because ultimately he wanted to help control it was there ever such nonsense the practical side of this was serious enough however he was back at his old idea of going round the earth later on that might be rather a jolly thing to do but not until they had struck root a little more surely in london  and then with amazement with incredulity with indignation she began to realize that he was proposing to go off by himself upon this vague extravagant research that all this work she had been doing to make a social place for him in london was as nothing to him that he was thinking of himself as separable from her  but cheetah how can you leave your spotless leopard you would howl in the lonely jungle  possibly i shall but i am going  then i shall come  no he considered her reasons you see you are not interested  but i am  not as i am you would turn it all into a jolly holiday you dont want to see things as i want to do you want romance all the world is a show for you as a show i cant endure it i want to lay hands on it  but cheetah she said this is separation  you will have your life here and i shall come back  but cheetah how can we be separated  we are separated he said  her eyes became round with astonishment then her face puckered  cheetah she cried in a voice of soft distress i love you what do you mean  and she staggered forward tearblinded and felt for his neck and shoulders so that she might weep in his arms    5   dont say we are separated she whispered putting her still wet face close to his  no were mates he answered softly with his arm about her  how could we ever keep away from each uvver she whispered  he was silent  how could we  he answered aloud amanda he said i mean to go round the world  she disentangled herself from his arm and sat up beside him  what is to become of me she asked suddenly in a voice of despair while you go round the world if you desert me in london she said if you shame me by deserting me in london if you leave me i will never forgive you cheetah never then in an almost breathless voice and as if she spoke to herself never in all my days    6   it was after that that amanda began to talk about children there was nothing involuntary about amanda soon she said we must begin to think of children not just now but a little later its good to travel and have our fun but life is unreal until there are children in the background no woman is really content until she is a mother and for nearly a fortnight nothing more was said about that solitary journey round the world  but children were not the only new topic in amandas talk she set herself with an ingenious subtlety to remind her husband that there were other men in the world the convenient fags sometimes a little embarrassed found their inobtrusive services being brought into the light before benhams eyes most of them were much older men than himself elderly philanderers of whom it seemed to him no sane man need be jealous men often of forty or more but one was a contemporary sir philip easton a man with a touch of spanish blood and a suggestion of spanish fire who quite manifestly was very much in love with amanda and of whom she spoke with a slight perceptible difference of manner that made benham faintly uneasy he was ashamed of the feeling easton it seemed was a man of a peculiarly fine honour so that amanda could trust herself with him to an extent that would have been inadvisable with men of a commoner substance and he had a gift of understanding and sympathy that was almost feminine he could cheer one up when one was lonely and despondent for amanda was so methodical in the arrangement of her time that even in the full rush of a london season she could find an hour now and then for being lonely and despondent and he was a liberal and understanding purchaser of the ascendant painters he understood that side of amandas interests a side upon which benham was notably deficient  amanda seems to like that dark boy poff what is his namesir philip easton said lady marayne  benham looked at her with a slightly hostile intelligence and said nothing  when a man takes a wife he has to keep her said lady marayne  no said benham after consideration i dont intend to be a wifeherd  what  wifeherdsame as goatherd  coarse you are sometimes poffnowadays  its exactly what i mean i can understand the kind of curators interest an oriental finds in shepherding a large establishment but to spend my days looking after one person who ought to be able to look after herself  shes very young  shes quite grown up anyhow im not a moral nursemaid  if you leave her about and go abroad  has she been talking to you mother  the thing shows  but about my going abroad  she said something my little poff  lady marayne suddenly perceived that beneath benhams indifference was something strung very tight as though he had been thinking inordinately he weighed his words before he spoke again if amanda chooses to threaten me with a sort of conditional infidelity i dont see that it ought to change the plans i have made for my life    7   no aristocrat has any right to be jealous benham wrote if he chances to be mated with a woman who does not see his vision or naturally go his way he has no right to expect her much less to compel her to go his way what is the use of dragging an unwilling companion through morasses of uncongenial thought to unsought ends what is the use of dragging even a willing pretender who has no inherent will to seek and live the aristocratic life  but that does not excuse him from obedience to his own call  he wrote that very early in his examination of the third limitation already he had thought out and judged amanda the very charm of her the sweetness the nearness and magic of her was making him more grimly resolute to break away all the elaborate process of thinking her over had gone on behind the mask of his silences while she had been preoccupied with her housing and establishment in london it was with a sense of extraordinary injustice of having had a march stolen upon her of being unfairly trapped that amanda found herself faced by foregone conclusions he was ready now even with the details of his project she should go on with her life in london exactly as she had planned it he would take fifteen hundred a year for himself and all the rest she might spend without check or stint as it pleased her he was going round the world for one or two years it was even possible he would not go alone there was a man at cambridge he might persuade to come with him a don called prothero who was peculiarly useful in helping him to hammer out his ideas  to her it became commandingly necessary that none of these things should happen  she tried to play upon his jealousy but her quick instinct speedily told her that this only hardened his heart she perceived that she must make a softer appeal now of a set intention she began to revive and imitate the spontaneous passion of the honeymoon she perceived for the first time clearly how wise and righteous a thing it is for a woman to bear a child he cannot go if i am going to have a child she told herself but that would mean illness and for illness in herself or others amanda had the intense disgust natural to her youth yet even illness would be better than this intolerable publication of her husbands ability to leave her side  she had a wonderful facility of enthusiasm and she set herself forthwith to cultivate a philoprogenitive ambition to communicate it to him her dread of illness disappeared her desire for offspring grew  yes he said i want to have children but i must go round the world none the less  she argued with all the concentrated subtlety of her fine keen mind she argued with persistence and repetition and then suddenly so that she was astonished at herself there came a moment when she ceased to argue  she stood in the dusk in a window that looked out upon the park and she was now so intent upon her purpose as to be still and selfforgetful she was dressed in a dinnerdress of white and pale green that set off her slim erect body and the strong clear lines of her neck and shoulders very beautifully some greenish stones caught a light from without and flashed soft whispering gleams from amidst the misty darkness of her hair she was going to lady marayne and the opera and he was bound for a dinner at the house with some young liberals at which he was to meet two representative indians with a grievance from bengal husband and wife had but a few moments together she asked about his company and he told her  they will tell you about india  yes  she stood for a moment looking out across the lights and the dark green trees and then she turned to him  why cannot i come with you she asked with sudden passion why cannot i see the things you want to see  i tell you you are not interested you would only be interested through me that would not help me i should just be dealing out my premature ideas to you if you cared as i care if you wanted to know as i want to know it would be different but you dont it isnt your fault that you dont it happens so and there is no good in forced interest in prescribed discovery  cheetah she asked what is it that you want to knowthat i dont care for  i want to know about the world i want to rule the world  so do i  no you want to have the world  isnt it the same  no youre a greedier thing than i am you black leopard youstanding there in the dusk youre a stronger thing dont you know youre stronger when i am with you you carry your point because you are more concentrated more definite less scrupulous when you run beside me you push me out of my path youve made me afraid of you and so i wont go with you leopard i go alone it isnt because i dont love you i love you too well it isnt because you arent beautiful and wonderful  but cheetah nevertheless you care more for this that you want than you care for me  benham thought of it i suppose i do he said  what is it that you want still i dont understand  her voice had the break of one who would keep reasonable in spite of pain  i ought to tell you  yes you ought to tell me  i wonder if i can tell you he said very thoughtfully and rested his hands on his hips i shall seem ridiculous to you  you ought to tell me  i think what i want is to be king of the world  she stood quite still staring at him  i do not know how i can tell you of it amanda do you remember those bodiesyou saw those bodiesthose mutilated men  i saw them said amanda  well is it nothing to you that those things happen  they must happen  no they happen because there are no kings but pitiful kings they happen because the kings love their amandas and do not care  but what can you do cheetah  very little but i can give my life and all my strength i can give all i can give  but how how can you help ithelp things like that massacre  i can do my utmost to find out what is wrong with my world and rule it and set it right  you alone  other men do as much every one who does so helps others to do so you see in this world one may wake in the night and one may resolve to be a king and directly one has resolved one is a king does that sound foolishness to you anyhow its fair that i should tell you though you count me a fool thisthis kingshipthis dream of the nightis my life it is the very core of me much more than you are more than anything else can be i mean to be a king in this earth king im not mad i see the world staggering from misery to misery and there is little wisdom less rule folly prejudice limitation the good things come by chance and the evil things recover and slay them and it is my world and i am responsible every man to whom this light has come is responsible as soon as this light comes to you as soon as your kingship is plain to you there is no more rest no peace no delight except in work in service in utmost effort as far as i can do it i will rule my world i cannot abide in this smug city i cannot endure its selfcomplacency its routine its gloss of success its rottenness i shall do little perhaps i shall do nothing but what i can understand and what i can do i will do think of that wild beautiful country we saw and the mean misery the filth and the warring cruelty of the life that lives there tragedy tragedy without dignity and think too of the limitless ugliness here and of russia slipping from disorder to massacre and china that sea of human beings sliding steadily to disaster do you think these are only things in the newspapers to me at any rate they are not things in newspapers they are pain and failure they are torment they are blood and dust and misery they haunt me day and night even if it is utterly absurd i will still do my utmost it is absurd im a madman and you and my mother are sensible people and i will go my way i dont care for the absurdity i dont care a rap  he stopped abruptly  there you have it amanda its rant perhaps sometimes i feel its rant and yet its the breath of life to me there you are at last ive been able to break silence and tell you  he stopped with something like a sob and stood regarding the dusky mystery of her face she stood quite still she was just a beautiful outline in the twilight her face was an indistinctness under the black shadow of her hair with eyes that were two patches of darkness  he looked at his watch lifting it close to his face to see the time his voice changed wellif you provoke a man enough you see he makes speeches let it be a lesson to you amanda here we are talking instead of going to our dinners the car has been waiting ten minutes  amanda so still was the most disconcerting of all amandas  a strange exaltation seized upon her very suddenly in an instant she had ceased to plot against him a vast wave of emotion swept her forward to a resolution that astonished her  cheetah she said and the very quality of her voice had changed give me one thing stay until june with me  why he asked  her answer came in a voice so low that it was almost a whisper  becausenowno i dont want to keep you any morei am not trying to hold you any more i want  she came forward to him and looked up closely at his face  cheetah she whispered almost inaudibly cheetahi didnt understand but now i want to bear your child  he was astonished old leopard he said  no she answered putting her hands upon his shoulders and drawing very close to him queenif i can beto your king  you want to bear me a child he whispered profoundly moved    8   the hindu agitators at the cavernous dinner under the house of commons came to the conclusion that benham was a dreamer and over against amanda at her dinnerparty sat sir sidney umber one of those men who know that their judgments are quoted  who is the beautiful young woman who is seeing visions he asked of his neighbour in confidential undertones  he tittered i think you know she ought to seem just slightly aware that the man to her left is talking to her    9   a few days later benham went down to cambridge where prothero was now a fellow of trinity and brissenden trust lecturer  all through benhams writing there was manifest a persuasion that in some way prothero was necessary to his mind it was as if he looked to prothero to keep him real he suspected even while he obeyed that upward flourish which was his own essential characteristic he had a peculiar feeling that somehow that upward bias would betray him that from exaltation he might presently float off into the higher the better and so to complete unreality he fled from priggishness and the terror of such sublimity alike to prothero moreover in relation to so many things prothero in a peculiar distinctive manner saw he had less selfcontrol than benham less integrity of purpose less concentration and things that were before his eyes were by the very virtue of these defects invariably visible to him things were able to insist upon themselves with him benham on the other hand when facts contradicted his purpose too stoutly had a way of becoming blind to them he repudiated inconvenient facts he mastered and made his world prothero accepted and recorded his benham was a will towards the universe where prothero was a perception and amanda a confusing responsive activity and it was because of his realization of this profound difference between them that he was possessed by the idea of taking prothero with him about the world as a detachable kind of visionrather like that eye the graiae used to hand one another  after the busy sunlit streets of maytime cambridge protheros rooms in trinity their windows full of gothic perspectives and lightsoaked blue sky seemed cool and quiet a flavour of scholarship pervaded thema little blended with the flavour of innumerable breakfasts nearly but not completely forgotten protheros door had been locked against the world and he had appeared after a slight delay looking a little puffy and only apprehending who his visitor was after a resentful stare for the better part of a second he might have been asleep he might have been doing anything but the examination papers he appeared to be doing the two men exchanged personal details they had not met since some months before benham s marriage and the visitors eye went meanwhile from his host to the room and back to his hosts face as though they were all aspects of the thing he was after the prothero humour the earthly touch the distinctive prothero flavour then his eye was caught by a large red incongruous meretriciouslooking volume upon the couch that had an air of having been flung aside venus in gem and marble its cover proclaimed  his host followed that glance and blushed they send me all sorts of inappropriate stuff to review he remarked  and then he was denouncing celibacy  the transition wasnt very clear to benham his mind had been preoccupied by the problem of how to open his own large project meanwhile prothero got as it were the conversational bit between his teeth and bolted he began to say the most shocking things right away so that benhams attention was caught in spite of himself  inflammatory classics  whats that  celibacy my dear benham is maddening me said prothero i cant stand it any longer  it seemed to benham that somewhere very far away in another world such a statement might have been credible even in his own lifeit was now indeed a remote forgotten stagethere had been something distantly akin  youre going to marry  i must  whos the lady billy  i dont know venus  his little redbrown eye met his friends defiantly so far as i know it is venus anadyomene a flash of laughter passed across his face and left it still angrier still more indecorously defiant i like her best anyhow i do indeed but lord i feel that almost any of them  tut tut said benham  prothero flushed deeply but stuck to his discourse  wasnt it always your principle benham to look facts in the face i am not pronouncing an immoral principle your manner suggests i am i am telling you exactly how i feel that is how i feel i wantvenus i dont want her to talk to or anything of that sort i have been studying that book yes that large vulgar red book all the morning instead of doing any work would you like to see it no  this spring benham i tell you is driving me mad it is a peculiarly erotic spring i cannot sleep i cannot fix my mind i cannot attend to ordinary conversation these feelings i understand are by no means peculiar to myself no dont interrupt me benham let me talk now that the spirit of speech is upon me when you came in you said how are you i am telling you how i am you brought it on yourself welli aminflamed i have no strong moral or religious convictions to assist me either to endure or deny thisthis urgency and so why should i deny it its one of our chief problems here the majority of my fellow dons who look at me with secretive faces in hall and court and combinationroom are in just the same case as myself the fever in oneself detects the fever in others i know their hidden thoughts their fishy eyes defy me to challenge their hidden thoughts each covers his miserable secret under the cloak of a wholesome manly indifference a tattered cloak each tries to hide his abandonment to this horrible vice of continence  billy whats the matter with you  prothero grimaced impatience shall i never teach you not to be a humbug benham he screamed and in screaming became calmer nature taunts me maddens me my life is becoming a hell of shame get out from all these books says nature and serve the flesh the flesh benham yesi insistthe flesh do i look like a pure spirit is any man a pure spirit and here am i at cambridge like a lark in a cage with too much port and no aspasia not that i should have liked aspasia  mutual perhaps billy  oh you can sneer  well clearlysaint paul is my authorityits marriage billy  prothero had walked to the window he turned round  i cant marry he said the trouble has gone too far ive lost my nerve in the presence of women i dont like them any more they come at onedone up in a lot of ridiculous clothes and chattering about all sorts of things that dont matter he surveyed his friends thoughtful attitude im getting to hate women benham im beginning now to understand the bitterness of spinsters against men im beginning to grasp the unkindliness of priests the perpetual denial to you happily married a woman is just a human being you can talk to her like her you can even admire her calmly youve got you see no grudge against her  he sat down abruptly  benham upon the hearthrug before the empty fireplace considered him  billy this is delusion he said whats come over you  im telling you said prothero  no said benham  prothero awaited some further utterance  im looking for the cause of it its feeding billy its port and stimulants where there is no scope for action its idleness i begin to see now how much fatter you are how much coarser  idleness look at this pile of examination answers look at that filing system like an arsenal of wisdom useless wisdom i admit but anyhow not idleness  theres still bodily idleness no thats your trouble youre stuffy youve enlarged your liver you sit in this room of a warm morning after an extravagant breakfast and peep and covet  just eggs and bacon  think of it coffee and toast it ought to be come out of it billy and get aired  how can one  easily come out of it now come for a walk you pig  its an infernally warm morning  walk with me to grantchester  we might go by boat you could row  walk  i ought to do these papers  you werent doing them  no  walk with me to grantchester all this affliction of yours ishorridand just nothing at all come out of it i want you to come with me to russia and about the world im going to leave my wife  leave your wife  why not and i came here hoping to find you clearheaded and instead you are in this disgusting state ive never met anything in my life so hot and red and shiny and shameless come out of it man how can one talk to you    10   you pull things down to your own level said benham as they went through the heat to grantchester  i pull them down to truth panted prothero  truth as though being full of gross appetites was truth and discipline and training some sort of falsity  artificiality and begetting pride benham begetting a prigs pride  for a time there was more than the heat of the day between them  the things that benham had come down to discuss were thrust into the background by the impassioned materialism of prothero  im not talking of love he said remaining persistently outrageous im talking of physical needs that first what is the good of arranging systems of morality and sentiment before you know what is physically possible  but how can one disentangle physical and moral necessities  then why dont we up and find out said billy  he had no patience with the secrecy the ignorance the emotion that surrounded these questions we didnt worship our ancestors when it came to building bridges or working metals or curing disease or studying our indigestion and why should we become breathless or wordless with awe and terror when it came to this fundamental affair why here in particular should we give way to holy fear and stifled submission to traditional suppressions and the wisdom of the ages what is the wisdom of the ages said prothero think of the corners where that wisdom was born fleabitten sages in stoneage hovels wandering wise man with a rolling eye a fakir under a tree a jewish sheik an arab epileptic  would you sweep away the experience of mankind protested benham  the experience of mankind in these matters had always been bitter experience most of it was better forgotten it didnt convince it had never worked things out in this matter just as in every other matter that really signified things had still to be worked out nothing had been worked out hitherto the wisdom of the ages was a cant people had been too busy quarrelling fighting and running away there wasnt any digested experience of the ages at all only the misremembered hankeypankey of the dead old man  is this lovemaking a physical necessity for most men and women or isnt it prothero demanded theres a simple question enough and is there anything whatever in your confounded wisdom of the ages to tell me yes or no can an ordinary celibate be as healthy and vigorous as a mated man is a spinster of thirtyeight a healthy human being can she be i dont believe so then why in thunder do we let her be here am i at a centre of learning and wisdom and i dont believe so and there is nothing in all our colleges libraries and roomsfull of wiseacres here to settle that plain question for me plainly and finally my life is a grubby torment of cravings because it isnt settled if sexual activity is a part of the balance of life if it is a necessity well lets set about making it accessible and harmless and have done with it swedish exercises that sort of thing if it isnt if it can be reduced and done without then let us set about teaching people how to control themselves and reduce and get rid of this vehement passion but all this muffled mystery this pompous sneaks way we take with it  but billy how can one settle these things its a matter of idiosyncrasy what is true for one man isnt true for another theres infinite difference of temperaments  then why havent we a classification of temperaments and a moral code for each sort why am i ruled by the way of life that is convenient for rigdon the vegetarian and fits bowler the saint like a glove it isnt convenient for me it fits me like a hairshirt of course there are temperaments but why cant we formulate them and exercise the elementary charity of recognizing that one mans health in these matters is another mans death some want love and gratification and some dont there are people who want children and people who dont want to be bothered by children but who are full of vivid desires there are people whose only happiness is chastity and women who would rather be courtesans than mothers some of us would concentrate upon a single passion or a single idea others overflow with a miscellaneoustenderness yesand you smile why spit upon and insult a miscellaneous tenderness benham why grin at it why try every one by the standards that suit oneself were savages benham shamefaced savages still shamefaced and persecuting  i was angry about sex by seventeen he went on every year i live i grow angrier  his voice rose to a squeal of indignation as he talked  think he said of the amount of thinking and feeling about sex that is going on in cambridge this morning the hundreds out of these thousands full of it a vast tank of cerebration and we put none of it together we work nothing out from that but poor little couplings and casual stories patchings up of situations misbehaviours blunders disease trouble escapes and the next generation will start and the next generation after that will start with nothing but your wisdom of the ages which isnt wisdom at all which is just awe and funk taboos and mystery and the secretive cunning of the savage  what i really want to do is my work said prothero going off quite unexpectedly again that is why all this business this incessant craving and the shame of it and all makes me so infernally angry    11   there im with you cried benham struggling out of the thick torrent of protheros prepossessions what we want to do is our work  he clung to his idea he raised his voice to prevent prothero getting the word again  its this that you call work that i callwhat do i call itliving the aristocratic life which takes all the coarse simplicity out of this business if it was only submission you think it is only submissiongiving way it isnt only submission wed manage sex all right wed be the happy swine our senses would make us if we didnt know all the time that there was something else to live for something far more important and different absolutely different and contradictory so different that it cuts right across all these considerations it wont fit in i dont know what this other thing is its what i want to talk about with you but i know that it is in all my bones you know it demands control it demands continence it insists upon disregard  but the ideas of continence and disregard were unpleasant ideas to prothero that day  mankind said benham is overcharged with this sex it suffocates us it gives life only to consume it we struggle out of the urgent necessities of a mere animal existence we are not so much living as being married and given in marriage all life is swamped in the love story  man is only overcharged because he is unsatisfied said prothero sticking stoutly to his own view    12   it was only as they sat at a little table in the orchard at grantchester after their lunch that benham could make head against prothero and recover that largeness of outlook which had so easily touched the imagination of amanda and then he did not so much dispose of protheros troubles as soar over them it is the last triumph of the human understanding to sympathize with desires we do not share and to benham who now believed himself to be loved beyond the chances of life who was satisfied and tranquil and austerely content it was impossible that protheros demands should seem anything more than the grotesque and squalid squealings of the beast that has to be overridden and rejected altogether it is a freakish fact of our composition that these most intense feelings in life are just those that are most rapidly and completely forgotten hate one may recall for years but the magic of love and the flame of desire serve their purpose in our lives and vanish leaving no trace like the snows of venice benham was still not a year and a half from the meretricious delights of mrs skelmersdale and he looked at prothero as a marble angel might look at a swine in its sty  what he had now in mind was an expedition to russia when at last he could sufficiently release protheros attention he unfolded the project that had been developing steadily in him since his honeymoon experience  he had discovered a new reason for travelling the last country we can see clearly he had discovered is our own country it is as hard to see ones own country as it is to see the back of ones head it is too much behind us too much ourselves but russia is like england with everything larger more vivid cruder one felt that directly one walked about st petersburg st petersburg upon its neva was like a savage untamed london on a larger thames they were seagullhaunted tidal cities like no other capitals in europe the shipping and buildings mingled in their effects like london it looked over the heads of its own people to a limitless polyglot empire and russia was an aristocratic land with a middleclass that had no pride in itself as a class it had a british toughness and incompetence a british disregard of logic and meticulous care russia like england was outside catholic christendom it had a state church and the opposition to that church was not secularism but dissent one could draw a score of such contrasted parallels and now it was in a state of intolerable stress that laid bare the elemental facts of a great social organization it was having its south african war its war at the other end of the earth with a certain defeat instead of a dubious victory  there is far more freedom for the personal life in russia than in england said prothero a little irrelevantly  benham went on with his discourse about russia  at the college of troitzka said prothero which i understand is a kind of monster trinity unencumbered by a university binns tells me that although there is a profession of celibacy within the walls the arrangements of the town and more particularly of the various hotels are conceived in a spirit of extreme liberality  benham hardly attended at all to these interruptions  he went on to point out the elemental quality of the russian situation he led up to the assertion that to go to russia to see russia to try to grasp the broad outline of the russian process was the manifest duty of every responsible intelligence that was free to do as much and so he was going and if prothero cared to come too  yes said prothero i should like to go to russia    13   but throughout all their travel together that summer benham was never able to lift prothero away from his obsession it was the substance of their talk as the holland boat stood out past waiting destroyers and winking beacons and the lights of harwich into the smoothly undulating darkness of the north sea it rose upon them again as they sat over the cakes and cheese of a dutch breakfast in the express for berlin prothero filled the sieges allee with his complaints against nature and society and distracted benham in his contemplation of polish agriculture from the windows of the train with turgid sexual liberalism so that benham during this period until prothero left him and until the tragic enormous spectacle of russia in revolution took complete possession of him was as it were thinking upon two floors upon the one he was thinking of the vast problems of a society of a hundred million people staggering on the verge of anarchy and upon the other he was perplexed by the feverish inattention of prothero to the tremendous things that were going on all about them it was only presently when the serenity of his own private life began to be ruffled by disillusionment that he began to realize the intimate connexion of these two systems of thought yet prothero put it to him plainly enough  inattentive said prothero of course i am inattentive what is really the matter with all thisthis social mess people are in here is that nearly everybody is inattentive these big things of yours nobody is thinking of them really everybody is thinking about the near things that concern himself  the bombs they threw yesterday the cossacks and the whips  nudges gestures of inattention if everybody was thinking of the res publica would there be any need for bombs  he pursued his advantage its all nonsense to suppose people think of politics because they are in em as well suppose that the passengers on a liner understand the engines or soldiers a war before men can think of tomorrow they must think of today before they can think of others they must be sure about themselves first of all food the private the personal economic worry am i safe for food then sex and until one is tranquil and not ashamed not irritated and dissatisfied how can one care for other people or for next year or the order of the world how can one benham  he seized the illustration at hand here we are in warsawnot a month after bombthrowing and cossack charging windows have still to be mended smashed doors restored theres bloodstains still on some of the houses there are hundreds of people in the citadel and in the ochrana prison this morning there were executions is it anything more than an eddy in the real life of the place watch the customers in the shops the crowd in the streets the men in the cafes who stare at the passing women they are all swallowed up again in their own business they just looked up as the cossacks galloped past they just shifted a bit when the bullets spat  and when the streets of moscow were agog with the grotesque amazing adventure of the potemkin mutineers prothero was in the full tide of the private romance that severed him from benham and sent him back to cambridgechanged  before they reached moscow benham was already becoming accustomed to disregard prothero he was looking over him at the vast heaving trouble of russia which now was like a sea that tumbles under the hurrying darknesses of an approaching storm in those days it looked as though it must be an overwhelming storm he was drinking in the wide and massive russian effects the drifting crowds in the entangling streets the houses with their strange lettering in black and gold the innumerable barbaric churches the wildly driven droshkys the sombre red fortress of the kremlin with its bulbous churches clustering up into the sky the crosses the innumerable gold crosses the mad church of st basil carrying the russian note beyond the pitch of permissible caricature and in this setting the obscure drama of clustering staring sashwearing peasants longhaired students saneeyed women a thousand varieties of uniform a running and galloping to and fro of messengers a flutter of little papers whispers shouts shots a drama elusive and portentous a gathering of forces an accumulation of tension going on to a perpetual clash and clamour of bells benham had brought letters of introduction to a variety of people some had vanished it seemed they were away the porters said and they continued to be awayit was the formula he learnt for arrest others were evasive a few showed themselves extraordinarily anxious to inform him about things to explain themselves and things about them exhaustively one young student took him to various meetings and showed him in great detail the scene of the recent murder of the grand duke sergius the buildings opposite the old french cannons were still under repair the assassin stood just here the bomb fell there look right down there towards the gate that was where they found his arm he was torn to fragments he was scraped up he was mixed with the horses  every one who talked spoke of the outbreak of revolution as a matter of days or at the utmost weeks and whatever question benham chose to ask these talkers were prepared to answer except one and after the revolution he asked what then then they waved their hands and failed to convey meanings by reassuring gestures  he was absorbed in his effort to understand this universal ominous drift towards a conflict he was trying to piece together a process if it was one and the same process which involved riots in lodz fighting at libau wild disorder at odessa remote colossal battlings in manchuria the obscure movements of a disastrous fleet lost somewhere now in the indian seas steaming clumsily to its fate he was trying to rationalize it all in his mind to comprehend its direction he was struggling strenuously with the obscurities of the language in which these things were being discussed about him a most difficult language demanding new sets of visual images because of its strange alphabet is it any wonder that for a time he failed to observe that prothero was involved in some entirely disconnected affair  they were staying at the big cosmopolis bazaar in the theatre square thither through the doors that are opened by distraughtlooking men with peacocks feathers round their caps came benhams friends and guides to take him out and show him this and that at first prothero always accompanied benham on these expeditions then he began to make excuses he would stay behind in the hotel then when benham returned prothero would have disappeared when the porter was questioned about prothero his nescience was profound  one night no prothero was discoverable at any hour and benham who wanted to discuss a project for going on to kieff and odessa was alarmed  moscow is a late place said benhams student friend you need not be anxious until after four or five in the morning it will be quite timequite time to be anxious tomorrow he may beclose at hand  when benham hunted up prothero in his room next morning he found him sleepy and irritable  i dont trouble if you are late said prothero sitting up in his bed with a red resentful face and crumpled hair i wasnt born yesterday  i wanted to talk about leaving moscow  i dont want to leave moscow  but odessaodessa is the centre of interest just now  i want to stay in moscow  benham looked baffled  prothero stuck up his knees and rested his nightshirted arms upon them i dont want to leave moscow he said and im not going to do so  but havent we done  prothero interrupted you may but i havent were not after the same things things that interest you benham dont interest me ive founddifferent things  his expression was extraordinarily defiant  i want he went on to put our affairs on a different footing now youve opened the matter we may as well go into it you were good enough to bring me here there was a sort of understanding we were working together we arent the long and short of it is benham i want to pay you for my journey here and go on my ownindependently  his eye and voice achieved a fierceness that benham found nearly incredible in him  something that had got itself overlooked in the press of other matters jerked back into benhams memory it popped back so suddenly that for an instant he wanted to laugh he turned towards the window picked his way among protheros carelessly dropped garments and stood for a moment staring into the square with its drifting assembling and dispersing fleet of trains and its long line of bluecoated izvoshtchiks then he turned  billy he said didnt i see you the other evening driving towards the hermitage  yes said prothero and added thats it  you were with a lady  and she is a lady said prothero so deeply moved that his face twitched as though he was going to weep  shes a russian  she had an english mother oh you neednt stand there and look so damned ironical shesshes a woman shes a thing of kindness  he was too full to go on  billy old boy said benham distressed i dont want to be ironical  prothero had got his voice again  youd better know he said youd better know shes one of those women who live in this hotel  live in this hotel  on the fourth floor didnt you know its the way in most of these big russian hotels they come down and sit about after lunch and dinner a woman with a yellow ticket oh i dont care i dont care a rap shes been kind to me shesshes dear to me how are you to understand i shall stop in moscow i shall take her to england i cant live without her benham and then and then you come worrying me to come to your damned odessa  and suddenly this extraordinary young man put his hands to his face as though he feared to lose it and would hold it on and after an apoplectic moment burst noisily into tears they ran between his fingers get out of my room he shouted suffocatingly what business have you to come prying on me  benham sat down on a chair in the middle of the room and stared roundeyed at his friend his hands were in his pockets for a time he said nothing  billy he began at last and stopped again billy in this country somehow one wants to talk like a russian billy my dearim not your father im not your judge imunreasonably fond of you its not my business to settle what is right or wrong for you if you want to stay in moscow stay in moscow stay here and stay as my guest  he stopped and remained staring at his friend for a little space  i didnt know said prothero brokenly i didnt know it was possible to get so fond of a person  benham stood up he had never found prothero so attractive and so abominable in his life before  i shall go to odessa alone billy ill make things all right here before i go  he closed the door behind him and went in a state of profound thought to his own room  presently prothero came to him with a vague inopportune desire to explain what so evidently did not need explaining he walked about the room trying ways of putting it while benham packed  in an unaccountable way protheros bristling little mind seemed to have shrunken to something sleek and small  i wish he said you could stay for a later train and have lunch and meet her shes not the ordinary thing shesdifferent  benham plumbed depths of wisdom billy he said no woman is the ordinary thing they are alldifferent    14   for a time this affair of protheros seemed to be a matter as disconnected from the research magnificent as one could imagine any matter to be while benham went from moscow and returned and travelled hither and thither and involved himself more and more in the endless tangled threads of the revolutionary movement in russia prothero was lost to all those large issues in the development of his personal situation he contributed nothing to benhams thought except attempts at discouragement he reiterated his declaration that all the vast stress and change of russian national life was going on because it was universally disregarded i tell you as i told you before that nobody is attending you think because all moscow all russia is in the picture that everybody is concerned nobody is concerned nobody cares what is happening even the men who write in newspapers and talk at meetings about it dont care they are thinking of their dinners of their clothes of their money of their wives they hurry home  that was his excuse  manifestly it was an excuse  his situation developed into remarkable complications of jealousy and divided counsels that benham found altogether incomprehensible to benham in those days everything was very simple in this business of love the aristocrat had to love ideally that was all he had to love amanda he and amanda were now very deeply in love again more in love he felt than they had ever been before they were now writing loveletters to each other and enjoying a separation that was almost voluptuous she found in the epistolatory treatment of her surrender to him and to the natural fate of women a delightful exercise for her very considerable powers of expression life pointed now wonderfully to the great time ahead when there would be a cheetah cub in the world and meanwhile the cheetah loped about the wild world upon a mighty quest in such terms she put it such foolishness written in her invincibly square and youthful hand went daily from london to russia and stacked up against his return in the porters office at the cosmopolis bazaar or pursued him down through the jarring disorders of southwest russia or waited for him at illchosen postoffices that deflected his journeyings wastefully or in several instances went altogether astray perhaps they supplied selfeducating young strikers in the postal service with useful exercises in the deciphering of manuscript english he wrote back five hundred different ways of saying that he loved her extravagantly  it seemed to benham in those days that he had found the remedy and solution of all those sexual perplexities that distressed the world heroic love to its highest noteand then you go about your business it seemed impossible not to be happy and lift ones chin high and diffuse a bracing kindliness among the unfortunate multitudes who stewed in affliction and hate because they had failed as yet to find this simple culminating elucidation and protheroprothero too was now achieving the same grand elementariness out of his lusts and protests and general physical squalor he had flowered into love for a time it is true it made rather an ineffective companion of him but this was the mere goosestepping for the triumphal march this way ultimately lay exaltation benham had had as yet but a passing glimpse of this anglorussian who was a lady and altogether unlike her fellows he had seen her for a doubtful second or so as she and prothero drove past him and his impression was of a rather little creature whitefaced with dusky hair under a red cap paler and smaller but with something in her a quiet alertness that gave her a touch of kinship with amanda and if she liked old prothero and indeed she must like old prothero or could she possibly have made him so deeply in love with her  they must stick to each other and then presently protheros soul would wake up and face the world again what did it matter what she had been  through stray shots and red conflict long tediums of strained anxiety and the physical dangers of a barbaric country staggering towards revolution benham went with his own love like a lamp within him and this affair of protheros reflecting its light and he was quite prepared for the most sympathetic and liberal behaviour when he came back to moscow to make the ladys acquaintance he intended to help prothero to marry and take her back to cambridge and to assist by every possible means in destroying and forgetting the official yellow ticket that defined her status in moscow but he reckoned without either prothero or the young lady in this expectation  it only got to him slowly through his political preoccupations that there were obscure obstacles to this manifest course prothero hesitated the lady expressed doubts  on closer acquaintance her resemblance to amanda diminished it was chiefly a similarity of complexion she had a more delicate face than amanda and its youthful brightness was deadened she had none of amandas glow and she spoke her mothers language with a pretty halting limp that was very different from amandas clear decisions  she put her case compactly  i would not do in cambridge she said with an infinitesimal glance at prothero  mr benham she said and her manner had the gravity of a woman of affairs now do you see me in cambridge now do you see me kept outside the walls in a little datcha with no occupation just to amuse him  and on another occasion when prothero was not with her she achieved still completer lucidity  i would come if i thought he wanted me to come she said but you see if i came he would not want me to come because then he would have me and so he wouldnt want me he would just have the trouble and i am not sure if i should be happy in cambridge i am not sure i should be happy enough to make him happy it is a very learned and intelligent and charming society of course but here things happen at cambridge nothing happensthere is only education there is no revolution in cambridge there are not even sinful people to be sorry for and he says himself that cambridge people are particular he says they are liberal but very very particular and perhaps i could not always act my part well sometimes i am not always well behaved when there is music i behave badly sometimes or when i am bored he says the cambridge people are so liberal that they do not mind what you are but he says they are so particular that they mind dreadfully how you are what you are so that it comes to exactly the same thing  anna alexievna said benham suddenly are you in love with prothero  her manner became conscientiously scientific  he is very kind and very generoustoo generous he keeps sending for more moneyhundreds of roubles i try to prevent him  were you ever in love  of course but its all gone long ago it was like being hungry only very fine hungry exquisite hungry and then being disgusted  he is in love with you  what is love said anna he is grateful he is by nature grateful she smiled a smile like the smile of a pale madonna who looks down on her bambino  and you love nothing  i love russiaand being alone being completely alone when i am dead perhaps i shall be alone not even my own body will touch me then  then she added but i shall be sorry when he goes  afterwards benham talked to prothero alone your anna he said is rather wonderful at first i tell you now frankly i did not like her very much i thought she looked used she drank vodka at lunch she was gay uneasily she seemed a sham thing all that was prejudice she thinks shes generous shes fine  shes tragic said prothero as though it was the same thing  he spoke as though he noted an objection his next remark confirmed this impression thats why i cant take her back to cambridge he said  you see benham he went on shes human shes not really feminine i mean shesunsexed she isnt fitted to be a wife or a mother any more weve talked about the possible life in england very plainly ive explained what a household in cambridge would mean it doesnt attract her in a way shes been let out from womanhood forced out of womanhood and i see now that when women are let out from womanhood theres no putting them back i could give a lecture on anna i see now that if women are going to be wives and mothers and homekeepers and ladies they must be got ready for it from the beginning sheltered never really let out into the wild chances of life she has been bitterly shes really emancipated and its let her out into a sort of nothingness shes no longer a woman and she isnt a man she ought to be able to go on her ownlike a man but i cant take her back to cambridge even for her sake  his perplexed eyes regarded benham  you wont be happy in cambridgealone said benham  oh damnably not but what can i do i had at first some idea of coming to moscow for goodteaching  he paused impossible im worth nothing here i couldnt have kept her  then what are you going to do billy  i dont know what im going to do i tell you i live for the moment tomorrow we are going out into the country  i dont understand said benham with a gesture of resignation it seems to me that if a man and woman love each otherwell they insist upon each other what is to happen to her if you leave her in moscow  damnation is there any need to ask that  take her to cambridge man and if cambridge objects teach cambridge better manners  protheros face was suddenly transfigured with rage  i tell you she wont come he said  billy said benham you should make her  i cant  if a man loves a woman he can make her do anything  but i dont love her like that said prothero shrill with anger i tell you i dont love her like that  then he lunged into further deeps its the other men he said its the things that have been dont you understand cant you understand the memoriesshe must have memoriesthey come between us its something deeper than reason its in ones spine and under ones nails one could do anything i perceive for ones very own woman  make her your very own woman said the exponent of heroic love  i shirk deeds benham but you shirk facts how could any man make her his very own woman now youyou dont seem to understandanything shes nobodys womanfor ever thatthat mighthavebeen has gone for ever its nervesa passion of the nerves theres a cruelty in life and shes kind to me shes so kind to me  and then again prothero was weeping like a vexed child    15   the end of protheros first love affair came to benham in broken fragments in letters when he looked for anna alexievna in decemberhe never learnt her surnamehe found she had left the cosmopolis bazaar soon after protheros departure and he could not find whither she had gone he never found her again moscow and russia had swallowed her up  of course she and prothero parted that was a foregone conclusion but protheros manner of parting succeeded in being at every phase a shock to benhams ideas it was clear he went off almost callously it would seem there was very little crying towards the end it was evident that the two had quarrelled the tears only came at the very end of all it was almost as if he had got through the passion and was glad to go then came regret a regret that increased in geometrical proportion with every mile of distance  in warsaw it was that grief really came to prothero he had some hours there and he prowled the crowded streets seeing girls and women happy with their lovers abroad upon bright expeditions and full of delicious secrets girls and women who ever and again flashed out some instant resemblance to anna  in berlin he stopped a night and almost decided that he would go back but now i had the damned frontier he wrote between us  it was so entirely in the spirit of prothero benham thought to let the damned frontier tip the balance against him  then came a scrawl of passionate confession so passionate that it seemed as if prothero had been transfigured i cant stand this business he wrote it has things in it possibilities of emotional disturbanceyou can have no idea in the trainluckily i was alone in the compartmenti sat and thought and suddenly i could not help it i was weepingnoisy weeping an uproar a beastly german came and stood in the corridor to stare i had to get out of the train it is disgraceful it is monstrous we should be made like this  here i am stranded in hanover with nothing to do but to write to you about my dismal feelings  after that surely there was nothing before a brokenhearted prothero but to go on with his trailing wing to trinity and a life of inappeasable regrets but again benham reckoned without the invincible earthliness of his friend prothero stayed three nights in paris  there is an extraordinary excitement about paris he wrote a levity i suspect the gypsum in the subsoilsome as yet undescribed radiations suddenly the world looks brightly cynical none of those tearcompelling german emanations  and benham i have found a friend  a woman of course you will laugh you will sneer you do not understand these things yet they are so simple it was the strangest accident brought us together there was something that drew us together a sort of instinct near the boulevard poissoniere  good heavens said benham a sort of instinct  i told her all about anna  good lord cried benham  she understood perfectly none of your socalled respectable women could have understood at first i intended merely to talk to her  benham crumpled the letter in his hand  little anna alexievna he said you were too clean for him    16   benham had a vision of prothero returning from all this foreign travel meekly pensively a little sadly and yet not without a kind of relief to the grey mildness of trinity he saw him capped and gowned and restored to academic dignity again nodding greetings resuming friendships  the little man merged again into his rare company of discreet benedicts and restrained celibates at the high tables they ate on in their mature wisdom long after the undergraduates had fled presently they would withdraw processionally to the combination room  there would be much to talk about over the wine  benham speculated what account prothero would give of moscow  he laughed abruptly  and with that laugh prothero dropped out of benhams world for a space of years there may have been other letters but if so they were lost in the heaving troubles of a revolutionstrained postoffice perhaps to this day they linger sere and yellow in some forgotten pigeonhole in kishinev or ekaterinoslav    17   in november after an adventure in the traders quarter of kieff which had brought him within an inch of death and because an emotional wave had swept across him and across his correspondence with amanda benham went back suddenly to england and her he wanted very greatly to see her and also he wanted to make certain arrangements about his property he returned by way of hungary and sent telegrams like shouts of excitement whenever the train stopped for a sufficient time old leopard i am coming i am coming he telegraphed announcing his coming for the fourth time it was to be the briefest of visits very passionate the mutual refreshment of two noble lovers and then he was returning to russia again  amanda was at chexington and there he found her installed in the utmost dignity of expectant maternity like many other people he had been a little disposed to regard the bearing of children as a common human experience at chexington he came to think of it as a rare and sacramental function amanda had become very beautiful in quiet grey dovelike tones her suntouched boys complexion had given way to a soft glow of the utmost loveliness her brisk little neck that had always reminded him of the stalk of a flower was now softened and rounded her eyes were tender and she moved about the place in the manner of one who is vowed to a great sacrifice she dominated the scene and lady marayne with a certain astonishment in her eyes and a smouldering disposition to irony was the halfsympathetic halfresentful priestess of her daughterinlaws unparalleled immolation the motif of motherhood was everywhere and at his bedside he foundit had been put there for him by amandaamong much other exaltation of womans mission that most wonderful of all philoprogenitive stories hudsons crystal age  everybody at chexington had an air of being grouped about the impending fact an epidemic of internal troubles it is true kept sir godfrey in the depths of london society but to make up for his absence mrs morris had taken a little cottage down by the river and the wilder girls were with her both afire with fine and subtle feelings and both it seemed and more particularly betty prepared to be keenly critical of benhams attitude  he did a little miss his cue in these exaltations because he had returned in a rather different vein of exaltation  in missing it he was assisted by amanda herself who had at moments an effect upon him of a priestess confidentially disrobed it was as if she put aside for him something official something sincerely maintained necessary but at times a little irksome it was as if she was glad to take him into her confidence and unbend within the prenatal amanda an impish amanda still lingered  there were aspects of amanda that it was manifest dear betty must never know  but the real amanda of that november visit even in her most unpontifical moods did not quite come up to the imagined amanda who had drawn him home across europe at times she was extraordinarily jolly they had two or three happy walks about the chexington woods that year the golden weather of october had flowed over into november and except for a carpet of green and gold under the horsechestnuts most of the leaves were still on the trees gleams of her old wanton humour shone on him and then would come something else something like a shadow across the world something he had quite forgotten since his idea of heroic love had flooded him something that reminded him of those long explanations with mr rathbonesanders that had never been explained and of the curate in the doorway of the cottage and his unaccountable tears  on the afternoon of his arrival at chexington he was a little surprised to find sir philip easton coming through the house into the garden with an accustomed familiarity sir philip perceived him with a start that was instantly controlled and greeted him with unnatural ease  sir philip it seemed was fishing and reading and playing cricket in the neighbourhood which struck benham as a poor way of spending the summer the sort of soft holiday a man learns to take from scholars and literary men a man like sir philip he thought ought to have been aviating or travelling  moreover when sir philip greeted amanda it seemed to benham that there was a flavour of established association in their manner but then sir philip was also very assiduous with lady marayne she called him pip and afterwards amanda called across the tenniscourt to him pip and then he called her amanda when the wilder girls came up to join the tennis he was just as brotherly  the next day he came to lunch  during that meal benham became more aware than he had ever been before of the peculiar deep expressiveness of this young mans eyes they watched him and they watched amanda with a solicitude that seemed at once pained and tender and there was something about amanda a kind of hard brightness an impartiality and an air of something undefinably suspended that gave benham an intuitive certitude that that afternoon sir philip would be spoken to privately and that then he would pack up and go away in a state of illumination from chexington but before he could be spoken to he contrived to speak to benham  they were left to smoke after lunch and then it was he took advantage of a pause to commit his little indiscretion  mrs benham he said looks amazingly wellextraordinarily well dont you think  yes said benham startled yes she certainly keeps very well  she misses you terribly said sir philip it is a time when a woman misses her husband but of course she does not want to hamper your work  benham felt it was very kind of him to take so intimate an interest in these matters but on the spur of the moment he could find no better expression for this than a grunt  you dont mind said the young man with a slight catch in the breath that might have been apprehensive that i sometimes bring her books and flowers and things do what little i can to keep life interesting down here its not very congenial shes so wonderfuli think she is the most wonderful woman in the world  benham perceived that so far from being a modern aristocrat he was really a primitive barbarian in these matters  ive no doubt he said that my wife has every reason to be grateful for your attentions  in the little pause that followed benham had a feeling that sir philip was engendering something still more personal if so he might be constrained to invert very gently but very firmly the bowl of chrysanthemums over sir philips head or kick him in an improving manner he had a ridiculous belief that sir philip would probably take anything of the sort very touchingly he scrambled in his mind for some remark that would avert this possibility  have you ever been in russia he asked hastily it is the most wonderful country in europe i had an odd adventure near kiev during a pogrom  and he drowned the developing situation in a flood of description  but it was not so easy to drown the little things that were presently thrown out by lady marayne they were so much more in the air    18   sir philip suddenly got out of the picture even as benham had foreseen  easton has gone away he remarked three days later to amanda  i told him to go he is a bore with you about but otherwise he is rather a comfort cheetah she meditated upon sir philip and hes an honourable man she said hes safe    19   after that visit it was that the notes upon love and sex began in earnest the scattered memoranda upon the perfectness of heroic love for the modern aristocrat ended abruptly instead there came the first draft for a study of jealousy the note was written in pencil on chexington notepaper and manifestly that had been supported on the ribbed cover of a book there was a little computation in the corner converting fortyfive degrees reaumur into degrees fahrenheit which made white guess it had been written in the red sea but indeed it had been written in a rather amateurishly stoked corridortrain on benhams journey to the gathering revolt in moscow  i think i have been disposed to underrate the force of sexual jealousy i thought it was something essentially contemptible something that one dismissed and put behind oneself in the mere effort to be aristocratic but i begin to realize that it is not quite so easily settled with  one likes to know possibly one wants to know too much in phases of fatigue and particularly in phases of sleeplessness when one is leaving all that one cares for behind it becomes an irrational torment  and it is not only in oneself that i am astonished by the power of this base motive i see too in the queer business of prothero how strongly jealousy how strongly the sense of proprietorship weighs with a man  there is no clear reason why one should insist upon another human being being ones ownest ownutterly ones own  there is of course no clear reason for most human motives  one does  there is something dishonouring in distrustto both the distrusted and the one who distrusts  after that apparently it had been too hot and stuffy to continue    20   benham did not see amanda again until after the birth of their child he spent his christmas in moscow watching the outbreak the fitful fighting and the subsequent breakup of the revolution and taking care of a lost and helpless english family whose father had gone astray temporarily on the way home from baku then he went southward to rostov and thence to astrakhan here he really began his travels he determined to get to india by way of herat and for the first time in his life rode out into an altogether lawless wilderness he went on obstinately because he found himself disposed to funk the journey and because discouragements were put in his way he was soon quite cut off from all the ways of living he had known he learnt what it is to be fleabitten saddlesore hungry and above all thirsty he was haunted by a dread of fever and so contrived strange torments for himself with overdoses of quinine he ceased to be traceable from chexington in march and he reappeared in the form of a telegram from karachi demanding news in may he learnt he was the father of a manchild and that all was well with amanda  he had not expected to be so long away from any communication with the outer world and something in the nature of a stricken conscience took him back to england he found a second william porphyry in the world dominating chexington and amanda tenderly triumphant and passionate the madonna enthroned for william porphyry he could feel no emotion william porphyry was very red and ugly and protesting feeble and aggressive a matter for a skilled nurse to see him was to ignore him and dispel a dream it was to amanda benham turned again  for some days he was content to adore his madonna and listen to the familiar flatteries of her love he was a leaner riper man amanda said and wiser so that she was afraid of him  and then he became aware that she was requiring him to stay at her side we have both had our adventures she said which struck him as an odd phrase  it forced itself upon his obstinate incredulity that all those conceptions of heroic love and faithfulness he had supposed to be so clearly understood between them had vanished from her mind she had absolutely forgotten that twilight moment at the window which had seemed to him the crowning instant the real marriage of their lives it had gone it had left no recoverable trace in her and upon his interpretations of that he had loved her passionately for a year she was back at exactly the ideas and intentions that ruled her during their first settlement in london she wanted a joint life in the social world of london she demanded his presence his attention the daily practical evidences of love it was all very well for him to be away when the child was coming but now everything was different now he must stay by her  this time he argued no case these issues he had settled for ever even an indignant dissertation from lady marayne a dissertation that began with appeals and ended in taunts did not move him behind these things now was india the huge problems of india had laid an unshakeable hold upon his imagination he had seen russia and he wanted to balance that picture by a vision of the east  he saw easton only once during a weekend at chexington the young man displayed no further disposition to be confidentially sentimental but he seemed to have something on his mind and amanda said not a word about him he was a young man above suspicion benham felt  and from his departure the quality of the correspondence of these two larger carnivores began to change except for the repetition of accustomed endearments they ceased to be love letters in any sense of the word they dealt chiefly with the cub and even there benham felt presently that the enthusiasm diminished a new amazing quality for amanda appearedtriteness the very writing of her letters changed as though it had suddenly lost backbone her habitual liveliness of phrasing lost its point had she lost her animation was she ill unknowingly where had the light gone it was as if her attention was distracted as if every day when she wrote her mind was busy about something else  abruptly at last he understood a fact that had never been stated never formulated never in any way admitted was suddenly pointed to convergently by a thousand indicating fingers and beyond question perceived to be there  he left a record of that moment of realization  suddenly one night i woke up and lay still and it was as if i had never seen amanda before now i saw her plainly i saw her with that same dreadful clearness that sometimes comes at dawn a pitiless a scientific distinctness that has neither light nor shadow  of course i said and then presently i got up very softly  i wanted to get out of my intolerable close personal cabin i wanted to feel the largeness of the sky i went out upon the deck we were off the coast of madras and when i think of that moment there comes back to me also the faint flavour of spice in the air the low line of the coast the cool flooding abundance of the indian moonlight the swish of the black water against the side of the ship and a perception of infinite loss as if the limitless heavens above this earth and below to the very uttermost star were just one boundless cavity from which delight had fled  of course i had lost her i knew it with absolute certainty i knew it from her insecure temperament her adventurousness her needs i knew it from every line she had written me in the last three months i knew it intuitively she had been unfaithful she must have been unfaithful  what had i been dreaming about to think that it would not be so    21   now let me write down plainly what i think of these matters let me be at least honest with myself whatever selfcontradictions i may have been led into by force of my passions always i have despised jealousy  only by the conquest of four natural limitations is the aristocratic life to be achieved they come in a certain order and in that order the spirit of man is armed against them less and less efficiently of fear and my struggle against fear i have told already i am fearful i am a physical coward until i can bring shame and anger to my assistance but in overcoming fear i have been helped by the whole body of human tradition every one the basest creatures every hottentot every stunted creature that ever breathed poison in a slum knows that the instinctive constitution of man is at fault here and that fear is shameful and must be subdued the race is on ones side and so there is a vast traditional support for a man against the second limitation the limitation of physical indulgence it is not so universal as the first there is a grinning bawling humour on the side of grossness but common pride is against it and in this matter my temperament has been my help i am fastidious i eat little drink little and feel a shivering recoil from excess it is no great virtue it happens so it is something in the nerves of my skin i cannot endure myself unshaven or in any way unclean i am tormented by dirty hands or dirty blood or dirty memories and after i had once loved amanda i could notunless some irrational impulse to get equal with her had caught mehave broken my faith to her whatever breach there was in her faith to me  i see that in these matters i am cleaner than most men and more easily clean and it may be that it is in the vein of just that distinctive virtue that i fell so readily into a passion of resentment and anger  i despised a jealous man there is a traditional discredit of jealousy not so strong as that against cowardice but still very strong but the general contempt of jealousy is curiously wrapped up with the supposition that there is no cause for jealousy that it is unreasonable suspicion given a cause then tradition speaks with an uncertain voice  i see now that i despised jealousy because i assumed that it was impossible for amanda to love any one but me it was intolerable to imagine anything else i insisted upon believing that she was as fastidious as myself and as faithful as myself made indeed after my image and i went on disregarding the most obvious intimations that she was not until that still moment in the indian ocean when silently gently as a drowned body might rise out of the depths of a pool that knowledge of love dead and honour gone for ever floated up into my consciousness  and then i felt that amanda had cheated me outrageously abominably  now so far as my intelligence goes there is not a cloud upon this question my demand upon amanda was outrageous and i had no right whatever to her love or loyalty i must have that very clear  this aristocratic life as i conceive it must be except accidentally here and there incompatible with the domestic life it means going hither and thither in the universe of thought as much as in the universe of matter it means adventure it means movement and adventure that must needs be hopelessly encumbered by an inseparable associate it means selfimposed responsibilities that will not fit into the welfare of a family in all ages directly society had risen above the level of a barbaric tribal village this need of a release from the family for certain necessary types of people has been recognized it was met sometimes informally sometimes formally by the growth and establishment of special classes and orders of priests monks nuns of pledged knights of a great variety of nonfamily people whose concern was the larger collective life that opens out beyond the simple necessities and duties and loyalties of the steading and of the craftsmans house sometimes but not always that release took the form of celibacy but besides that there have been a hundred institutional variations of the common life to meet the need of the special man the man who must go deep and the man who must go far a vowed celibacy ceased to be a tolerable rule for an aristocracy directly the eugenic idea entered the mind of man because a celibate aristocracy means the abandonment of the racial future to a proletariat of base unleaderly men that was plain to plato it was plain to campanelea it was plain to the protestant reformers but the world has never yet gone on to the next step beyond that recognition to the recognition of feminine aristocrats rulers and the mates of rulers as untrammelled by domestic servitudes and family relationships as the men of their kind that i see has always been my idea since in my undergraduate days i came under the spell of plato it was a matter of course that my first gift to amanda should be his republic i loved amanda transfigured in that dream  there are no such women  it is no excuse for me that i thought she was likeminded with myself i had no sound reason for supposing that i did suppose that i did not perceive that not only was she younger than myself but that while i had been going through a mill of steely education kept close severely exercised polished by discussion she had but the weak training of a not very good school some scrappy reading the vague discussions of village artists and the draped and decorated novelties of the advanced it all went to nothing on the impact of the world she showed herself the woman the world has always known no miracle and the alternative was for me to give myself to her in the ancient way to serve her happiness to control her and delight and companion her or to let her go  the normal woman centres upon herself her mission is her own charm and her own beauty and her own setting her place is her home she demands the concentration of a man not to be able to command that is her failure not to give her that is to shame her as i had shamed amanda    22   there are no such women he had written this in and struck it out and then at some later time written it in again there it stayed now as his last persuasion but it set white thinking and doubting and indeed there was another sheet of pencilled broken stuff that seemed to glance at quite another type of womanhood    23   it is clear that the women aristocrats who must come to the remaking of the world will do so in spite of limitations at least as great as those from which the aristocratic spirit of man escapes these women must become aristocratic through their own innate impulse they must be selfcalled to their lives exactly as men must be there is no making an aristocrat without a predisposition for rule and nobility and they have to discover and struggle against just exactly the limitations that we have to struggle against they have to conquer not only fear but indulgence indulgence of a softer more insidious quality and jealousyproprietorship  it is as natural to want a mate as to want bread and a thousand times in my work and in my wanderings i have thought of a mate and desired a mate a matenot a possession it is a need almost naively simple if only one could have a woman who thought of one and with one though she were on the other side of the world and busied about a thousand things  with one i see it must be rather than of one that of one is just the unexpurgated egotistical demand coming back again  man is a mating creature it is not good to be alone but mating means a mate  we should be lovers of course that goes without saying  and yet not specialized lovers not devoted attending lovers dancing attendanceas they used to say we should meet upon our ways as the great carnivores do  that at any rate was a sound idea though we only played with it  but that mate desire is just a longing that can have no possible satisfaction now for me what is the good of dreaming life and chance have played a trick upon my body and soul i am mated though i am mated to a phantom i loved and i love arnanda not eastons amanda but amanda in armour the amanda of my dreams sense and particularly the sense of beauty lies deeper than reason in us there can be no mate for me now unless she comes with amandas voice and amandas face and amandas quick movements and her clever hands    24   why am i so ungrateful to her still for all the happiness she gave me  there were things between us two as loverslove things more beautiful than anything else in the world things that set the mind hunting among ineffectual images in a search for impossible expression images of sunlight shining through bloodred petals images of moonlight in a scented garden of marble gleaming in the shade of faroff wonderful music heard at dusk in a great stillness of fairies dancing softly of floating happiness and stirring delights of joys as keen and sudden as the knife of an assassin assassins knives made out of tears tears that are happiness wordless things and surprises expectations gratitudes sudden moments of contemplation the sight of a soft eyelid closed in sleep shadowy tones in the sound of a voice heard unexpectedly sweet dear magical things that i can find no words for  if she was a goddess to me should it be any affair of mine that she was not a goddess to herself that she could hold all this that has been between us more cheaply than i did it does not change one jot of it for me at the time she did not hold it cheaply she forgets where i do not forget    25   such were the things that benham could think and set down  yet for whole days he was possessed by the thought of killing amanda and himself  he did not at once turn homeward it was in ceylon that he dropped his work and came home at colombo he found a heap of letters awaiting him and there were two of these that had started at the same time they had been posted in london on one eventful afternoon lady marayne and amanda had quarrelled violently two earnest flushed quickbreathing women full of neat but belated repartee separated to write their simultaneous letters each letter trailed the atmosphere of that truncated encounter lady marayne told her story ruthlessly amanda on the other hand generalized and explained sir philips adoration of her was a lovefriendship it was beautiful it was pure was there no trust nor courage in the world she would defy all jealous scandal she would not even banish him from her side surely the cheetah could trust her but the pitiless facts of lady marayne went beyond amandas explaining the little ladys dignity had been stricken i have been used as a cloak she wrote  her phrases were vivid she quoted the very words of amanda words she had overheard at chexington in the twilight they were no invention they were the very essence of amanda the lover it was as sure as if benham had heard the sound of her voice as if he had peeped and seen as if she had crept by him stooping and rustling softly it brought back the living sense of her excited flushed reckless his wildhaired amanda of infinite delight all day those words of hers pursued him all night they flared across the black universe he buried his face in the pillows and they whispered softly in his ear  he walked his room in the darkness longing to smash and tear  he went out from the house and shook his ineffectual fists at the stirring quiet of the stars  he sent no notice of his coming back nor did he come back with a definite plan but he wanted to get at amanda    26   it was with amanda he had to reckon towards easton he felt scarcely any anger at all easton he felt only existed for him because amanda willed to have it so  such anger as easton did arouse in him was a contemptuous anger his devotion filled benham with scorn his determination to serve amanda at any price to bear the grossest humiliations and slights for her his humility his service and tenderness his care for her moods and happiness seemed to benham a treachery to human nobility that rage against easton was like the rage of a tradeunionist against a blackleg are all the women to fall to the men who will be their masterslaves and keepers but it was not simply that benham felt men must be freed from this incessant attendance women too must free themselves from their almost instinctive demand for an attendant  his innate disposition was to treat women as responsible beings never in his life had he thought of a woman as a pretty thing to be fooled and won and competed for and fought over so that it was amanda he wanted to reach and reckon with now amanda who had mated and ruled his senses only to fling him into this intolerable pit of shame and jealous fury but the forces that were driving him home now were the forces below the level of reason and ideas organic forces compounded of hate and desire profound aboriginal urgencies he thought indeed very little as he lay in his berth or sulked on deck his mind lay waste under a pitiless invasion of exasperating images that ever and again would so wring him that his muscles would tighten and his hands clench or he would find himself restraining a snarl the threat of the beast in his throat  amanda grew upon his imagination until she overshadowed the whole world she filled the skies she bent over him and mocked him she became a mystery of passion and dark beauty she was the sin of the world one breathed her in the winds of the sea she had taken to herself the greatness of elemental things  so that when at last he saw her he was amazed to see her and see that she was just a creature of common size and quality a rather tired and very frightenedlooking whitefaced young woman in an eveningdress of unfamiliar fashion with little common trinkets of gold and colour about her wrists and neck  in that instants confrontation he forgot all that had brought him homeward he stared at her as one stares at a stranger whom one has greeted in mistake for an intimate friend  for he saw that she was no more the amanda he hated and desired to kill than she had ever been the amanda he had loved    27   he took them by surprise it had been his intention to take them by surprise such is the inelegance of the jealous state  he reached london in the afternoon and put up at a hotel near charing cross in the evening about ten he appeared at the house in lancaster gate the butler was deferentially amazed mrs benham was he said at a theatre with sir philip easton and he thought some other people also he did not know when she would be back she might go on to supper it was not the custom for the servants to wait up for her  benham went into the study that reduplicated his former rooms in finacue street and sat down before the fire the butler lit for him he sent the man to bed and fell into profound meditation  it was nearly two oclock when he heard the sound of her latchkey and went out at once upon the landing  the halfdoor stood open and eastons car was outside she stood in the middle of the hall and relieved easton of the gloves and fan he was carrying  goodnight she said i am so tired  my wonderful goddess he said  she yielded herself to his accustomed embrace then started stared and wrenched herself out of his arms  benham stood at the top of the stairs looking down upon them whitefaced and inexpressive easton dropped back a pace for a moment no one moved nor spoke and then very quietly easton shut the halfdoor and shut out the noises of the road  for some seconds benham regarded them and as he did so his spirit changed  everything he had thought of saying and doing vanished out of his mind  he stuck his hands into his pockets and descended the staircase when he was five or six steps above them he spoke just sit down here he said with a gesture of one hand and sat down himself upon the stairs do sit down he said with a sudden testiness as they continued standing i know all about this affair do please sit down and let us talk everybodys gone to bed long ago  cheetah she said why have you come back like this  then at his mute gesture she sat down at his feet  i wish you would sit down easton he said in a voice of subdued savagery  why have you come back sir philip easton found his voice to ask  sit down benham spat and easton obeyed unwillingly  i came back benham went on to see to all this why else i dontnow i see youfeel very fierce about it but it has distressed me you look changed amanda and fagged and your hair is untidy its as if something had happened to you and made you a stranger you two people are lovers very natural and simple but i want to get out of it yes i want to get out of it that wasnt quite my idea but now i see it is its queer but on the whole i feel sorry for you all of us poor humans theres reason to be sorry for all of us were full of lusts and uneasiness and resentments that we havent the will to control what do you two people want me to do to you would you like a divorce amanda its the clean straight thing isnt it or would the scandal hurt you  amanda sat crouched together with her eyes on benham  give us a divorce said easton looking to her to confirm him  amanda shook her head  i dont want a divorce she said  then what do you want asked benham with sudden asperity  i dont want a divorce she repeated why do you after a long silence come home like this abruptly with no notice  it was the way it took me said benham after a little interval  you have left me for long months  yes i was angry and it was ridiculous to be angry i thought i wanted to kill you and now i see you i see that all i want to do is to help you out of this miserable messand then get away from you you two would like to marry you ought to be married  i would die to make amanda happy said easton  your business it seems to me is to live to make her happy that you may find more of a strain less tragic and more tiresome i on the other hand want neither to die nor live for her amanda moved sharply its extraordinary what amazing vapours a lonely man may get into his head if you dont want a divorce then i suppose things might go on as they are now  i hate things as they are now said easton i hate this falsehood and deception  you would hate the scandal just as much said amanda  i would not care what the scandal was unless it hurt you  it would be only a temporary inconvenience said benham every one would sympathize with you the whole thing is so natural people would be glad to forget very soon they did with my mother  no said amanda it isnt so easy as that  she seemed to come to a decision  pip she said i want to talk tohimalone  eastons brown eyes were filled with distress and perplexity but why he asked  i do she said  but this is a thing for us  pip i want to talk to him alone there is somethingsomething i cant say before you  sir philip rose slowly to his feet  shall i wait outside  no pip go home yesthere are some things you must leave to me  she stood up too and turned so that she and benham both faced the younger man the strangest uneasiness mingled with his resolve to be at any cost splendid he feltand it was a most unexpected and disconcerting feelingthat he was no longer confederated with amanda that prior more fundamental and greater associations prevailed over his little new grip upon her mind and senses he stared at husband and wife aghast in this realization then his resolute romanticism came to his help i would trust you he began if you tell me to go  amanda seemed to measure her hold upon him  she laid her hand upon his arm go my dear pip she said go  he had a moment of hesitation of anguish and it seemed to benham as though he eked himself out with unreality as though somewhen somewhere he had seen something of the sort in a play and filled in a gap that otherwise he could not have supplied  then the door had closed upon him and amanda pale and darkly dishevelled faced her husband silently and intensely  well said benham  she held out her arms to him  why did you leave me cheetah why did you leave me    28   benham affected to ignore those proffered arms but they recalled in a swift rush the animal anger that had brought him back to england to remind him of desire now was to revive an anger stronger than any desire he spoke seeking to hurt her  i am wondering now he said why the devil i came back  you had to come back to me  i could have written just as well about these things  cheetah she said softly and came towards him slowly stooping forward and looking into his eyes you had to come back to see your old leopard your wretched leopard who has rolled in the dirt and is still yours  do you want a divorce how are we to fix things amanda  cheetah i will tell you how we will fix things  she dropped upon the step below him she laid her hands with a deliberate softness upon him she gave a toss so that her disordered hair was a little more disordered and brought her soft chin down to touch his knees her eyes implored him  cheetah she said you are going to forgive  he sat rigid meeting her eyes  amanda he said at last you would be astonished if i kicked you away from me and trampled over you to the door that is what i want to do  do it she said and the grip of her hands tightened cheetah dear i would love you to kill me  i dont want to kill you  her eyes dilated beat me  and i havent the remotest intention of making love to you he said and pushed her soft face and hands away from him as if he would stand up  she caught hold of him again stay with me she said  he made no effort to shake off her grip he looked at the dark cloud of her hair that had ruled him so magically and the memory of old delights made him grip a great handful almost inadvertently as he spoke dear leopard he said we humans are the most streaky of conceivable things i thought i hated you i do i hate you like poison and also i do not hate you at all  then abruptly he was standing over her  she rose to her knees  stay here old cheetah she said this is your house i am your wife  he went towards the unfastened front door  cheetah she cried with a note of despair  he halted at the door  amanda i will come tomorrow i will come in the morning in the sober london daylight and then we will settle things  he stared at her and to her amazement he smiled he spoke as one who remarks upon a quite unexpected fact  never in my life amanda have i seen a human being that i wanted so little to kill    29   white found a fragment that might have been written within a week of those last encounters of benham and amanda  the thing that astonished me most in amanda was the change in her mental quality  with me in the old days she had always been a sincere person she had deceived me about facts but she had never deceived me about herself her personal stark frankness had been her essential strength and it was gone i came back to find amanda an accomplished actress a thing of poses and calculated effects she was a surface a sham a lorelei beneath that surface i could not discover anything individual at all fear and a grasping quality such as god gave us all when he gave us hands but the individual i knew the humorous wilful spotless leopard was gone whither i cannot imagine an amazing disappearance clean out of space and time like a soul lost for ever  when i went to see her in the morning she was made up for a scene she acted an intricate part never for a moment was she there in reality  i have got a remarkable persuasion that she lost herself in this way by cheapening love by making base love to a lover she despised there can be no inequality in love give and take must balance one must be ones natural self or the whole business is an indecent trick a vile use of life to use inferiors in love one must needs talk down to them interpret oneself in their insufficient phrases pretend sentimentalize and it is clear that unless oneself is to be lost one must be content to leave alone all those people that one can reach only by sentimentalizing but amandaand yet somehow i love her for it stillcould not leave any one alone so she was always feverishly weaving nets of false relationship until her very self was forgotten so she will go on until the end with easton it had been necessary for her to key herself to a simple exalted romanticism that was entirely insincere she had so accustomed herself to these poses that her innate gestures were forgotten she could not recover them she could not even reinvent them between us there were momentary gleams as though presently we should be our frank former selves again they were never more than momentary  and that was all that this astonishing man had seen fit to tell of his last parting from his wife  perhaps he did amanda injustice perhaps there was a stronger thread of reality in her desire to recover him than he supposed clearly he believed that under the circumstances amanda would have tried to recover anybody  she had dressed for that mornings encounter in a very becoming and intimate wrap of soft mauve and white silk and she had washed and dried her dark hair so that it was a vapour about her face she set herself with a single mind to persuade herself and benham that they were inseparable lovers and she would not be deflected by his grim determination to discuss the conditions of their separation when he asked her whether she wanted a divorce she offered to throw over sir philip and banish him for ever as lightly as a great lady might sacrifice an objectionable poodle to her connubial peace  benham passed through perplexing phases so that she herself began to feel that her practice with easton had spoilt her hands his initial grimness she could understand and partially its breakdown into irritability but she was puzzled by his laughter for he laughed abruptly  you know amanda i came home in a mood of tremendous tragedy and reallyyou are a lark  and then overriding her altogether he told her what he meant to do about their future and the future of their little son  you dont want a divorce and a fuss then ill leave things i perceive ive no intention of marrying any more but youd better do the straight thing people forget and forgive especially when there is no one about making a fuss against you  perhaps after all there is something to be said for shirking it well both be able to get at the boy then youll not hurt him and i shall want to see him its better for the boy anyhow not to have a divorce  ill not stand in your way ill get a little flat and i shant come too much to london and when i do you can get out of town you must be discreet about easton and if people say anything about him send them to me after all this is our private affair  well go on about money matters as we have been going i trust to you not to run me into overwhelming debts and of course if at any time you do want to marryon account of children or anythingif nobody knows of this conversation we can be divorced then  benham threw out these decisions in little dry sentences while amanda gathered her forces for her last appeal  it was an unsuccessful appeal and at the end she flung herself down before him and clung to his knees he struggled ridiculously to get himself clear and when at last he succeeded she dropped prostrate on the floor with her dishevelled hair about her  she heard the door close behind him and still she lay there a dark guinevere until with a start she heard a step upon the thick carpet without he had come back the door reopened there was a slight pause and then she raised her face and met the blank stare of the second housemaid there are moments suspended fragments of time rather than links in its succession when the human eye is more intelligible than any words  the housemaid made a rapid apologetic noise and vanished with a click of the door  damn said amanda  then slowly she rose to her knees  she meditated through vast moments  its a cursed thing to be a woman said amanda she stood up she put her hand on the telephone in the corner and then she forgot about it after another long interval of thought she spoke  cheetah she said old cheetah  i didnt think it of you  then presently with the even joyless movements of one who does a reasonable business with something indeed of the manner of one who packs a trunk she rang up sir philip easton    30   the head chambermaid on the first floor of the westwood hotel in danebury street had a curious and perplexing glimpse of benhams private processes the morning after this affair  benham had taken room 27 on the afternoon of his return to london she had seen him twice or three times and he had struck her as a coldly decorous person tall whitefaced slow speaking the last man to behave violently or surprise a head chambermaid in any way on the morning of his departure she was told by the firstfloor waiter that the occupant of room 26 had complained of an uproar in the night and almost immediately she was summoned to see benham  he was standing facing the door and in a position which did a little obscure the condition of the room behind him he was carefully dressed and his manner was more cold and decorous than ever but one of his hands was tied up in a white bandage  i am going this morning he said i am going down now to breakfast i have had a few little accidents with some of the things in the room and i have cut my hand i want you to tell the manager and see that they are properly charged for on the bill thank you  the head chambermaid was left to consider the accidents  benhams things were all packed up and the room had an air of having been straightened up neatly and methodically after a destructive cataclysm one or two items that the chambermaid might possibly have overlooked in the normal course of things were carefully exhibited for example the sheet had been torn into half a dozen strips and they were lying side by side on the bed the clock on the mantelpiece had been knocked into the fireplace and then pounded to pieces all the lookingglasses in the room were smashed apparently the electric lamp that stood on the night table by the bedside had been wrenched off and flung or hammered about amidst the other breakables and there was a considerable amount of blood splashed about the room the head chambermaid felt unequal to the perplexities of the spectacle and summoned her most convenient friend the head chambermaid on the third floor to her aid the firstfloor waiter joined their deliberations and several housemaids displayed a respectful interest in the matter finally they invoked the manager he was still contemplating the scene of the disorder when the precipitate retreat of his subordinates warned him of benhams return  benham was smoking a cigarette and his bearing was reassuringly tranquil  i had a kind of nightmare he said i am fearfully sorry to have disarranged your room you must charge me for the inconvenience as well as for the damage    31   an aristocrat cannot be a lover  one cannot serve at once the intricacies of the wider issues of life and the intricacies of another human being i do not mean that one may not love one loves the more because one does not concentrate ones love one loves nations the people passing in the street beasts hurt by the wayside troubled scoundrels and university dons in tears  but if one does not give ones whole love and life into a womans hands i do not think one can expect to be loved  an aristocrat must do without close personal love  this much was written at the top of a sheet of paper the writing ended halfway down the page manifestly it was an abandoned beginning and it was it seemed to white the last page of all this confusion of matter that dealt with the second and third limitations its incompleteness made its expression perfect  there benhams love experience ended he turned to the great business of the world desire and jealousy should deflect his life no more like fear they were to be dismissed as far as possible and subdued when they could not be altogether dismissed whatever stirrings of blood or imagination there were in him after that parting whatever failures from this resolution they left no trace on the rest of his research which was concerned with the hates of peoples and classes and war and peace and the possibilities science unveils and starry speculations of what mankind may do    32   but benham did not leave england again until he had had an encounter with lady marayne  the little lady came to her son in a state of extraordinary anger and distress never had she seemed quite so resolute nor quite so hopelessly dispersed and mixed and when for a moment it seemed to him that she was not as a matter of fact dispersed and mixed at all then with an instant eagerness he dismissed that one elucidatory gleam what are you doing in england poff she demanded and what are you going to do  nothing and you are going to leave her in your house with your property and a lover if thats it poff why did you ever come back and why did you ever marry her you might have known her father was a swindler shes begotten of deceit shell tell her own story while you are away and a pretty story shell make of it  do you want me to divorce her and make a scandal  i never wanted you to go away from her if youd stayed and watched her as a man should as i begged you and implored you to do didnt i tell you poff didnt i warn you  but now what am i to do  there you are thats just a mans way you get yourself into this trouble you follow your passions and your fancies and fads and then you turn to me how can i help you now poff if youd listened to me before  her blue eyes were demonstratively round  yes but  i warned you she interrupted i warned you ive done all i could for you it isnt that i havent seen through her when she came to me at first with that madeup story of a baby and all about loving me like her own mother but i did what i could i thought we might still make the best of a bad job and then i might have known she couldnt leave pip alone but for weeks i didnt dream i wouldnt dream right under my nose the impudence of it  her voice broke such a horrid mess such a hopeless horrid mess  she wiped away a bright little tear  its all alike its your way with us all of you there isnt a man in the world deserves to have a woman in the world we do all we can for you we do all we can to amuse you we dress for you and we talk for you all the sweet warm little women there are and then you go away from us there never was a woman yet who pleased and satisfied a man who did not lose him give you everything and off you must go lovers mothers  it dawned upon benham dimly that his mothers troubles did not deal exclusively with himself  but amanda he began  if youd looked after her properly it would have been right enough pip was as good as gold until she undermined him a woman cant wait about like an umbrella in a stand he was just a boy only of course there she wasa novelty it is perfectly easy to understand she flattered him men are such fools  stillits no good saying that now  but shell spend all your money poff shell break your back with debts whats to prevent her with him living on her for thats what it comes to practically  well what am i to do  you arent going back without tying her up poff you ought to stop every farthing of her moneyevery farthing its your duty  i cant do things like that  but have you no shame to let that sort of thing go on  if i dont feel the shame of it and i dont  and that money i got you that money poff it was my money  benham stared at her perplexed what am i to do he asked  cut her off you silly boy tie her up pay her through a solicitor say that if she sees him once again  he reflected no he said at last  poff she cried every time i see you you are more and more like your father youre going offjust as he did that baffled mulish lookpriggishsolemn oh its strange the stuff a poor woman has to bring into the world but youll do nothing i know youll do nothing youll stand everything youyou cuckold and shell drive by me shell pass me in theatres with the money that ought to have been mine oh oh  she dabbed her handkerchief from one swimming eye to the other but she went on talking faster and faster less and less coherently more and more wildly abusive presently in a brief pause of the storm benham sighed profoundly  it brought the scene to a painful end  for weeks her distress pursued and perplexed him  he had an extraordinary persuasion that in some obscure way he was in default that he was to blame for her distress that he owed herhe could never define what he owed her  and yet what on earth was one to do  and something his mother had said gave him the odd idea that he had misjudged his father that he had missed depths of perplexed and kindred goodwill he went down to see him before he returned to india but if there was a hidden well of feeling in mr benham senior it had been very carefully boarded over the parental mind and attention were entirely engaged in a dispute in the school world about the heuristic method somebody had been disrespectful to martindale house and the thing was rankling almost unendurably it seemed to be a relief to him to show his son very fully the essentially illogical position of his assailant he was entirely inattentive to benhams carefully made conversational opportunities he would be silent at times while benham talked and then he would break out suddenly with what seems to me so unreasonable so ridiculous in the whole of that fellows second argumentif one can call it an argument a man who reasons as he does is bound to get laughed at if people will only see it     chapter the sixth  the new haroun al raschid    1   benham corresponded with amanda until the summer of 1913 sometimes the two wrote coldly to one another sometimes with warm affection sometimes with great bitterness when he met white in johannesburg during the strike period of 1913 he was on his way to see her in london and to settle their relationship upon a new and more definite footing it was her suggestion that they should meet  about her he felt an enormous inexorable dissatisfaction he could not persuade himself that his treatment of her and that his relations to her squared with any of his preconceptions of nobility and yet at no precise point could he detect where he had definitely taken an ignoble step through amanda he was coming to the full experience of life like all of us he had been prepared he had prepared himself to take life in a certain way and life had taken him as it takes all of us in an entirely different and unexpected way he had been ready for noble deeds and villainies for achievements and failures and here as the dominant fact of his personal life was a perplexing riddle he could not hate and condemn her for ten minutes at a time without a flow of exoneration he could not think of her tolerantly or lovingly without immediate shame and resentment and with the utmost will in the world he could not banish her from his mind  during the intervening years he had never ceased to have her in his mind he would not think of her it is true if he could help it but often he could not help it and as a negative presence as a thing denied she was almost more potent than she had been as a thing accepted meanwhile he worked his nervous irritability increased but it did not hinder the steady development of his research  long before his final parting from amanda he had worked out his idea and method for all the more personal problems in life the problems he put together under his headings of the first three limitations he had resolved to emancipate himself from fear indulgence and that instinctive preoccupation with the interests and dignity of self which he chose to term jealousy and with the one tremendous exception of amanda he had to a large extent succeeded amanda amanda amanda he stuck the more grimly to his research to drown that beating in his brain  emancipation from all these personal things he held now to be a mere prelude to the real work of a mans life which was to serve this dream of a larger human purpose the bulk of his work was to discover and define that purpose that purpose which must be the directing and comprehending form of all the activities of the noble life one cannot be noble he had come to perceive at large one must be noble to an end to make human life collectively and in detail a thing more comprehensive more beautiful more generous and coherent than it is today seemed to him the fundamental intention of all nobility he believed more and more firmly that the impulses to make and help and subserve great purposes are abundantly present in the world that they are inhibited by hasty thinking limited thinking and bad thinking and that the real ennoblement of human life was not so much a creation as a release he lumped the preventive and destructive forces that keep men dispersed unhappy and ignoble under the heading of prejudice and he made this prejudice his fourth and greatest and most difficult limitation in one place he had written it prejudice or divisions that being subdued in oneself and in the world then in the measure of its subjugation the new life of our race the great age the noble age would begin  so he set himself to examine his own mind and the mind of the world about him for prejudice for hampering follies disguised disloyalties and mischievous distrusts and the great bulk of the papers that white struggled with at westhaven street were devoted to various aspects of this search for prejudice it seemed to white to be at once the most magnificent and the most preposterous of enterprises it was indeed no less than an enquiry into all the preventable sources of human failure and disorder and it was all too manifest to white also that the last place in which benham was capable of detecting a prejudice was at the back of his own head  under this fourth limitation he put the most remarkable array of influences racehatred national suspicion the evil side of patriotism religious and social intolerance every social consequence of muddle headedness every dividing force indeed except the purely personal dissensions between man and man and he developed a metaphysical interpretation of these troubles no doubt he wrote in one place much of the evil between different kinds of men is due to uncultivated feeling to natural bad feeling but far more is it due to bad thinking at times he seemed on the verge of the persuasion that most human trouble is really due to bad metaphysics it was one must remark an extraordinary journey he had made he had started from chivalry and arrived at metaphysics every knight he held must be a logician and ultimate bravery is courage of the mind one thinks of his coming to this conclusion with knit brows and balancing intentness above whole gulfs of bathosvery much as he had once walked the leysin bisse  men do not know how to think he insistedgetting along the planks and they will not realize that they do not know how to think ninetenths of the wars in the world have arisen out of misconceptions misconception is the sin and dishonour of the mind and muddled thinking as ignoble as dirty conduct infinitely more disastrous  and again he wrote man i see is an overpractical creature too eager to get into action there is our deepest trouble he takes conclusions readymade or he makes them in a hurry life is so short that he thinks it better to err than wait he has no patience no faith in anything but himself he thinks he is a being when in reality he is only a link in a being and so he is more anxious to be complete than right the last devotion of which he is capable is that devotion of the mind which suffers partial performance but insists upon exhaustive thought he scamps his thought and finishes his performance and before he is dead it is already being abandoned and begun all over again by some one else in the same egotistical haste  it is i suppose a part of the general humour of life that these words should have been written by a man who walked the plank to fresh ideas with the dizziest difficulty unless he had prothero to drag him forward and who acted time after time with an altogether disastrous hastiness    2   yet there was a kind of necessity in this journey of benhams from the cocked hat and wooden sword of seagate and his early shame at cowardice and baseness to the spiritual megalomania of his complete research magnificent you can no more resolve to live a life of honour nowadays and abstain from social and political scheming on a worldwide scale than you can profess religion and refuse to think about god in the past it was possible to take all sorts of things for granted and be loyal to unexamined things one could be loyal to unexamined things because they were unchallenged things but now everything is challenged by the time of his second visit to russia benhams ideas of conscious and deliberate aristocracy reaching out to an idea of universal responsibility had already grown into the extraordinary fantasy that he was as it were an uncrowned king in the world to be noble is to be aristocratic that is to say a ruler thence it follows that aristocracy is multiple kingship and to be an aristocrat is to partake both of the nature of philosopher and king  yet it is manifest that the powerful people of this world are by no means necessarily noble and that most modern kings poor in quality petty in spirit conventional in outlook controlled and limited fall far short of kingship nevertheless there is nobility there is kingship or this earth is a dustbin and mankind but a kind of skindisease upon a planet from that it is an easy step to this idea the idea whose first expression had already so touched the imagination of amanda of a sort of diffused and voluntary kingship scattered throughout mankind the aristocrats are not at the high table the kings are not enthroned those who are enthroned are but pretenders and simulacra kings of the vulgar the real king and ruler is every man who sets aside the naive passions and selfinterest of the common life for the rule and service of the world  this is an idea that is now to be found in much contemporary writing it is one of those ideas that seem to appear simultaneously at many points in the world and it is impossible to say now how far benham was an originator of this idea and how far he simply resonated to its expression by others it was far more likely that prothero getting it heaven knows where had spluttered it out and forgotten it leaving it to germinate in the mind of his friend  this lordly this kingly dream became more and more essential to benham as his life went on when benham walked the bisse he was just a youngster resolved to be individually brave when he prowled in the jungle by night he was there for all mankind with every year he became more and more definitely to himself a consecrated man as kings are consecrated only that he was selfconsecrated and anointed only in his heart at last he was so to speak haroun al raschid again going unsuspected about the world because the palace of his security would not tell him the secrets of mens disorders he was no longer a creature of circumstances he was kingly unknown alfred in the camp of the danes in the great later accumulations of his research the personal matter the introspection the intimate discussion of motive becomes less and less he forgets himself in the exaltation of kingliness he worries less and less over the particular rightness of his definite acts in these later papers white found benham abstracted selfforgetful trying to find out with an ever increased selfdetachment with an ever deepening regal solicitude why there are massacres wars tyrannies and persecutions why we let famine disease and beasts assail us and want dwarf and cripple vast multitudes in the midst of possible plenty and when he found out and as far as he found out he meant quite simply and earnestly to apply his knowledge    3   the intellectualism of benham intensified to the end his definition of prejudice impressed white as being the most bloodless and philosophical formula that ever dominated the mind of a man  prejudice benham had written is that common incapacity of the human mind to understand that a difference in any respect is not a difference in all respects reinforced and rendered malignant by an instinctive hostility to what is unlike ourselves we exaggerate classification and then charge it with mischievous emotion by referring it to ourselves and under this comprehensive formula he proceeded to study and attack family prejudice national prejudice race prejudice war class prejudice professional prejudice sex prejudice in the most industrious and elaborate manner whether one regards ones self or others he held that these prejudices are evil things from the point of view of human welfare they break men up into wars and conflicts make them an easy prey to those who trade upon suspicion and hostility prevent sane collective cooperations cripple and embitter life from the point of view of personal aristocracy they make men vulgar violent unjust and futile all the conscious life of the aristocrat must be a constant struggle against false generalizations it is as much his duty to free himself from that as from fear indulgence and jealousy it is a larger and more elaborate task but it is none the less cardinal and essential indeed it is more cardinal and essential the true knight has to be not only no coward no selfpamperer no egotist he has to be a philosopher he has to be no hasty or foolish thinker his judgment no more than his courage is to be taken by surprise  to subdue fear desire and jealousy is the aristocrats personal affair it is his ritual and discipline like a knight watching his arms but the destruction of division and prejudice and all their forms and establishments is his real task that is the common work of knighthood it is a task to be done in a thousand ways one man working by persuasion another by example this one overthrowing some crippling restraint upon the freedom of speech and the spread of knowledge and that preparing himself for a war that will shatter a tyrannous presumption most imaginative literature all scientific investigation all sound criticism all good building all good manufacture all sound politics every honesty and every reasoned kindliness contribute to this release of men from the heat and confusions of our present world  it was clear to white that as benham progressed with this major part of his research he was more and more possessed by the idea that he was not making his own personal research alone but side by side with a vast masked hidden and once unsuspected multitude of others that this great idea of his was under kindred forms the great idea of thousands that it was breaking as the dawn breaks simultaneously to great numbers of people and that the time was not far off when the new aristocracy the disguised rulers of the world would begin to realize their common bent and effort into these latter papers there creeps more and more frequently a new phraseology such expressions as the invisible king and the spirit of kingship so that as benham became personally more and more solitary his thoughts became more and more public and social  benham was not content to define and denounce the prejudices of mankind he set himself to study just exactly how these prejudices worked to get at the nature and habits and strengths of each kind of prejudice and to devise means for its treatment destruction or neutralization he had no great faith in the power of pure reasonableness his psychological ideas were modern and he had grasped the fact that the power of most of the great prejudices that strain humanity lies deeper than the intellectual level consequently he sought to bring himself into the closest contact with prejudices in action and prejudices in conflict in order to discover their subrational springs  a large proportion of that larger moiety of the material at westhaven street which white from his extensive experience of the public patience decided could not possibly make a book consisted of notes and discussions upon the firsthand observations benham had made in this or that part of the world he began in russia during the revolutionary trouble of 1906 he went thence to odessa and from place to place in bessarabia and kieff where during a pogrom he had his first really illuminating encounter with race and culture prejudice his examination of the social and political condition of russia seems to have left him much more hopeful than was the common feeling of liberalminded people during the years of depression that followed the revolution of 1906 and it was upon the race question that his attention concentrated  the swadeshi outbreak drew him from russia to india here in an entirely different environment was another discord of race and culture and he found in his study of it much that illuminated and corrected his impressions of the russian issue a whole drawer was devoted to a comparatively finished and very thorough enquiry into human dissensions in lower bengal here there were not only race but culture conflicts and he could work particularly upon the differences between men of the same race who were hindus christians and mahometans respectively he could compare the bengali mahometan not only with the bengali brahminist but also with the mahometan from the northwest if one could scrape off all the creed and training would one find much the same thing at the bottom or something fundamentally so different that no close homogeneous social life and not even perhaps a life of just compromise is possible between the different races of mankind  his answer to that was a confident one there are no such natural and unalterable differences in character and quality between any two sorts of men whatever as would make their peaceful and kindly cooperation in the world impossible he wrote  but he was not satisfied with his observations in india he found the prevalence of caste ideas antipathetic and complicating he went on after his last parting from amanda into china it was the first of several visits to china and thence he crossed to america white found a number of american presscuttings of a vehemently antijapanese quality still awaiting digestion in a drawer and it was clear to him that benham had given a considerable amount of attention to the development of the white and yellow race hostility on the pacific slope but his chief interest at that time had been the negro he went to washington and thence south he visited tuskegee and atlanta and then went off at a tangent to hayti he was drawn to hayti by hesketh pritchards vivid book where black rules white and like hesketh pritchard he was able to visit that wonderful monument to kingship the hidden fastness of la ferriere the citadel built a century ago by the black napoleon the emperor christophe he went with a young american demonstrator from harvard    4   it was a memorable excursion they rode from cap haytien for a days journey along dusty uneven tracks through a steaming plain of luxurious vegetation that presented the strangest mixture of unbridled jungle with populous country they passed countless villages of thatched huts alive with curiosity and swarming with naked black children and yet all the time they seemed to be in a wilderness they forded rivers they had at times to force themselves through thickets once or twice they lost their way and always ahead of them purple and sullen the great mountain peak with la ferriere upon its crest rose slowly out of the background until it dominated the landscape long after dark they blundered upon rather than came to the village at its foot where they were to pass the night they were interrogated under a flaring torch by peering ragged black soldiers and passed through a firelit crowd into the presence of the local commandant to dispute volubly about their right to go further they might have been in some remote corner of nigeria their papers laboriously got in order were vitiated by the fact which only became apparent by degrees that the commandant could not read they carried their point with difficulty  but they carried their point and watched and guarded by a hungry halfnaked negro in a kepi and the remains of a skyblue pair of trousers they explored one of the most exemplary memorials of imperialism that humanity has ever made the roads and parks and prospects constructed by this vanished emperor of hayti had long since disappeared and the three men clambered for hours up ravines and precipitous jungle tracks occasionally crossing the winding traces of a choked and ruined road that had once been the lordly approach to his fastness below they passed an abandoned palace of vast extent a palace with great terraces and the still traceable outline of gardens though there were green things pushing between the terrace steps and trees thrust out of the empty windows here from a belvedere of which the skulllike vestige still remained the negro emperor christophe after fourteen years of absolute rule had watched for a time the smoke of the burning of his canefields in the plain below and then learning that his bodyguard had deserted him had gone in and blown out his brains  he had christened the place after the best of examples sans souci  but the citadel above which was to have been his last defence he never used the defection of his guards made him abandon that to build it they say cost hayti thirty thousand lives he had the true imperial lavishness so high it was so lost in a wilderness of trees and bush looking out over a land relapsed now altogether to a barbarism of patch and hovel so solitary and chill under the tropical skyfor even the guards who still watched over its suspected treasures feared to live in its ghostly galleries and had made hovels outside its wallsand at the same time so huge and grandiosethere were walls thirty feet thick galleries with scores of rusteaten cannon circular dininghalls kings apartments and queens apartments towering battlements and great arched doorwaysthat it seemed to benham to embody the power and passing of that miracle of human history tyranny the helpless bowing of multitudes before one man and the transitoriness of such glories more completely than anything he had ever seen or imagined in the world before beneath the battlementsthey are choked above with jungle grass and tamarinds and many flowery weedsthe precipice fell away a sheer two thousand feet and below spread a vast rich green plain populous and diversified bounded at last by the blue sea like an amethystine wall over this precipice christophe was wont to fling his victims and below this terrace were bottleshaped dungeons where men broken and torn thrust in at the necklike hole above starved and died it was his headquarters here here he had his torture chambers and the means for nameless cruelties  not a hundred years ago said benhams companion and told the story of the disgraced favourite the youth who had offended  leap said his master and the poor hypnotized wretch after one questioning glance at the conceivable alternatives made his last gesture of servility and then stood out against the sky swayed and with a convulsion of resolve leapt and shot headlong down through the shimmering air  came presently the little faint sound of his fall  the emperor satisfied turned away unmindful of the fact that this projectile he had launched had caught among the bushes below and presently struggled and found itself still a living man it could scramble down to the road and what is more wonderful hope for mercy an hour and it stood before christophe again with an arm broken and bloody and a face torn a battered thing now but with a faint flavour of pride in its bearing your bidding has been done sire it said  so said the emperor unappeased and you live well leap again  and then came other stories the young man told them as he had heard them stories of ferocious wholesale butcheries of men standing along the walls of the banqueting chamber to be shot one by one as the feast went on of exquisite and terrifying cruelties and his one note of wonder his refrain was here not a hundred years ago it makes one almost believe that somewhere things of this sort are being done now  they ate their lunch together amidst the weedy flowery ruins the lizards which had fled their coming crept out again to bask in the sunshine the soldierguide and guard scrabbled about with his black fingers in the ruinous and rifled tomb of christophe in a search for some saleable memento  benham sat musing in silence the thought of deliberate cruelty was always an actual physical distress to him he sat bathed in the dreamy afternoon sunlight and struggled against the pictures that crowded into his mind pictures of men aghast at death and of feardriven men toiling in agony and of the shame of extorted obedience and of cringing and crawling black figures and the defiance of righteous hate beaten down under blow and anguish he saw eyes alight with terror and lips rolled back in agony he saw weary hopeless flight before striding proud destruction he saw the poor trampled mangled dead and he shivered in his soul  he hated christophe and all that made christophe he hated pride and then the idea came to him that it is not pride that makes christophes but humility  there is in the medley of mans composition deeper far than his superficial working delusion that he is a separated selfseeking individual an instinct for cooperation and obedience every natural sane man wants though he may want it unwittingly kingly guidance a definite direction for his own partial life at the bottom of his heart he feels even if he does not know it definitely that his life is partial he is driven to join himself on he obeys decision and the appearance of strength as a horse obeys its riders voice one thinks of the pride the uncontrolled frantic will of this black ape of all emperors and one forgets the universal docility that made him possible usurpation is a crime to which men are tempted by human dirigibility it is the orderly peoples who create tyrants and it is not so much restraint above as stiff insubordination below that has to be taught to men there are kings and tyrannies and imperialisms simply because of the unkingliness of men  and as he sat upon the battlements of la ferriere benham cast off from his mind his last tolerance for earthly kings and existing states and expounded to another human being for the first time this longcherished doctrine of his of the invisible king who is the lord of human destiny the spirit of nobility who will one day take the sceptre and rule the earth to the young americans naive american response to any simply felt emotion he seemed with his white earnestness and his glowing eyes a veritable prophet  this is the root idea of aristocracy said benham  i have never heard the underlying spirit of democracy the real true thing in democracy so thoroughly expressed said the young american    5   benhams notes on race and racial cultures gave white tantalizing glimpses of a number of picturesque experiences the adventure in kieff had first roused benham to the reality of racial quality he was caught in the wheels of a pogrom  before that time i had been disposed to minimize and deny race i still think it need not prevent men from the completest social cooperation but i see now better than i did how difficult it is for any man to purge from his mind the idea that he is not primarily a jew a teuton or a kelt but a man you can persuade any one in five minutes that he or she belongs to some special and blessed and privileged sort of human being it takes a lifetime to destroy that persuasion there are these confounded differences of colour of eye and brow of nose or hair small differences in themselves except that they give a foothold and foundation for tremendous fortifications of prejudice and tradition in which hostilities and hatreds may gather when i think of a jews nose a chinamans eyes or a negros colour i am reminded of that fatal little pit which nature has left in the vermiform appendix a thing no use in itself and of no significance but a gatheringplace for mischief the extremest case of racefeeling is the jewish case and even here i am convinced it is the bible and the talmud and the exertions of those inevitable professional champions who live upon racial feeling far more than their common distinction of blood which holds this people together banded against mankind  between the lines of such general propositions as this white read little scraps of intimation that linked with the things benham let fall in johannesburg to reconstruct the kieff adventure  benham had been visiting a friend in the country on the further side of the dnieper as they drove back along dusty stretches of road amidst fields of corn and sunflower and through bright little villages they saw against the evening blue under the full moon a smoky red glare rising from amidst the white houses and dark trees of the town the pogroms begun said benhams friend and was surprised when benham wanted to end a pleasant day by going to see what happens after the beginning of a pogrom  he was to have several surprises before at last he left benham in disgust and went home by himself  for benham with that hastiness that so flouted his exalted theories passed rapidly from an attitude of impartial enquiry to active intervention the two men left their carriage and plunged into the network of unlovely dark streets in which the jews and traders harboured benhams first intervention was on behalf of a crouching and yelping bundle of humanity that was being dragged about and kicked at a street corner the bundle resolved itself into a filthy little old man and made off with extraordinary rapidity while benham remonstrated with the kickers benhams tallness his very gentile face his good clothes and an air of tense authority about him had its effect and the kickers shuffled off with remarks that were partly apologies but benhams friend revolted this was no business of theirs  benham went on unaccompanied towards the glare of the burning houses  for a time he watched black figures moved between him and the glare and he tried to find out the exact nature of the conflict by enquiries in clumsy russian he was told that the jews had insulted a religious procession that a jew had spat at an ikon that the shop of a cheating jew trader had been set on fire and that the blaze had spread to the adjacent group of houses he gathered that the jews were running out of the burning block on the other side like rats the crowd was mostly composed of town roughs with a sprinkling of peasants they were mischievous but undecided among them were a number of soldiers and he was surprised to see a policemen brightly lit from head to foot watching the looting of a shop that was still untouched by the flames  he held back some men who had discovered a couple of womens figures slinking along in the shadow beneath a wall behind his remonstrances the jewesses escaped his anger against disorder was growing upon him  late that night benham found himself the leading figure amidst a party of jews who had made a counter attack upon a gang of roughs in a court that had become the refuge of a crowd of fugitives some of the young jewish men had already been making a fight rather a poor and hopeless fight from the windows of the house near the entrance of the court but it is doubtful if they would have made an effective resistance if it had not been for this tall excited stranger who was suddenly shouting directions to them in sympathetically murdered russian it was not that he brought powerful blows or subtle strategy to their assistance but that he put heart into them and perplexity into his adversaries because he was so manifestly nonpartizan nobody could ever have mistaken benham for a jew when at last towards dawn a not too zealous governor called out the troops and began to clear the streets of rioters benham and a band of jews were still keeping the gateway of that court behind a hasty but adequate barricade of furniture and handbarrows  the ghetto could not understand him nobody could understand him but it was clear a rare and precious visitor had come to their rescue and he was implored by a number of elderly dirty but very intelligentlooking old men to stay with them and preserve them until their safety was assured  they could not understand him but they did their utmost to entertain him and assure him of their gratitude they seemed to consider him as a representative of the british government and foreign intervention on their behalf is one of those unfortunate fixed ideas that no persecuted jews seem able to abandon  benham found himself refreshed and tended sitting beside a wood fire in an inner chamber richly flavoured by humanity and listening to a discourse in evil but understandable german it was a discourse upon the wrongs and the greatness of the jewish peopleand it was delivered by a compact middleaged man with a big black beard and longlashed but animated eyes beside him a very old man dozed and nodded approval a number of other men crowded the apartment including several who had helped to hold off the rioters from the court some could follow the talk and ever again endorsed the speaker in yiddish or russian others listened with tantalized expressions their brows knit their lips moving  it was a discourse benham had provoked for now he was at the very heart of the jewish question and he could get some light upon the mystery of this great hatred at first hand he did not want to hear tales of outrages of such things he knew but he wanted to understand what was the irritation that caused these things  so he listened the jew dilated at first on the harmlessness and usefulness of the jews  but do you never take a certain advantage benham threw out  the jews are cleverer than the russians must we suffer for that  the spokesman went on to the more positive virtues of his race benham suddenly had that uncomfortable feeling of the gentile who finds a bill being made against him did the world owe israel nothing for philo aron ben asher solomon gabriol halevy mendelssohn heine meyerbeer rubinstein joachim zangwill does britain owe nothing to lord beaconsfield montefiore or the rothschilds can france repudiate her debt to fould gaudahaux oppert or germany to furst steinschneider herxheimer lasker auerbach traube and lazarus and benfey  benham admitted under the pressure of urgent tones and gestures that these names did undoubtedly include the cream of humanity but was it not true that the jews did press a little financially upon the inferior peoples whose lands they honoured in their exile  the man with the black beard took up the challenge bravely  they are merciful creditors he said and it is their genius to possess and control what better stewards could you find for the wealth of nations than the jews and for the honours that always had been the role of the jewsstewardship since the days of joseph in egypt  then in a lower voice he went on to speak of the deficiencies of the gentile population he wished to be just and generous but the truth was the truth the christian russians loved drink and laziness they had no sense of property were it not for unjust laws even now the jews would possess all the land of south russia  benham listened with a kind of fascination but he said  it was so and with a confidence that aroused a protest or so from the onlookers the jewish apologist suddenly rose up opened a safe close beside the fire and produced an armful of documents  look he said all over south russia there are these  benham was a little slow to understand until half a dozen of these papers had been thrust into his hand eager fingers pointed and several voices spoke these things were illegalities that might some day be legal there were the records of loans and hidden transactions that might at any time put all the surrounding soil into the hands of the jew all south russia was mortgaged  but is it so asked benham and for a time ceased to listen and stared into the fire  then he held up the papers in his hand to secure silence and feeling his way in unaccustomed german began to speak and continued to speak in spite of a constant insurgent undertone of interruption from the jewish spokesman  all men benham said were brothers did they not remember nathan the wise  i did not claim him said the spokesman misunderstanding he is a character in fiction  but all men are brothers benham maintained they had to be merciful to one another and give their gifts freely to one another also they had to consider each others weaknesses the jews were probably justified in securing and administering the property of every community into which they came they were no doubt right in claiming to be best fitted for that task but also they had to consider perhaps more than they did the feelings and vanities of the host population into which they brought these beneficent activities what was said of the ignorance incapacity and vice of the roumanians and russians was very generally believed and accepted but it did not alter the fact that the peasant for all his incapacity did like to imagine he owned his own patch and hovel and did have a curious irrational hatred of debt  the faces about benham looked perplexed  this said benham tapping the papers in his hand they will not understand the ultimate benefit of it it will be a source of anger and fresh hostility it does not follow because your race has supreme financial genius that you must always follow its dictates to the exclusion of other considerations  the perplexity increased  benham felt he must be more general he went on to emphasize the brotherhood of man the right to equal opportunity equal privilege freedom to develop their idiosyncrasies as far as possible unhindered by the idiosyncrasies of others he could feel the sympathy and understanding of his hearers returning you see said benham you must have generosity you must forget ancient scores do you not see the world must make a fresh beginning  he was entirely convinced he had them with him the heads nodded assent the bright eyes and lips followed the slow disentanglement of his bad german  free yourselves and the world he said  applause  and so he said breaking unconsciously into english let us begin by burning these beastly mortgages  and with a noble and dramatic gesture benham cast his handful on the fire the assenting faces became masks of horror a score of hands clutched at those precious papers and a yell of dismay and anger filled the room some one caught at his throat from behind dont kill him cried some one he fought for us    6   an hour later benham returned in an extraordinarily dishevelled and battered condition to his hotel he found his friend in anxious consultation with the hotel proprietor  we were afraid that something had happened to you said his friend  i got a little involved said benham  hasnt some one clawed your cheek  very probably said benham  and torn your coat and hit you rather heavily upon the neck  it was a complicated misunderstanding said benham oh pardon im rather badly bruised upon that arm youre holding    7   benham told the story to white as a jest against himself  i see now of course that they could not possibly understand my point of view he said  im not sure if they quite followed my german  its odd too that i remember saying lets burn these mortgages and at the time im almost sure i didnt know the german for mortgage  it was not the only occasion on which other people had failed to grasp the full intention behind benhams proceedings his aristocratic impulses were apt to run away with his conceptions of brotherhood and time after time it was only too manifest to white that benhams pallid flash of anger had astonished the subjects of his disinterested observations extremely his explorations in hayti had been terminated abruptly by an affair with a native policeman that had necessitated the intervention of the british consul it was begun with that suddenness that was too often characteristic of benham by his hitting the policeman it was in the main street of cap haytien and the policeman had just clubbed an unfortunate youth over the head with the heavily loaded wooden club which is the normal instrument of haytien discipline his blow was a repartee part of a triangular altercation in which a large voluble mahoganycoloured lady whose head was tied up in a blue handkerchief played a conspicuous part but it seemed to benham an entirely unjustifiable blow  he allowed an indignation with negro policemen in general that had been gathering from the very moment of his arrival at portauprince to carry him away he advanced with the kind of shout one would hurl at a dog and smote the policeman to the earth with the stout stick that the peculiar social atmosphere of hayti had disposed him to carry by the local standard his blow was probably a trivial one but the moral effect of his indignant pallor and a sort of rearing tallness about him on these occasions was always very considerable unhappily these characteristics could have no effect on a second negro policeman who was approaching the affray from behind and he felled benham by a blow on the shoulder that was meant for the head and with the assistance of his colleague overpowered him while the youth and the woman vanished  the two officials dragged benham in a state of vehement protest to the lockup and only there in the light of a superior officers superior knowledge did they begin to realize the grave fact of his british citizenship  the memory of the destruction of the haytien fleet by a german gunboat was still vivid in portauprince and to that benham owed it that in spite of his blank refusal to compensate the man he had knocked over he was after two days of anger two days of extreme insanitary experience and much meditation upon his unphilosophical hastiness released  quite a number of trivial incidents of a kindred sort diversified his enquiries into indian conditions they too turned for the most part on his facile exasperation at any defiance of his deepfelt desire for human brotherhood at last indeed came an affair that refused ultimately to remain trivial and tangled him up in a coil that invoked newspaper articles and heated controversies  the effect of india upon benhams mind was a peculiar mixture of attraction and irritation he was attracted by the hindu spirit of intellectualism and the hindu repudiation of brutality and he was infuriated by the spirit of caste that cuts the great world of india into a thousand futile little worlds all aloof and hostile one to the other i came to see india he wrote and there is no india there is a great number of indias and each goes about with its chin in the air quietly scorning everybody else  his indian adventures and his great public controversy on caste began with a tremendous row with an indian civil servant who had turned an indian gentleman out of his firstclass compartment and culminated in a disgraceful fracas with a squatting brown holiness at benares who had thrown aside his little brass bowlful of dinner because benhams shadow had fallen upon it  you unendurable snob said benham and then lapsing into the forceful and inadvisable by heaven you shall eat it    8   benhams detestation of human divisions and hostilities was so deep in his character as to seem almost instinctive but he had too a very clear reason for his hostility to all these amazing breaks in human continuity in his sense of the gathering dangers they now involve they had always he was convinced meant conflict hatred misery and the destruction of human dignity but the new conditions of life that have been brought about by modern science were making them far more dangerous than they had ever been before he believed that the evil and horror of war was becoming more and more tremendous with every decade and that the free play of national prejudice and that stupid filching ambitiousness that seems to be inseparable from monarchy were bound to precipitate catastrophe unless a real international aristocracy could be brought into being to prevent it  in the drawer full of papers labelled politics white found a paper called the metal beast it showed that for a time benham had been greatly obsessed by the thought of the armaments that were in those days piling up in every country in europe he had gone to essen and at essen he had met a german who had boasted of zeppelins and the great guns that were presently to smash the effete british fleet and open the imperial way to london  i could not sleep he wrote on account of this man and his talk and the streak of hatred in his talk he distressed me not because he seemed exceptional but because he seemed ordinary i realized that he was more human than i was and that only killing and killing could come out of such humanity i thought of the great ugly guns i had seen and of the still greater guns he had talked about and how gloatingly he thought of the destruction they could do i felt as i used to feel about that infernal stallion that had killed a man with its teeth and feet a despairing fear a sense of monstrosity in life and this creature who had so disturbed me was only a beastly snuffy little man in an illfitting frockcoat who laid his knife and fork by their tips on the edge of his plate and picked his teeth with gusto and breathed into my face as he talked to me the commonest of representative men i went about that westphalian country after that with the conviction that headless soulless blooddrinking metal monsters were breeding all about me i felt that science was producing a poisonous swarm a nest of black dragons they were crouching here and away there in france and england they were crouching like beasts that bide their time mewed up in forts kennelled in arsenals hooded in tarpaulins as hawks are hooded and i had never thought very much about them before and there they were waiting until some human fool like that frockcoated thing of spite and fools like him multiplied by a million saw fit to call them out to action just out of hatred and nationalism and faction  then came a queer fancy  great guns mines battleships all that crueltyapparatus i see it more and more as the gathering revenge of dead joyless matter for the happiness of life it is a conspiracy of the lifeless an enormous plot of the rebel metals against sensation that is why in particular halfliving people seem to love these things la ferriere was a fastness of the kind of tyranny that passes out of human experience the tyranny of the strong man over men essen comes the new thing the tyranny of the strong machine  science is either slave or master these peoplei mean the german people and militarist people generallyhave no real mastery over the scientific and economic forces on which they seem to ride the monster of steel and iron carries kaiser and germany and all europe captive it has persuaded them to mount upon its back and now they must follow the logic of its path whither only kingship will ever master that beast of steel which has got loose into the world nothing but the sense of unconquerable kingship in us all will ever dare withstand it men must be kingly aristocratsit isnt may be now it is must beor these confederated metals these things of chemistry and metallurgy these explosives and mechanisms will trample the blood and life out of our race into mere redstreaked froth and filth  then he turned to the question of this metallic beasts release would it ever be given blood  men of my generation have been brought up in this threat of a great war that never comes for forty years we have had it so that it is with a note of incredulity that one tells oneself after all this war may happen but can it happen  he proceeded to speculate upon the probability whether a great war would ever devastate western europe again and it was very evident to white that he wanted very much to persuade himself against that idea it was too disagreeable for him to think it probable the paper was dated 1910 it was in october 1914 that white who was still working upon the laborious uncertain account of benhams life and thought he has recently published read what benham had written benham concluded that the commonsense of the world would hold up this danger until reason could get to the head of things  there are already mighty forces in germany benham wrote that will struggle very powerfully to avoid a war and these forces increase behind the coarseness and the threatenings the melodrama and the display of the vulgarer sort there arises a great and noble people i have talked with germans of the better kind you cannot have a whole nation of christophes there also the true knighthood discovers itself i do not believe this war will overtake us  well said white  i must go back to germany and understand germany better the notes went on  but other things were to hold benham back from that resolve other things were to hold many men back from similar resolves until it was too late for them  it is preposterous that these monstrous dangers should lower over europe because a certain threatening vanity has crept into the blood of a people because a few crude ideas go inadequately controlled does no one see what that metallic beast will do if they once let it loose it will trample cities it will devour nations  white read this on the 9th of october 1914 one crumpled evening paper at his feet proclaimed in startled headlines rain of incendiary shells antwerp ablaze another declared untruthfully but impressively six zeppelins drop bombs over the doomed city  he had bought all the evening papers and had read and reread them and turned up maps and worried over strategic problems for which he had no data at allas every one did at that timebefore he was able to go on with benhams manuscripts  these pacific reassurances seemed to whites wartroubled mind like finding a flattened and faded flower a girls love token between the pages of some torn and scorched and bloodstained book picked out from a heap of loot after rapine and murder had had their fill  how can we ever begin over again said white and sat for a long time staring gloomily into the fire forgetting forgetting forgetting too that men who are tired and weary die and that new men are born to succeed them  we have to begin over again said white at last and took up benhams papers where he had laid them down    9   one considerable section of benhams treatment of the fourth limitation was devoted to what he called the prejudices of social position this section alone was manifestly expanding into a large treatise upon the psychology of economic organization  it was only very slowly that he had come to realize the important part played by economic and class hostilities in the disordering of human affairs this was a very natural result of his peculiar social circumstances most people born to wealth and ease take the established industrial system as the natural method in human affairs it is only very reluctantly and by real feats of sympathy and disinterestedness that they can be brought to realize that it is natural only in the sense that it has grown up and come about and necessary only because nobody is strong and clever enough to rearrange it their experience of it is a satisfactory experience on the other hand the better off one is the wider is ones outlook and the more alert one is to see the risks and dangers of international dissensions travel and talk to foreigners open ones eyes to aggressive possibilities history and its warnings become conceivable it is in the nature of things that socialists and labour parties should minimize international obligations and necessities and equally so that autocracies and aristocracies and plutocracies should be negligent of and impatient about social reform  but benham did come to realize this broader conflict between worker and director between poor man and possessor between resentful humanity and enterprise between unwilling toil and unearned opportunity it is a far profounder and subtler conflict than any other in human affairs i can foresee a time he wrote when the greater national and racial hatreds may all be so weakened as to be no longer a considerable source of human limitation and misery when the suspicions of complexion and language and social habit are allayed and when the element of hatred and aggression may be clean washed out of most religious cults but i do not begin to imagine a time because i cannot imagine a method when there will not be great friction between those who employ those who direct collective action and those whose part it is to be the rank and file in industrialism this i know is a limitation upon my confidence due very largely to the restricted nature of my knowledge of this sort of organization very probably resentment and suspicion in the mass and selfseeking and dishonesty in the fortunate few are not so deeply seated so necessary as they seem to be and if men can be cheerfully obedient and modestly directive in war time there is no reason why ultimately they should not be so in the business of peace but i do not understand the elements of the methods by which this state of affairs can be brought about  if i were to confess this much to an intelligent working man i know that at once he would answer socialism but socialism is no more a solution of this problem than eating is a solution when one is lost in the wilderness and hungry of course everybody with any intelligence wants socialism everybody that is to say wants to see all human efforts directed to the common good and a common end but brought face to face with practical problems socialism betrays a vast insufficiency of practical suggestions i do not say that socialism would not work but i do say that so far socialists have failed to convince me that they could work it the substitution of a stupid official for a greedy proprietor may mean a vanished dividend a limited output and no other human advantage whatever socialism is in itself a mere eloquent gesture inspiring encouraging perhaps but beyond that not very helpful towards the vast problem of moral and material adjustment before the race that problem is incurably miscellaneous and intricate and only by great multitudes of generous workers one working at this point and one at that secretly devoted knights of humanity hidden and dispersed kings unaware of one another doubting each his right to count himself among those who do these kingly services is this elaborate rightening of work and guidance to be done  so from these most fundamental social difficulties he came back to his panacea all paths and all enquiries led him back to his conception of aristocracy conscious selfdisciplined devoted selfexamining yet secret making no personal nor class pretences as the supreme need not only of the individual but the world    10   it was the labour trouble in the transvaal which had brought the two schoolfellows together again white had been on his way to zimbabwe an emotional disturbance of unusual intensity had driven him to seek consolations in strange scenery and mysterious desolations it was as if zimbabwe called to him benham had come to south africa to see into the question of indian immigration and he was now on his way to meet amanda in london neither man had given much heed to the gathering social conflict on the rand until the storm burst about them there had been a few paragraphs in the papers about a dispute upon a point of labour etiquette a question of the recognition of trade union officials a thing that impressed them both as technical and then suddenly a long incubated quarrel flared out in rioting and violence the burning of houses and furniture attacks on mines attempts to dynamite trains white stayed in johannesburg because he did not want to be stranded up country by the railway strike that was among the possibilities of the situation benham stayed because he was going to london very reluctantly and he was glad of this justification for a few days delay the two men found themselves occupying adjacent tables in the sherborough hotel and white was the first to recognize the other they came together with a warmth and readiness of intimacy that neither would have displayed in london  white had not seen benham since the social days of amanda at lancaster gate and he was astonished at the change a few years had made in him the peculiar contrast of his pallor and his dark hair had become more marked his skin was deader his features seemed more prominent and his expression intenser his eyes were very bright and more sunken under his brows he had suffered from yellow fever in the west indies and these it seemed were the marks left by that illness and he was much more detached from the people about him less attentive to the small incidents of life more occupied with inner things he greeted white with a confidence that white was one day to remember as pathetic  it is good to meet an old friend benham said i have lost friends and i do not make fresh ones i go about too much by myself and i do not follow the same tracks that other people are following  what track was he following it was now that white first heard of the research magnificent he wanted to know what benham was doing and benham after some partial and unsatisfactory explanation of his interest in insurgent hindoos embarked upon larger expositions it is of course a part of something else he amplified he was writing a book an enormous sort of book he laughed with a touch of shyness it was about everything about how to live and how not to live and aristocracy and all sorts of things white was always curious about other peoples books benham became earnest and more explicit under encouragement and to talk about his book was soon to talk about himself in various ways intentionally and inadvertently he told white much these chance encounters these intimacies of the train and hotel will lead men at times to a stark frankness of statement they would never permit themselves with habitual friends  about the johannesburg labour trouble they talked very little considering how insistent it was becoming but the wide propositions of the research magnificent with its large indifference to immediate occurrences its vast patience its tremendous expectations contrasted very sharply in whites memory with the bitterness narrowness and resentment of the events about them for him the thought of that first discussion of this vast inchoate book into which benhams life was flowering and which he was ultimately to summarize trailed with it a fringe of vivid little pictures pictures of crowds of men hurrying on bicycles and afoot under a lowering twilight sky towards murmuring centres of disorder of startling flares seen suddenly afar off of the muffled galloping of troops through the broad dusty street in the night of groups of men standing and watching down straight broad roads roads that ended in groups of chimneys and squat buildings of corrugated iron and once there was a marching body of white men in the foreground and a complicated wire fence and a clustering mass of kaffirs watching them over this fence and talking eagerly amongst themselves  all this affair here is little more than a hitch in the machinery said benham and went back to his large preoccupation  but white who had not seen so much human disorder as benham felt that it was more than that always he kept the tail of his eye upon that eventful background while benham talked to him  when the firearms went off he may for the moment have even given the background the greater share of his attention    11   it was only as white burrowed through his legacy of documents that the full values came to very many things that benham said during these last conversations the papers fitted in with his memories of their long talks like text with commentary so much of benhams talk had repeated the private writings in which he had first digested his ideas that it was presently almost impossible to disentangle what had been said and understood at johannesburg from the fuller statement of those patched and corrected manuscripts the two things merged in whites mind as he read the written text took upon itself a resonance of benhams voice it eked out the hints and broken sentences of his remembered conversation  but some things that benham did not talk about at all left by their mere marked absence an impression on whites mind and occasionally after benham had been talking for a long time there would be an occasional aphasia such as is often apparent in the speech of men who restrain themselves from betraying a preoccupation he would say nothing about amanda or about women in general he was reluctant to speak of prothero and another peculiarity was that he referred perhaps half a dozen times or more to the idea that he was a prig he seemed to be defending himself against some inner accusation some unconquerable doubt of the entire adventure of his life these half hints and hints by omission exercised the quick intuitions of whites mind very keenly and he drew far closer to an understanding of benhams reserves than benham ever suspected  at first after his parting from amanda in london benham had felt completely justified in his treatment of her she had betrayed him and he had behaved he felt with dignity and selfcontrol he had no doubt that he had punished her very effectively and it was only after he had been travelling in china with prothero for some time and in the light of one or two chance phrases in her letters that he began to have doubts whether he ought to have punished her at all and one night at shanghai he had a dream in which she stood before him dishevelled and tearful his amanda very intensely his amanda and said that she was dirty and shameful and spoilt for ever because he had gone away from her afterwards the dream became absurd she showed him the black leopards fur as though it was a rug and it was now motheaten and mangey the leopard skin that had been so bright and wonderful such a little time ago and he awoke before he could answer her and for a long time he was full of unspoken answers explaining that in view of her deliberate unfaithfulness the position she took up was absurd she had spoilt her own fur but what was more penetrating and distressing in this dream was not so much the case amanda stated as the atmosphere of unconquerable intimacy between them as though they still belonged to each other soul to soul as though nothing that had happened afterwards could have destroyed their common responsibility and the common interest of their first unstinted union she was hurt and of course he was hurt he began to see that his marriage to amanda was still infinitely more than a technical bond  and having perceived that much he presently began to doubt whether she realized anything of the sort her letters fluctuated very much in tone but at times they were as detached and guarded as a schoolgirl writing to a cousin then it seemed to benham an extraordinary fraud on her part that she should presume to come into his dream with an entirely deceptive closeness and confidence she began to sound him in these latter letters upon the possibility of divorce this which he had been quite disposed to concede in london now struck him as an outrageous suggestion he wrote to ask her why and she responded exasperatingly that she thought it was better but again why better it is remarkable that although his mind had habituated itself to the idea that easton was her lover in london her thought of being divorced no doubt to marry again filled him with jealous rage she asked him to take the blame in the divorce proceedings there again he found himself ungenerous he did not want to do that why should he do that as a matter of fact he was by no means reconciled to the price he had paid for his research magnificent he regretted his amanda acutely he was regretting her with a regret that grew when by all the rules of life it ought to be diminishing  it was in consequence of that regret and his controversies with prothero while they travelled together in china that his concern about what he called priggishness arose it is a concern that one may suppose has a little afflicted every reasonably selfconscious man who has turned from the natural passionate personal life to religion or to public service or any abstract devotion these things that are at least more extensive than the interests of flesh and blood have a trick of becoming unsubstantial they shine gloriously and inspiringly upon the imagination they capture one and isolate one and then they vanish out of sight it is far easier to be entirely faithful to friend or lover than it is to be faithful to a cause or to ones country or to a religion in the glow of ones first service that larger idea may be as closely spontaneous as a handclasp but in the darkness that comes as the glow dies away there is a fearful sense of unreality it was in such dark moments that benham was most persecuted by his memories of amanda and most distressed by this suspicion that the research magnificent was a priggishness a pretentious logomachy prothero could indeed hint as much so skilfully that at times the dream of nobility seemed an insult to the sunshine to the careless laughter of children to the good light in wine and all the warm happiness of existence and then amanda would peep out of the dusk and whisper of course if you could leave me was i not life even now if you cared to come back to me for i loved you best and loved you still old cheetah long after you had left me to follow your dreams even now i am drifting further into lies and the last shreds of dignity drop from me a dirty lost and shameful leopard i am now who was once clean and bright you could come back cheetah and you could save me yet if you would love me  in certain moods she could wring his heart by such imagined speeches the very quality of her voice was in them a softness that his ear had loved and not only could she distress him but when benham was in this heartache mood when once she had set him going then his little mother also would rise against him touchingly indignant with her blue eyes bright with tears and his frowsty father would back towards him and sit down complaining that he was neglected and even little mrs skelmersdale would reappear bravely tearful on her chair looking after him as he slunk away from her through kensington gardens indeed every personal link he had ever had to life could in certain moods pull him back through the door of selfreproach amanda opened and set him aching and accusing himself of harshness and selfconcentration the very kittens of his childhood revived forgotten moments of longrepented hardness for a year before prothero was killed there were these heartaches that tragedy gave them their crowning justification all these people said in this form or that you owed a debt to us you evaded it you betrayed us you owed us life out of yourself love and services and you have gone off from us all with this life that was ours to live by yourself in dreams about the rule of the world and with empty phantoms of power and destiny all this was intellectualization you sacrificed us to the thin things of the mind there is no rule of the world at all or none that a man like you may lay hold upon the rule of the world is a fortuitous result of incalculably multitudinous forces but all of us you could have made happier you could have spared us distresses prothero died because of you presently it will be the turn of your father your motheramanda perhaps  he made no written note of his heartaches but he made several memoranda about priggishness that white read and came near to understanding in spite of the tugging at his heartstrings benham was making up his mind to be a prig he weighed the cold uningratiating virtues of priggishness against his smouldering passion for amanda and against his obstinate sympathy for protheros grossness and his mothers personal pride and he made his choice but it was a reluctant choice  one fragment began in the air of course i had made myself responsible for her life but it was you see such a confoundedly energetic life as vigorous and as slippery as an eel only by giving all my strength to her could i have held amanda so what was the good of trying to hold amanda  all ones people have this sort of claim upon one claims made by their pride and their selfrespect and their weaknesses and dependences youve no right to hurt them to kick about and demand freedom when it means snapping and tearing the silly suffering tendrils they have wrapped about you the true aristocrat i think will have enough grasp enough steadiness to be kind and right to every human being and still do the work that ought to be his essential life i see that now its one of the things this last year or so of loneliness has made me realize that in so far as i have set out to live the aristocratic life i have failed instead ive discovered itand found myself out im an overstrung man i go harshly and continuously for one idea i live as i ride i blunder through my fences i take off too soon ive no natural ease of mind or conduct or body i am straining to keep hold of a thing too big for me and do a thing beyond my ability only after protheros death was it possible for me to realize the prig i have always been first as regards him and then as regards amanda and my mother and every one a necessary unavoidable priggishness i do not see how certain things can be done without prigs people that is to say so concentrated and specialized in interest as to be a trifle inhuman so resolved as to be rather rhetorical and forced all things must begin with clumsiness there is no assurance about pioneers  some one has to talk about aristocracy some one has to explain aristocracy but the very essence of aristocracy as i conceive it is that it does not explain nor talk about itself  after all it doesnt matter what i am its just a private vexation that i havent got where i meant to get that does not affect the truth i have to tell  if one has to speak the truth with the voice of a prig still one must speak the truth i have worked out some very considerable things in my research and the time has come when i must set them out clearly and plainly that is my job anyhow my journey to london to release amanda will be just the end of my adolescence and the beginning of my real life it will release me from my last entanglement with the fellow creatures i have always failed to make happy its a detail in the work and i shall go on  but i shall feel very like a man who goes back for a surgical operation  its very like that a surgical operation and when it is over perhaps i shall think no more about it  and beyond these things there are great masses of work to be done so far i have but cleared up for myself a project and outline of living i must begin upon these masses now i must do what i can upon the details and presently i shall see more clearly where other men are working to the same ends    12   benhams expedition to china with prothero was essentially a wrestle between his high resolve to work out his conception of the noble life to the utmost limit and his curiously invincible affection and sympathy for the earthliness of that inglorious little don although benham insisted upon the dominance of life by noble imaginations and relentless reasonableness he would never altogether abandon the materialism of life prothero had once said to him you are the advocate of the brain and i of the belly only only we respect each other and at another time you fear emotions and distrust sensations i invite them you do not drink gin because you think it would make you weep but if i could not weep in any other way i would drink gin and it was under the influence of prothero that benham turned from the haughty intellectualism the systematized superiorities and refinements the caste marks and defensive dignities of india to china that great teeming stinking tank of humorous yellow humanity  benham had gone to prothero again after a bout of elevated idealism it was only very slowly that he reconciled his mind to the idea of an entirely solitary pursuit of his aristocratic dream for some time as he went about the world he was trying to bring himself into relationship with the advanced thinkers the liberalminded people who seemed to promise at least a mental and moral cooperation yet it is difficult to see what cooperation was possible unless it was some sort of agreement that presently they should all shout together and it was after a certain pursuit of rabindranath tagore whom he met in hampstead that a horror of perfect manners and perfect finish came upon him and he fled from that starry calm to the rich uncleanness of the most undignified fellow of trinity and as an advocate and exponent of the richness of the lower levels of life as the declared antagonist of caste and of the uttermost refinements of pride prothero went with benham by way of siberia to the chinese scene  their controversy was perceptible at every dinnertable in their choice of food and drink benham was always wary and prothero always appreciative it peeped out in the distribution of their time in the direction of their glances whenever women walked about prothero gave way to a sort of ethnological excitement that girla wonderful racial type but in moscow he was sentimental he insisted on going again to the cosmopolis bazaar and when he had ascertained that anna alexievna had vanished and left no trace he prowled the streets until the small hours  in the eastward train he talked intermittently of her i should have defied cambridge he said  but at every stopping station he got out upon the platform ethnologically alert  theoretically benham was disgusted with prothero really he was not disgusted at all there was something about prothero like a sparrow like a starling like a scotch terrier these too are morally objectionable creatures that do not disgust  prothero discoursed much upon the essential goodness of russians he said they were a people of genius that they showed it in their faults and failures just as much as in their virtues and achievements he extolled the germinating disorder of moscow far above the implacable discipline of berlin only a people of inferior imagination a base materialist people could so maintain its attention upon precision and cleanliness benham was roused to defence against this paradox but all exaltation neglects said prothero no religion has ever boasted that its saints were spick and span this controversy raged between them in the streets of irkutsk it was still burning while they picked their way through the indescribable filth of pekin  you say that all this is a fine disdain for material things said benham but look out there  apt to their argument a couple of sturdy young women came shuffling along cleaving the crowd in the narrow street by virtue of a single word and two brace of pails of human ordure  that is not a fine disdain for material things said benham that is merely individualism and unsystematic living  a mere phase of frankness only frankness is left to them now the manchus crippled them spoilt their roads and broke their waterways european intervention paralyses every attempt they make to establish order on their own lines in the ming days china did not reek and anyhow benham its better than the silly waste of london  and in a little while prothero discovered that china had tried benham and found him wanting centuries and dynasties ago  what was this newfangled aristocratic man he asked but the ideal of confucius the superior person the son of the king there you had the very essence of benham the idea of selfexamination selfpreparation under a vague theocracy vaguer said benham for the confucian heaven could punish and reward even the elaborate sham modesty of the two dreams was the same benham interrupted and protested with heat and this confucian idea of the son of the king prothero insisted had been the cause of chinas paralysis my idea of nobility is not traditional but expectant said benham after all confucianism has held together a great pacific state far longer than any other polity has ever lasted ill accept your confucianism ive not the slightest objection to finding china nearer salvation than any other land do but turn it round so that it looks to the future and not to the past and it will be the best social and political culture in the world that indeed is what is happening mix chinese culture with american enterprise and you will have made a new lead for mankind  from that benham drove on to discoveries when a man thinks of the past he concentrates on self when he thinks of the future he radiates from self call me a neoconfucian with the cone opening forward away from me instead of focussing on me  you make me think of an extinguisher said prothero  you know i am thinking of a focus said benham but all your thought now has become caricature you have stopped thinking you are fighting after making up your mind  prothero was a little disconcerted by benhams prompt endorsement of his chinese identification he had hoped it would be exasperating he tried to barb his offence he amplified the indictment all cultures must be judged by their reaction and fatigue products and confucianism had produced formalism priggishness humbug no doubt its ideals had had their successes they had unified china stamped the idea of universal peace and good manners upon the greatest mass of population in the world paved the way for much beautiful art and literature and living but in the end all your stern orderliness benham said prothero only leads to me the human spirit rebels against this everlasting armour on the soul after han came tang have you never read ling po theres scraps of him in english in that little book you havewhat is itthe lute of jade he was the inevitable epicurean the omar khayyam after the prophet life must relax at last  no cried benham if it is traditional i admit yes but if it is creative no  under the stimulation of their undying controversy benham was driven to closer enquiries into chinese thought he tried particularly to get to mental grips with englishspeaking chinese we still know nothing of china said prothero most of the stuff we have been told about this country is mere middleclass tourists twaddle we send merchants from brixton and missionaries from glasgow and what doesnt remind them of these delectable standards seems either funny to them or wicked i admit the thing is slightly potbound so to speak in the ancient characters and the ancient traditions but for all that they know they have what all the rest of the world has still to find and get when they begin to speak and write in a modern way and handle modern things and break into the soil they have scarcely touched the rest of the world will find just how much it is behind oh not soldiering the chinese are not such fools as that but life  benham was won to a half belief in these assertions  he came to realize more and more clearly that while india dreams or wrestles weakly in its sleep while europe is still hopelessly and foolishly given over to militant monarchies racial vanities delirious religious feuds and an altogether imbecile fumbling with loaded guns china even more than america develops steadily into a massive possibility of ordered and aristocratic liberalism  the two men followed their associated and disconnected paths through benhams chance speeches and notes white caught glimpses as one might catch glimpses through a moving trellis of that bilateral adventure he saw benham in conversation with liberalminded mandarins gravefaced baldbrowed persons with disciplined movements who sat with their hands thrust into their sleeves talking excellent english while prothero pursued enquiries of an intenser more recondite sort with gentlemen of a more confidential type and presently prothero began to discover and discuss the merits of opium  for if one is to disavow all pride and priggishness if one is to find the solution of lifes problem in the rational enjoyment of ones sensations why should one not use opium it is art materialized it gives tremendous experiences with a minimum of exertion and if presently its gifts diminish one need but increase the quantity moreover it quickens the garrulous mind and steadies the happiness of love across the varied adventures of benhams journey in china fell the shadow first of a suspicion and then of a certainty  the perfected and ancient vices of china wrapped about prothero like some tainted but scented robe and all too late benham sought to drag him away and then in a passion of disgust turned from him  to this cried benham one comes save for pride and fierceness  better this than cruelty said prothero talking quickly and clearly because of the evil thing in his veins you think that you are the only explorer of life benham but while you toil up the mountains i board the houseboat and float down the stream for you the stars for me the music and the lanterns you are the son of a mountaineering don and i am a chinese philosopher of the riper school you force yourself beyond fear of pain and i force myself beyond fear of consequences what are we either of us but children groping under the black cloak of our makerwho will not blind us with his light did he not give us also these lusts the keen knife and the sweetness these sensations that are like pineapple smeared with saltpetre like salted olives from heaven like being flayed with delight and did he not give us dreams fantastic beyond any lust whatever what is the good of talking speak to your own kind i have gone benham i am lost already there is no resisting any more since i have drugged away resistance why then should i come back i know now the symphonies of the exalted nerves i can judge and i say better lie and hear them to the end than come back again to my old life to my little tinwhistle solo myeffort my effort i ruin my body i know but what of that i shall soon be thin and filthy what of the grapeskin when one has had the pulp  but said benham the cleanness of life  while i perish said prothero still more wickedly i say good things    13   white had a vision of a great city with narrow crowded streets hung with lank banners and gay with vertical vermilion labels and of a pleasant large low house that stood in a garden on a hillside a garden set with artificial stones and with beasts and men and lanterns of white porcelain a garden which overlooked this city here it was that benham stayed and talked with his host a man robed in marvellous silks and subtle of speech even in the european languages he used and meanwhile prothero it seemed had gone down into the wickedness of the town below it was a very great town indeed spreading for miles along the banks of a huge river a river that divided itself indolently into three shining branches so as to make islands of the central portion of the place and on this river swarmed for ever a vast flotilla of ships and boats boats in which people lived boats in which they sought pleasure moored places of assembly highpooped junks steamboats passenger sampans cargo craft such a water town in streets and lanes endless miles of it as no other part of the world save china can display in the daylight it was gay with countless sunlit colours embroidered upon a fabric of yellow and brown at night it glittered with a hundred thousand lights that swayed and quivered and were reflected quiveringly upon the black flowing waters  and while benham sat and talked in the garden above came a messenger who was for some reason very vividly realized by whites imagination he was a tall man with lacklustre eyes and sunken cheeks that made his cheek bones very prominent and gave his thinlipped mouth something of the geniality of a skull and the arm he thrust out of his yellow robe to hand protheros message to benham was lean as a pole so he stood out in whites imagination against the warm afternoon sky and the brown roofs and blue haze of the great town below and was with one exception the distinctest thing in the story the message he bore was scribbled by prothero himself in a nerveless scrawl send a hundred dollars by this man i am in a frightful fix  now benhams host had been twitting him with the european patronage of opium and something in this message stirred his facile indignation twice before he had had similar demands and on the whole they had seemed to him to be unreasonable demands he was astonished that while he was sitting and talking of the great worldrepublic of the future and the secret selfdirected aristocracy that would make it possible his own friend his chosen companion should thus by this inglorious request and this ungainly messenger disavow him he felt a wave of intense irritation  no he said i will not  and he was too angry to express himself in any language understandable by his messenger  his host intervened and explained after a few questions that the occasion was serious prothero it seemed had been gambling  no said benham he is shameless let him do what he can  the messenger was still reluctant to go  and scarcely had he gone before misgivings seized benham  where is your friend asked the mandarin  i dont know said benham  but they will keep him they may do all sorts of things when they find he is lying to them  lying to them  about your help  stop that man cried benham suddenly realizing his mistake but when the servants went to stop the messenger their intentions were misunderstood and the man dashed through the open gate of the garden and made off down the winding road  stop him cried benham and started in pursuit suddenly afraid for prothero  the chinese are a people of great curiosity and a small pebble sometimes starts an avalanche  white pieced together his conception of the circles of disturbance that spread out from benhams pursuit of protheros flying messenger  for weeks and months the great town had been uneasy in all its ways because of the insurgent spirits from the south and the disorder from the north because of endless rumours and incessant intrigue the stupid manoeuvres of one european power against another the tactlessness of missionaries the growing chinese disposition to meet violence and force with violence and force had fermented and brewed the possibility of an outbreak the sudden resolve of benham to get at once to prothero was like the firing of a mine this tall palefaced incomprehensible stranger charging through the narrow streets that led to the pleasureboats in the south river seemed to many a blueclad citizen like the white peril embodied behind him came the attendants of the rich man up the hill but they surely were traitors to help this stranger  before benham could at all realize what was happening he found his way to the riverboat on which he supposed prothero to be detained barred by a vigorous street fight explanations were impossible he joined in the fight  for three days that fight developed round the mystery of protheros disappearance  it was a complicated struggle into which the local foreign traders on the riverfront and a detachment of modern drilled troops from the upriver barracks were presently drawn it was a struggle that was never clearly explained and at the end of it they found protheros body flung out upon a waste place near a little temple on the river bank stabbed while he was asleep  and from the broken fragments of description that benham let fall white had an impression of him hunting for all those three days through the strange places of a chinese city along narrow passages over queer venetianlike bridges through the vast spaces of empty warehouses in the incensescented darkness of temple yards along planks that passed to the dark hulls of secret barges in quickflying boats that slipped noiselessly among the larger craft and sometimes he hunted alone sometimes in company sometimes black figures struggled in the darkness against dimlit backgrounds and sometimes a swarm of shining yellow faces screamed and shouted through the torn paper windows and then at the end of this confused effect of struggle this chinese kinematograph film one last picture jerked into place and stopped and stood still a white wall in the sunshine come upon suddenly round a corner a dirty flagged passage and a stiff crumpled body that had for the first time an inexpressive face    14   benham sat at a table in the smokingroom of the sherborough hotel at johannesburg and told of these things white watched him from an armchair and as he listened he noted again the intensification of benhams face the darkness under his brows the pallor of his skin the touch of red in his eyes for there was still that red gleam in benhams eyes it shone when he looked out of a darkness into a light and he sat forward with his arms folded under him or moved his long lean hand about over the things on the table  you see he said this is a sort of horror in my mind things like this stick in my mind i am always seeing prothero now and it will take years to get this scar off my memory again once beforeabout a horse i had the same kind of distress and it makes me tender soreminded about everything it will go of course in the long run and its just like any other ache that lays hold of one one cant cure it one has to get along with it  i know white i ought to have sent that money but how was i to know then that it was so imperative to send that money  at the time it seemed just pandering to his vices  i was angry i shall never subdue that kind of hastiness altogether it takes me by surprise before the messenger was out of sight i had repented  i failed him i have gone about in the world dreaming of tremendous things and failing most people my wife too  he stopped talking for a little time and folded his arms tight and stared hard in front of himself his lips compressed  you see white he said with a kind of setting of the teeth this is the sort of thing one has to stand life is imperfect nothing can be done perfectly and on the whole he spoke still more slowly i would go through again with the very same things that have hurt my people if i had to live over again i would try to do the things without hurting the people but i would do the things anyhow because im raw with remorse it does not follow that on the whole i am not doing right right doing isnt balm if i could have contrived not to hurt these people as i have done it would have been better just as it would be better to win a battle without any killed or wounded i was clumsy with them and they suffered i suffer for their suffering but still i have to stick to the way i have taken ones blunders are accidents if one thing is clearer than another it is that the world isnt accidentproof  but i wish i had sent those dollars to prothero god white but i lie awake at night thinking of that messenger as he turned away trying to stop him  i didnt send those dollars so fifty or sixty people were killed and many wounded there for all practical purposes the thing ends perhaps it will serve to give me a little charity for some other fools haste and blundering  i couldnt help it white i couldnt help it  the main thing the impersonal thing goes on one thinks one learns one adds ones contribution of experience and understanding the spirit of the race goes on to light and comprehension in spite of accidents in spite of individual blundering  it would be absurd anyhow to suppose that nobility is so easy as to come slick and true on every occasion  if one gives oneself to any long aim one must reckon with minor disasters this research i undertook grows and grows i believe in it more and more the more it asks from me the more i give to it when i was a youngster i thought the thing i wanted was just round the corner i fancied i would find out the noble life in a year or two just what it was just where it took one and for the rest of my life i would live it finely but i am just one of a multitude of men each one going a little wrong each one achieving a little right and the noble life is a long long way ahead we are working out a new way of living for mankind a new rule a new conscience its no small job for all of us there must be lifetimes of building up and lifetimes of pulling down and trying again hope and disappointments and much need for philosophy i see myself now for the little workman i am upon this tremendous undertaking and all my life hereafter goes to serve it  he turned his sombre eyes upon his friend he spoke with a grim enthusiasm im a prig im a fanatic white but i have something clear something better worth going on with than any adventure of personal relationship could possibly be  and suddenly he began to tell white as plainly as he could of the faith that had grown up in his mind he spoke with a touch of defiance with the tense force of a man who shrinks but overcomes his shame i will tell you what i believe  he told of his early dread of fear and baseness and of the slow development expansion and complication of his idea of selfrespect until he saw that there is no honour nor pride for a man until he refers his life to ends and purposes beyond himself an aristocrat must be loyal so it has ever been but a modern aristocrat must also be lucid there it is that one has at once the demand for kingship and the repudiation of all existing states and kings in this manner he had come to his idea of a great world republic that must replace the little warring kingdoms of the present to the conception of an unseen kingship ruling the whole globe to his king invisible who is the lord of truth and all sane loyalty there he said is the link of our order the new knighthood the new aristocracy that must at last rule the earth there is our prince he is in me he is in you he is latent in all mankind i have worked this out and tried it and lived it and i know that outwardly and inwardly this is the way a man must live or else be a poor thing and a base one on great occasions and small occasions i have failed myself a thousand times but no failure lasts if your faith lasts what i have learnt what i have thought out and made sure i want now to tell the world somehow i will tell it as a book i suppose though i do not know if i shall ever be able to make a book but i have away there in london or with me here all the masses of notes i have made in my search for the life that is worth while living we who are selfappointed aristocrats who are not ashamed of kingship must speak to one another  we can have no organization because organizations corrupt  no recognition  but we can speak plainly  as he talked his voice was for a space drowned by the jingle and voices of mounted police riding past the hotel  but on one side your aristocracy means revolution said white it becomes a political conspiracy  manifestly an open conspiracy it denies the king upon the stamps and the flag upon the wall it is the continual proclamation of the republic of mankind    15   the earlier phases of violence in the rand outbreak in 1913 were manifest rather in the outskirts of johannesburg than at the centre pulling out was going on first at this mine and then that there were riots in benoni attacks on strike breakers and the smashing up of a number of houses it was not until july the 4th that with the suppression of a public meeting in the marketplace johannesburg itself became the storm centre  benham and white were present at this marketplace affair a confused crowded occasion in which a little leaven of active men stirred through a large uncertain multitude of decently dressed onlookers the whole big square was astir a swaying crowd of men a ramshackle platform improvised upon a trolley struggled through the swarming straw hats to a street corner and there was some speaking at first it seemed as though military men were using this platform and then it was manifestly in possession of an excited knot of labour leaders with red rosettes the military men had said their say and got down they came close by benham pushing their way across the square weve warned them said one a red flag like some misunderstood remark at a teaparty was fitfully visible and incomprehensible behind the platform somebody was either pitched or fell off the platform one could hear nothing from the speakers except a minute bleating  then there were shouts that the police were charging a number of mounted men trotted into the square the crowd began a series of short rushes that opened lanes for the passage of the mounted police as they rode to and fro these men trotted through the crowd scattering knots of people they carried pickhandles but they did not seem to be hitting with them it became clear that they aimed at the capture of the trolley there was only a feeble struggle for the trolley it was captured and hauled through the scattered spectators in the square to the protection of a small impassive body of regular cavalry at the opposite corner then quite a number of people seemed to be getting excited and fighting they appeared to be vaguely fighting the footpolice and the police seemed to be vaguely pushing through them and dispersing them the roof of a little onestory shop became prominent as a centre of vigorous stonethrowing  it was no sort of battle merely the normal inconsecutiveness of human affairs had become exaggerated and pugnacious a meeting was being prevented and the police engaged in the operation were being pelted or obstructed mostly people were just looking on  it amounts to nothing said benham even if they held a meeting what could happen why does the government try to stop it  the drifting and charging and a little booing went on for some time every now and then some one clambered to a point of vantage began a speech and was pulled down by policemen and at last across the confusion came an idea like a wind across a pond  the strikers were to go to the power station  that had the effect of a distinct move in the game the power station was the centre of johannesburgs light and energy there if anywhere it would be possible to express ones disapproval of the administration ones desire to embarrass and confute it one could stop all sorts of things from the power station at any rate it was a repartee to the suppression of the meeting everybody seemed gladdened by a definite project  benham and white went with the crowd  at the intersection of two streets they were held up for a time the scattered drift of people became congested gliding slowly across the mass came an electric tram an entirely unbattered tram with even its glass undamaged and then another and another strikers with the happy expression of men who have found something expressive to do were escorting the trams off the street they were being meticulously careful with them never was there less mob violence in a riot they walked by the captured cars almost deferentially like rough men honoured by a real ladys company and when white and benham reached the power house the marvel grew the rioters were already in possession and going freely over the whole place and they had injured nothing they had stopped the engines but they had not even disabled them here too manifestly a majority of the people were like white and benham merely lookerson  but this is the most civilized rioting said benham it isnt rioting its drifting just as things drifted in moscow because nobody has the rudder  what maddens me he said is the democracy of the whole thing white i hate this modern democracy democracy and inequality was there ever an absurder combination what is the good of a social order in which the men at the top are commoner meaner stuff than the men underneath the same stuff just spoilt spoilt by prosperity and opportunity and the conceit that comes with advantage this trouble wants so little just a touch of aristocracy just a little cultivated magnanimity just an inkling of responsibility and the place might rise instantly out of all this squalor and evil temper what does all this struggle here amount to on one side unintelligent greed unintelligent resentment on the other suspicion everywhere  and you know white at bottom they all want to be decent  if only they had light enough in their brains to show them how its such a plain job they have here too a new city the simplest industries freedom from war everything to make a good life for men prosperity glorious sunshine a kind of happiness in the air and mismanagement fear indulgence jealousy prejudice stupidity poison it all a squabble about working on a saturday afternoon a squabble embittered by this universal shadow of miners phthisis that the masters were too incapable and too mean to prevent  oh god cried benham when will men be princes and take hold of life when will the kingship in us wake up and come to its own look at this place look at this place the easy accessible happiness the manifest prosperity the newness and the sunshine and the silly bitterness the rage the mischief and miseries  and then its not our quarrel  its amazing how every human quarrel draws one in to take sides life is one long struggle against the incidental i can feel my anger gathering against the government here in spite of my reason i want to go and expostulate i have a ridiculous idea that i ought to go off to lord gladstone or botha and expostulate what good would it do they move in the magic circles of their own limitations an official a politicianhow would they put itwith many things to consider  its my weakness to be drawn into quarrels its a thing i have to guard against  what does it all amount to it is like a fight between navvies in a tunnel to settle the position of the pole star it doesnt concern us oh it doesnt indeed concern us its a scuffle in the darkness and our business the business of all brains the only permanent good work is to light up the world there will be mischief and hatred here and suppression and then forgetfulness and then things will go on again a little better or a little worse  im tired of this place white and of all such places im tired of the shouting and running the beating and shooting im sick of all the confusions of lifes experience which tells only of one need amidst an endless multitude of distresses ive seen my fill of wars and disputes and struggles i see now how a man may grow weary at last of life and its disorders its unreal exacting disorders its blunders and its remorse no i want to begin upon the realities i have made for myself for they are the realities i want to go now to some quiet corner where i can polish what i have learnt sort out my accumulations be undisturbed by these transitory symptomatic things  what was that boy saying they are burning the star office well let them  and as if to emphasize his detachment his aversion from the things that hurried through the night about them from the red flare in the sky and the distant shouts and revolver shots and scuffling flights down side streets he began to talk again of aristocracy and the making of greatness and a new great spirit in men all the rest of his life he said must be given to that he would say his thing plainly and honestly and afterwards other men would say it clearly and beautifully here it would touch a man and there it would touch a man the invisible king in us all would find himself and know himself a little in this and a little in that and at last a day would come when fair things and fine things would rule the world and such squalor as this about them would be as impossible any more for men as a stone age corroboree  late or soon  benham sought for some loose large measure of time  before those constellations above us have changed their shapes  does it matter if we work at something that will take a hundred years or ten thousand years it will never come in our lives white not soon enough for that but after that everything will be soonwhen one comes to death then everything is at ones fingertipsi can feel that greater world i shall never see as one feels the dawn coming through the last darkness    16   the attack on the rand club began while benham and white were at lunch in the diningroom at the sherborough on the day following the burning of the star office the sherborough diningroom was on the first floor and the venetian window beside their table opened on to a verandah above a piazza as they talked they became aware of an excitement in the street below shouting and running and then a sound of wheels and the tramp of a body of soldiers marching quickly white stood up and looked theyre seizing the stuff in the gunshops he said sitting down again its amazing they havent done it before  they went on eating and discussing the work of a medical mission at mukden that had won benhams admiration  a revolver cracked in the street and there was a sound of glass smashing then more revolver shots thats at the big club at the corner i think said benham and went out upon the verandah  up and down the street mischief was afoot outside the rand club in the cross street a considerable mass of people had accumulated and was being hustled by a handful of khakiclad soldiers down the street people were looking in the direction of the marketplace and then suddenly a rush of figures flooded round the corner first a froth of scattered individuals and then a mass a column marching with an appearance of order and waving a flag it was a poorly disciplined body it fringed out into a swarm of sympathizers and spectators upon the side walk and at the head of it two men disputed they seemed to be differing about the direction of the whole crowd suddenly one smote the other with his fist a blow that hurled him sideways and then turned with a triumphant gesture to the following ranks waving his arms in the air he was a tall lean man hatless and collarless greyhaired and wildeyed on he came gesticulating gauntly past the hotel  and then up the street something happened benhams attention was turned round to it by a checking by a kind of catch in the breath on the part of the advancing procession under the verandah  the roadway beyond the club had suddenly become clear across it a dozen soldiers had appeared and dismounted methodically and lined out with their carbines in readiness the mounted men at the club corner had vanished and the people there had swayed about towards this new threat quite abruptly the miscellaneous noises of the crowd ceased understanding seized upon every one  these soldiers were going to fire  the brown uniformed figures moved like automata the rifle shots rang out almost in one report  there was a rush in the crowd towards doorways and side streets an enquiring pause the darting back of a number of individuals into the roadway and then a derisive shouting nobody had been hit the soldiers had fired in the air  but this is a stupid game said benham why did they fire at all  the tall man who had led the mob had run out into the middle of the road his commando was a little disposed to assume a marginal position and it had to be reassured he was near enough for benham to see his face for a time it looked anxious and thoughtful then he seemed to jump to his decision he unbuttoned and opened his coat wide as if defying the soldiers shoot he bawled shoot if you dare  a little uniform movement of the soldiers answered him the small figure of the officer away there was inaudible the coat of the man below flapped like the wings of a crowing cock before a breast of dirty shirt the hoarse voice cracked with excitement shoot if you dare shoot if you dare see  came the metallic bang of the carbines again and in the instant the leader collapsed in the road a sprawl of clothes hit by half a dozen bullets it was an extraordinary effect as though the figure had been deflated it was incredible that a moment before this thing had been a man an individual a hesitating complicated purpose  good god cried benham butthis is horrible  the heap of garments lay still the red hand that stretched out towards the soldiers never twitched  the spectacular silence broke into a confusion of sounds women shrieked men cursed some fled some sought a corner from which they might still see others pressed forward go for the swine bawled a voice a third volley rattled over the heads of the people and in the road below a man with a rifle halted took aim and answered the soldiers fire look out cried white who was watching the soldiers and ducked this isnt in the air  came a straggling volley again like a man running a metal hammer very rapidly along iron corrugations and this time people were dropping all over the road one whitefaced man not a score of yards away fell with a curse and a sob struggled up staggered for some yards with blood running abundantly from his neck and fell and never stirred again another went down upon his back clumsily in the roadway and lay wringing his hands faster and faster until suddenly with a movement like a sigh they dropped inert by his side a strawhatted youth in a flannel suit ran and stopped and ran again he seemed to be holding something red and strange to his face with both hands above them his eyes were round and anxious blood came out between his fingers he went right past the hotel and stumbled and suddenly sprawled headlong at the opposite corner the majority of the crowd had already vanished into doorways and side streets but there was still shouting and there was still a remnant of amazed and angry men in the roadwayand one or two angry women they were not fighting indeed they were unarmed but if they had had weapons now they would certainly have used them  but this is preposterous cried benham preposterous those soldiers are never going to shoot again this must stop  he stood hesitating for a moment and then turned about and dashed for the staircase good heaven cried white what are you going to do  benham was going to stop that conflict very much as a man might go to stop a clock that is striking unwarrantably and amazingly he was going to stop it because it annoyed his sense of human dignity  white hesitated for a moment and then followed crying benham  but there was no arresting this last outbreak of benhams all too impatient kingship he pushed aside a ducking german waiter who was peeping through the glass doors and rushed out of the hotel with a gesture of authority he ran forward into the middle of the street holding up his hand in which he still held his dinner napkin clenched like a bomb white believes firmly that benham thought he would be able to dominate everything he shouted out something about foolery  haroun al raschid was flinging aside all this sublime indifference to current things  but the carbines spoke again  benham seemed to run unexpectedly against something invisible he spun right round and fell down into a sitting position he sat looking surprised  after one moment of blank funk white drew out his pocket handkerchief held it arm high by way of a white flag and ran out from the piazza of the hotel    17   are you hit cried white dropping to his knees and making himself as compact as possible benham  benham after a moment of perplexed thought answered in a strange voice a whisper into which a whistling note had been mixed  it was stupid of me to come out here not my quarrel faults on both sides and now i cant get up i will sit here a moment and pull myself together perhaps imi must be shot but it seemed to comeinside me if i should be hurt am i hurt will you see to that book of mine white its odd a kind of faintness what  i will see after your book said white and glanced at his hand because it felt wet and was astonished to discover it bright red he forgot about himself then and the fresh flight of bullets down the street  the immediate effect of this blood was that he said something more about the book a promise a definite promise he could never recall his exact words but their intention was binding he conveyed his absolute acquiescence with benhams wishes whatever they were his life for that moment was unreservedly at his friends disposal  white never knew if his promise was heard benham had stopped speaking quite abruptly with that what  he stared in front of him with a doubtful expression like a man who is going to be sick and then in an instant every muscle seemed to give way he shuddered his head flopped and white held a dead man in his arms   the end
