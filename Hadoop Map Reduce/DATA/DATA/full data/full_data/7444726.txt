7444726	some short christmas stories by charles dickens     contents  a christmas tree what christmas is as we grow older the poor relations story the childs story the schoolboys story nobodys story    a christmas tree    i have been looking on this evening at a merry company of children assembled round that pretty german toy a christmas tree  the tree was planted in the middle of a great round table and towered high above their heads  it was brilliantly lighted by a multitude of little tapers and everywhere sparkled and glittered with bright objects  there were rosycheeked dolls hiding behind the green leaves and there were real watches with movable hands at least and an endless capacity of being wound up dangling from innumerable twigs there were frenchpolished tables chairs bedsteads wardrobes eightday clocks and various other articles of domestic furniture wonderfully made in tin at wolverhampton perched among the boughs as if in preparation for some fairy housekeeping there were jolly broadfaced little men much more agreeable in appearance than many real menand no wonder for their heads took off and showed them to be full of sugarplums there were fiddles and drums there were tambourines books workboxes paintboxes sweetmeatboxes peepshow boxes and all kinds of boxes there were trinkets for the elder girls far brighter than any grownup gold and jewels there were baskets and pincushions in all devices there were guns swords and banners there were witches standing in enchanted rings of pasteboard to tell fortunes there were teetotums hummingtops needlecases penwipers smellingbottles conversationcards bouquetholders real fruit made artificially dazzling with gold leaf imitation apples pears and walnuts crammed with surprises in short as a pretty child before me delightedly whispered to another pretty child her bosom friend there was everything and more  this motley collection of odd objects clustering on the tree like magic fruit and flashing back the bright looks directed towards it from every sidesome of the diamondeyes admiring it were hardly on a level with the table and a few were languishing in timid wonder on the bosoms of pretty mothers aunts and nursesmade a lively realisation of the fancies of childhood and set me thinking how all the trees that grow and all the things that come into existence on the earth have their wild adornments at that wellremembered time  being now at home again and alone the only person in the house awake my thoughts are drawn back by a fascination which i do not care to resist to my own childhood  i begin to consider what do we all remember best upon the branches of the christmas tree of our own young christmas days by which we climbed to real life  straight in the middle of the room cramped in the freedom of its growth by no encircling walls or soonreached ceiling a shadowy tree arises and looking up into the dreamy brightness of its top for i observe in this tree the singular property that it appears to grow downward towards the earthi look into my youngest christmas recollections  all toys at first i find  up yonder among the green holly and red berries is the tumbler with his hands in his pockets who wouldnt lie down but whenever he was put upon the floor persisted in rolling his fat body about until he rolled himself still and brought those lobster eyes of his to bear upon mewhen i affected to laugh very much but in my heart of hearts was extremely doubtful of him  close beside him is that infernal snuffbox out of which there sprang a demoniacal counsellor in a black gown with an obnoxious head of hair and a red cloth mouth wide open who was not to be endured on any terms but could not be put away either for he used suddenly in a highly magnified state to fly out of mammoth snuffboxes in dreams when least expected  nor is the frog with cobblers wax on his tail far off for there was no knowing where he wouldnt jump and when he flew over the candle and came upon ones hand with that spotted backred on a green groundhe was horrible  the cardboard lady in a bluesilk skirt who was stood up against the candlestick to dance and whom i see on the same branch was milder and was beautiful but i cant say as much for the larger cardboard man who used to be hung against the wall and pulled by a string there was a sinister expression in that nose of his and when he got his legs round his neck which he very often did he was ghastly and not a creature to be alone with  when did that dreadful mask first look at me  who put it on and why was i so frightened that the sight of it is an era in my life it is not a hideous visage in itself it is even meant to be droll why then were its stolid features so intolerable  surely not because it hid the wearers face  an apron would have done as much and though i should have preferred even the apron away it would not have been absolutely insupportable like the mask  was it the immovability of the mask  the dolls face was immovable but i was not afraid of her  perhaps that fixed and set change coming over a real face infused into my quickened heart some remote suggestion and dread of the universal change that is to come on every face and make it still  nothing reconciled me to it  no drummers from whom proceeded a melancholy chirping on the turning of a handle no regiment of soldiers with a mute band taken out of a box and fitted one by one upon a stiff and lazy little set of lazytongs no old woman made of wires and a brownpaper composition cutting up a pie for two small children could give me a permanent comfort for a long time  nor was it any satisfaction to be shown the mask and see that it was made of paper or to have it locked up and be assured that no one wore it  the mere recollection of that fixed face the mere knowledge of its existence anywhere was sufficient to awake me in the night all perspiration and horror with o i know its coming  o the mask  i never wondered what the dear old donkey with the panniersthere he is was made of then  his hide was real to the touch i recollect  and the great black horse with the round red spots all over himthe horse that i could even get uponi never wondered what had brought him to that strange condition or thought that such a horse was not commonly seen at newmarket  the four horses of no colour next to him that went into the waggon of cheeses and could be taken out and stabled under the piano appear to have bits of furtippet for their tails and other bits for their manes and to stand on pegs instead of legs but it was not so when they were brought home for a christmas present  they were all right then neither was their harness unceremoniously nailed into their chests as appears to be the case now  the tinkling works of the music cart i did find out to be made of quill toothpicks and wire and i always thought that little tumbler in his shirt sleeves perpetually swarming up one side of a wooden frame and coming down head foremost on the other rather a weakminded personthough goodnatured but the jacobs ladder next him made of little squares of red wood that went flapping and clattering over one another each developing a different picture and the whole enlivened by small bells was a mighty marvel and a great delight  ah  the dolls houseof which i was not proprietor but where i visited  i dont admire the houses of parliament half so much as that stonefronted mansion with real glass windows and doorsteps and a real balconygreener than i ever see now except at watering places and even they afford but a poor imitation  and though it did open all at once the entire housefront which was a blow i admit as cancelling the fiction of a staircase it was but to shut it up again and i could believe  even open there were three distinct rooms in it  a sittingroom and bedroom elegantly furnished and best of all a kitchen with uncommonly soft fire irons a plentiful assortment of diminutive utensilsoh the warmingpanand a tin mancook in profile who was always going to fry two fish  what barmecide justice have i done to the noble feasts wherein the set of wooden platters figured each with its own peculiar delicacy as a ham or turkey glued tight on to it and garnished with something green which i recollect as moss  could all the temperance societies of these later days united give me such a teadrinking as i have had through the means of yonder little set of blue crockery which really would hold liquid it ran out of the small wooden cask i recollect and tasted of matches and which made tea nectar  and if the two legs of the ineffectual little sugartongs did tumble over one another and want purpose like punchs hands what does it matter  and if i did once shriek out as a poisoned child and strike the fashionable company with consternation by reason of having drunk a little teaspoon inadvertently dissolved in too hot tea i was never the worse for it except by a powder  upon the next branches of the tree lower down hard by the green roller and miniature gardeningtools how thick the books begin to hang  thin books in themselves at first but many of them and with deliciously smooth covers of bright red or green  what fat black letters to begin with  a was an archer and shot at a frog of course he was  he was an applepie also and there he is  he was a good many things in his time was a and so were most of his friends except x who had so little versatility that i never knew him to get beyond xerxes or xantippelike y who was always confined to a yacht or a yew tree and z condemned for ever to be a zebra or a zany  but now the very tree itself changes and becomes a beanstalkthe marvellous beanstalk up which jack climbed to the giants house  and now those dreadfully interesting doubleheaded giants with their clubs over their shoulders begin to stride along the boughs in a perfect throng dragging knights and ladies home for dinner by the hair of their heads  and jackhow noble with his sword of sharpness and his shoes of swiftness  again those old meditations come upon me as i gaze up at him and i debate within myself whether there was more than one jack which i am loth to believe possible or only one genuine original admirable jack who achieved all the recorded exploits  good for christmastime is the ruddy colour of the cloak in which the tree making a forest of itself for her to trip through with her basketlittle red ridinghood comes to me one christmas eve to give me information of the cruelty and treachery of that dissembling wolf who ate her grandmother without making any impression on his appetite and then ate her after making that ferocious joke about his teeth  she was my first love  i felt that if i could have married little red ridinghood i should have known perfect bliss but it was not to be and there was nothing for it but to look out the wolf in the noahs ark there and put him late in the procession on the table as a monster who was to be degraded  o the wonderful noahs ark  it was not found seaworthy when put in a washingtub and the animals were crammed in at the roof and needed to have their legs well shaken down before they could be got in even there and then ten to one but they began to tumble out at the door which was but imperfectly fastened with a wire latchbut what was that against it  consider the noble fly a size or two smaller than the elephant  the ladybird the butterflyall triumphs of art consider the goose whose feet were so small and whose balance was so indifferent that he usually tumbled forward and knocked down all the animal creation  consider noah and his family like idiotic tobaccostoppers and how the leopard stuck to warm little fingers and how the tails of the larger animals used gradually to resolve themselves into frayed bits of string  hush  again a forest and somebody up in a treenot robin hood not valentine not the yellow dwarf i have passed him and all mother bunchs wonders without mention but an eastern king with a glittering scimitar and turban  by allah two eastern kings for i see another looking over his shoulder  down upon the grass at the trees foot lies the full length of a coalblack giant stretched asleep with his head in a ladys lap and near them is a glass box fastened with four locks of shining steel in which he keeps the lady prisoner when he is awake  i see the four keys at his girdle now  the lady makes signs to the two kings in the tree who softly descend  it is the settingin of the bright arabian nights  oh now all common things become uncommon and enchanted to me  all lamps are wonderful all rings are talismans  common flowerpots are full of treasure with a little earth scattered on the top trees are for ali baba to hide in beefsteaks are to throw down into the valley of diamonds that the precious stones may stick to them and be carried by the eagles to their nests whence the traders with loud cries will scare them  tarts are made according to the recipe of the viziers son of bussorah who turned pastrycook after he was set down in his drawers at the gate of damascus cobblers are all mustaphas and in the habit of sewing up people cut into four pieces to whom they are taken blindfold  any iron ring let into stone is the entrance to a cave which only waits for the magician and the little fire and the necromancy that will make the earth shake  all the dates imported come from the same tree as that unlucky date with whose shell the merchant knocked out the eye of the genies invisible son  all olives are of the stock of that fresh fruit concerning which the commander of the faithful overheard the boy conduct the fictitious trial of the fraudulent olive merchant all apples are akin to the apple purchased with two others from the sultans gardener for three sequins and which the tall black slave stole from the child  all dogs are associated with the dog really a transformed man who jumped upon the bakers counter and put his paw on the piece of bad money  all rice recalls the rice which the awful lady who was a ghoule could only peck by grains because of her nightly feasts in the burialplace  my very rockinghorsethere he is with his nostrils turned completely insideout indicative of bloodshould have a peg in his neck by virtue thereof to fly away with me as the wooden horse did with the prince of persia in the sight of all his fathers court  yes on every object that i recognise among those upper branches of my christmas tree i see this fairy light  when i wake in bed at daybreak on the cold dark winter mornings the white snow dimly beheld outside through the frost on the windowpane i hear dinarzade  sister sister if you are yet awake i pray you finish the history of the young king of the black islands  scheherazade replies if my lord the sultan will suffer me to live another day sister i will not only finish that but tell you a more wonderful story yet  then the gracious sultan goes out giving no orders for the execution and we all three breathe again  at this height of my tree i begin to see cowering among the leaves it may be born of turkey or of pudding or mince pie or of these many fancies jumbled with robinson crusoe on his desert island philip quarll among the monkeys sandford and merton with mr barlow mother bunch and the maskor it may be the result of indigestion assisted by imagination and overdoctoringa prodigious nightmare  it is so exceedingly indistinct that i dont know why its frightfulbut i know it is  i can only make out that it is an immense array of shapeless things which appear to be planted on a vast exaggeration of the lazytongs that used to bear the toy soldiers and to be slowly coming close to my eyes and receding to an immeasurable distance  when it comes closest it is worse  in connection with it i descry remembrances of winter nights incredibly long of being sent early to bed as a punishment for some small offence and waking in two hours with a sensation of having been asleep two nights of the laden hopelessness of morning ever dawning and the oppression of a weight of remorse  and now i see a wonderful row of little lights rise smoothly out of the ground before a vast green curtain  now a bell ringsa magic bell which still sounds in my ears unlike all other bellsand music plays amidst a buzz of voices and a fragrant smell of orangepeel and oil  anon the magic bell commands the music to cease and the great green curtain rolls itself up majestically and the play begins  the devoted dog of montargis avenges the death of his master foully murdered in the forest of bondy and a humorous peasant with a red nose and a very little hat whom i take from this hour forth to my bosom as a friend i think he was a waiter or an hostler at a village inn but many years have passed since he and i have met remarks that the sassigassity of that dog is indeed surprising and evermore this jocular conceit will live in my remembrance fresh and unfading overtopping all possible jokes unto the end of time  or now i learn with bitter tears how poor jane shore dressed all in white and with her brown hair hanging down went starving through the streets or how george barnwell killed the worthiest uncle that ever man had and was afterwards so sorry for it that he ought to have been let off  comes swift to comfort me the pantomimestupendous phenomenonwhen clowns are shot from loaded mortars into the great chandelier bright constellation that it is when harlequins covered all over with scales of pure gold twist and sparkle like amazing fish when pantaloon whom i deem it no irreverence to compare in my own mind to my grandfather puts redhot pokers in his pocket and cries heres somebody coming or taxes the clown with petty larceny by saying now i sawed you do it when everything is capable with the greatest ease of being changed into anything and nothing is but thinking makes it so now too i perceive my first experience of the dreary sensation often to return in afterlifeof being unable next day to get back to the dull settled world of wanting to live for ever in the bright atmosphere i have quitted of doting on the little fairy with the wand like a celestial barbers pole and pining for a fairy immortality along with her  ah she comes back in many shapes as my eye wanders down the branches of my christmas tree and goes as often and has never yet stayed by me  out of this delight springs the toytheatrethere it is with its familiar proscenium and ladies in feathers in the boxesand all its attendant occupation with paste and glue and gum and water colours in the gettingup of the miller and his men and elizabeth or the exile of siberia  in spite of a few besetting accidents and failures particularly an unreasonable disposition in the respectable kelmar and some others to become faint in the legs and double up at exciting points of the drama a teeming world of fancies so suggestive and allembracing that far below it on my christmas tree i see dark dirty real theatres in the daytime adorned with these associations as with the freshest garlands of the rarest flowers and charming me yet  but hark  the waits are playing and they break my childish sleep what images do i associate with the christmas music as i see them set forth on the christmas tree  known before all the others keeping far apart from all the others they gather round my little bed  an angel speaking to a group of shepherds in a field some travellers with eyes uplifted following a star a baby in a manger a child in a spacious temple talking with grave men a solemn figure with a mild and beautiful face raising a dead girl by the hand again near a city gate calling back the son of a widow on his bier to life a crowd of people looking through the opened roof of a chamber where he sits and letting down a sick person on a bed with ropes the same in a tempest walking on the water to a ship again on a seashore teaching a great multitude again with a child upon his knee and other children round again restoring sight to the blind speech to the dumb hearing to the deaf health to the sick strength to the lame knowledge to the ignorant again dying upon a cross watched by armed soldiers a thick darkness coming on the earth beginning to shake and only one voice heard forgive them for they know not what they do  still on the lower and maturer branches of the tree christmas associations cluster thick  schoolbooks shut up ovid and virgil silenced the rule of three with its cool impertinent inquiries long disposed of terence and plautus acted no more in an arena of huddled desks and forms all chipped and notched and inked cricketbats stumps and balls left higher up with the smell of trodden grass and the softened noise of shouts in the evening air the tree is still fresh still gay  if i no more come home at christmastime there will be boys and girls thank heaven while the world lasts and they do  yonder they dance and play upon the branches of my tree god bless them merrily and my heart dances and plays too  and i do come home at christmas  we all do or we all should  we all come home or ought to come home for a short holidaythe longer the betterfrom the great boardingschool where we are for ever working at our arithmetical slates to take and give a rest as to going a visiting where can we not go if we will where have we not been when we would starting our fancy from our christmas tree  away into the winter prospect  there are many such upon the tree on by lowlying misty grounds through fens and fogs up long hills winding dark as caverns between thick plantations almost shutting out the sparkling stars so out on broad heights until we stop at last with sudden silence at an avenue  the gatebell has a deep halfawful sound in the frosty air the gate swings open on its hinges and as we drive up to a great house the glancing lights grow larger in the windows and the opposing rows of trees seem to fall solemnly back on either side to give us place  at intervals all day a frightened hare has shot across this whitened turf or the distant clatter of a herd of deer trampling the hard frost has for the minute crushed the silence too  their watchful eyes beneath the fern may be shining now if we could see them like the icy dewdrops on the leaves but they are still and all is still  and so the lights growing larger and the trees falling back before us and closing up again behind us as if to forbid retreat we come to the house  there is probably a smell of roasted chestnuts and other good comfortable things all the time for we are telling winter stories ghost stories or more shame for usround the christmas fire and we have never stirred except to draw a little nearer to it  but no matter for that  we came to the house and it is an old house full of great chimneys where wood is burnt on ancient dogs upon the hearth and grim portraits some of them with grim legends too lower distrustfully from the oaken panels of the walls  we are a middleaged nobleman and we make a generous supper with our host and hostess and their guestsit being christmastime and the old house full of companyand then we go to bed  our room is a very old room  it is hung with tapestry  we dont like the portrait of a cavalier in green over the fireplace  there are great black beams in the ceiling and there is a great black bedstead supported at the foot by two great black figures who seem to have come off a couple of tombs in the old baronial church in the park for our particular accommodation  but we are not a superstitious nobleman and we dont mind  well we dismiss our servant lock the door and sit before the fire in our dressinggown musing about a great many things  at length we go to bed  well we cant sleep  we toss and tumble and cant sleep  the embers on the hearth burn fitfully and make the room look ghostly  we cant help peeping out over the counterpane at the two black figures and the cavalierthat wicked looking cavalierin green  in the flickering light they seem to advance and retire  which though we are not by any means a superstitious nobleman is not agreeable  well we get nervous more and more nervous  we say this is very foolish but we cant stand this well pretend to be ill and knock up somebody  well we are just going to do it when the locked door opens and there comes in a young woman deadly pale and with long fair hair who glides to the fire and sits down in the chair we have left there wringing her hands  then we notice that her clothes are wet  our tongue cleaves to the roof of our mouth and we cant speak but we observe her accurately  her clothes are wet her long hair is dabbled with moist mud she is dressed in the fashion of two hundred years ago and she has at her girdle a bunch of rusty keys  well there she sits and we cant even faint we are in such a state about it  presently she gets up and tries all the locks in the room with the rusty keys which wont fit one of them then she fixes her eyes on the portrait of the cavalier in green and says in a low terrible voice the stags know it  after that she wrings her hands again passes the bedside and goes out at the door  we hurry on our dressinggown seize our pistols we always travel with pistols and are following when we find the door locked  we turn the key look out into the dark gallery no one there  we wander away and try to find our servant  cant be done we pace the gallery till daybreak then return to our deserted room fall asleep and are awakened by our servant nothing ever haunts him and the shining sun  well we make a wretched breakfast and all the company say we look queer  after breakfast we go over the house with our host and then we take him to the portrait of the cavalier in green and then it all comes out  he was false to a young housekeeper once attached to that family and famous for her beauty who drowned herself in a pond and whose body was discovered after a long time because the stags refused to drink of the water  since which it has been whispered that she traverses the house at midnight but goes especially to that room where the cavalier in green was wont to sleep trying the old locks with the rusty keys  well we tell our host of what we have seen and a shade comes over his features and he begs it may be hushed up and so it is  but its all true and we said so before we died we are dead now to many responsible people  there is no end to the old houses with resounding galleries and dismal statebedchambers and haunted wings shut up for many years through which we may ramble with an agreeable creeping up our back and encounter any number of ghosts but it is worthy of remark perhaps reducible to a very few general types and classes for ghosts have little originality and walk in a beaten track  thus it comes to pass that a certain room in a certain old hall where a certain bad lord baronet knight or gentleman shot himself has certain planks in the floor from which the blood will not be taken out  you may scrape and scrape as the present owner has done or plane and plane as his father did or scrub and scrub as his grandfather did or burn and burn with strong acids as his great grandfather did but there the blood will still beno redder and no palerno more and no lessalways just the same  thus in such another house there is a haunted door that never will keep open or another door that never will keep shut or a haunted sound of a spinningwheel or a hammer or a footstep or a cry or a sigh or a horses tramp or the rattling of a chain  or else there is a turretclock which at the midnight hour strikes thirteen when the head of the family is going to die or a shadowy immovable black carriage which at such a time is always seen by somebody waiting near the great gates in the stableyard  or thus it came to pass how lady mary went to pay a visit at a large wild house in the scottish highlands and being fatigued with her long journey retired to bed early and innocently said next morning at the breakfasttable how odd to have so late a party last night in this remote place and not to tell me of it before i went to bed then every one asked lady mary what she meant  then lady mary replied why all night long the carriages were driving round and round the terrace underneath my window  then the owner of the house turned pale and so did his lady and charles macdoodle of macdoodle signed to lady mary to say no more and every one was silent  after breakfast charles macdoodle told lady mary that it was a tradition in the family that those rumbling carriages on the terrace betokened death  and so it proved for two months afterwards the lady of the mansion died  and lady mary who was a maid of honour at court often told this story to the old queen charlotte by this token that the old king always said eh eh what what  ghosts ghosts  no such thing no such thing  and never left off saying so until he went to bed  or a friend of somebodys whom most of us know when he was a young man at college had a particular friend with whom he made the compact that if it were possible for the spirit to return to this earth after its separation from the body he of the twain who first died should reappear to the other  in course of time this compact was forgotten by our friend the two young men having progressed in life and taken diverging paths that were wide asunder  but one night many years afterwards our friend being in the north of england and staying for the night in an inn on the yorkshire moors happened to look out of bed and there in the moonlight leaning on a bureau near the window steadfastly regarding him saw his old college friend  the appearance being solemnly addressed replied in a kind of whisper but very audibly do not come near me  i am dead  i am here to redeem my promise  i come from another world but may not disclose its secrets  then the whole form becoming paler melted as it were into the moonlight and faded away  or there was the daughter of the first occupier of the picturesque elizabethan house so famous in our neighbourhood  you have heard about her  no  why she went out one summer evening at twilight when she was a beautiful girl just seventeen years of age to gather flowers in the garden and presently came running terrified into the hall to her father saying oh dear father i have met myself  he took her in his arms and told her it was fancy but she said oh no  i met myself in the broad walk and i was pale and gathering withered flowers and i turned my head and held them up  and that night she died and a picture of her story was begun though never finished and they say it is somewhere in the house to this day with its face to the wall  or the uncle of my brothers wife was riding home on horseback one mellow evening at sunset when in a green lane close to his own house he saw a man standing before him in the very centre of a narrow way  why does that man in the cloak stand there he thought  does he want me to ride over him  but the figure never moved  he felt a strange sensation at seeing it so still but slackened his trot and rode forward  when he was so close to it as almost to touch it with his stirrup his horse shied and the figure glided up the bank in a curious unearthly mannerbackward and without seeming to use its feetand was gone  the uncle of my brothers wife exclaiming good heaven  its my cousin harry from bombay put spurs to his horse which was suddenly in a profuse sweat and wondering at such strange behaviour dashed round to the front of his house  there he saw the same figure just passing in at the long french window of the drawingroom opening on the ground  he threw his bridle to a servant and hastened in after it  his sister was sitting there alone  alice wheres my cousin harry  your cousin harry john  yes  from bombay  i met him in the lane just now and saw him enter here this instant  not a creature had been seen by any one and in that hour and minute as it afterwards appeared this cousin died in india  or it was a certain sensible old maiden lady who died at ninety nine and retained her faculties to the last who really did see the orphan boy a story which has often been incorrectly told but of which the real truth is thisbecause it is in fact a story belonging to our familyand she was a connexion of our family when she was about forty years of age and still an uncommonly fine woman her lover died young which was the reason why she never married though she had many offers she went to stay at a place in kent which her brother an indianmerchant had newly bought there was a story that this place had once been held in trust by the guardian of a young boy who was himself the next heir and who killed the young boy by harsh and cruel treatment  she knew nothing of that  it has been said that there was a cage in her bedroom in which the guardian used to put the boy  there was no such thing there was only a closet  she went to bed made no alarm whatever in the night and in the morning said composedly to her maid when she came in who is the pretty forlornlooking child who has been peeping out of that closet all night  the maid replied by giving a loud scream and instantly decamping  she was surprised but she was a woman of remarkable strength of mind and she dressed herself and went downstairs and closeted herself with her brother  now walter she said i have been disturbed all night by a pretty forlornlooking boy who has been constantly peeping out of that closet in my room which i cant open  this is some trick  i am afraid not charlotte said he for it is the legend of the house it is the orphan boy  what did he do  he opened the door softly said she and peeped out  sometimes he came a step or two into the room  then i called to him to encourage him and he shrunk and shuddered and crept in again and shut the door  the closet has no communication charlotte said her brother with any other part of the house and its nailed up  this was undeniably true and it took two carpenters a whole forenoon to get it open for examination  then she was satisfied that she had seen the orphan boy  but the wild and terrible part of the story is that he was also seen by three of her brothers sons in succession who all died young  on the occasion of each child being taken ill he came home in a heat twelve hours before and said oh mamma he had been playing under a particular oaktree in a certain meadow with a strange boya pretty forlornlooking boy who was very timid and made signs  from fatal experience the parents came to know that this was the orphan boy and that the course of that child whom he chose for his little playmate was surely run  legion is the name of the german castles where we sit up alone to wait for the spectrewhere we are shown into a room made comparatively cheerful for our receptionwhere we glance round at the shadows thrown on the blank walls by the crackling firewhere we feel very lonely when the village innkeeper and his pretty daughter have retired after laying down a fresh store of wood upon the hearth and setting forth on the small table such suppercheer as a cold roast capon bread grapes and a flask of old rhine wine where the reverberating doors close on their retreat one after another like so many peals of sullen thunderand where about the small hours of the night we come into the knowledge of divers supernatural mysteries  legion is the name of the haunted german students in whose society we draw yet nearer to the fire while the schoolboy in the corner opens his eyes wide and round and flies off the footstool he has chosen for his seat when the door accidentally blows open  vast is the crop of such fruit shining on our christmas tree in blossom almost at the very top ripening all down the boughs  among the later toys and fancies hanging thereas idle often and less purebe the images once associated with the sweet old waits the softened music in the night ever unalterable  encircled by the social thoughts of christmastime still let the benignant figure of my childhood stand unchanged  in every cheerful image and suggestion that the season brings may the bright star that rested above the poor roof be the star of all the christian world  a moments pause o vanishing tree of which the lower boughs are dark to me as yet and let me look once more  i know there are blank spaces on thy branches where eyes that i have loved have shone and smiled from which they are departed  but far above i see the raiser of the dead girl and the widows son and god is good  if age be hiding for me in the unseen portion of thy downward growth o may i with a grey head turn a childs heart to that figure yet and a childs trustfulness and confidence  now the tree is decorated with bright merriment and song and dance and cheerfulness  and they are welcome  innocent and welcome be they ever held beneath the branches of the christmas tree which cast no gloomy shadow  but as it sinks into the ground i hear a whisper going through the leaves  this in commemoration of the law of love and kindness mercy and compassion this in remembrance of me    what christmas is as we grow older    time was with most of us when christmas day encircling all our limited world like a magic ring left nothing out for us to miss or seek bound together all our home enjoyments affections and hopes grouped everything and every one around the christmas fire and made the little picture shining in our bright young eyes complete  time came perhaps all so soon when our thoughts overleaped that narrow boundary when there was some one very dear we thought then very beautiful and absolutely perfect wanting to the fulness of our happiness when we were wanting too or we thought so which did just as well at the christmas hearth by which that some one sat and when we intertwined with every wreath and garland of our life that some ones name  that was the time for the bright visionary christmases which have long arisen from us to show faintly after summer rain in the palest edges of the rainbow  that was the time for the beatified enjoyment of the things that were to be and never were and yet the things that were so real in our resolute hope that it would be hard to say now what realities achieved since have been stronger  what  did that christmas never really come when we and the priceless pearl who was our young choice were received after the happiest of totally impossible marriages by the two united families previously at daggersdrawn on our account  when brothers and sistersinlaw who had always been rather cool to us before our relationship was effected perfectly doted on us and when fathers and mothers overwhelmed us with unlimited incomes  was that christmas dinner never really eaten after which we arose and generously and eloquently rendered honour to our late rival present in the company then and there exchanging friendship and forgiveness and founding an attachment not to be surpassed in greek or roman story which subsisted until death  has that same rival long ceased to care for that same priceless pearl and married for money and become usurious  above all do we really know now that we should probably have been miserable if we had won and worn the pearl and that we are better without her  that christmas when we had recently achieved so much fame when we had been carried in triumph somewhere for doing something great and good when we had won an honoured and ennobled name and arrived and were received at home in a shower of tears of joy is it possible that that christmas has not come yet  and is our life here at the best so constituted that pausing as we advance at such a noticeable milestone in the track as this great birthday we look back on the things that never were as naturally and full as gravely as on the things that have been and are gone or have been and still are  if it be so and so it seems to be must we come to the conclusion that life is little better than a dream and little worth the loves and strivings that we crowd into it  no  far be such miscalled philosophy from us dear reader on christmas day  nearer and closer to our hearts be the christmas spirit which is the spirit of active usefulness perseverance cheerful discharge of duty kindness and forbearance  it is in the last virtues especially that we are or should be strengthened by the unaccomplished visions of our youth for who shall say that they are not our teachers to deal gently even with the impalpable nothings of the earth  therefore as we grow older let us be more thankful that the circle of our christmas associations and of the lessons that they bring expands  let us welcome every one of them and summon them to take their places by the christmas hearth  welcome old aspirations glittering creatures of an ardent fancy to your shelter underneath the holly  we know you and have not outlived you yet  welcome old projects and old loves however fleeting to your nooks among the steadier lights that burn around us  welcome all that was ever real to our hearts and for the earnestness that made you real thanks to heaven  do we build no christmas castles in the clouds now  let our thoughts fluttering like butterflies among these flowers of children bear witness before this boy there stretches out a future brighter than we ever looked on in our old romantic time but bright with honour and with truth  around this little head on which the sunny curls lie heaped the graces sport as prettily as airily as when there was no scythe within the reach of time to shear away the curls of our firstlove  upon another girls face near itplacider but smiling brighta quiet and contented little face we see home fairly written  shining from the word as rays shine from a star we see how when our graves are old other hopes than ours are young other hearts than ours are moved how other ways are smoothed how other happiness blooms ripens and decaysno not decays for other homes and other bands of children not yet in being nor for ages yet to be arise and bloom and ripen to the end of all  welcome everything  welcome alike what has been and what never was and what we hope may be to your shelter underneath the holly to your places round the christmas fire where what is sits open hearted  in yonder shadow do we see obtruding furtively upon the blaze an enemys face  by christmas day we do forgive him  if the injury he has done us may admit of such companionship let him come here and take his place  if otherwise unhappily let him go hence assured that we will never injure nor accuse him  on this day we shut out nothing  pause says a low voice  nothing  think  on christmas day we will shut out from our fireside nothing  not the shadow of a vast city where the withered leaves are lying deep the voice replies  not the shadow that darkens the whole globe  not the shadow of the city of the dead  not even that  of all days in the year we will turn our faces towards that city upon christmas day and from its silent hosts bring those we loved among us  city of the dead in the blessed name wherein we are gathered together at this time and in the presence that is here among us according to the promise we will receive and not dismiss thy people who are dear to us  yes  we can look upon these children angels that alight so solemnly so beautifully among the living children by the fire and can bear to think how they departed from us  entertaining angels unawares as the patriarchs did the playful children are unconscious of their guests but we can see themcan see a radiant arm around one favourite neck as if there were a tempting of that child away  among the celestial figures there is one a poor misshapen boy on earth of a glorious beauty now of whom his dying mother said it grieved her much to leave him here alone for so many years as it was likely would elapse before he came to her being such a little child  but he went quickly and was laid upon her breast and in her hand she leads him  there was a gallant boy who fell far away upon a burning sand beneath a burning sun and said tell them at home with my last love how much i could have wished to kiss them once but that i died contented and had done my duty  or there was another over whom they read the words therefore we commit his body to the deep and so consigned him to the lonely ocean and sailed on  or there was another who lay down to his rest in the dark shadow of great forests and on earth awoke no more  o shall they not from sand and sea and forest be brought home at such a time  there was a dear girlalmost a womannever to be onewho made a mourning christmas in a house of joy and went her trackless way to the silent city  do we recollect her worn out faintly whispering what could not be heard and falling into that last sleep for weariness  o look upon her now  o look upon her beauty her serenity her changeless youth her happiness  the daughter of jairus was recalled to life to die but she more blest has heard the same voice saying unto her arise for ever  we had a friend who was our friend from early days with whom we often pictured the changes that were to come upon our lives and merrily imagined how we would speak and walk and think and talk when we came to be old  his destined habitation in the city of the dead received him in his prime  shall he be shut out from our christmas remembrance  would his love have so excluded us  lost friend lost child lost parent sister brother husband wife we will not so discard you  you shall hold your cherished places in our christmas hearts and by our christmas fires and in the season of immortal hope and on the birthday of immortal mercy we will shut out nothing  the winter sun goes down over town and village on the sea it makes a rosy path as if the sacred tread were fresh upon the water  a few more moments and it sinks and night comes on and lights begin to sparkle in the prospect  on the hillside beyond the shapelesslydiffused town and in the quiet keeping of the trees that gird the villagesteeple remembrances are cut in stone planted in common flowers growing in grass entwined with lowly brambles around many a mound of earth  in town and village there are doors and windows closed against the weather there are flaming logs heaped high there are joyful faces there is healthy music of voices  be all ungentleness and harm excluded from the temples of the household gods but be those remembrances admitted with tender encouragement  they are of the time and all its comforting and peaceful reassurances and of the history that reunited even upon earth the living and the dead and of the broad beneficence and goodness that too many men have tried to tear to narrow shreds    the poor relations story    he was very reluctant to take precedence of so many respected members of the family by beginning the round of stories they were to relate as they sat in a goodly circle by the christmas fire and he modestly suggested that it would be more correct if john our esteemed host whose health he begged to drink would have the kindness to begin  for as to himself he said he was so little used to lead the way that really but as they all cried out here that he must begin and agreed with one voice that he might could would and should begin he left off rubbing his hands and took his legs out from under his armchair and did begin  i have no doubt said the poor relation that i shall surprise the assembled members of our family and particularly john our esteemed host to whom we are so much indebted for the great hospitality with which he has this day entertained us by the confession i am going to make  but if you do me the honour to be surprised at anything that falls from a person so unimportant in the family as i am i can only say that i shall be scrupulously accurate in all i relate  i am not what i am supposed to be  i am quite another thing perhaps before i go further i had better glance at what i am supposed to be  it is supposed unless i mistakethe assembled members of our family will correct me if i do which is very likely here the poor relation looked mildly about him for contradiction that i am nobodys enemy but my own  that i never met with any particular success in anything  that i failed in business because i was unbusinesslike and credulousin not being prepared for the interested designs of my partner  that i failed in love because i was ridiculously trustfulin thinking it impossible that christiana could deceive me  that i failed in my expectations from my uncle chill on account of not being as sharp as he could have wished in worldly matters  that through life i have been rather put upon and disappointed in a general way  that i am at present a bachelor of between fiftynine and sixty years of age living on a limited income in the form of a quarterly allowance to which i see that john our esteemed host wishes me to make no further allusion  the supposition as to my present pursuits and habits is to the following effect  i live in a lodging in the clapham roada very clean back room in a very respectable housewhere i am expected not to be at home in the daytime unless poorly and which i usually leave in the morning at nine oclock on pretence of going to business  i take my breakfastmy roll and butter and my halfpint of coffeeat the oldestablished coffeeshop near westminster bridge and then i go into the cityi dont know whyand sit in garraways coffee house and on change and walk about and look into a few offices and countinghouses where some of my relations or acquaintance are so good as to tolerate me and where i stand by the fire if the weather happens to be cold  i get through the day in this way until five oclock and then i dine  at a cost on the average of one and threepence  having still a little money to spend on my evenings entertainment i look into the oldestablished coffeeshop as i go home and take my cup of tea and perhaps my bit of toast  so as the large hand of the clock makes its way round to the morning hour again i make my way round to the clapham road again and go to bed when i get to my lodgingfire being expensive and being objected to by the family on account of its giving trouble and making a dirt  sometimes one of my relations or acquaintances is so obliging as to ask me to dinner  those are holiday occasions and then i generally walk in the park  i am a solitary man and seldom walk with anybody  not that i am avoided because i am shabby for i am not at all shabby having always a very good suit of black on or rather oxford mixture which has the appearance of black and wears much better but i have got into a habit of speaking low and being rather silent and my spirits are not high and i am sensible that i am not an attractive companion  the only exception to this general rule is the child of my first cousin little frank  i have a particular affection for that child and he takes very kindly to me  he is a diffident boy by nature and in a crowd he is soon run over as i may say and forgotten  he and i however get on exceedingly well  i have a fancy that the poor child will in time succeed to my peculiar position in the family  we talk but little still we understand each other  we walk about hand in hand and without much speaking he knows what i mean and i know what he means  when he was very little indeed i used to take him to the windows of the toyshops and show him the toys inside  it is surprising how soon he found out that i would have made him a great many presents if i had been in circumstances to do it  little frank and i go and look at the outside of the monumenthe is very fond of the monumentand at the bridges and at all the sights that are free  on two of my birthdays we have dined on elamode beef and gone at halfprice to the play and been deeply interested  i was once walking with him in lombard street which we often visit on account of my having mentioned to him that there are great riches therehe is very fond of lombard streetwhen a gentleman said to me as he passed by sir your little son has dropped his glove  i assure you if you will excuse my remarking on so trivial a circumstance this accidental mention of the child as mine quite touched my heart and brought the foolish tears into my eyes  when little frank is sent to school in the country i shall be very much at a loss what to do with myself but i have the intention of walking down there once a month and seeing him on a half holiday  i am told he will then be at play upon the heath and if my visits should be objected to as unsettling the child i can see him from a distance without his seeing me and walk back again  his mother comes of a highly genteel family and rather disapproves i am aware of our being too much together  i know that i am not calculated to improve his retiring disposition but i think he would miss me beyond the feeling of the moment if we were wholly separated  when i die in the clapham road i shall not leave much more in this world than i shall take out of it but i happen to have a miniature of a brightfaced boy with a curling head and an open shirtfrill waving down his bosom my mother had it taken for me but i cant believe that it was ever like which will be worth nothing to sell and which i shall beg may he given to frank  i have written my dear boy a little letter with it in which i have told him that i felt very sorry to part from him though bound to confess that i knew no reason why i should remain here  i have given him some short advice the best in my power to take warning of the consequences of being nobodys enemy but his own and i have endeavoured to comfort him for what i fear he will consider a bereavement by pointing out to him that i was only a superfluous something to every one but him and that having by some means failed to find a place in this great assembly i am better out of it  such said the poor relation clearing his throat and beginning to speak a little louder is the general impression about me  now it is a remarkable circumstance which forms the aim and purpose of my story that this is all wrong  this is not my life and these are not my habits  i do not even live in the clapham road comparatively speaking i am very seldom there  i reside mostly in ai am almost ashamed to say the word it sounds so full of pretensionin a castle  i do not mean that it is an old baronial habitation but still it is a building always known to every one by the name of a castle  in it i preserve the particulars of my history they run thus  it was when i first took john spatter who had been my clerk into partnership and when i was still a young man of not more than five andtwenty residing in the house of my uncle chill from whom i had considerable expectations that i ventured to propose to christiana i had loved christiana a long time  she was very beautiful and very winning in all respects  i rather mistrusted her widowed mother who i feared was of a plotting and mercenary turn of mind but i thought as well of her as i could for christianas sake  i never had loved any one but christiana and she had been all the world and o far more than all the world to me from our childhood  christiana accepted me with her mothers consent and i was rendered very happy indeed  my life at my uncle chills was of a spare dull kind and my garret chamber was as dull and bare and cold as an upper prison room in some stern northern fortress  but having christianas love i wanted nothing upon earth  i would not have changed my lot with any human being  avarice was unhappily my uncle chills mastervice  though he was rich he pinched and scraped and clutched and lived miserably as christiana had no fortune i was for some time a little fearful of confessing our engagement to him but at length i wrote him a letter saying how it all truly was  i put it into his hand one night on going to bed  as i came downstairs next morning shivering in the cold december air colder in my uncles unwarmed house than in the street where the winter sun did sometimes shine and which was at all events enlivened by cheerful faces and voices passing along i carried a heavy heart towards the long low breakfastroom in which my uncle sat  it was a large room with a small fire and there was a great bay window in it which the rain had marked in the night as if with the tears of houseless people  it stared upon a raw yard with a cracked stone pavement and some rusted iron railings half uprooted whence an ugly outbuilding that had once been a dissectingroom in the time of the great surgeon who had mortgaged the house to my uncle stared at it  we rose so early always that at that time of the year we breakfasted by candlelight  when i went into the room my uncle was so contracted by the cold and so huddled together in his chair behind the one dim candle that i did not see him until i was close to the table  as i held out my hand to him he caught up his stick being infirm he always walked about the house with a stick and made a blow at me and said you fool  uncle i returned i didnt expect you to be so angry as this nor had i expected it though he was a hard and angry old man  you didnt expect said he when did you ever expect  when did you ever calculate or look forward you contemptible dog  these are hard words uncle  hard words  feathers to pelt such an idiot as you with said he here  betsy snap  look at him  betsy snap was a withered hardfavoured yellow old womanour only domesticalways employed at this time of the morning in rubbing my uncles legs  as my uncle adjured her to look at me he put his lean grip on the crown of her head she kneeling beside him and turned her face towards me  an involuntary thought connecting them both with the dissecting room as it must often have been in the surgeons time passed across my mind in the midst of my anxiety  look at the snivelling milksop said my uncle  look at the baby this is the gentleman who people say is nobodys enemy but his own  this is the gentleman who cant say no  this is the gentleman who was making such large profits in his business that he must needs take a partner tother day  this is the gentleman who is going to marry a wife without a penny and who falls into the hands of jezabels who are speculating on my death  i knew now how great my uncles rage was for nothing short of his being almost beside himself would have induced him to utter that concluding word which he held in such repugnance that it was never spoken or hinted at before him on any account  on my death he repeated as if he were defying me by defying his own abhorrence of the word  on my deathdeathdeath  but ill spoil the speculation  eat your last under this roof you feeble wretch and may it choke you  you may suppose that i had not much appetite for the breakfast to which i was bidden in these terms but i took my accustomed seat i saw that i was repudiated henceforth by my uncle still i could bear that very well possessing christianas heart  he emptied his basin of bread and milk as usual only that he took it on his knees with his chair turned away from the table where i sat  when he had done he carefully snuffed out the candle and the cold slatecoloured miserable day looked in upon us  now mr michael said he before we part i should like to have a word with these ladies in your presence  as you will sir i returned but you deceive yourself and wrong us cruelly if you suppose that there is any feeling at stake in this contract but pure disinterested faithful love  to this he only replied you lie and not one other word  we went through halfthawed snow and halffrozen rain to the house where christiana and her mother lived  my uncle knew them very well  they were sitting at their breakfast and were surprised to see us at that hour  your servant maam said my uncle to the mother  you divine the purpose of my visit i dare say maam  i understand there is a world of pure disinterested faithful love cooped up here  i am happy to bring it all it wants to make it complete  i bring you your soninlaw maamand you your husband miss  the gentleman is a perfect stranger to me but i wish him joy of his wise bargain  he snarled at me as he went out and i never saw him again   it is altogether a mistake continued the poor relation to suppose that my dear christiana overpersuaded and influenced by her mother married a rich man the dirt from whose carriage wheels is often in these changed times thrown upon me as she rides by  no no  she married me  the way we came to be married rather sooner than we intended was this  i took a frugal lodging and was saving and planning for her sake when one day she spoke to me with great earnestness and said  my dear michael i have given you my heart  i have said that i loved you and i have pledged myself to be your wife  i am as much yours through all changes of good and evil as if we had been married on the day when such words passed between us  i know you well and know that if we should be separated and our union broken off your whole life would be shadowed and all that might even now be stronger in your character for the conflict with the world would then be weakened to the shadow of what it is  god help me christiana said i  you speak the truth  michael said she putting her hand in mine in all maidenly devotion let us keep apart no longer  it is but for me to say that i can live contented upon such means as you have and i well know you are happy  i say so from my heart  strive no more alone let us strive together  my dear michael it is not right that i should keep secret from you what you do not suspect but what distresses my whole life  my mother  without considering that what you have lost you have lost for me and on the assurance of my faith  sets her heart on riches and urges another suit upon me to my misery  i cannot bear this for to bear it is to be untrue to you  i would rather share your struggles than look on  i want no better home than you can give me  i know that you will aspire and labour with a higher courage if i am wholly yours and let it be so when you will  i was blest indeed that day and a new world opened to me  we were married in a very little while and i took my wife to our happy home  that was the beginning of the residence i have spoken of the castle we have ever since inhabited together dates from that time all our children have been born in it  our first childnow marriedwas a little girl whom we called christiana  her son is so like little frank that i hardly know which is which   the current impression as to my partners dealings with me is also quite erroneous  he did not begin to treat me coldly as a poor simpleton when my uncle and i so fatally quarrelled nor did he afterwards gradually possess himself of our business and edge me out  on the contrary he behaved to me with the utmost good faith and honour  matters between us took this turn on the day of my separation from my uncle and even before the arrival at our countinghouse of my trunks which he sent after me not carriage paid i went down to our room of business on our little wharf overlooking the river and there i told john spatter what had happened  john did not say in reply that rich old relatives were palpable facts and that love and sentiment were moonshine and fiction  he addressed me thus  michael said john we were at school together and i generally had the knack of getting on better than you and making a higher reputation  you had john i returned  although said john i borrowed your books and lost them borrowed your pocketmoney and never repaid it got you to buy my damaged knives at a higher price than i had given for them new and to own to the windows that i had broken  all not worth mentioning john spatter said i but certainly true  when you were first established in this infant business which promises to thrive so well pursued john i came to you in my search for almost any employment and you made me your clerk  still not worth mentioning my dear john spatter said i still equally true  and finding that i had a good head for business and that i was really useful to the business you did not like to retain me in that capacity and thought it an act of justice soon to make me your partner  still less worth mentioning than any of those other little circumstances you have recalled john spatter said i for i was and am sensible of your merits and my deficiencies  now my good friend said john drawing my arm through his as he had had a habit of doing at school while two vessels outside the windows of our countinghousewhich were shaped like the stern windows of a shipwent lightly down the river with the tide as john and i might then be sailing away in company and in trust and confidence on our voyage of life let there under these friendly circumstances be a right understanding between us  you are too easy michael  you are nobodys enemy but your own  if i were to give you that damaging character among our connexion with a shrug and a shake of the head and a sigh and if i were further to abuse the trust you place in me  but you never will abuse it at all john i observed  never said he but i am putting a casei say and if i were further to abuse that trust by keeping this piece of our common affairs in the dark and this other piece in the light and again this other piece in the twilight and so on i should strengthen my strength and weaken your weakness day by day until at last i found myself on the high road to fortune and you left behind on some bare common a hopeless number of miles out of the way  exactly so said i  to prevent this michael said john spatter or the remotest chance of this there must be perfect openness between us  nothing must be concealed and we must have but one interest  my dear john spatter i assured him that is precisely what i mean  and when you are too easy pursued john his face glowing with friendship you must allow me to prevent that imperfection in your nature from being taken advantage of by any one you must not expect me to humour it  my dear john spatter i interrupted i dont expect you to humour it  i want to correct it  and i too said john  exactly so cried i  we both have the same end in view and honourably seeking it and fully trusting one another and having but one interest ours will be a prosperous and happy partnership  i am sure of it returned john spatter  and we shook hands most affectionately  i took john home to my castle and we had a very happy day  our partnership throve well  my friend and partner supplied what i wanted as i had foreseen that he would and by improving both the business and myself amply acknowledged any little rise in life to which i had helped him   i am not said the poor relation looking at the fire as he slowly rubbed his hands very rich for i never cared to be that but i have enough and am above all moderate wants and anxieties  my castle is not a splendid place but it is very comfortable and it has a warm and cheerful air and is quite a picture of home  our eldest girl who is very like her mother married john spatters eldest son  our two families are closely united in other ties of attachment  it is very pleasant of an evening when we are all assembled togetherwhich frequently happensand when john and i talk over old times and the one interest there has always been between us  i really do not know in my castle what loneliness is  some of our children or grandchildren are always about it and the young voices of my descendants are delightfulo how delightfulto me to hear my dearest and most devoted wife ever faithful ever loving ever helpful and sustaining and consoling is the priceless blessing of my house from whom all its other blessings spring  we are rather a musical family and when christiana sees me at any time a little weary or depressed she steals to the piano and sings a gentle air she used to sing when we were first betrothed  so weak a man am i that i cannot bear to hear it from any other source  they played it once at the theatre when i was there with little frank and the child said wondering cousin michael whose hot tears are these that have fallen on my hand  such is my castle and such are the real particulars of my life therein preserved  i often take little frank home there  he is very welcome to my grandchildren and they play together  at this time of the yearthe christmas and new year timei am seldom out of my castle  for the associations of the season seem to hold me there and the precepts of the season seem to teach me that it is well to be there   and the castle is observed a grave kind voice among the company  yes  my castle said the poor relation shaking his head as he still looked at the fire is in the air  john our esteemed host suggests its situation accurately  my castle is in the air  i have done  will you be so good as to pass the story    the childs story    once upon a time a good many years ago there was a traveller and he set out upon a journey  it was a magic journey and was to seem very long when he began it and very short when he got half way through  he travelled along a rather dark path for some little time without meeting anything until at last he came to a beautiful child  so he said to the child what do you do here  and the child said i am always at play  come and play with me  so he played with that child the whole day long and they were very merry  the sky was so blue the sun was so bright the water was so sparkling the leaves were so green the flowers were so lovely and they heard such singingbirds and saw so many butteries that everything was beautiful  this was in fine weather  when it rained they loved to watch the falling drops and to smell the fresh scents  when it blew it was delightful to listen to the wind and fancy what it said as it came rushing from its home where was that they wonderedwhistling and howling driving the clouds before it bending the trees rumbling in the chimneys shaking the house and making the sea roar in fury  but when it snowed that was best of all for they liked nothing so well as to look up at the white flakes falling fast and thick like down from the breasts of millions of white birds and to see how smooth and deep the drift was and to listen to the hush upon the paths and roads  they had plenty of the finest toys in the world and the most astonishing picturebooks  all about scimitars and slippers and turbans and dwarfs and giants and genii and fairies and blue beards and beanstalks and riches and caverns and forests and valentines and orsons  and all new and all true  but one day of a sudden the traveller lost the child  he called to him over and over again but got no answer  so he went upon his road and went on for a little while without meeting anything until at last he came to a handsome boy  so he said to the boy what do you do here  and the boy said i am always learning  come and learn with me  so he learned with that boy about jupiter and juno and the greeks and the romans and i dont know what and learned more than i could tellor he either for he soon forgot a great deal of it  but they were not always learning they had the merriest games that ever were played  they rowed upon the river in summer and skated on the ice in winter they were active afoot and active on horseback at cricket and all games at ball at prisoners base hare and hounds follow my leader and more sports than i can think of nobody could beat them  they had holidays too and twelfth cakes and parties where they danced till midnight and real theatres where they saw palaces of real gold and silver rise out of the real earth and saw all the wonders of the world at once  as to friends they had such dear friends and so many of them that i want the time to reckon them up  they were all young like the handsome boy and were never to be strange to one another all their lives through  still one day in the midst of all these pleasures the traveller lost the boy as he had lost the child and after calling to him in vain went on upon his journey  so he went on for a little while without seeing anything until at last he came to a young man  so he said to the young man what do you do here  and the young man said i am always in love  come and love with me  so he went away with that young man and presently they came to one of the prettiest girls that ever was seenjust like fanny in the corner thereand she had eyes like fanny and hair like fanny and dimples like fannys and she laughed and coloured just as fanny does while i am talking about her  so the young man fell in love directlyjust as somebody i wont mention the first time he came here did with fanny  well he was teased sometimesjust as somebody used to be by fanny and they quarrelled sometimesjust as somebody and fanny used to quarrel and they made it up and sat in the dark and wrote letters every day and never were happy asunder and were always looking out for one another and pretending not to and were engaged at christmastime and sat close to one another by the fire and were going to be married very soonall exactly like somebody i wont mention and fanny  but the traveller lost them one day as he had lost the rest of his friends and after calling to them to come back which they never did went on upon his journey  so he went on for a little while without seeing anything until at last he came to a middleaged gentleman  so he said to the gentleman what are you doing here and his answer was i am always busy  come and be busy with me  so he began to be very busy with that gentleman and they went on through the wood together  the whole journey was through a wood only it had been open and green at first like a wood in spring and now began to be thick and dark like a wood in summer some of the little trees that had come out earliest were even turning brown the gentleman was not alone but had a lady of about the same age with him who was his wife and they had children who were with them too  so they all went on together through the wood cutting down the trees and making a path through the branches and the fallen leaves and carrying burdens and working hard  sometimes they came to a long green avenue that opened into deeper woods  then they would hear a very little distant voice crying father father i am another child  stop for me  and presently they would see a very little figure growing larger as it came along running to join them  when it came up they all crowded round it and kissed and welcomed it and then they all went on together  sometimes they came to several avenues at once and then they all stood still and one of the children said father i am going to sea and another said father i am going to india and another father i am going to seek my fortune where i can and another father i am going to heaven  so with many tears at parting they went solitary down those avenues each child upon its way and the child who went to heaven rose into the golden air and vanished  whenever these partings happened the traveller looked at the gentleman and saw him glance up at the sky above the trees where the day was beginning to decline and the sunset to come on  he saw too that his hair was turning grey  but they never could rest long for they had their journey to perform and it was necessary for them to be always busy  at last there had been so many partings that there were no children left and only the traveller the gentleman and the lady went upon their way in company  and now the wood was yellow and now brown and the leaves even of the forest trees began to fall  so they came to an avenue that was darker than the rest and were pressing forward on their journey without looking down it when the lady stopped  my husband said the lady  i am called  they listened and they heard a voice a long way down the avenue say mother mother  it was the voice of the first child who had said i am going to heaven and the father said i pray not yet  the sunset is very near  i pray not yet  but the voice cried mother mother without minding him though his hair was now quite white and tears were on his face  then the mother who was already drawn into the shade of the dark avenue and moving away with her arms still round his neck kissed him and said my dearest i am summoned and i go  and she was gone  and the traveller and he were left alone together  and they went on and on together until they came to very near the end of the wood  so near that they could see the sunset shining red before them through the trees  yet once more while he broke his way among the branches the traveller lost his friend  he called and called but there was no reply and when he passed out of the wood and saw the peaceful sun going down upon a wide purple prospect he came to an old man sitting on a fallen tree  so he said to the old man what do you do here  and the old man said with a calm smile i am always remembering  come and remember with me  so the traveller sat down by the side of that old man face to face with the serene sunset and all his friends came softly back and stood around him  the beautiful child the handsome boy the young man in love the father mother and children  every one of them was there and he had lost nothing  so he loved them all and was kind and forbearing with them all and was always pleased to watch them all and they all honoured and loved him  and i think the traveller must be yourself dear grandfather because this what you do to us and what we do to you    the schoolboys story    being rather young at presenti am getting on in years but still i am rather youngi have no particular adventures of my own to fall back upon  it wouldnt much interest anybody here i suppose to know what a screw the reverend is or what a griffin she is or how they do stick it into parentsparticularly haircutting and medical attendance  one of our fellows was charged in his halfs account twelve and sixpence for two pillstolerably profitable at six and threepence apiece i should thinkand he never took them either but put them up the sleeve of his jacket  as to the beef its shameful  its not beef  regular beef isnt veins  you can chew regular beef  besides which theres gravy to regular beef and you never see a drop to ours  another of our fellows went home ill and heard the family doctor tell his father that he couldnt account for his complaint unless it was the beer of course it was the beer and well it might be  however beef and old cheeseman are two different things  so is beer  it was old cheeseman i meant to tell about not the manner in which our fellows get their constitutions destroyed for the sake of profit  why look at the piecrust alone  theres no flakiness in it  its solidlike damp lead  then our fellows get nightmares and are bolstered for calling out and waking other fellows  who can wonder  old cheeseman one night walked in his sleep put his hat on over his nightcap got hold of a fishingrod and a cricketbat and went down into the parlour where they naturally thought from his appearance he was a ghost  why he never would have done that if his meals had been wholesome  when we all begin to walk in our sleeps i suppose theyll be sorry for it  old cheeseman wasnt second latin master then he was a fellow himself  he was first brought there very small in a postchaise by a woman who was always taking snuff and shaking himand that was the most he remembered about it  he never went home for the holidays  his accounts he never learnt any extras were sent to a bank and the bank paid them and he had a brown suit twice ayear and went into boots at twelve  they were always too big for him too  in the midsummer holidays some of our fellows who lived within walking distance used to come back and climb the trees outside the playground wall on purpose to look at old cheeseman reading there by himself  he was always as mild as the teaand thats pretty mild i should hopeso when they whistled to him he looked up and nodded and when they said halloa old cheeseman what have you had for dinner he said boiled mutton and when they said ant it solitary old cheeseman he said it is a little dull sometimes and then they said well goodbye old cheeseman and climbed down again  of course it was imposing on old cheeseman to give him nothing but boiled mutton through a whole vacation but that was just like the system  when they didnt give him boiled mutton they gave him rice pudding pretending it was a treat  and saved the butcher  so old cheeseman went on  the holidays brought him into other trouble besides the loneliness because when the fellows began to come back not wanting to he was always glad to see them which was aggravating when they were not at all glad to see him and so he got his head knocked against walls and that was the way his nose bled but he was a favourite in general  once a subscription was raised for him and to keep up his spirits he was presented before the holidays with two white mice a rabbit a pigeon and a beautiful puppy  old cheeseman cried about itespecially soon afterwards when they all ate one another  of course old cheeseman used to be called by the names of all sorts of cheesesdouble glosterman family cheshireman dutchman north wiltshireman and all that  but he never minded it  and i dont mean to say he was old in point of yearsbecause he wasntonly he was called from the first old cheeseman  at last old cheeseman was made second latin master  he was brought in one morning at the beginning of a new half and presented to the school in that capacity as mr cheeseman  then our fellows all agreed that old cheeseman was a spy and a deserter who had gone over to the enemys camp and sold himself for gold  it was no excuse for him that he had sold himself for very little goldtwo pound ten a quarter and his washing as was reported  it was decided by a parliament which sat about it that old cheesemans mercenary motives could alone be taken into account and that he had coined our blood for drachmas  the parliament took the expression out of the quarrel scene between brutus and cassius  when it was settled in this strong way that old cheeseman was a tremendous traitor who had wormed himself into our fellows secrets on purpose to get himself into favour by giving up everything he knew all courageous fellows were invited to come forward and enrol themselves in a society for making a set against him  the president of the society was first boy named bob tarter  his father was in the west indies and he owned himself that his father was worth millions  he had great power among our fellows and he wrote a parody beginning      who made believe to be so meek   that we could hardly hear him speak   yet turned out an informing sneak   old cheeseman    and on in that way through more than a dozen verses which he used to go and sing every morning close by the new masters desk  he trained one of the low boys too a rosycheeked little brass who didnt care what he did to go up to him with his latin grammar one morning and say it so  nominativus pronominumold cheeseman raro exprimiturwas never suspected nisi distinctionisof being an informer aut emphasis gratiauntil he proved one  utfor instance vos damnastiswhen he sold the boys  quasias though dicathe should say pretaerea nemoim a judas  all this produced a great effect on old cheeseman  he had never had much hair but what he had began to get thinner and thinner every day he grew paler and more worn and sometimes of an evening he was seen sitting at his desk with a precious long snuff to his candle and his hands before his face crying  but no member of the society could pity him even if he felt inclined because the president said it was old cheesemans conscience  so old cheeseman went on and didnt he lead a miserable life  of course the reverend turned up his nose at him and of course she didbecause both of them always do that at all the mastersbut he suffered from the fellows most and he suffered from them constantly  he never told about it that the society could find out but he got no credit for that because the president said it was old cheesemans cowardice  he had only one friend in the world and that one was almost as powerless as he was for it was only jane  jane was a sort of wardrobe woman to our fellows and took care of the boxes  she had come at first i believe as a kind of apprenticesome of our fellows say from a charity but i dont knowand after her time was out had stopped at so much a year  so little a year perhaps i ought to say for it is far more likely  however she had put some pounds in the savings bank and she was a very nice young woman she was not quite pretty but she had a very frank honest bright face and all our fellows were fond of her  she was uncommonly neat and cheerful and uncommonly comfortable and kind  and if anything was the matter with a fellows mother he always went and showed the letter to jane  jane was old cheesemans friend  the more the society went against him the more jane stood by him  she used to give him a good humoured look out of her stillroom window sometimes that seemed to set him up for the day  she used to pass out of the orchard and the kitchen garden always kept locked i believe you through the playground when she might have gone the other way only to give a turn of her head as much as to say keep up your spirits to old cheeseman  his slip of a room was so fresh and orderly that it was well known who looked after it while he was at his desk and when our fellows saw a smoking hot dumpling on his plate at dinner they knew with indignation who had sent it up  under these circumstances the society resolved after a quantity of meeting and debating that jane should be requested to cut old cheeseman dead and that if she refused she must be sent to coventry herself  so a deputation headed by the president was appointed to wait on jane and inform her of the vote the society had been under the painful necessity of passing  she was very much respected for all her good qualities and there was a story about her having once waylaid the reverend in his own study and got a fellow off from severe punishment of her own kind comfortable heart  so the deputation didnt much like the job  however they went up and the president told jane all about it  upon which jane turned very red burst into tears informed the president and the deputation in a way not at all like her usual way that they were a parcel of malicious young savages and turned the whole respected body out of the room  consequently it was entered in the societys book kept in astronomical cypher for fear of detection that all communication with jane was interdicted  and the president addressed the members on this convincing instance of old cheesemans undermining  but jane was as true to old cheeseman as old cheeseman was false to our fellowsin their opinion at all eventsand steadily continued to be his only friend  it was a great exasperation to the society because jane was as much a loss to them as she was a gain to him and being more inveterate against him than ever they treated him worse than ever  at last one morning his desk stood empty his room was peeped into and found to be vacant and a whisper went about among the pale faces of our fellows that old cheeseman unable to bear it any longer had got up early and drowned himself  the mysterious looks of the other masters after breakfast and the evident fact that old cheeseman was not expected confirmed the society in this opinion  some began to discuss whether the president was liable to hanging or only transportation for life and the presidents face showed a great anxiety to know which  however he said that a jury of his country should find him game and that in his address he should put it to them to lay their hands upon their hearts and say whether they as britons approved of informers and how they thought they would like it themselves  some of the society considered that he had better run away until he found a forest where he might change clothes with a woodcutter and stain his face with blackberries but the majority believed that if he stood his ground his fatherbelonging as he did to the west indies and being worth millionscould buy him off  all our fellows hearts beat fast when the reverend came in and made a sort of a roman or a field marshal of himself with the ruler as he always did before delivering an address  but their fears were nothing to their astonishment when he came out with the story that old cheeseman so long our respected friend and fellow pilgrim in the pleasant plains of knowledge he called himo yes i dare say  much of thatwas the orphan child of a disinherited young lady who had married against her fathers wish and whose young husband had died and who had died of sorrow herself and whose unfortunate baby old cheeseman had been brought up at the cost of a grandfather who would never consent to see it baby boy or man  which grandfather was now dead and serve him rightthats my putting inand which grandfathers large property there being no will was now and all of a sudden and for ever old cheesemans our so long respected friend and fellowpilgrim in the pleasant plains of knowledge the reverend wound up a lot of bothering quotations by saying would come among us once more that day fortnight when he desired to take leave of us himself in a more particular manner  with these words he stared severely round at our fellows and went solemnly out  there was precious consternation among the members of the society now  lots of them wanted to resign and lots more began to try to make out that they had never belonged to it  however the president stuck up and said that they must stand or fall together and that if a breach was made it should be over his bodywhich was meant to encourage the society  but it didnt  the president further said he would consider the position in which they stood and would give them his best opinion and advice in a few days  this was eagerly looked for as he knew a good deal of the world on account of his fathers being in the west indies  after days and days of hard thinking and drawing armies all over his slate the president called our fellows together and made the matter clear  he said it was plain that when old cheeseman came on the appointed day his first revenge would be to impeach the society and have it flogged all round  after witnessing with joy the torture of his enemies and gloating over the cries which agony would extort from them the probability was that he would invite the reverend on pretence of conversation into a private roomsay the parlour into which parents were shown where the two great globes were which were never usedand would there reproach him with the various frauds and oppressions he had endured at his hands  at the close of his observations he would make a signal to a prizefighter concealed in the passage who would then appear and pitch into the reverend till he was left insensible  old cheeseman would then make jane a present of from five to ten pounds and would leave the establishment in fiendish triumph  the president explained that against the parlour part or the jane part of these arrangements he had nothing to say but on the part of the society he counselled deadly resistance  with this view he recommended that all available desks should be filled with stones and that the first word of the complaint should be the signal to every fellow to let fly at old cheeseman  the bold advice put the society in better spirits and was unanimously taken  a post about old cheesemans size was put up in the playground and all our fellows practised at it till it was dinted all over  when the day came and places were called every fellow sat down in a tremble  there had been much discussing and disputing as to how old cheeseman would come but it was the general opinion that he would appear in a sort of triumphal car drawn by four horses with two livery servants in front and the prizefighter in disguise up behind  so all our fellows sat listening for the sound of wheels but no wheels were heard for old cheeseman walked after all and came into the school without any preparation  pretty much as he used to be only dressed in black  gentlemen said the reverend presenting him our so long respected friend and fellowpilgrim in the pleasant plains of knowledge is desirous to offer a word or two  attention gentlemen one and all  every fellow stole his hand into his desk and looked at the president  the president was all ready and taking aim at old cheeseman with his eyes  what did old cheeseman then but walk up to his old desk look round him with a queer smile as if there was a tear in his eye and begin in a quavering mild voice my dear companions and old friends  every fellows hand came out of his desk and the president suddenly began to cry  my dear companions and old friends said old cheeseman you have heard of my good fortune  i have passed so many years under this roofmy entire life so far i may saythat i hope you have been glad to hear of it for my sake  i could never enjoy it without exchanging congratulations with you  if we have ever misunderstood one another at all pray my dear boys let us forgive and forget i have a great tenderness for you and i am sure you return it  i want in the fulness of a grateful heart to shake hands with you every one  i have come back to do it if you please my dear boys  since the president had begun to cry several other fellows had broken out here and there  but now when old cheeseman began with him as first boy laid his left hand affectionately on his shoulder and gave him his right and when the president said indeed i dont deserve it sir upon my honour i dont there was sobbing and crying all over the school  every other fellow said he didnt deserve it much in the same way but old cheeseman not minding that a bit went cheerfully round to every boy and wound up with every masterfinishing off the reverend last  then a snivelling little chap in a corner who was always under some punishment or other set up a shrill cry of success to old cheeseman  hooray  the reverend glared upon him and said mr cheeseman sir  but old cheeseman protesting that he liked his old name a great deal better than his new one all our fellows took up the cry and for i dont know how many minutes there was such a thundering of feet and hands and such a roaring of old cheeseman as never was heard  after that there was a spread in the diningroom of the most magnificent kind  fowls tongues preserves fruits confectionaries jellies neguses barleysugar temples trifles crackerseat all you can and pocket what you likeall at old cheesemans expense  after that speeches whole holiday double and treble sets of all manners of things for all manners of games donkeys ponychaises and drive yourself dinner for all the masters at the seven bells twenty pounds ahead our fellows estimated it at an annual holiday and feast fixed for that day every year and another on old cheesemans birthdayreverend bound down before the fellows to allow it so that he could never back outall at old cheesemans expense  and didnt our fellows go down in a body and cheer outside the seven bells  o no  but theres something else besides  dont look at the next story teller for theres more yet  next day it was resolved that the society should make it up with jane and then be dissolved  what do you think of jane being gone though  what  gone for ever said our fellows with long faces  yes to be sure was all the answer they could get  none of the people about the house would say anything more  at length the first boy took upon himself to ask the reverend whether our old friend jane was really gone  the reverend he has got a daughter at hometurnup nose and red replied severely yes sir miss pitt is gone  the idea of calling jane miss pitt  some said she had been sent away in disgrace for taking money from old cheeseman others said she had gone into old cheesemans service at a rise of ten pounds a year all that our fellows knew was she was gone  it was two or three months afterwards when one afternoon an open carriage stopped at the cricket field just outside bounds with a lady and gentleman in it who looked at the game a long time and stood up to see it played  nobody thought much about them until the same little snivelling chap came in against all rules from the post where he was scout and said its jane  both elevens forgot the game directly and ran crowding round the carriage  it was jane  in such a bonnet  and if youll believe me jane was married to old cheeseman  it soon became quite a regular thing when our fellows were hard at it in the playground to see a carriage at the low part of the wall where it joins the high part and a lady and gentleman standing up in it looking over  the gentleman was always old cheeseman and the lady was always jane  the first time i ever saw them i saw them in that way  there had been a good many changes among our fellows then and it had turned out that bob tarters father wasnt worth millions  he wasnt worth anything  bob had gone for a soldier and old cheeseman had purchased his discharge  but thats not the carriage  the carriage stopped and all our fellows stopped as soon as it was seen  so you have never sent me to coventry after all said the lady laughing as our fellows swarmed up the wall to shake hands with her  are you never going to do it  never never never on all sides  i didnt understand what she meant then but of course i do now  i was very much pleased with her face though and with her good way and i couldnt help looking at herand at him toowith all our fellows clustering so joyfully about them  they soon took notice of me as a new boy so i thought i might as well swarm up the wall myself and shake hands with them as the rest did  i was quite as glad to see them as the rest were and was quite as familiar with them in a moment  only a fortnight now said old cheeseman to the holidays  who stops  anybody  a good many fingers pointed at me and a good many voices cried he does  for it was the year when you were all away and rather low i was about it i can tell you  oh said old cheeseman  but its solitary here in the holiday time  he had better come to us  so i went to their delightful house and was as happy as i could possibly be  they understand how to conduct themselves towards boys they do  when they take a boy to the play for instance they do take him  they dont go in after its begun or come out before its over  they know how to bring a boy up too  look at their own  though he is very little as yet what a capital boy he is why my next favourite to mrs cheeseman and old cheeseman is young cheeseman  so now i have told you all i know about old cheeseman  and its not much after all i am afraid  is it    nobodys story    he lived on the bank of a mighty river broad and deep which was always silently rolling on to a vast undiscovered ocean  it had rolled on ever since the world began  it had changed its course sometimes and turned into new channels leaving its old ways dry and barren but it had ever been upon the flow and ever was to flow until time should be no more  against its strong unfathomable stream nothing made head  no living creature no flower no leaf no particle of animate or inanimate existence ever strayed back from the undiscovered ocean  the tide of the river set resistlessly towards it and the tide never stopped any more than the earth stops in its circling round the sun  he lived in a busy place and he worked very hard to live  he had no hope of ever being rich enough to live a month without hard work but he was quite content god knows to labour with a cheerful will he was one of an immense family all of whose sons and daughters gained their daily bread by daily work prolonged from their rising up betimes until their lying down at night  beyond this destiny he had no prospect and he sought none  there was overmuch drumming trumpeting and speechmaking in the neighbourhood where he dwelt but he had nothing to do with that such clash and uproar came from the bigwig family at the unaccountable proceedings of which race he marvelled much  they set up the strangest statues in iron marble bronze and brass before his door and darkened his house with the legs and tails of uncouth images of horses  he wondered what it all meant smiled in a rough goodhumoured way he had and kept at his hard work  the bigwig family composed of all the stateliest people thereabouts and all the noisiest had undertaken to save him the trouble of thinking for himself and to manage him and his affairs why truly said he i have little time upon my hands and if you will be so good as to take care of me in return for the money i pay overfor the bigwig family were not above his moneyi shall be relieved and much obliged considering that you know best  hence the drumming trumpeting and speechmaking and the ugly images of horses which he was expected to fall down and worship  i dont understand all this said he rubbing his furrowed brow confusedly  but it has a meaning maybe if i could find it out  it means returned the bigwig family suspecting something of what he said honour and glory in the highest to the highest merit  oh said he  and he was glad to hear that  but when he looked among the images in iron marble bronze and brass he failed to find a rather meritorious countryman of his once the son of a warwickshire wooldealer or any single countryman whomsoever of that kind  he could find none of the men whose knowledge had rescued him and his children from terrific and disfiguring disease whose boldness had raised his forefathers from the condition of serfs whose wise fancy had opened a new and high existence to the humblest whose skill had filled the working mans world with accumulated wonders  whereas he did find others whom he knew no good of and even others whom he knew much ill of  humph said he  i dont quite understand it  so he went home and sat down by his fireside to get it out of his mind  now his fireside was a bare one all hemmed in by blackened streets but it was a precious place to him  the hands of his wife were hardened with toil and she was old before her time but she was dear to him  his children stunted in their growth bore traces of unwholesome nurture but they had beauty in his sight  above all other things it was an earnest desire of this mans soul that his children should be taught  if i am sometimes misled said he for want of knowledge at least let them know better and avoid my mistakes  if it is hard to me to reap the harvest of pleasure and instruction that is stored in books let it be easier to them  but the bigwig family broke out into violent family quarrels concerning what it was lawful to teach to this mans children  some of the family insisted on such a thing being primary and indispensable above all other things and others of the family insisted on such another thing being primary and indispensable above all other things and the bigwig family rent into factions wrote pamphlets held convocations delivered charges orations and all varieties of discourses impounded one another in courts lay and courts ecclesiastical threw dirt exchanged pummelings and fell together by the ears in unintelligible animosity  meanwhile this man in his short evening snatches at his fireside saw the demon ignorance arise there and take his children to itself  he saw his daughter perverted into a heavy slatternly drudge he saw his son go moping down the ways of low sensuality to brutality and crime he saw the dawning light of intelligence in the eyes of his babies so changing into cunning and suspicion that he could have rather wished them idiots  i dont understand this any the better said he but i think it cannot be right  nay by the clouded heaven above me i protest against this as my wrong  becoming peaceable again for his passion was usually shortlived and his nature kind he looked about him on his sundays and holidays and he saw how much monotony and weariness there was and thence how drunkenness arose with all its train of ruin  then he appealed to the bigwig family and said we are a labouring people and i have a glimmering suspicion in me that labouring people of whatever condition were madeby a higher intelligence than yours as i poorly understand itto be in need of mental refreshment and recreation  see what we fall into when we rest without it  come amuse me harmlessly show me something give me an escape  but here the bigwig family fell into a state of uproar absolutely deafening  when some few voices were faintly heard proposing to show him the wonders of the world the greatness of creation the mighty changes of time the workings of nature and the beauties of artto show him these things that is to say at any period of his life when he could look upon themthere arose among the bigwigs such roaring and raving such pulpiting and petitioning such maundering and memorialising such namecalling and dirtthrowing such a shrill wind of parliamentary questioning and feeble replying where i dare not waited on i wouldthat the poor fellow stood aghast staring wildly around  have i provoked all this said he with his hands to his affrighted ears by what was meant to be an innocent request plainly arising out of my familiar experience and the common knowledge of all men who choose to open their eyes  i dont understand and i am not understood  what is to come of such a state of things  he was bending over his work often asking himself the question when the news began to spread that a pestilence had appeared among the labourers and was slaying them by thousands  going forth to look about him he soon found this to be true  the dying and the dead were mingled in the close and tainted houses among which his life was passed  new poison was distilled into the always murky always sickening air  the robust and the weak old age and infancy the father and the mother all were stricken down alike  what means of flight had he  he remained there where he was and saw those who were dearest to him die  a kind preacher came to him and would have said some prayers to soften his heart in his gloom but he replied  o what avails it missionary to come to me a man condemned to residence in this foetid place where every sense bestowed upon me for my delight becomes a torment and where every minute of my numbered days is new mire added to the heap under which i lie oppressed  but give me my first glimpse of heaven through a little of its light and air give me pure water help me to be clean lighten this heavy atmosphere and heavy life in which our spirits sink and we become the indifferent and callous creatures you too often see us gently and kindly take the bodies of those who die among us out of the small room where we grow to be so familiar with the awful change that even its sanctity is lost to us and teacher then i will hearnone know better than you how willingly of him whose thoughts were so much with the poor and who had compassion for all human sorrow  he was at work again solitary and sad when his master came and stood near to him dressed in black  he also had suffered heavily his young wife his beautiful and good young wife was dead so too his only child  master tis hard to beari know itbut be comforted  i would give you comfort if i could  the master thanked him from his heart but said he o you labouring men  the calamity began among you  if you had but lived more healthily and decently i should not be the widowed and bereft mourner that i am this day  master returned the other shaking his head i have begun to understand a little that most calamities will come from us as this one did and that none will stop at our poor doors until we are united with that great squabbling family yonder to do the things that are right  we cannot live healthily and decently unless they who undertook to manage us provide the means  we cannot be instructed unless they will teach us we cannot be rationally amused unless they will amuse us we cannot but have some false gods of our own while they set up so many of theirs in all the public places  the evil consequences of imperfect instruction the evil consequences of pernicious neglect the evil consequences of unnatural restraint and the denial of humanising enjoyments will all come from us and none of them will stop with us  they will spread far and wide  they always do they always have donejust like the pestilence  i understand so much i think at last  but the master said again o you labouring men  how seldom do we ever hear of you except in connection with some trouble  master he replied i am nobody and little likely to be heard of nor yet much wanted to be heard of perhaps except when there is some trouble  but it never begins with me and it never can end with me  as sure as death it comes down to me and it goes up from me  there was so much reason in what he said that the bigwig family getting wind of it and being horribly frightened by the late desolation resolved to unite with him to do the things that were rightat all events so far as the said things were associated with the direct prevention humanly speaking of another pestilence but as their fear wore off which it soon began to do they resumed their falling out among themselves and did nothing  consequently the scourge appeared againlow down as beforeand spread avengingly upward as before and carried off vast numbers of the brawlers  but not a man among them ever admitted if in the least degree he ever perceived that he had anything to do with it  so nobody lived and died in the old old old way and this in the main is the whole of nobodys story  had he no name you ask  perhaps it was legion  it matters little what his name was  let us call him legion  if you were ever in the belgian villages near the field of waterloo you will have seen in some quiet little church a monument erected by faithful companions in arms to the memory of colonel a major b captains c d and e lieutenants f and g ensigns h i and j seven noncommissioned officers and one hundred and thirty rank and file who fell in the discharge of their duty on the memorable day  the story of nobody is the story of the rank and file of the earth they bear their share of the battle they have their part in the victory they fall they leave no name but in the mass  the march of the proudest of us leads to the dusty way by which they go  o let us think of them this year at the christmas fire and not forget them when it is burnt out
