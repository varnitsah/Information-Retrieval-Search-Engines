65824706	the tragic muse  by  henry james        macmillan and co limited st martins street london  1921      preface   i profess a certain vagueness of remembrance in respect to the origin and growth of the tragic muse which appeared in the atlantic monthly again beginning january 1889 and running on inordinately several months beyond its proper twelve if it be ever of interest and profit to put ones finger on the productive germ of a work of art and if in fact a lucid account of any such work involves that prime identification i can but look on the present fiction as a poor fatherless and motherless a sort of unregistered and unacknowledged birth i fail to recover my precious first moment of consciousness of the idea to which it was to give form to recognise in itas i like to do in generalthe effect of some particular sharp impression or concussion i call such remembered glimmers always precious because without them comes no clear vision of what one may have intended and without that vision no straight measure of what one may have succeeded in doing what i make out from furthest back is that i must have had from still further back must in fact practically have always had the happy thought of some dramatic picture of the artistlife and of the difficult terms on which it is at the best secured and enjoyed the general question of its having to be not altogether easily paid for to do something about artart that is as a human complication and a social stumblingblockmust have been for me early a good deal of a nursed intention the conflict between art and the world striking me thus betimes as one of the halfdozen great primary motives i remember even having taken for granted with this fond inveteracy that no one of these pregnant themes was likely to prove under the test more full of matter this being the case meanwhile what would all experience have done but enrich ones convictionsince if on the one hand i had gained a more and more intimate view of the nature of art and the conditions therewith imposed so the world was a conception that clearly required and that would for ever continue to take any amount of fillingin the happy and fruitful truth at all events was that there was oppositionwhy there should be was another matterand that the opposition would beget an infinity of situations what had doubtless occurred in fact moreover was that just this question of the essence and the reasons of the opposition had shown itself to demand the light of experience so that to the growth of experience truly the treatment of the subject had yielded it had waited for that advantage  yet i continue to see experience giving me its jog mainly in the form of an invitation from the gentle editor of the atlantic the late thomas bailey aldrich to contribute to his pages a serial that should run through the year that friendly appeal becomes thus the most definite statement i can make of the genesis of the book though from the moment of its reaching me everything else in the matter seems to live again what lives not least to be quite candid is the fact that i was to see this production make a virtual end for the time as by its sinister effectthough for reasons still obscure to meof the pleasant old custom of the running of the novel not for many years was i to feel the practice for my benefit confidingly revive the influence of the tragic muse was thus exactly other than what i had all earnestly if of course privately enough invoked for it and i remember well the particular chill at last of the sense of my having launched it in a great grey void from which no echo or message whatever would come back none in the event ever came and as i now read the book over i find the circumstance make in its name for a special tenderness of charity even for that finer consideration hanging in the parental breast about the maimed or slighted the disfigured or defeated the unlucky or unlikely childwith this hapless small mortal thought of further as somehow compromising i am thus able to take the thing as having quite wittingly and undisturbedly existed for itself alone and to liken it to some aromatic bag of gathered herbs of which the string has never been loosed or better still to some jar of potpourri shaped and overfigured and polished but of which the lid never lifted has provided for the intense accumulation of the fragrance within the consistent the sustained preserved tone of the tragic muse its constant and doubtless rather finedrawn truth to its particular sought pitch and accent are critically speaking its principal meritthe inner harmony that i perhaps presumptuously permit myself to compare to an unevaporated scent  after which indeed i may well be summoned to say what i mean in such a business by an appreciable tone and how i can justify my claim to ita demonstration that will await us later suffice it just here that i find the latent historic clue in my hand again with the easy recall of my prompt grasp of such a chance to make a story about art there was my subject this timeall mature with having long waited and with the blest dignity that my original perception of its value was quite lost in the mists of youth i must long have carried in my head the notion of a young man who should amid difficultythe difficulties being the storyhave abandoned public life for the zealous pursuit of some supposedly minor craft just as evidently there had hovered before me some possible picture but all comic and ironic of one of the most salient london social passions the unappeasable curiosity for the things of the theatre for every one of them that is except the drama itself and for the personality of the performer almost any performer quite sufficiently serving in particular this latter verily had struck me as an aspect appealing mainly to satiric treatment the only adequate or effective treatment i had again and again felt for most of the distinctively social aspects of london the general artlessly histrionised air of things caused so many examples to spring from behind any hedge what came up however at once for my own stretched canvas was that it would have to be ample give me really space to turn round and that a single illustrative case might easily be meagre fare the young man who should chuck admired politics and of course some other admired object with them would be all very well but he wouldnt be enoughtherefore what should one say to some other young man who would chuck something and somebody else admired in their way too  there need never at the worst be any difficulty about the things advantageously chuckable for art the question is all but of choosing them in the heap yet were i to represent a strugglean interesting one indispensablywith the passions of the theatre as a profession or at least as an absorption i should have to place the theatre in another light than the satiric this however would by good luck be perfectly possible toowithout a sacrifice of truth and i should doubtless even be able to make my theatric case as important as i might desire it it seemed clear that i needed big casessmall ones would practically give my central idea away and i make out now my still labouring under the illusion that the case of the sacrifice for art can ever be with truth with taste with discretion involved apparently and showily big i daresay it glimmered upon me even then that the very sharpest difficulty of the victim of the conflict i should seek to represent and the very highest interest of his predicament dwell deep in the fact that his repudiation of the great obvious great moral or functional or useful character shall just have to consent to resemble a surrender for absolutely nothing those characters are all large and expansive seated and established and endowed whereas the most charming truth about the preference for art is that to parade abroad so thoroughly inward and so naturally embarrassed a matter is to falsify and vulgarise it that as a preference attended with the honours of publicity it is indeed nowhere that in fact under the rule of its sincerity its only honours are those of contradiction concentration and a seemingly deplorable indifference to everything but itself nothing can well figure as less big in an honest thesis than a marked instance of somebodys willingness to pass mainly for an ass of these things i must i say have been in strictness aware what i perhaps failed of was to note that if a certain romantic glamour even that of mere eccentricity or of a fine perversity may be flung over the act of exchange of a career for the esthetic life in general the prose and the modesty of the matter yet come in with any exhibition of the particular branch of esthetics selected then it is that the attitude of hero or heroine may look too muchfor the romantic effectlike a low crouching over proved trifles art indeed has in our day taken on so many honours and emoluments that the recognition of its importance is more than a custom has become on occasion almost a fury the line is drawnespecially in the english worldonly at the importance of heeding what it may mean  the more i turn my pieces over at any rate the more i now see i must have found in them and i remember how once well in presence of my three typical examples my fear of too ample a canvas quite dropped the only question was that if i had marked my political case from so far back for a story by itself and then marked my theatrical case for another the joining together of these interests originally seen as separate might all disgracefully betray the seam show for mechanical and superficial a story was a story a picture a picture and i had a mortal horror of two stories two pictures in one the reason of this was the clearestmy subject was immediately under that disadvantage so cheated of its indispensable centre as to become of no more use for expressing a main intention than a wheel without a hub is of use for moving a cart it was a fact apparently that one had on occasion seen two pictures in one were there not for instance certain sublime tintorettos at venice a measureless crucifixion in especial which showed without loss of authority halfadozen actions separately taking place yes that might be but there had surely been nevertheless a mighty pictorial fusion so that the virtue of composition had somehow thereby come all mysteriously to its own of course the affair would be simple enough if composition could be kept out of the question yet by what art or process what bars and bolts what unmuzzled dogs and pointed guns perform that feat i had to know myself utterly inapt for any such valour and recognise that to make it possible sundry things should have begun for me much further back than i had felt them even in their dawn a picture without composition slights its most precious chance for beauty and is moreover not composed at all unless the painter knows how that principle of health and safety working as an absolutely premeditated art has prevailed there may in its absence be life incontestably as the newcomes has life as les trois mousquetaires as tolstois peace and war have it but what do such large loose baggy monsters with their queer elements of the accidental and the arbitrary artistically mean we have heard it maintained we well remember that such things are superior to art but we understand least of all what that may mean and we look in vain for the artist the divine explanatory genius who will come to our aid and tell us there is life and life and as waste is only life sacrificed and thereby prevented from counting i delight in a deepbreathing economy and an organic form my business was accordingly to go in for complete pictorial fusion some such common interest between my two first notions as would in spite of their birth under quite different stars do them no violence at all  i recall with this confirmed infatuation of retrospect that through the mild perceptions i here glance at there struck for the tragic muse the first hour of a season of no small subjective felicity lighted mainly i seem to see by a wide west window that high aloft looked over near and far london sunsets a halfgrey halfflushed expanse of london life the production of the thing which yet took a good many months lives for me again all contemporaneously in that full projection upon my very table of the good fogfiltered kensington mornings which had a way indeed of seeing the sunset in and which at the very last are merged to memory in a different and a sharper pressure that of an hotel bedroom in paris during the autumn of 1889 with the exposition du centenaire about to endand my long story through the usual difficulties as well the usual difficultiesand i fairly cherish the record as some adventurer in another line may hug the sense of his inveterate habit of just saving in time the neck he ever undiscourageably riskswere those bequeathed as a particular vice of the artistic spirit against which vigilance had been destined from the first to exert itself in vain and the effect of which was that again and again perversely incurably the centre of my structure would insist on placing itself not so to speak in the middle it mattered little that the reader with the idea or the suspicion of a structural centre is the rarest of friends and of criticsa bird it would seem as merely fabled as the phoenix the terminational terror was none the less certain to break in and my work threaten to masquerade for me as an active figure condemned to the disgrace of legs too short ever so much too short for its body i urge myself to the candid confession that in very few of my productions to my eye has the organic centre succeeded in getting into proper position  time after time then has the precious waistband or girdle studded and buckled and placed for brave outward show practically worked itself and in spite of desperate remonstrance or in other words essential counterplotting to a point perilously near the kneesperilously i mean for the freedom of these parts in several of my compositions this displacement has so succeeded at the crisis in defying and resisting me has appeared so fraught with probable dishonour that i still turn upon them in spite of the greater or less success of final dissimulation a rueful and wondering eye these productions have in fact if i may be so bold about it specious and spurious centres altogether to make up for the failure of the true as to which in my list they are however that is another business not on any terms to be made known such at least would seem my resolution so far as i have thus proceeded of any attention ever arrested by the pages forming the object of this reference that rigour of discrimination has wholly and consistently failed i gather to constitute a part in which fact there is perhaps after all a rough justicesince the infirmity i speak of for example has been always but the direct and immediate fruit of a positive excess of foresight the overdone desire to provide for future need and lay up heavenly treasure against the demands of my climax if the art of the drama as a great french master of it has said is above all the art of preparations that is true only to a less extent of the art of the novel and true exactly in the degree in which the art of the particular novel comes near that of the drama the first half of a fiction insists ever on figuring to me as the stage or theatre for the second half and i have in general given so much space to making the theatre propitious that my halves have too often proved strangely unequal thereby has arisen with grim regularity the question of artfully of consummately masking the fault and conferring on the false quantity the brave appearance of the true  but i am far from pretending that these desperations of ingenuity have notas through seeming most of the very essence of the problemtheir exasperated charm so far from it that my particular supreme predicament in the paris hotel after an undue primary leakage of time no doubt over at the great riverspanning museum of the champ de mars and the trocadero fairly takes on to me now the tender grace of a day that is dead rereading the last chapters of the tragic muse i catch again the very odour of paris which comes up in the rich rumble of the rue de la paixwith which my room itself for that matter seems impregnatedand which hangs for reminiscence about the embarrassed effort to finish not ignobly within my already exceeded limits an effort prolonged each day to those late afternoon hours during which the tone of the terrible city seemed to deepen about one to an effect strangely composed at once of the auspicious and the fatal the plot of paris thickened at such hours beyond any other plot in the world i think but there one sat meanwhile with another on ones hands absolutely requiring precedence not the least imperative of ones conditions was thus that one should have really should have finely and given ones scale concisely treated ones subject in spite of there being so much of the confounded irreducible quantity still to treat if i spoke just now however of the exasperated charm of supreme difficulty that is because the challenge of economic representation so easily becomes in any of the arts intensely interesting to meet to put all that is possible of ones idea into a form and compass that will contain and express it only by delicate adjustments and an exquisite chemistry so that there will at the end be neither a drop of ones liquor left nor a hairs breadth of the rim of ones glass to spareevery artist will remember how often that sort of necessity has carried with it its particular inspiration therein lies the secret of the appeal to his mind of the successfully foreshortened thing where representation is arrived at as i have already elsewhere had occasion to urge not by the addition of items a light that has for its attendant shadow a possible dryness but by the art of figuring synthetically a compactness into which the imagination may cut thick as into the rich density of weddingcake the moral of all which indeed i fear is perhaps too trivially but that the thick the false the dissembling second half of the work before me associated throughout with the effort to weight my dramatic values as heavily as might be since they had to be so few presents that effort as at the very last a quite convulsive yet in its way highly agreeable spasm of such mild prodigies is the history of any specific creative effort composed  but i have got too much out of the old kensington light of twenty years agoa lingering oblique ray of which today surely quite extinct played for a benediction over my canvas from the moment i made out at my highperched west window my lucky title that is from the moment miriam rooth herself had given it me so this young woman had given me with it her own position in the book and so that in turn had given me my precious unity to which no more than miriam was either nick dormer or peter sherringham to be sacrificed much of the interest of the matter was immediately therefore in working out the detail of that unity andalways entrancing range of questionsthe order the reason the relation of presented aspects with three general aspects that of miriams case that of nicks and that of sherringhams there was work in plenty cut out since happy as it might be to say my several actions beautifully become one the point of the affair would be in showing them beautifully become sowithout which showing foul failure hovered and pounced well the pleasure of handling an action or otherwise expressed of a story is at the worst for a storyteller immense and the interest of such a question as for example keeping nick dormers story his and yet making it also and all effectively in a large part peter sherringhams of keeping sherringhams his and yet making it in its high degree his kinsmans too and miriam rooths into the bargain just as miriam rooths is by the same token quite operatively his and nicks and just as that of each of the young men by an equal logic is very contributively hersthe interest of such a question i say is ever so considerably the interest of the system on which the whole thing is done i see today that it was but half a system to say oh miriam a case herself is the link between the two other cases that device was to ask for as much help as it gave and to require a good deal more application than it announced on the surface the sense of a system saves the painter from the baseness of the arbitrary stroke the touch without its reason but as payment for that service the process insists on being kept impeccably the right one  these are intimate truths indeed of which the charm mainly comes out but on experiment and in practice yet i like to have it well before me here that after all the tragic muse makes it not easy to say which of the situations concerned in it predominates and rules what has become in that imperfect order accordingly of the famous centre of ones subject it is surely not in nicks consciousnesssince why if it be are we treated to such an intolerable dose of sherringhams it cant be in sherringhamswe have for that altogether an excess of nicks how on the other hand can it be in miriams given that we have no direct exhibition of hers whatever that we get at it all inferentially and inductively seeing it only through a more or less bewildered interpretation of it by others the emphasis is all on an absolutely objective miriam and this affirmed howwith such an amount of exposed subjectivity all round hercan so dense a medium be a centre such questions as those go straightthanks to which they are i profess delightful going straight they are of the sort that makes answers possible miriam is central then to analysis in spite of being objective central in virtue of the fact that the whole thing has visibly from the first to get itself done in dramatic or at least in scenic conditionsthough scenic conditions which are as near an approach to the dramatic as the novel may permit itself and which have this in common with the latter that they move in the light of alternation this imposes a consistency other than that of the novel at its loosest and for ones subject a different view and a different placing of the centre the charm of the scenic consistency the consistency of the multiplication of aspects that of making them amusingly various had haunted the author of the tragic muse from far back and he was in due course to yield to it all luxuriously too luxuriously perhaps in the awkward age as will doubtless with the extension of these remarks be complacently shown  to put himself at any rate as much as possible under the protection of it had been ever his practice he had notably done so in the princess casamassima so frankly panoramic and processional and in what case could this protection have had more price than in the one before us no character in a play any play not a mere monologue has for the right expression of the thing a usurping consciousness the consciousness of others is exhibited exactly in the same way as that of the hero the prodigious consciousness of hamlet the most capacious and most crowded the moral presence the most asserted in the whole range of fiction only takes its turn with that of the other agents of the story no matter how occasional these may be it is left in other words to answer for itself equally with theirs wherefore by a parity of reasoning if not of example miriams might without inconsequence be placed on the same footing and all in spite of the fact that the moral presence of each of the men most importantly concerned with heror with the second of whom she at least is importantly concernedis independently answered for the idea of the book being as i have said a picture of some of the personal consequences of the artappetite raised to intensity swollen to voracity the heavy emphasis falls where the symbol of some of the complications so begotten might be made as i judged heaven forgive me most amusing amusing i mean in the best very modern sense i never go behind miriam only poor sherringham goes a great deal and nick dormer goes a little and the author while they so waste wonderment goes behind them but none the less she is as thoroughly symbolic as functional for illustration of the idea as either of them while her image had seemed susceptible of a livelier and prettier concretion i had desired for her i remember all manageable vividnessso ineluctable had it long appeared to do the actress to touch the theatre to meet that connexion somehow or other in any free plunge of the speculative fork into the contemporary social salad  the late r l stevenson was to write to me i recalland precisely on the occasion of the tragic musethat he was at a loss to conceive how one could find an interest in anything so vulgar or pretend to gather fruit in so scrubby an orchard but the view of a creature of the stage the view of the histrionic temperament as suggestive much less verily in respect to the poor stage per se than in respect to art at large affected me in spite of that as justly tenable an objection of a more pointed order was forced upon me by an acute friend later on and in another connexion the challenge of ones right in any pretended show of social realities to attach to the image of a public character a supposed particular celebrity a range of interest of intrinsic distinction greater than any such display of importance on the part of eminent members of the class as we see them about us there was a nice point if one wouldyet only nice enough after all to be easily amusing we shall deal with it later on however in a more urgent connexion what would have worried me much more had it dawned earlier is the light lately thrown by that admirable writer m anatole france on the question of any animated view of the histrionic temperamenta light that may well dazzle to distress any ingenuous worker in the same field in those parts of his brief but inimitable histoire comique on which he is most to be congratulatedfor there are some that prompt to reserveshe has done the actress as well as the actor done above all the mountebank the mummer and the cabotin and mixed them up with the queer theatric air in a manner that practically warns all other hands off the material for ever at the same time i think i saw miriam and without a sacrifice of truth that is of the particular glow of verisimilitude i wished her most to benefit by in a complexity of relations finer than any that appear possible for the gentry of m anatole france  her relation to nick dormer for instance was intended as a superior interestthat of being while perfectly sincere sincere for her and therefore perfectly consonant with her impulse perpetually to perform and with her success in performing the result of a touched imagination a touched pride for art as well as of the charm cast on other sensibilities still dormers relation to herself is a different matter of which more presently but the sympathy she poor young woman very generously and intelligently offers him where most people have so stinted it is disclosed largely at the cost of her egotism and her personal pretensions even though in fact determined by her sense of their together nick and she postponing the world to their conception of other and finer decencies nick cant on the whole seefor i have represented him as in his day quite sufficiently troubled and anxiouswhy he should condemn to ugly feebleness his most prized faculty most prized at least by himself even in order to keep his seat in parliament to inherit mr carterets blessing and money to gratify his mother and carry out the mission of his father to marry julia dallow in fine a beautiful imperative woman with a great many thousands a year it all comes back in the last analysis to the individual vision of decency the critical as well as the passionate judgement of it under sharp stress and nicks vision and judgement all on the esthetic ground have beautifully coincided to miriams imagination with a now fully marked an inspired and impenitent choice of her own so that other considerations powerfully aiding indeed she is ready to see their interest all splendidly as one she is in the uplifted state to which sacrifices and submissions loom large but loom so just because they must write sympathy write passion large her measure of what she would be capable of for himcapable that is of not asking of himwill depend on what he shall ask of her but she has no fear of not being able to satisfy him even to the point of chucking for him if need be that artistic identity of her own which she has begun to build up it will all be to the glory therefore of their common infatuation with art she will doubtless be no less willing to serve his than she was eager to serve her own purged now of the too great shrillness  this puts her quite on a different level from that of the vivid monsters of m france whose artistic identity is the last thing they wish to chucktheir only dismissal is of all material and social overdraping nick dormer in point of fact asks of miriam nothing but that she shall remain awfully interesting to paint but that is his relation which as i say is quite a matter by itself he at any rate luckily for both of them it may be doesnt put her to the test he is so busy with his own case busy with testing himself and feeling his reality he has seen himself as giving up precious things for an object and that object has somehow not been the young woman in question nor anything very nearly like her she on the other hand has asked everything of peter sherringham who has asked everything of her and it is in so doing that she has really most testified for art and invited him to testify with his professed interest in the theatreone of those deep subjections that in men of taste the comédie française used in old days to conspire for and some such odd and affecting examples of which were to be notedhe yet offers her his hand and an introduction to the very best society if she will leave the stage the powerand her having the sense of the powerto shine in the world is his highest measure of her the test applied by him to her beautiful human value just as the manner in which she turns on him is the application of her own standard and touchstone she is perfectly sure of her own forif there were nothing else and there is muchshe has tasted blood so to speak in the form of her so prompt and auspicious success with the public leaving all probations behind the whole of which as the book gives it is too rapid and sudden though inevitably so processes periods intervals stages degrees connexions may be easily enough and barely enough named may be unconvincingly stated in fiction to the deep discredit of the writer but it remains the very deuce to represent them especially represent them under strong compression and in brief and subordinate terms and this even though the novelist who doesnt represent and represent all the time is lost exactly as much lost as the painter who at his work and given his intention doesnt paint all the time  turn upon her friend at any rate miriam does and one of my main points is missed if it fails to appear that she does so with absolute sincerity and with the cold passion of the high critic who knows on sight of them together the more or less dazzling false from the comparatively greycoloured true sherringhams whole profession has been that he rejoices in her as she is and that the theatre the organised theatre will be as matthew arnold was in those very days pronouncing it irresistible and it is the promptness with which he sheds his pretended faith as soon as it feels in the air the breath of reality as soon as it asks of him a proof or a sacrifice it is this that excites her doubtless sufficiently arrogant scorn where is the virtue of his high interest if it has verily never been an interest to speak of and if all it has suddenly to suggest is that in face of a serious call it shall be unblushingly relinquished if he and she together and her great field and future and the whole cause they had armed and declared for have not been serious things they have been base makebelieves and trivialitieswhich is what in fact the homage of society to art always turns out so soon as art presumes not to be vulgar and futile it is immensely the fashion and immensely edifying to listen to this homage while it confines its attention to vanities and frauds but it knows only terror feels only horror the moment that instead of making all the concessions art proceeds to ask for a few miriam is nothing if not strenuous and evidently nothing if not cheeky where sherringham is concerned at least these in the allegotistical exhibition to which she is condemned are the very elements of her figure and the very colours of her portrait but she is mild and inconsequent for nick dormer who demands of her so little as if gravely and pityingly embracing the truth that his sacrifice on the right side is probably to have very little of her sort of recompense i must have had it well before me that she was all aware of the small strain a great sacrifice to nick would cost herby reason of the strong effect on her of his own superior logic in which the very intensity of concentration was so to find its account  if the man however who holds her personally dear yet holds her extremely personal message to the world cheap so the man capable of a consistency and as she regards the matter of an honesty so much higher than sherringhams virtually cares really cares no straw for his fellowstruggler if nick dormer attracts and allindifferently holds her it is because like herself and unlike peter he puts art first but the most he thus does for her in the event is to let her see how she may enjoy in intimacy the rigour it has taught him and which he cultivates at her expense this is the situation in which we leave her though there would be more still to be said about the difference for her of the two relationsthat to each of the mencould i fondly suppose as much of the interest of the book left over for the reader as for myself sherringham for instance offers miriam marriage ever so handsomely but if nothing might lead me on further than the question of what it would have been open to usus novelists especially in the old daysto show serially a young man in nick dormers quite different position as offering or a young woman in miriams as taking so for that very reason such an excursion is forbidden me the trade of the stageplayer and above all of the actress must have so many detestable sides for the person exercising it that we scarce imagine a full surrender to it without a full surrender not less to every immediate compensation to every freedom and the largest ease within reach which presentment of the possible case for miriam would yet have been condemnedand on grounds both various and interesting to traceto remain very imperfect  i feel moreover that i might still with space abound in remarks about nicks character and nicks crisis suggested to my present more reflective vision it strikes me alas that he is not quite so interesting as he was fondly intended to be and this in spite of the multiplication within the picture of his pains and penalties so that while i turn this slight anomaly over i come upon a reason that affects me as singularly charming and touching and at which indeed i have already glanced any presentation of the artist in triumph must be flat in proportion as it really sticks to its subjectit can only smuggle in relief and variety for to put the matter in an image all we thenin his triumphsee of the charmcompeller is the back he turns to us as he bends over his work his triumph decently is but the triumph of what he produces and that is another affair his romance is the romance he himself projects he eats the cake of the very rarest privilege the most luscious baked in the oven of the godstherefore he maynt have it in the form of the privilege of the hero at the same time the privilege of the herothat is of the martyr or of the interesting and appealing and comparatively floundering personplaces him in quite a different category belongs to him only as to the artist deluded diverted frustrated or vanquished when the amateur in him gains for our admiration or compassion or whatever all that the expert has to do without therefore i strove in vain i feel to embroil and adorn this young man on whom a hundred ingenious touches are thus lavished he has insisted in the event on looking as simple and flat as some mere brass check or engraved number the symbol and guarantee of a stored treasure the better part of him is locked too much away from us and the part we see has to pass forwell what it passes for so lamentedly among his friends and relatives no accordingly nick dormer isnt the best thing in the book as i judge i imagined he would be and it contains nothing better i make out than that preserved and achieved unity and quality of tone a value in itself which i referred to at the beginning of these remarks what i mean by this is that the interest created and the expression of that interest are things kept as to kind genuine and true to themselves the appeal the fidelity to the prime motive is with no little art strained clear even as silver is polished in a degree answeringat least by intentionto the air of beauty there is an awkwardness again in having thus belatedly to point such features out but in that wrought appearance of animation and harmony that effect of free movement and yet of recurrent and insistent reference the tragic muse has struck me again as conscious of a bright advantage  henry james     book first     i   the people of france have made it no secret that those of england as a general thing are to their perception an inexpressive and speechless race perpendicular and unsociable unaddicted to enriching any bareness of contact with verbal or other embroidery this view might have derived encouragement a few years ago in paris from the manner in which four persons sat together in silence one fine day about noon in the garden as it is called of the palais de lindustriethe central court of the great glazed bazaar where among plants and parterres gravelled walks and thin fountains are ranged the figures and groups the monuments and busts which form in the annual exhibition of the salon the department of statuary the spirit of observation is naturally high at the salon quickened by a thousand artful or artless appeals but it need have put forth no great intensity to take in the characters i mention as a solicitation of the eye on definite grounds these visitors too constituted a successful plastic fact and even the most superficial observer would have marked them as products of an insular neighbourhood representatives of that tweedandwaterproof class with which on the recurrent occasions when the english turn out for a holidaychristmas and easter whitsuntide and the autumnparis besprinkles itself at a nights notice they had about them the indefinable professional look of the british traveller abroad the air of preparation for exposure material and moral which is so oddly combined with the serene revelation of security and of persistence and which excites according to individual susceptibility the ire or the admiration of foreign communities they were the more unmistakable as they presented mainly the happier aspects of the energetic race to which they had the honour to belong the fresh diffused light of the salon made them clear and important they were finished creations in their way and ranged there motionless on their green bench were almost as much on exhibition as if they had been hung on the line  three ladies and a young man they were obviously a familya mother two daughters and a son a circumstance which had the effect at once of making each member of the group doubly typical and of helping to account for their fine taciturnity they were not with each other on terms of ceremony and also were probably fatigued with their course among the pictures the rooms on the upper floor their attitude on the part of visitors who had superior features even if they might appear to some passersby to have neglected a fine opportunity for completing these features with an expression was after all a kind of tribute to the state of exhaustion of bewilderment to which the genius of france is still capable of reducing the proud  en vlà des abrutis more than one of their fellowgazers might have been heard to exclaim and certain it is that there was something depressed and discouraged in this interesting group who sat looking vaguely before them not noticing the life of the place somewhat as if each had a private anxiety it might have been finely guessed however that though on many questions they were closely united this present anxiety was not the same for each if they looked grave moreover this was doubtless partly the result of their all being dressed in such mourning as told of a recent bereavement the eldest of the three ladies had indeed a face of a fine austere mould which would have been moved to gaiety only by some force more insidious than any she was likely to recognise in paris cold still and considerably worn it was neither stupid nor hardit was firm narrow and sharp this competent matron acquainted evidently with grief but not weakened by it had a high forehead to which the quality of the skin gave a singular polishit glittered even when seen at a distance a nose which achieved a high free curve and a tendency to throw back her head and carry it well above her as if to disengage it from the possible entanglements of the rest of her person if you had seen her walk you would have felt her to tread the earth after a fashion suggesting that in a world where she had long since discovered that one couldnt have ones own way one could never tell what annoying aggression might take place so that it was well from hour to hour to save what one could lady agnes saved her head her white triangular forehead over which her closecrinkled flaxen hair reproduced in different shades in her children made a looped silken canopy like the marquee at a gardenparty her daughters were as tall as herselfthat was visible even as they sat thereand one of them the younger evidently altogether pretty a straight slender greyeyed english girl of the sort who show good figures and fresh complexions the sister who was not pretty was also straight and slender and greyeyed but the grey in this case was not so pure nor were the straightness and the slenderness so maidenly the brother of these young ladies had taken off his hat as if he felt the air of the summer day heavy in the great pavilion he was a lean strong clearfaced youth with a formed nose and thick lightbrown hair which lay continuously and profusely back from his forehead so that to smooth it from the brow to the neck but a single movement of the hand was required i cannot describe him better than by saying that he was the sort of young englishman who looks particularly well in strange lands and whose general aspecthis inches his limbs his friendly eyes the modulation of his voice the cleanness of his fleshtints and the fashion of his garmentsexcites on the part of those who encounter him in far countries on the ground of a common speech a delightful sympathy of race this sympathy may sometimes be qualified by the seen limits of his apprehension but it almost revels as such horizons recede we shall see quickly enough how accurate a measure it might have taken of nicholas dormer there was food for suspicion perhaps in the wandering blankness that sat at moments in his eyes as if he had no attention at all not the least in the world at his command but it is no more than just to add without delay that this discouraging symptom was known among those who liked him by the indulgent name of dreaminess by his mother and sisters for instance his dreaminess was constantly noted he is the more welcome to the benefit of such an interpretation as there is always held to be something engaging in the combination of the muscular and the musing the mildness of strength  after some time an interval during which these good people might have appeared to have come individually to the palais de lindustrie much less to see the works of art than to think over their domestic affairs the young man rousing himself from his reverie addressed one of the girls  i say biddy why should we sit moping here all day come and take a turn about with me  his younger sister while he got up leaned forward a little looking round her but she gave for the moment no further sign of complying with his invitation  where shall we find you then if peter comes asked the other miss dormer making no movement at all  i daresay peter wont come hell leave us here to cool our heels  oh nick dear biddy exclaimed in a small sweet voice of protest it was plainly her theory that peter would come and even a little her fond fear that she might miss him should she quit that spot  we shall come back in a quarter of an hour really i must look at these things nick declared turning his face to a marble group which stood near them on the righta man with the skin of a beast round his loins tussling with a naked woman in some primitive effort of courtship or capture  lady agnes followed the direction of her sons eyes and then observed everything seems very dreadful i should think biddy had better sit still hasnt she seen enough horrors up above  i daresay that if peter comes juliall be with him the elder girl remarked irrelevantly  well then he can take julia about that will be more proper said lady agnes  mother dear she doesnt care a rap about art its a fearful bore looking at fine things with julia nick returned  wont you go with him graceand biddy appealed to her sister  i think she has awfully good taste grace exclaimed not answering this inquiry  dont say nasty things about her lady agnes broke out solemnly to her son after resting her eyes on him a moment with an air of reluctant reprobation  i say nothing but what shed say herself the young man urged about some things she has very good taste but about this kind of thing she has no taste at all  thats better i think said lady agnes turning her eyes again to the kind of thing her son appeared to designate  shes awfully cleverawfully grace went on with decision  awfully awfully her brother repeated standing in front of her and smiling down at her  you are nasty nick you know you are said the young lady but more in sorrow than in anger  biddy got up at this as if the accusatory tone prompted her to place herself generously at his side mightnt you go and order lunchin that place you know she asked of her mother then wed come back when it was ready  my dear child i cant order lunch lady agnes replied with a cold impatience which seemed to intimate that she had problems far more important than those of victualling to contend with  then perhaps peter will if he comes im sure hes up in everything of that sort  oh hang peter nick exclaimed leave him out of account and do order lunch mother but not cold beef and pickles  i must sayabout himyoure not nice biddy ventured to remark to her brother hesitating and even blushing a little  you make up for it my dear the young man answered giving her china very charming rotund little china friendly whisk with his forefinger  i cant imagine what youve got against him her ladyship said gravely  dear mother its disappointed fondness nick argued they wont answer ones notes they wont let one know where they are nor what to expect hell has no fury like a woman scorned nor like a man either  peter has such a tremendous lot to doits a very busy time at the embassy there are sure to be reasons biddy explained with her pretty eyes  reasons enough no doubt said lady agneswho accompanied these words with an ambiguous sigh however as if in paris even the best reasons would naturally be bad ones  doesnt julia write to you doesnt she answer you the very day grace asked looking at nick as if she were the bold one  he waited returning her glance with a certain severity what do you know about my correspondence no doubt i ask too much he went on im so attached to them dear old peter dear old julia  shes younger than you my dear cried the elder girl still resolute  yes nineteen days  im glad you know her birthday  she knows yours she always gives you something lady agnes reminded her son  her taste is good then isnt it nick grace dormer continued  she makes charming presents but dear mother it isnt her taste its her husbands  how her husbands  the beautiful objects of which she disposes so freely are the things he collected for years laboriously devotedly poor man  she disposes of them to you but not to others said lady agnes but thats all right she added as if this might have been taken for a complaint of the limitations of julias bounty she has to select among so many and thats a proof of taste her ladyship pursued  you cant say she doesnt choose lovely ones grace remarked to her brother in a tone of some triumph  my dear theyre all lovely george dallows judgement was so sure he was incapable of making a mistake nicholas dormer returned  i dont see how you can talk of him he was dreadful said lady agnes  my dear if he was good enough for julia to marry hes good enough for us to talk of  she did him a very great honour  i daresay but he was not unworthy of it no such enlightened collection of beautiful objects has been made in england in our time  you think too much of beautiful objects lady agnes sighed  i thought you were just now lamenting that i think too little  its very nicehis having left julia so well off biddy interposed soothingly as if she foresaw a tangle  he treated her en grand seigneur absolutely nick went on  he used to look greasy all the samegrace bore on it with a dull weight his name ought to have been tallow  youre not saying what julia would like if thats what you are trying to say her brother observed  dont be vulgar grace said lady agnes  i know peter sherringhams birthday biddy broke out innocently as a pacific diversion she had passed her hand into nicks arm to signify her readiness to go with him while she scanned the remoter reaches of the garden as if it had occurred to her that to direct their steps in some such sense might after all be the shorter way to get at peter  hes too much older than you my dear grace answered without encouragement  thats why ive noticed ithes thirtyfour do you call that too old i dont care for slobbering infants biddy cried  dont be vulgar lady agnes enjoined again  come bid well go and be vulgar together for thats what we are im afraid her brother said to her well go and look at all these low works of art  do you really think its necessary to the childs development lady agnes demanded as the pair turned away and then while her son struck as by a challenge paused lingering a moment with his little sister on his arm what weve been through this morning in this place and what youve paraded before our eyesthe murders the tortures all kinds of disease and indecency  nick looked at his mother as if this sudden protest surprised him but as if also there were lurking explanations of it which he quickly guessed her resentment had the effect not so much of animating her cold face as of making it colder less expressive though visibly prouder ah dear mother dont do the british matron he replied goodhumouredly  british matrons soon said i dont know what theyre coming to  how odd that you should have been struck only with the disagreeable things when for myself ive felt it to be most interesting the most suggestive morning ive passed for ever so many months  oh nick nick lady agnes cried with a strange depth of feeling  i like them better in londontheyre much less unpleasant said grace dormer  theyre things you can look at her ladyship went on we certainly make the better show  the subject doesnt matter its the treatment the treatment biddy protested in a voice like the tinkle of a silver bell  poor little bidher brother broke into a laugh  how can i learn to model mamma dear if i dont look at things and if i dont study them the girl continued  this question passed unheeded and nicholas dormer said to his mother more seriously but with a certain kind explicitness as if he could make a particular allowance this place is an immense stimulus to me it refreshes me excites meits such an exhibition of artistic life its full of ideas full of refinements it gives one such an impression of artistic experience they try everything they feel everything while you were looking at the murders apparently i observed an immense deal of curious and interesting work there are too many of them poor devils so many who must make their way who must attract attention some of them can only taper fort stand on their heads turn somersaults or commit deeds of violence to make people notice them after that no doubt a good many will be quieter but i dont know today im in an appreciative moodi feel indulgent even to them they give me an impression of intelligence of eager observation all art is oneremember that biddy dear the young man continued smiling down from his height its the same great manyheaded effort and any ground thats gained by an individual any spark thats struck in any province is of use and of suggestion to all the others were all in the same boat  we do you say my dear are you really setting up for an artist lady agnes asked  nick just hesitated i was speaking for biddy  but you are one nickyou are the girl cried  lady agnes looked for an instant as if she were going to say once more dont be vulgar but she suppressed these words had she intended them and uttered sounds few in number and not completely articulate to the effect that she hated talking about art while her son spoke she had watched him as if failing to follow yet something in the tone of her exclamation hinted that she had understood him but too well  were all in the same boat biddy repeated with cheerful zeal  not me if you please lady agnes replied its horrid messy work your modelling  ah but look at the results said the girl eagerlyglancing about at the monuments in the garden as if in regard even to them she were through that unity of art her brother had just proclaimed in some degree an effective cause  theres a great deal being done herea real vitality nicholas dormer went on to his mother in the same reasonable informing way some of these fellows go very far  they do indeed said lady agnes  im fond of young schoolslike this movement in sculpture nick insisted with his slightly provoking serenity  theyre old enough to know better  maynt i look mamma it is necessary to my development biddy declared  you may do as you like said lady agnes with dignity  she ought to see good work you know the young man went on  i leave it to your sense of responsibility this statement was somewhat majestic and for a moment evidently it tempted nick almost provoked him or at any rate suggested to him an occasion for some pronouncement he had had on his mind apparently however he judged the time on the whole not quite right and his sister grace interposed with the inquiry  please mamma are we never going to lunch  ah mother mother the young man murmured in a troubled way looking down at her with a deep fold in his forehead  for lady agnes also as she returned his look it seemed an occasion but with this difference that she had no hesitation in taking advantage of it she was encouraged by his slight embarrassment for ordinarily nick was not embarrassed you used to have so much sense of responsibility she pursued but sometimes i dont know what has become of itit seems all all gone  ah mother mother he exclaimed againas if there were so many things to say that it was impossible to choose but now he stepped closer bent over her and in spite of the publicity of their situation gave her a quick expressive kiss the foreign observer whom i took for granted in beginning to sketch this scene would have had to admit that the rigid english family had after all a capacity for emotion grace dormer indeed looked round her to see if at this moment they were noticed she judged with satisfaction that they had escaped     ii   nick dormer walked away with biddy but he had not gone far before he stopped in front of a clever bust where his mother in the distance saw him playing in the air with his hand carrying out by this gesture which presumably was applausive some critical remark he had made to his sister lady agnes raised her glass to her eyes by the long handle to which rather a clanking chain was attached perceiving that the bust represented an ugly old man with a bald head at which her ladyship indefinitely sighed though it was not apparent in what way such an object could be detrimental to her daughter nick passed on and quickly paused again this time his mother discerned before the marble image of a strange grimacing woman presently she lost sight of him he wandered behind things looking at them all round  i ought to get plenty of ideas for my modelling oughtnt i nick his sister put to him after a moment  ah my poor child what shall i say  dont you think ive any capacity for ideas the girl continued ruefully  lots of them no doubt but the capacity for applying them for putting them into practicehow much of that have you  how can i tell till i try  what do you mean by trying biddy dear  why you knowyouve seen me  do you call that trying her brother amusedly demanded  ah nick she said with sensibility but then with more spirit and please what do you call it  well this for instance is a good case and her companion pointed to another busta head of a young man in terracotta at which they had just arrived a modern young man to whom with his thick neck his little cap and his wide ring of dense curls the artist had given the air of some sturdy florentine of the time of lorenzo  biddy looked at the image a moment ah thats not trying thats succeeding  not altogether its only trying seriously  well why shouldnt i be serious  mother wouldnt like it she has inherited the fine old superstition that arts pardonable only so long as its badso long as its done at odd hours for a little distraction like a game of tennis or of whist the only thing that can justify it the effort to carry it as far as one can which you cant do without time and singleness of purpose she regards as just the dangerous the criminal element its the oddest hindpartbefore view the drollest immorality  she doesnt want one to be professional biddy returned as if she could do justice to every system  better leave it alone then there are always duffers enough  i dont want to be a duffer biddy said but i thought you encouraged me  so i did my poor child it was only to encourage myself  with your own workyour painting  with my futile my illstarred endeavours union is strengthso that we might present a wider front a larger surface of resistance  biddy for a while said nothing and they continued their tour of observation she noticed how he passed over some things quickly his first glance sufficing to show him if they were worth another and then recognised in a moment the figures that made some appeal his tone puzzled but his certainty of eye impressed her and she felt what a difference there was yet between themhow much longer in every case she would have taken to discriminate she was aware of how little she could judge of the value of a thing till she had looked at it ten minutes indeed modest little biddy was compelled privately to add and often not even then she was mystified as i saynick was often mystifying it was his only faultbut one thing was definite her brother had high ability it was the consciousness of this that made her bring out at last i dont so much care whether or no i please mamma if i please you  oh dont lean on me im a wretched broken reedim no use really he promptly admonished her  do you mean youre a duffer biddy asked in alarm  frightful frightful  so that you intend to give up your workto let it alone as you advise me  it has never been my work all that business biddy if it had it would be different i should stick to it  and you wont stick to it the girl said standing before him openeyed  her brother looked into her eyes a moment and she had a compunction she feared she was indiscreet and was worrying him your questions are much simpler than the elements out of which my answer should come  a great talentwhats simpler than that  one excellent thing dear biddy no talent at all  well yours is so real you cant help it  we shall see we shall see said nick dormer let us go look at that big group  we shall see if your talents real biddy went on as she accompanied him  no we shall see if as you say i cant help it what nonsense paris makes one talk the young man added as they stopped in front of the composition this was true perhaps but not in a sense he could find himself tempted to deplore the present was far from his first visit to the french capital he had often quitted england and usually made a point of putting in as he called it a few days there on the outward journey to the continent or on the return but at present the feelings for the most part agreeable attendant upon a change of air and of scene had been more punctual and more acute than for a long time before and stronger the sense of novelty refreshment amusement of the hundred appeals from that quarter of thought to which on the whole his attention was apt most frequently though not most confessedly to stray he was fonder of paris than most of his countrymen though not so fond perhaps as some other captivated aliens the place had always had the virtue of quickening in him sensibly the life of reflexion and observation it was a good while since his impressions had been so favourable to the city by the seine a good while at all events since they had ministered so to excitement to exhilaration to ambition even to a restlessness that was not prevented from being agreeable by the excess of agitation in it nick could have given the reason of this unwonted glow but his preference was very much to keep it to himself certainly to persons not deeply knowing or at any rate not deeply curious in relation to the young mans history the explanation might have seemed to beg the question consisting as it did of the simple formula that he had at last come to a crisis why a crisiswhat was it and why had he not come to it before the reader shall learn these things in time if he cares enough for them  our young man had not in any recent year failed to see the salon which the general voice this season pronounced not particularly good none the less it was the present exhibition that for some cause connected with his crisis made him think fast produced that effect he had spoken of to his mother as a sense of artistic life the precinct of the marbles and bronzes spoke to him especially today the glazed garden not florally rich with its new productions alternating with perfunctory plants and its queer damp smell partly the odour of plastic clay of the studios of sculptors put forth the voice of old associations of other visits of companionships now endedan insinuating eloquence which was at the same time somehow identical with the general sharp contagion of paris there was youth in the air and a multitudinous newness for ever reviving and the diffusion of a hundred talents ingenuities experiments the summer clouds made shadows on the roof of the great building the white images hard in their crudity spotted the place with provocations the rattle of plates at the restaurant sounded sociable in the distance and our young man congratulated himself more than ever that he had not missed his chance he felt how it would help him to settle something at the moment he made this reflexion his eye fell upon a person who appearedjust in the first glimpseto carry out the idea of help he uttered a lively ejaculation which however in its want of finish biddy failed to understand so pertinent so relevant and congruous was the other party to this encounter  the girls attention followed her brothers resting with it on a young man who faced them without seeing them engaged as he was in imparting to two companions his ideas about one of the works exposed to view what biddy remarked was that this young man was fair and fat and of the middle stature he had a round face and a short beard and on his crown a mere reminiscence of hair as the fact that he carried his hat in his hand permitted to be observed bridget dormer who was quick placed him immediately as a gentleman but as a gentleman unlike any other gentleman she had ever seen she would have taken him for very foreign but that the words proceeding from his mouth reached her ear and imposed themselves as a rare variety of english it was not that a foreigner might not have spoken smoothly enough nor yet that the speech of this young man was not smooth it had in truth a conspicuous and aggressive perfection and biddy was sure no mere learner would have ventured to play such tricks with the tongue he seemed to draw rich effects and wandering airs from itto modulate and manipulate it as he would have done a musical instrument her view of the gentlemans companions was less operative save for her soon making the reflexion that they were people whom in any country from china to peru you would immediately have taken for natives one of them was an old lady with a shawl that was the most salient way in which she presented herself the shawl was an ancient muchused fabric of embroidered cashmere such as many ladies wore forty years ago in their walks abroad and such as no lady wears today it had fallen half off the back of the wearer but at the moment biddy permitted herself to consider her she gave it a violent jerk and brought it up to her shoulders again where she continued to arrange and settle it with a good deal of jauntiness and elegance while she listened to the talk of the gentleman biddy guessed that this little transaction took place very frequently and was not unaware of its giving the old lady a droll factitious faded appearance as if she were singularly out of step with the age the other person was very much youngershe might have been a daughterand had a pale face a low forehead and thick dark hair what she chiefly had however biddy rapidly discovered was a pair of largelygazing eyes our young friend was helped to the discovery by the accident of their resting at this moment for a timeit struck biddy as very longon her own both these ladies were clad in light thin scant gowns giving an impression of flowered figures and odd transparencies and in low shoes which showed a great deal of stocking and were ornamented with large rosettes biddys slightly agitated perception travelled directly to their shoes they suggested to her vaguely that the wearers were dancersconnected possibly with the oldfashioned exhibition of the shawldance by the time she had taken in so much as this the mellifluous young man had perceived and addressed himself to her brother he came on with an offered hand nick greeted him and said it was a happy chancehe was uncommonly glad to see him  i never come across youi dont know why nick added while the two smiling looked each other up and down like men reunited after a long interval  oh it seems to me theres reason enough our paths in life are so different nicks friend had a great deal of manner as was evinced by his fashion of saluting biddy without knowing her  different yes but not so different as that dont we both live in london after all and in the nineteenth century  ah my dear dormer excuse me i dont live in the nineteenth century jamais de la vie the gentleman declared  nor in london either  yeswhen im not at samarcand but surely weve diverged since the old days i adore what you burn you burn what i adore while the stranger spoke he looked cheerfully hospitably at biddy not because it was she she easily guessed but because it was in his nature to desire a second auditora kind of sympathetic gallery her life was somehow filled with shy people and she immediately knew she had never encountered any one who seemed so to know his part and recognise his cues  how do you know what i adore nicholas dormer asked  i know well enough what you used to  thats more than i do myself there were so many things  yes there are many thingsmany many thats what makes life so amusing  do you find it amusing  my dear fellow cest à se tordre dont you think so ah it was high time i should meet youi see ive an idea you need me  upon my word i think i do nick said in a tone which struck his sister and made her wonder still more why if the gentleman was so important as that he didnt introduce him  there are many gods and this is one of their temples the mysterious personage went on its a house of strange idolsisnt itand of some strange and unnatural sacrifices  to biddy as much as to her brother this remark might have been offered but the girls eyes turned back to the ladies who for the moment had lost their companion she felt irresponsive and feared she should pass with this easy cosmopolite for a stiff scared english girl which was not the type she aimed at but wasnt even ocular commerce overbold so long as she hadnt a sign from nick the elder of the strange women had turned her back and was looking at some bronze figure losing her shawl again as she did so but the other stood where their escort had quitted her giving all her attention to his sudden sociability with others her arms hung at her sides her head was bent her face lowered so that she had an odd appearance of raising her eyes from under her brows and in this attitude she was striking though her air was so unconciliatory as almost to seem dangerous did it express resentment at having been abandoned for another girl biddy who began to be frightenedthere was a moment when the neglected creature resembled a tigress about to springwas tempted to cry out that she had no wish whatever to appropriate the gentleman then she made the discovery that the young lady too had a manner almost as much as her clever guide and the rapid induction that it perhaps meant no more than his she only looked at biddy from beneath her eyebrows which were wonderfully arched but there was ever so much of a manner in the way she did it biddy had a momentary sense of being a figure in a ballet a dramatic balleta subordinate motionless figure to be dashed at to music or strangely capered up to it would be a very dramatic ballet indeed if this young person were the heroine she had magnificent hair the girl reflected and at the same moment heard nick say to his interlocutor youre not in londonone cant meet you there  i rove drift float was the answer my feelings direct meif such a life as mine may be said to have a direction where theres anything to feel i try to be there the young man continued with his confiding laugh  i should like to get hold of you nick returned  well in that case there would be no doubt the intellectual adventure those are the currentsany sort of personal relationthat govern my career  i dont want to lose you this time nick continued in a tone that excited biddys surprise a moment before when his friend had said that he tried to be where there was anything to feel she had wondered how he could endure him  dont lose me dont lose me cried the stranger after a fashion which affected the girl as the highest expression of irresponsibility she had ever seen after all why should you let us remain together unless i interfereand he looked smiling and interrogative at biddy who still remained blank only noting again that nick forbore to make them acquainted this was an anomaly since he prized the gentleman so still there could be no anomaly of nicks that wouldnt impose itself on his younger sister  certainly i keep you he said unless on my side i deprive those ladies  charming women but its not an indissoluble union we meet we communicate we part theyre goingim seeing them to the door i shall come back with this nicks friend rejoined his companions who moved away with him the strange fine eyes of the girl lingering on biddys brother as well as on biddy herself as they receded  who is hewho are they biddy instantly asked  hes a gentleman nick made answerinsufficiently she thought and even with a shade of hesitation he spoke as if she might have supposed he was not one and if he was really one why didnt he introduce him but biddy wouldnt for the world have put this question and he now moved to the nearest bench and dropped upon it as to await the others return no sooner however had his sister seated herself than he said see here my dear do you think you had better stay  do you want me to go back to mother the girl asked with a lengthening visage  well what do you think he asked it indeed gaily enough  is your conversation to be aboutabout private affairs  no i cant say that but i doubt if mother would think it the sort of thing thats necessary to your development  this assertion appeared to inspire her with the eagerness with which she again broke out but who are theywho are they  i know nothing of the ladies i never saw them before the mans a fellow i knew very well at oxford he was thought immense fun there weve diverged as he says and i had almost lost sight of him but not so much as he thinks because ive read himread him with interest he has written a very clever book  what kind of a book  a sort of novel  what sort of novel  well i dont knowwith a lot of good writing biddy listened to this so receptively that she thought it perverse her brother should add i daresay peter will have come if you return to mother  i dont care if he has peters nothing to me but ill go if you wish it  nick smiled upon her again and then said it doesnt signify well all go  all she echoed  he wont hurt us on the contrary hell do us good  this was possible the girl reflected in silence but none the less the idea struck her as courageous of their taking the odd young man back to breakfast with them and with the others especially if peter should be there if peter was nothing to her it was singular she should have attached such importance to this contingency the odd young man reappeared and now that she saw him without his queer female appendages he seemed personally less weird he struck her moreover as generally a good deal accounted for by the literary character especially if it were responsible for a lot of good writing as he took his place on the bench nick said to him indicating her my sister bridget and then mentioned his name mr gabriel nash  you enjoy parisyoure happy here mr nash inquired leaning over his friend to speak to the girl  though his words belonged to the situation it struck her that his tone didnt and this made her answer him more dryly than she usually spoke oh yes its very nice  and french art interests you you find things here that please  oh yes i like some of them  mr nash considered her kindly i hoped youd say you like the academy better  she would if she didnt think you expected it said nicholas dormer  oh nick biddy protested  miss dormers herself an english picture their visitor pronounced in the tone of a man whose urbanity was a general solvent  thats a compliment if you dont like them biddy exclaimed  ah some of them some of them theres a certain sort of thing mr nash continued we must feel everything everything that we can were here for that  you do like english art then nick demanded with a slight accent of surprise  mr nash indulged his wonder my dear dormer do you remember the old complaint i used to make of you you had formulas that were like walking in ones hat one may see something in a case and one may not  upon my word said nick i dont know any one who was fonder of a generalisation than you you turned them off as the man at the streetcorner distributes handbills  they were my wild oats ive sown them all  we shall see that  oh theres nothing of them now a tame scanty homely growth my only good generalisations are my actions  we shall see them then  ah pardon me you cant see them with the naked eye moreover mine are principally negative peoples actions i know are for the most part the things they dobut mine are all the things i dont do there are so many of those so many but they dont produce any effect and then all the rest are shadesextremely fine shades  shades of behaviour nick inquired with an interest which surprised his sister mr nashs discourse striking her mainly as the twaddle of the underworld  shades of impression of appreciation said the young man with his explanatory smile all my behaviour consists of my feelings  well dont you show your feelings you used to  wasnt it mainly those of disgust nash asked those operate no longer ive closed that window  do you mean you like everything  dear me no but i look only at what i do like  do you mean that youve lost the noble faculty of disgust  i havent the least idea i never try it my dear fellow said gabriel nash weve only one life that we know anything about fancy taking it up with disagreeable impressions when then shall we go in for the agreeable  what do you mean by the agreeable nick demanded  oh the happy moments of our consciousnessthe multiplication of those moments we must save as many as possible from the dark gulf  nick had excited surprise on the part of his sister but it was now biddys turn to make him open his eyes a little she raised her sweet voice in appeal to the stranger  dont you think there are any wrongs in the worldany abuses and sufferings  oh so many so many thats why one must choose  choose to stop them to reform themisnt that the choice biddy asked thats nicks she added blushing and looking at this personage  ah our divergenceyes mr nash sighed there are all kinds of machinery for thatvery complicated and ingenious your formulas my dear dormer your formulas  hang em i havent got any nick now bravely declared  to me personally the simplest ways are those that appeal most mr nash went on we pay too much attention to the ugly we notice it we magnify it the great thing is to leave it alone and encourage the beautiful  you must be very sure you get hold of the beautiful said nick  ah precisely and thats just the importance of the faculty of appreciation we must train our special sense its capable of extraordinary extension lifes none too long for that  but whats the good of the extraordinary extension if there is no affirmation of it if it all goes to the negative as you say where are the fine consequences dormer asked  in ones own spirit one is ones self a fine consequence thats the most important one we have to do with i am a fine consequence said gabriel nash  biddy rose from the bench at this and stepped away a little as to look at a piece of statuary but she had not gone far before pausing and turning she bent her eyes on the speaker with a heightened colour an air of desperation and the question after a moment are you then an æsthete  ah theres one of the formulas thats walking in ones hat ive no profession my dear young lady ive no état civil these things are a part of the complicated ingenious machinery as i say i keep to the simplest way i find that gives one enough to do merely to be is such a métier to live such an art to feel such a career  bridget dormer turned her back and examined her statue and her brother said to his old friend and to write  to write oh i shall never do it again  youve done it almost well enough to be inconsistent that book of yours is anything but negative its complicated and ingenious  my dear fellow im extremely ashamed of that book said gabriel nash  ah call yourself a bloated buddhist and have done with it his companion exclaimed  have done with it i havent the least desire to have done with it and why should one call ones self anything one only deprives other people of their dearest occupation let me add that you dont begin to have an insight into the art of life till it ceases to be of the smallest consequence to you what you may be called thats rudimentary  but if you go in for shades you must also go in for names you must distinguish nick objected the observers nothing without his categories his types and varieties  ah trust him to distinguish said gabriel nash sweetly thats for his own convenience he has privately a terminology to meet it thats ones style but from the moment its for the convenience of others the signs have to be grosser the shades begin to go thats a deplorable hour literature you see is for the convenience of others it requires the most abject concessions it plays such mischief with ones style that really ive had to give it up  and politics nick asked  well what about them was mr nashs reply with a special cadence as he watched his friends sister who was still examining her statue biddy was divided between irritation and curiosity she had interposed space but she had not gone beyond earshot nicks question made her curiosity throb as a rejoinder to his friends words  that no doubt youll say is still far more for the convenience of othersis still worse for ones style  biddy turned round in time to hear mr nash answer it has simply nothing in life to do with shades i cant say worse for it than that  biddy stepped nearer at this and drew still further on her courage wont mamma be waiting oughtnt we to go to luncheon  both the young men looked up at her and mr nash broke out you ought to protest you ought to save him  to save him biddy echoed  he had a style upon my word he had but ive seen it go ive read his speeches  you were capable of that nick laughed  for you yes but it was like listening to a nightingale in a brass band  i think they were beautiful biddy declared  her brother got up at this tribute and mr nash rising too said with his bright colloquial air but miss dormer he had eyes he was made to seeto see all over to see everything there are so few like that  i think he still sees biddy returned wondering a little why nick didnt defend himself  he sees his side his dreadful side dear young lady poor man fancy your having a sideyou youand spending your days and your nights looking at it id as soon pass my life looking at an advertisement on a hoarding  you dont see me some day a great statesman said nick  my dear fellow its exactly what ive a terror of  mercy dont you admire them biddy cried  its a trade like another and a method of making ones way which society certainly condones but when one can be something better  why what in the world is better biddy asked  the young man gasped and nick replying for him said gabriel nash is better you must come and lunch with us i must keep youi must he added  we shall save him yet mr nash kept on easily to biddy while they went and the girl wondered still more what her mother would make of him     iii   after her companions left her lady agnes rested for five minutes in silence with her elder daughter at the end of which time she observed i suppose one must have food at any rate and getting up quitted the place where they had been sitting and where are we to go i hate eating out of doors she went on  dear me when one comes to paris grace returned in a tone apparently implying that in so rash an adventure one must be prepared for compromises and concessions the two ladies wandered to where they saw a large sign of buffet suspended in the air entering a precinct reserved for little whiteclothed tables strawcovered chairs and longaproned waiters one of these functionaries approached them with eagerness and with a mesdames sont seules receiving in return from her ladyship the slightly snappish announcement non nous sommes beaucoup he introduced them to a table larger than most of the others and under his protection they took their places at it and began rather languidly and vaguely to consider the question of the repast the waiter had placed a carte in lady agness hands and she studied it through her eyeglass with a failure of interest while he enumerated with professional fluency the resources of the establishment and grace watched the people at the other tables she was hungry and had already broken a morsel from a long glazed roll  not cold beef and pickles you know she observed to her mother lady agnes gave no heed to this profane remark but dropped her eyeglass and laid down the greasy document what does it signify i daresay its all nasty grace continued and she added inconsequently if peter comes hes sure to be particular  let him first be particular to come her ladyship exclaimed turning a cold eye upon the waiter  poulet chasseur filets mignons sauce bearnaise the man suggested  youll give us what i tell you said lady agnes and she mentioned with distinctness and authority the dishes of which she desired that the meal should be composed he interjected three or four more suggestions but as they produced absolutely no impression on her he became silent and submissive doing justice apparently to her ideas for lady agnes had ideas and though it had suited her humour ten minutes before to profess herself helpless in such a case the manner in which she imposed them on the waiter as original practical and economical showed the high executive woman the mother of children the daughter of earls the consort of an official the dispenser of hospitality looking back upon a lifetime of luncheons she carried many cares and the feeding of multitudesshe was honourably conscious of having fed them decently as she had always done everythinghad ever been one of them everythings absurdly dear she remarked to her daughter as the waiter went away to this remark grace made no answer she had been used for a long time back to hearing that everything was very dear it was what one always expected so she found the case herself but she was silent and inventive about it and nothing further passed in the way of conversation with her mother while they waited for the latters orders to be executed till lady agnes reflected audibly he makes me unhappy the way he talks about julia  sometimes i think he does it to torment one one cant mention her grace responded  its better not to mention her but to leave it alone  yet he never mentions her of himself  in some cases thats supposed to show that people like peoplethough of course something mores required to prove it lady agnes continued to meditate sometimes i think hes thinking of her then at others i cant fancy what hes thinking of  it would be awfully suitable said grace biting her roll  her companion had a pause as if looking for some higher ground to put it upon then she appeared to find this loftier level in the observation of course he must like herhe has known her always  nothing can be plainer than that she likes him grace opined  poor julia lady agnes almost wailed and her tone suggested that she knew more about that than she was ready to state  it isnt as if she wasnt clever and well read her daughter went on if there were nothing else there would be a reason in her being so interested in politics in everything that he is  ah what nick isthats what i sometimes wonder  grace eyed her parent in some despair why mother isnt he going to be like papa she waited for an answer that didnt come after which she pursued i thought you thought him so like him already  well i dont said lady agnes quietly  who is then certainly percy isnt  lady agnes was silent a space theres no one like your father  dear papa grace handsomely concurred then with a rapid transition it would be so jolly for all of usshed be so nice to us  shes that alreadyin her way said lady agnes conscientiously having followed the return quick as it was much good does it do her and she reproduced the note of her bitterness of a moment before  it does her some good that one should look out for her i do and i think she knows it grace declared one can at any rate keep other women off  dont meddleyoure very clumsy was her mothers not particularly sympathetic rejoinder there are other women who are beautiful and there are others who are clever and rich  yes but not all in one thats whats so nice in julia her fortune would be thrown in he wouldnt appear to have married her for it  if he does he wont said lady agnes a trifle obscurely  yes thats whats so charming and he could do anything then couldnt he  well your father had no fortune to speak of  yes but didnt uncle percy help him  his wife helped him said lady agnes  dear mammathe girl was prompt theres one thing she added that mr carteret will always help nick  what do you mean by always  why whether he marries julia or not  things arent so easy lady agnes judged it will all depend on nicks behaviour he can stop it tomorrow  grace dormer stared she evidently thought mr carterets beneficence a part of the scheme of nature how could he stop it  by not being serious it isnt so hard to prevent people giving you money  serious grace repeated does he want him to be a prig like lord egbert  yesthats exactly what he wants and what hell do for him hell do for him only if he marries julia  has he told you grace inquired and then before her mother could answer im delighted at that she cried  he hasnt told me but thats the way things happen lady agnes was less optimistic than her daughter and such optimism as she cultivated was a thin tissue with the sense of things as they are showing through if nick becomes rich charles carteret will make him more so if he doesnt he wont give him a shilling  oh mamma grace demurred  its all very well to say that in public life money isnt as necessary as it used to be her ladyship went on broodingly those who say so dont know anything about it its always intensely necessary  her daughter visibly affected by the gloom of her manner felt impelled to evoke as a corrective a more cheerful idea i daresay but theres the factisnt therethat poor papa had so little  yes and theres the fact that it killed him  these words came out with a strange quick little flare of passion they startled grace dormer who jumped in her place and gasped oh mother the next instant however she added in a different voice oh peter for with an air of eagerness a gentleman was walking up to them  how dye do cousin agnes how dye do little grace peter sherringham laughed and shook hands with them and three minutes later was settled in his chair at their table on which the first elements of the meal had been placed explanations on one side and the other were demanded and produced from which it appeared that the two parties had been in some degree at crosspurposes the day before lady agnes and her companions travelled to paris sherringham had gone to london for fortyeight hours on private business of the ambassadors arriving on his return by the nighttrain only early that morning there had accordingly been a delay in his receiving nick dormers two notes if nick had come to the embassy in personhe might have done him the honour to callhe would have learned that the second secretary was absent lady agnes was not altogether successful in assigning a motive to her sons neglect of this courteous form she could but say i expected him i wanted him to go and indeed not hearing from you he would have gone immediatelyan hour or two hence on leaving this place but were here so quietlynot to go out not to seem to appeal to the ambassador nick put it sooh mother well keep out of it a friendly note will do i dont know definitely what he wanted to keep out of unless anything like gaiety the embassy isnt gay i know but im sure his note was friendly wasnt it i daresay youll see for yourself hes different directly he gets abroad he doesnt seem to care lady agnes paused a moment not carrying out this particular elucidation then she resumed he said youd have seen julia and that youd understand everything from her and when i asked how shed know he said oh she knows everything  he never said a word to me about julia peter sherringham returned lady agnes and her daughter exchanged a glance at this the latter had already asked three times where julia was and her ladyship dropped that they had been hoping she would be able to come with peter the young man set forth that she was at the moment at an hotel in the rue de la paix but had only been there since that morning he had seen her before proceeding to the champs elysées she had come up to paris by an early train she had been staying at versailles of all places in the world she had been a week in paris on her return from cannesher stay there had been of nearly a month fancyand then had gone out to versailles to see mrs billinghurst perhaps theyd remember her poor dallows sister she was staying there to teach her daughters frenchshe had a dozen or twoand julia had spent three days with her she was to return to england about the twentyfifth it would make seven weeks she must have been away from towna rare thing for her she usually stuck to it so in summer  three days with mrs billinghursthow very goodnatured of her lady agnes commented  oh theyre very nice to her sherringham said  well i hope so grace dormer exhaled why didnt you make her come here  i proposed it but she wouldnt another eyebeam at this passed between the two ladies and peter went on she said you must come and see her at the hôtel de hollande  of course well do that lady agnes declared nick went to ask about her at the westminster  she gave that up they wouldnt give her the rooms she wanted her usual set  shes delightfully particular grace said complacently then she added she does like pictures doesnt she  peter sherringham stared oh i daresay but thats not what she has in her head this morning she has some news from londonshes immensely excited  what has she in her head lady agnes asked  whats her news from london grace added  she wants nick to stand  nick to stand both ladies cried  she undertakes to bring him in for harsh mr pinks is deadthe fellow you know who got the seat at the general election he dropped down in londondisease of the heart or something of that sort julia has her telegram but i see it was in last nights papers  imaginenick never mentioned it said lady agnes  dont you know motherabroad he only reads foreign papers  oh i know ive no patience with him her ladyship continued dear julia  its a nasty little place and pinks had a tight squeeze107 or something of that sort but if it returned a liberal a year ago very likely it will do so again julia at any rate believes it can be made toif the mans nickand is ready to take the order to put him in  im sure if she can do it she will grace pronounced  dear dear julia and nick can do something for himself said the mother of this candidate  ive no doubt he can do anything peter sherringham returned goodnaturedly then do you mean in expenses he inquired  ah im afraid he cant do much in expenses poor dear boy and its dreadful how little we can look to percy  well i daresay you may look to julia i think thats her idea  delightful julia lady agnes broke out if poor sir nicholas could have known of course he must go straight home she added  he wont like that said grace  then hell have to go without liking it  it will rather spoil your little excursion if youve only just come peter suggested to say nothing of the great biddys if shes enjoying paris  we may stay perhapswith julia to protect us said lady agnes  ah she wont stay shell go over for her man  her man  the fellow who stands whoever he isespecially if hes nick these last words caused the eyes of peter sherringhams companions to meet again and he went on shell go straight down to harsh  wonderful julia lady agnes panted of course nick must go straight there too  well i suppose he must see first if theyll have him  if theyll have him why how can he tell till he tries  i mean the people at headquarters the fellows who arrange it  lady agnes coloured a little my dear peter do you suppose there will be the least doubt of their having the son of his father  of course its a great name cousin agnesa very great name  one of the greatest simply lady agnes smiled  its the best name in the world said grace more emphatically  all the same it didnt prevent his losing his seat  by halfadozen votes it was too odious her ladyship cried  i rememberi remember and in such a case as that why didnt they immediately put him in somewhere else  how one sees you live abroad dear peter there happens to have been the most extraordinary lack of openingsi never saw anything like itfor a year theyve had their hand on him keeping him all ready i daresay theyve telegraphed him  and he hasnt told you  lady agnes faltered hes so very odd when hes abroad  at home too he lets things go grace interposed he does so littletakes no trouble her mother suffered this statement to pass unchallenged and she pursued philosophically i suppose its because he knows hes so clever  so he is dear old man but what does he do what has he been doing in a positive way  he has been painting  ah not seriously lady agnes protested  thats the worst way said peter sherringham good things  neither of the ladies made a direct response to this but lady agnes said he has spoken repeatedly theyre always calling on him  he speaks magnificently grace attested  thats another of the things i lose living in far countries and hes doing the salon now with the great biddy  just the things in this part i cant think what keeps them so long lady agnes groaned did you ever see such a dreadful place  sherringham stared arent the things good i had an idea  good cried lady agnes theyre too odious too wicked  ah laughed peter thats what people fall into if they live abroad the french oughtnt to live abroad  here they come grace announced at this point but theyve got a strange man with them  thats a bore when we want to talk lady agnes sighed  peter got up in the spirit of welcome and stood a moment watching the others approach there will be no difficulty in talking to judge by the gentleman he dropped and while he remains so conspicuous our eyes may briefly rest on him he was middling high and was visibly a representative of the nervous rather than of the phlegmatic branch of his race he had an oval face fine firm features and a complexion that tended to the brown brown were his eyes and women thought them soft dark brown his hair in which the same critics sometimes regretted the absence of a little undulation it was perhaps to conceal this plainness that he wore it very short his teeth were white his moustache was pointed and so was the small beard that adorned the extremity of his chin his face expressed intelligence and was very much alive it had the further distinction that it often struck superficial observers with a certain foreignness of cast the deeper sort however usually felt it latently english enough there was an idea that having taken up the diplomatic career and gone to live in strange lands he cultivated the mask of an alien an italian or a spaniard of an alien in time evenone of the wonderful ubiquitous diplomatic agents of the sixteenth century in fact none the less it would have been impossible to be more modern than peter sherringhammore of ones class and ones country but this didnt prevent several stray personsbridget dormer for instancefrom admiring the hue of his cheek for its olive richness and his moustache and beard for their resemblance to those of charles i at the same timeshe rather jumbled her comparisonsshe thought he recalled a titian     iv   peters meeting with nick was of the friendliest on both sides involving a great many dear fellows and old boys and his salutation to the younger of the miss dormers consisted of the frankest delighted to see you my dear bid there was no kissing but there was cousinship in the air of a conscious living kind as gabriel nash doubtless quickly noted hovering for a moment outside the group biddy said nothing to peter sherringham but there was no flatness in a silence which heaved as it were with the fairest physiognomic portents nick introduced gabriel nash to his mother and to the other two as a delightful old friend whom he had just come across and sherringham acknowledged the act by saying to mr nash but as if rather less for his sake than for that of the presenter ive seen you very often before  ah repetitionrecurrence we havent yet in the study of how to live abolished that clumsiness have we mr nash genially inquired its a poverty in the supernumeraries of our stage that we dont pass once for all but come round and cross again like a procession or an army at the theatre its a sordid economy that ought to have been managed better the right thing would be just one appearance and the procession regardless of expense for ever and for ever different the company was occupied in placing itself at table so that the only disengaged attention for the moment was graces to whom as her eyes rested on him the young man addressed these last words with a smile alas its a very shabby idea isnt it the world isnt got up regardless of expense  grace looked quickly away from him and said to her brother nick mr pinks is dead  mr pinks asked gabriel nash appearing to wonder where he should sit  the member for harsh and julia wants you to stand the girl went on  mr pinks the member for harsh what names to be sure gabriel mused cheerfully still unseated  julia wants me im much obliged to her nick absently said nash please sit by my mother with peter on her other side  my dear it isnt julialady agnes spoke earnestly every one wants you havent you heard from your people didnt you know the seat was vacant  nick was looking round the table to see what was on it upon my word i dont remember what else have you ordered mother  theres some boeuf braisé my dear and afterwards some galantine heres a dish of eggs with asparagustips  i advise you to go in for it nick said peter sherringham to whom the preparation in question was presented  into the eggs with asparagustips donnez men sil vous plaît my dear fellow how can i stand how can i sit wheres the money to come from  the money why from jul grace began but immediately caught her mothers eye  poor julia how you do work her nick exclaimed nash i recommend you the asparagustips mother hes my best frienddo look after him  ive an impression ive breakfastedim not sure nash smiled  with those beautiful ladies try againyoull find out  the money can be managed the expenses are very small and the seats certain lady agnes pursued not apparently heeding her sons injunction in respect to nash  ratherif julia goes down her elder daughter exclaimed  perhaps julia wont go down nick answered humorously  biddy was seated next to mr nash so that she could take occasion to ask who are the beautiful ladies as if she failed to recognise her brothers allusion in reality this was an innocent trick she was more curious than she could have given a suitable reason for about the odd women from whom her neighbour had lately separated  deluded misguided infatuated persons mr nash replied understanding that she had asked for a description strange eccentric almost romantic types predestined victims simpleminded sacrificial lambs  this was copious yet it was vague so that biddy could only respond oh all that but meanwhile peter sherringham said to nick julias here you know you must go and see her  nick looked at him an instant rather hard as if to say you too but peters eyes appeared to answer no no not i upon which his cousin rejoined of course ill go and see her ill go immediately please to thank her for thinking of me  thinking of you there are plenty to think of you lady agnes said there are sure to be telegrams at home we must go backwe must go back  we must go back to england nick dormer asked and as his mother made no answer he continued do you mean i must go to harsh  her ladyship evaded this question inquiring of mr nash if he would have a morsel of fish but her gain was small for this gentleman struck again by the unhappy name of the bereaved constituency only broke out ah what a place to represent how can youhow can you  its an excellent place said lady agnes coldly i imagine youve never been there its a very good place indeed it belongs very largely to my cousin mrs dallow  gabriel partook of the fish listening with interest but i thought we had no more pocketboroughs  its pockets we rather lack so many of us there are plenty of harshes nick dormer observed  i dont know what you mean lady agnes said to nash with considerable majesty  peter sherringham also addressed him with an oh its all right they come down on you like a shot and the young man continued ingenuously  do you mean to say youve to pay money to get into that awful placethat its not you who are paid  into that awful place lady agnes repeated blankly  into the house of commons that you dont get a high salary  my dear nash youre delightful dont leave medont leave me nick cried while his mother looked at him with an eye that demanded who in the worlds this extraordinary person  what then did you think pocketboroughs were peter sherringham asked  mr nashs facial radiance rested on him why boroughs that filled your pocket to do that sort of thing without a bribecest trop fort  he lives at samarcand nick dormer explained to his mother who flushed perceptibly what do you advise me ill do whatever you say he went on to his old acquaintance  my dear my dear lady agnes pleaded  see julia first with all respect to mr nash shes of excellent counsel said peter sherringham  mr nash smiled across the table at his host the lady firstthe lady first ive not a word to suggest as against any idea of hers  we mustnt sit here too long therell be so much to do said lady agnes anxiously perceiving a certain slowness in the service of the boeuf braisé  biddy had been up to this moment mainly occupied in looking covertly and in snatches at peter sherringham as was perfectly lawful in a young lady with a handsome cousin whom she had not seen for more than a year but her sweet voice now took license to throw in the words we know what mr nash thinks of politics he told us just now he thinks them dreadful  no not dreadfulonly inferior the personage impugned protested everythings relative  inferior to what lady agnes demanded  mr nash appeared to consider a moment to anything else that may be in question  nothing else is in question said her ladyship in a tone that would have been triumphant if it had not been so dry  ah then and her neighbour shook his head sadly he turned after this to biddy the ladies whom i was with just now and in whom you were so good as to express an interest biddy gave a sign of assent and he went on theyre persons theatrical the younger ones trying to go upon the stage  and are you assisting her biddy inquired pleased she had guessed so nearly right  not in the leastim rather choking her off i consider it the lowest of the arts  lower than politics asked peter sherringham who was listening to this  dear no i wont say that i think the théâtre français a greater institution than the house of commons  i agree with you there laughed sherringham all the more that i dont consider the dramatic art a low one it seems to me on the contrary to include all the others  yesthats a view i think its the view of my friends  of your friends  two ladiesold acquaintanceswhom i met in paris a week ago and whom ive just been spending an hour with in this place  you should have seen them they struck me very much biddy said to her cousin  i should like to see them if they really have anything to say to the theatre  it can easily be managed do you believe in the theatre asked gabriel nash  passionately sherringham confessed dont you  before nash had had time to answer biddy had interposed with a sigh how i wish i could gobut in paris i cant  ill take you biddyi vow ill take you  but the plays peter the girl objected mamma says theyre worse than the pictures  oh well arrange that they shall do one at the français on purpose for a delightful little yearning english girl  can you make them  i can make them do anything i choose  ah then its the theatre that believes in you said mr nash  it would be ungrateful if it didnt after all ive done for it sherringham gaily opined  lady agnes had withdrawn herself from between him and her other guest and to signify that she at least had finished eating had gone to sit by her son whom she held with some importunity in conversation but hearing the theatre talked of she threw across an impersonal challenge to the paradoxical young man pray should you think it better for a gentleman to be an actor  better than being a politician ah comedian for comedian isnt the actor more honest  lady agnes turned to her son and brought forth with spirit think of your great father nicholas  he was an honest man said nicholas thats perhaps why he couldnt stand it  peter sherringham judged the colloquy to have taken an uncomfortable twist though not wholly as it seemed to him by the act of nicks queer comrade to draw it back to safer ground he said to this personage may i ask if the ladies you just spoke of are englishmrs and miss rooth isnt that the rather odd name  the very same only the daughter according to her kind desires to be known by some nom de guerre before she has even been able to enlist  and what does she call herself bridget dormer asked  maud vavasour or edith temple or gladys vanesome rubbish of that sort  what then is her own name  miriammiriam rooth it would do very well and would give her the benefit of the prepossessing fact thatto the best of my belief at leastshes more than half a jewess  it is as good as rachel felix sherringham said  the names as good but not the talent the girls splendidly stupid  and more than half a jewess dont you believe it sherringham laughed  dont believe shes a jewess biddy asked still more interested in miriam rooth  no nothat shes stupid really if she is shell be the first  ah you may judge for yourself nash rejoined if youll come tomorrow afternoon to madame carré rue de constantinople à lentresol  madame carré why ive already a note from heri found it this morning on my return to parisasking me to look in at five oclock and listen to a jeune anglaise  thats my arrangementi obtained the favour the ladies want an opinion and dear old carré has consented to see them and to give one maud vavasour will recite and the venerable artist will pass judgement  sherringham remembered he had his note in his pocket and took it out to look it over she wishes to make her a little audienceshe says shell do better with thatand she asks me because im english i shall make a point of going  and bring dormer if you can the audience will be better will you come dormer mr nash continued appealing to his friendwill you come with me to hear an english amateur recite and an old french actress pitch into her  nick looked round from his talk with his mother and grace ill go anywhere with you so that as ive told you i maynt lose sight of youmay keep hold of you  poor mr nash why is he so useful lady agnes took a cold freedom to inquire  he steadies me mother  oh i wish youd take me peter biddy broke out wistfully to her cousin  to spend an hour with an old french actress do you want to go upon the stage the young man asked  no but i want to see somethingto know something  madame carrés wonderful in her way but shes hardly company for a little english girl  im not little im only too big and she goes the person you speak of  for a professional purpose and with her good mother smiled mr nash i think lady agnes would hardly venture  oh ive seen her good mother said biddy as if she had her impression of what the worth of that protection might be  yes but you havent heard her its then that you measure her  biddy was wistful still is it the famous honorine carré the great celebrity  honorine in person the incomparable the perfect said peter sherringham the first artist of our time taking her altogether she and i are old pals she has been so good as to come and say thingswhich she does sometimes still dans le monde as no one else can in my rooms  make her come then we can go there  one of these days  and the young ladymiriam maud gladysmake her come too  sherringham looked at nash and the latter was bland oh youll have no difficulty shell jump at it  very good ill give a little artistic teawith julia too of course and you must come mr nash this gentleman promised with an inclination and peter continued but if as you say youre not for helping the young lady how came you to arrange this interview with the great model  precisely to stop her short the great model will find her very bad her judgements as you probably know are rhadamanthine  unfortunate creature said biddy i think youre cruel  never mindill look after them sherringham laughed  and how can madame carré judge if the girl recites english  shes so intelligent that she could judge if she recited chinese peter declared  thats true but the jeune anglaise recites also in french said gabriel nash  then she isnt stupid  and in italian and in several more tongues for aught i know  sherringham was visibly interested very goodwell put her through them all  she must be most clever biddy went on yearningly  she has spent her life on the continent she has wandered about with her mother she has picked up things  and is she a lady biddy asked  oh tremendous the great ones of the earth on the mothers side on the fathers on the other hand i imagine only a jew stockbroker in the city  then theyre richor ought to be sherringham suggested  ought to beah theres the bitterness the stockbroker had too short a gohe was carried off in his flower however he left his wife a certain property which she appears to have muddled away not having the safeguard of being herself a hebrew this is what she has lived on till todaythis and another resource her husband as she has often told me had the artistic temperament thats common as you know among ces messieurs he made the most of his little opportunities and collected various pictures tapestries enamels porcelains and similar gewgaws he parted with them also i gather at a profit in short he carried on a neat little business as a brocanteur it was nipped in the bud but mrs rooth was left with a certain number of these articles in her hands indeed they must have formed her only capital she was not a woman of business she turned them no doubt to indifferent account but she sold them piece by piece and they kept her going while her daughter grew up it was to this precarious traffic conducted with extraordinary mystery and delicacy that five years ago in florence i was indebted for my acquaintance with her in those days i used to collectheaven help mei used to pick up rubbish which i could ill afford it was a little phasewe have our little phases havent we mr nash asked with childlike trustand ive come out on the other side mrs rooth had an old green pot and i heard of her old green pot to hear of it was to long for it so that i went to see it under cover of night i bought it and a couple of years ago i overturned and smashed it it was the last of the little phase it was not however as youve seen the last of mrs rooth i met her afterwards in london and i found her a year or two ago in venice she appears to be a great wanderer she had other old pots of other colours red yellow black or blueshe could produce them of any complexion you liked i dont know whether she carried them about with her or whether she had little secret stores in the principal cities of europe today at any rate they seem all gone on the other hand she has her daughter who has grown up and whos a precious vase of another kindless fragile i hope than the rest may she not be overturned and smashed  peter sherringham and biddy dormer listened with attention to this history and the girl testified to the interest with which she had followed it by saying when mr nash had ceased speaking a jewish stockbroker a dealer in curiosities what an odd person to marryfor a person who was well born i daresay he was a german  his name must have been simply roth and the poor lady to smarten it up has put in another o sherringham ingeniously suggested  youre both very clever said gabriel and rudolf roth as i happen to know was indeed the designation of maud vavasours papa but so far as the question of derogation goes one might as well drown as starvefor what connexion is not a misalliance when one happens to have the unaccommodating the crushing honour of being a nevillenugent of castle nugent thats the high lineage of mauds mamma i seem to have heard it mentioned that rudolf roth was very versatile and like most of his species not unacquainted with the practice of music he had been employed to teach the harmonium to miss nevillenugent and she had profited by his lessons if his daughters like himand shes not like her motherhe was darkly and dangerously handsome so i venture rapidly to reconstruct the situation  a silence for the moment had fallen on lady agnes and her other two children so that mr nash with his universal urbanity practically addressed these last remarks to them as well as to his other auditors lady agnes looked as if she wondered whom he was talking about and having caught the name of a noble residence she inquired castle nugentwhere in the worlds that  its a domain of immeasurable extent and almost inconceivable splendour but i fear not to be found in any prosaic earthly geography lady agnes rested her eyes on the tablecloth as if she werent sure a liberty had not been taken with her or at least with her order and while mr nash continued to abound in descriptive suppositionsit must be on the banks of the manzanares or the guadalquivirpeter sherringham whose imagination had seemingly been kindled by the sketch of miriam rooth took up the argument and reminded him that he had a short time before assigned a low place to the dramatic art and had not yet answered the question as to whether he believed in the theatre which gave the speaker a further chance i dont know that i understand your question there are different ways of taking it do i think its important is that what you mean important certainly to managers and stagecarpenters who want to make money to ladies and gentlemen who want to produce themselves in public by limelight and to other ladies and gentlemen who are bored and stupid and dont know what to do with their evening its a commercial and social convenience which may be infinitely worked but important artistically intellectually how can it beso poor so limited a form  upon my honour it strikes me as rich and various do you think its a poor and limited form nick sherringham added appealing to his kinsman  i think whatever nash thinks ive no opinion today but his  this answer of the hope of the dormers drew the eyes of his mother and sisters to him and caused his friend to exclaim that he wasnt used to such responsibilitiesso few people had ever tested his presence of mind by agreeing with him oh i used to be of your way of feeling nash went on to sherringham i understand you perfectly its a phase like another ive been through itjai été comme ça  and you went then very often to the théâtre français and it was there i saw you i place you now  im afraid i noticed none of the other spectators nash explained i had no attention but for the great carréshe was still on the stage judge of my infatuation and how i can allow for yours when i tell you that i sought her acquaintance that i couldnt rest till i had told her how i hung upon her lips  thats just what i told her sherringham returned  she was very kind to me she said vous me rendez des forces  thats just what she said to me  and weve remained very good friends  so have we laughed sherringham and such perfect art as hersdo you mean to say you dont consider that important such a rare dramatic intelligence  im afraid you read the feuilletons you catch their phrasesnash spoke with pity dramatic intelligence is never rare nothings more common  then why have we so many shocking actors  have we i thought they were mostly good succeeding more easily and more completely in that business than in anything else what could they dothose people generallyif they didnt do that poor thing and reflect that the poor thing enables them to succeed of course always there are numbers of people on the stage who are no actors at all for its even easier to our poor humanity to be ineffectively stupid and vulgar than to bring down the house  its not easy by what i can see to produce completely any artistic effect sherringham declared and those the actor produces are among the most momentous we know youll not persuade me that to watch such an actress as madame carré wasnt an education of the taste an enlargement of ones knowledge  she did what she could poor woman but in what belittling coarsening conditions she had to interpret a character in a play and a character in a playnot to say the whole piece i speak more particularly of modern piecesis such a wretchedly small peg to hang anything on the dramatist shows us so little is so hampered by his audience is restricted to so poor an analysis  i know the complaint its all the fashion now the raffinés despise the theatre said peter sherringham in the manner of a man abreast with the culture of his age and not to be captured by a surprise connu connu  it will be known better yet wont it when the essentially brutal nature of the modern audience is still more perceived when it has been properly analysed the omnium gatherum of the population of a big commercial city at the hour of the day when their taste is at its lowest flocking out of hideous hotels and restaurants gorged with food stultified with buying and selling and with all the other sordid preoccupations of the age squeezed together in a sweltering mass disappointed in their seats timing the author timing the actor wishing to get their money back on the spotall before eleven oclock fancy putting the exquisite before such a tribunal as that theres not even a question of it the dramatist wouldnt if he could and in nine cases out of ten he couldnt if he would he has to make the basest concessions one of his principal canons is that he must enable his spectators to catch the suburban trains which stop at 1130 what would you think of any other artistthe painter or the novelistwhose governing forces should be the dinner and the suburban trains the old dramatists didnt defer to themnot so much at leastand thats why theyre less and less actable if theyre touchedthe large loose menits only to be mutilated and trivialised besides they had a simpler civilisation to representsocieties in which the life of man was in action in passion in immediate and violent expression those things could be put upon the playhouse boards with comparatively little sacrifice of their completeness and their truth today were so infinitely more reflective and complicated and diffuse that it makes all the difference what can you do with a character with an idea with a feeling between dinner and the suburban trains you can give a gross rough sketch of them but how little you touch them how bald you leave them what crudity compared with what the novelist does  do you write novels mr nash peter candidly asked  no but i read them when theyre extraordinarily good and i dont go to plays i read balzac for instancei encounter the admirable portrait of valérie marneffe in la cousine bette  and you contrast it with the poverty of emile augiers séraphine in les lionnes pauvres i was awaiting you there thats the cheval de bataille of you fellows  what an extraordinary discussion what dreadful authors lady agnes murmured to her son but he was listening so attentively to the other young men that he made no response and peter sherringham went on  ive seen madame carré in things of the modern repertory which she has made as vivid to me caused to abide as ineffaceably in my memory as valérie marneffe shes the balzac as one may say of actresses  the miniaturist as it were of whitewashers nash offered as a substitute  it might have been guessed that sherringham resented his damned freedom yet could but emulate his easy form youd be magnanimous if you thought the young lady youve introduced to our old friend would be important  mr nash lightly weighed it she might be much more so than she ever will be  lady agnes however got up to terminate the scene and even to signify that enough had been said about people and questions she had never so much as heard of every one else rose the waiter brought nicholas the receipt of the bill and sherringham went on to his interlocutor perhaps shell be more so than you think  perhapsif you take an interest in her  a mystic voice seems to exhort me to do so to whisper that though ive never seen her i shall find something in her on which peter appealed what do you say biddyshall i take an interest in her  the girl faltered coloured a little felt a certain embarrassment in being publicly treated as an oracle if shes not nice i dont advise it  and if she is nice  you advise it still less her brother exclaimed laughing and putting his arm round her  lady agnes looked sombreshe might have been saying to herself heaven help us what chance has a girl of mine with a man whos so agog about actresses she was disconcerted and distressed a multitude of incongruous things all the morning had been forced upon her attentiondispleasing pictures and still more displeasing theories about them vague portents of perversity on nicks part and a strange eagerness on peters learned apparently in paris to discuss with a person who had a tone she never had been exposed to topics irrelevant and uninteresting almost disgusting the practical effect of which was to make light of her presence let us leave thislet us leave this she grimly said the party moved together toward the door of departure and her ruffled spirit was not soothed by hearing her son remark to his terrible friend you know you dont escape me i stick to you  at this lady agnes broke out and interposed pardon my reminding you that youre going to call on julia  well cant nash also come to call on julia thats just what i wantthat she should see him  peter sherringham came humanely to his kinswomans assistance a better way perhaps will be for them to meet under my auspices at my dramatic tea this will enable me to return one favour for another if mr nash is so good as to introduce me to this aspirant for honours we estimate so differently ill introduce him to my sister a much more positive quantity  its easy to see wholl have the best of it grace dormer declared while nash stood there serenely impartially in a graceful detached way which seemed characteristic of him assenting to any decision that relieved him of the grossness of choice and generally confident that things would turn out well for him he was cheerfully helpless and sociably indifferent ready to preside with a smile even at a discussion of his own admissibility  nick will bring you ive a little corner at the embassy sherringham continued  youre very kind you must bring him then tomorrowrue de constantinople  at five oclockdont be afraid  oh dear biddy wailed as they went on again and lady agnes seizing his arm marched off more quickly with her son when they came out into the champs elysées nick dormer looking round saw his friend had disappeared biddy had attached herself to peter and grace couldnt have encouraged mr nash     v   lady agness idea had been that her son should go straight from the palais de lindustrie to the hôtel de hollande with or without his mother and his sisters as his humour should seem to recommend much as she desired to see their valued julia and as she knew her daughters desired it she was quite ready to put off their visit if this sacrifice should contribute to a speedy confrontation for nick she was anxious he should talk with mrs dallow and anxious he should be anxious himself but it presently appeared that he was conscious of no pressure of eagerness his view was that she and the girls should go to their cousin without delay and should if they liked spend the rest of the day in her society he would go later he would go in the evening there were lots of things he wanted to do meanwhile  this question was discussed with some intensity though not at length while the little party stood on the edge of the place de la concorde to which they had proceeded on foot and lady agnes noticed that the lots of things to which he proposed to give precedence over an urgent duty a conference with a person who held out full hands to him were implied somehow in the friendly glance with which he covered the great square the opposite bank of the seine the steep blue roofs of the quay the bright immensity of paris what in the world could be more important than making sure of his seatso quickly did the good ladys imagination travel and now that idea appealed to him less than a ramble in search of old books and printssince she was sure this was what he had in his head julia would be flattered should she know it but of course she mustnt know it lady agnes was already thinking of the least injurious account she could give of the young mans want of precipitation she would have liked to represent him as tremendously occupied in his room at their own hotel in getting off political letters to every one it should concern and particularly in drawing up his address to the electors of harsh fortunately she was a woman of innumerable discretions and a part of the worn look that sat in her face came from her having schooled herself for years in commerce with her husband and her sons not to insist unduly she would have liked to insist nature had formed her to insist and the selfcontrol had told in more ways than one even now it was powerless to prevent her suggesting that before doing anything else nick should at least repair to the inn and see if there werent some telegrams  he freely consented to do as much as this and having called a cab that she might go her way with the girls kissed her again as he had done at the exhibition this was an attention that could never displease her but somehow when he kissed her she was really the more worried she had come to recognise it as a sign that he was slipping away from her and she wished she might frankly take it as his clutch at her to save him she drove off with a vague sense that at any rate she and the girls might do something toward keeping the place warm for him she had been a little vexed that peter had not administered more of a push toward the hôtel de hollande clear as it had become to her now that there was a foreignness in peter which was not to be counted on and which made him speak of english affairs and even of english domestic politics as local and even funny they were very grandly local and if one recalled in public life an occasional droll incident wasnt that liberally viewed just the warm human comfort of them as she left the two young men standing together in the middle of the place de la concorde the grand composition of which nick as she looked back appeared to have paused to admireas if he hadnt seen it a thousand timesshe wished she might have thought of peters influence with her son as exerted a little more in favour of localism she had a fear he wouldnt abbreviate the boys illtimed flânerie however he had been very nice he had invited them all to dine with him that evening at a convenient café promising to bring julia and one of his colleagues so much as this he had been willing to do to make sure nick and his sister should meet his want of localism moreover was not so great as that if it should turn out that there was anything beneath his manner toward biddy the upshot of this reflexion might have been represented by the circumstance of her ladyships remarking after a minute to her younger daughter who sat opposite her in the voiture de place that it would do no harm if she should get a new hat and that the search might be instituted that afternoon  a french hat mamma said grace oh do wait till she gets home  i think theyre really prettier here you know biddy opined and lady agnes said simply i daresay theyre cheaper what was in her mind in fact was i daresay peter thinks them becoming it will be seen she had plenty of inward occupation the sum of which was not lessened by her learning when she reached the top of the rue de la paix that mrs dallow had gone out half an hour before and had left no message she was more disconcerted by this incident than she could have explained or than she thought was right as she had taken for granted julia would be in a manner waiting for them how could she be sure nick wasnt coming when people were in paris a few days they didnt mope in the house but she might have waited a little longer or have left an explanation was she then not so much in earnest about nicks standing didnt she recognise the importance of being there to see him about it lady agnes wondered if her behaviour were a sign of her being already tired of the way this young gentleman treated her perhaps she had gone out because an instinct told her that the great propriety of their meeting early would make no difference with himtold her he wouldnt after all come his mothers heart sank as she glanced at this possibility that their precious friend was already tired she having on her side an intuition that there were still harder things in store she had disliked having to tell mrs dallow that nick wouldnt see her till the evening but now she disliked still more her not being there to hear it she even resented a little her kinswomans not having reasoned that she and the girls would come in any event and not thought them worth staying in for it came up indeed that she would perhaps have gone to their hotel which was a good way up the rue de rivoli near the palais royalon which the cabman was directed to drive to that establishment  as he jogged along she took in some degree the measure of what that might mean julias seeking a little to avoid them was she growing to dislike them did she think they kept too sharp an eye on her so that the idea of their standing in a still closer relation wouldnt be enticing her conduct up to this time had not worn such an appearance unless perhaps a little just a very little in the matter of her ways with poor grace lady agnes knew she wasnt particularly fond of poor grace and could even sufficiently guess the reasonthe manner in which grace betrayed most how they wanted to make sure of her she remembered how long the girl had stayed the last time she had been at harshgoing for an acceptable week and dragging out her visit to a month she took a private heroic vow that grace shouldnt go near the place again for a year not that is unless nick and julia were married within the time if that were to happen she shouldnt care she recognised that it wasnt absolutely everything julia should be in love with nick it was also better she should dislike his mother and sisters after a probable pursuit of him than before lady agnes did justice to the natural rule in virtue of which it usually comes to pass that a woman doesnt get on with her husbands female belongings and was even willing to be sacrificed to it in her disciplined degree but she desired not to be sacrificed for nothing if she was to be objected to as a motherinlaw she wished to be the motherinlaw first  at the hotel in the rue de rivoli she had the disappointment of finding that mrs dallow had not called and also that no telegrams had come she went in with the girls for half an hour and then straggled out with them again she was undetermined and dissatisfied and the afternoon was rather a problem of the kind moreover that she disliked most and was least accustomed to not a choice between different things to doher life had been full of thatbut a want of anything to do at all nick had said to her before they separated you can knock about with the girls you know everythings amusing here that was easily said while he sauntered and gossiped with peter sherringham and perhaps went to see more pictures like those in the salon he was usually on such occasions very goodnatured about spending his time with them but this episode had taken altogether a perverse profane form she had no desire whatever to knock about and was far from finding everything in paris amusing she had no aptitude for aimlessness and moreover thought it vulgar if she had found julias card at the hotelthe sign of a hope of catching them just as they came back from the salonshe would have made a second attempt to see her before the evening but now certainly they would leave her alone lady agnes wandered joylessly with the girls in the palais royal and the rue de richelieu and emerged upon the boulevard where they continued their frugal prowl as biddy rather irritatingly called it they went into five shops to buy a hat for biddy and her ladyships presumptions of cheapness were woefully belied  who in the worlds your comic friend peter sherringham was meanwhile asking of his kinsman as they walked together  ah theres something else you lost by going to cambridgeyou lost gabriel nash  he sounds like an elizabethan dramatist sherringham said but i havent lost him since it appears now i shant be able to have you without him  oh as for that wait a little im going to try him again but i dont know how he wears what i mean is that youve probably lost his freshness which was the great thing i rather fear hes becoming conventional or at any rate serious  bless me do you call that serious  he used to be so gay he had a real genius for playing with ideas he was a wonderful talker  it seems to me he does very well now said peter sherringham  oh this is nothing he had great flights of old very great flights one saw him rise and rise and turn somersaults in the blueone wondered how far he could go hes very intelligent and i should think it might be interesting to find out what it is that prevents the whole man from being as good as his parts i mean in case he isnt so good  i see you more than suspect that maynt it be simply that hes too great an ass  that would be the wholei shall see in timebut it certainly isnt one of the parts it may be the effect but it isnt the cause and its for the cause i claim an interest do you think him an ass for what he said about the theatrehis pronouncing it a coarse art  to differ from you about him that reason would do said sherringham the only bad one would be one that shouldnt preserve our difference you neednt tell me you agree with him for frankly i dont care  then your passion still burns nick dormer asked  my passion  i dont mean for any individual exponent of the equivocal art mark the guilty conscience mark the rising blush mark the confusion of mind i mean the old sign one knew you best by your permanent stall at the français your inveterate attendance at premières the way you follow the young talents and the old  yes its still my little hobby my little folly if you like sherringham said i dont find i get tired of it what will you have strong predilections are rather a blessing theyre simplifying im fond of representationthe representation of life i like it better i think than the real thing you like it too youd be ready in other conditions to go in for it in your wayso youve no right to cast the stone you like it best done by one vehicle and i by another and our preference on either side has a deep root in us theres a fascination to me in the way the actor does it when his talentah he must have thathas been highly trained ah it must be that the things he can do in this effort at representation with the dramatist to back him seem to me innumerablehe can carry it to a pointand i take great pleasure in observing them in recognising and comparing them its an amusement like anotheri dont pretend to call it by any exalted name but in this vale of friction it will serve one can lose ones self in it and it has the recommendationin common i suppose with the study of the other artsthat the further you go in it the more you find so i go rather far if you will but is it the principal sign one knows me by peter abruptly asked  dont be ashamed of it nick returnedelse it will be ashamed of you i ought to discriminate youre distinguished among my friends and relations by your character of rising young diplomatist but you know i always want the final touch to the picture the last fruit of analysis therefore i make out that youre conspicuous among rising young diplomatists for the infatuation you describe in such pretty terms  you evidently believe it will prevent my ever rising very high but pastime for pastime is it any idler than yours  than mine  why youve halfadozen while i only allow myself the luxury of one for the theatres my sole vice really is this more wanton say than to devote weeks to the consideration of the particular way in which your friend mr nash may be most intensely a twaddler and a bore thats not my ideal of choice recreation but id undertake to satisfy you about him sooner youre a young statesmanwho happens to be an en disponibilité for the momentbut you spend not a little of your time in besmearing canvas with brightcoloured pigments the idea of representation fascinates you but in your case its representation in oilsor do you practise watercolours and pastel too you even go much further than i for i study my art of predilection only in the works of others i dont aspire to leave works of my own youre a painter possibly a great one but im not an actor nick dormer declared he would certainly become onehe was so well on the way to it and sherringham without heeding this charge went on let me add that considering you are a painter your portrait of the complicated nash is lamentably dim  hes not at all complicated hes only too simple to give an account of most people have a lot of attributes and appendages that dress them up and superscribe them and what i like gabriel for is that he hasnt any at all it makes him it keeps him so refreshingly cool  by jove you match him there isnt it an appendage and an attribute to escape kicking how does he manage that sherringham asked  i havent the least ideai dont know that he doesnt rouse the kicking impulse besides he can kick back and i dont think any one has ever seen him duck or dodge his means his profession his belongings have never anything to do with the question he doesnt shade off into other people hes as neat as an outline cut out of paper with scissors i like him therefore because in dealing with him you know what youve got hold of with most men you dont to pick the flower you must break off the whole dusty thorny worldly branch you find youre taking up in your grasp all sorts of other people and things dangling accidents and conditions poor nash has none of those encumbrances hes the solitaryfragrant blossom  my dear fellow youd be better for a little of the same pruning sherringham retorted and the young men continued their walk and their gossip jerking each other this way and that punching each other here and there with an amicable roughness consequent on their having been boys together intimacy had reigned of old between the little sherringhams and the little dormers united in the country by ease of neighbouring and by the fact that there was first cousinship not neglected among the parents lady agnes standing in this plastic relation to lady windrush the mother of peter and julia as well as of other daughters and of a maturer youth who was to inherit and who since then had inherited the ancient barony many things had altered later on but not the good reasons for not explaining one of our young men had gone to eton and the other to harrowthe scattered school on the hill was the tradition of the dormersand the divergence had rather taken its course in university years bricket however had remained accessible to windrush and windrush to bricket to which estate percival dormer had now succeeded terminating the interchange a trifle rudely by letting out that pleasant white house in the midlandsits expropriated inhabitants lady agnes and her daughters adored itto an american reputed rich who in the first flush of his sense of contrasts considered that for twelve hundred a year he got it at a bargain bricket had come to the late sir nicholas from his elder brother dying wifeless and childless the new baronet so different from his fatherthough recalling at some points the uncle after whom he had been namedthat nick had to make it up by cultivating conformity roamed about the world taking shots which excited the enthusiasm of society when society heard of them at the few legitimate creatures of the chase the british rifle had up to that time spared lady agnes meanwhile settled with her girls in a gabled latticed house in a mentionable quarter though it still required a little explaining of the temperate zone of london it was not into her lap poor woman that the revenues of bricket were poured there was no dowerhouse attached to that moderate property and the allowance with which the estate was charged on her ladyships behalf was not an incitement to grandeur  nick had a room under his mothers roof which he mainly used to dress for dinner when dining in calcutta gardens and he had kept on his chambers in the temple for to a young man in public life an independent address was indispensable moreover he was suspected of having a studio in an outoftheway district the indistinguishable parts of south kensington incongruous as such a retreat might seem in the case of a member of parliament it was an absurd place to see his constituents unless he wanted to paint their portraits a kind of representation with which they would scarce have been satisfied and in fact the only question of portraiture had been when the wives and daughters of several of them expressed a wish for the picture of their handsome young member nick had not offered to paint it himself and the studio was taken for granted rather than much looked into by the ladies in calcutta gardens too express a disposition to regard whims of this sort as extravagance pure and simple was known by them to be open to correction for they were not oblivious that mr carteret had humours which weighed against them in the shape of convenient cheques nestling between the inside pages of legible letters of advice mr carteret was nicks providence just as nick was looked to in a general way to be that of his mother and sisters especially since it had become so plain that percy who was not subtly selfish would operate mainly with a sixbore quite out of that sphere it was not for studios certainly that mr carteret sent cheques but they were an expression of general confidence in nick and a little expansion was natural to a young man enjoying such a luxury as that it was sufficiently felt in calcutta gardens that he could be looked to not to betray such confidence for mr carterets behaviour could have no name at all unless one were prepared to call it encouraging he had never promised anything but he was one of the delightful persons with whom the redemption precedes or dispenses with the vow he had been an early and lifelong friend of the late right honourable gentleman a political follower a devoted admirer a stanch supporter in difficult hours he had never married espousing nothing more reproductive than sir nicholass viewshe used to write letters to the times in favour of themand had so far as was known neither chick nor child nothing but an amiable little family of eccentricities the flower of which was his odd taste for living in a small steep clean country town all green gardens and red walls with a girdle of hedgerows all clustered about an immense brown old abbey when lady agness imagination rested upon the future of her second son she liked to remember that mr carteret had nothing to keep up the inference seemed so direct that he would keep up nick  the most important event in the life of this young man had been incomparably his success under his fathers eyes more than two years before in the sharp contest for crockhursta victory which his consecrated name his extreme youth his ardour in the fray the marked personal sympathy of the party and the attention excited by the fresh cleverness of his speeches tinted with young idealism and yet sticking sufficiently to the questionthe burning question which has since burned outhad made quite splendid there had been leaders in the newspapers about it half in compliment to her husband who was known to be failing so prematurelyhe was almost as young to die and to die famous for lady agnes regarded it as famous as his son had been to standtributes the boys mother religiously preserved cut out and tied together with a ribbon in the innermost drawer of a favourite cabinet but it had been a barren or almost a barren triumph for in the order of importance in nicks history another incident had run it as the phrase is very close nothing less than the quick dissolution of the parliament in which he was so manifestly destined to give symptoms of a future he had not recovered his seat at the general election for the second contest was even sharper than the first and the tories had put forward a loud vulgar rattling bullying moneyspending man it was to a certain extent a comfort that poor sir nicholas who had been witness of the bright hour should have passed away before the darkness he died with all his hopes on his second sons head unconscious of near disappointment handing on the torch and the tradition after a long supreme interview with nick at which lady agnes had not been present but which she knew to have been a thorough paternal dedication an august communication of ideas on the highest national questions she had reason to believe he had touched on those of external as well as of domestic and of colonial policy leaving on the boys nature and manner from that moment the most unmistakable traces if his tendency to reverie increased it was because he had so much to think over in what his pale father had said to him in the hushed dim chamber laying on him the great mission that death had cut short breathing into him with unforgettable solemnity the very accentssir nicholass voice had been wonderful for richnessthat he was to sound again it was work cut out for a lifetime and that coordinating power in relation to detail which was one of the great characteristics of the lamented statesmans high distinctionthe most analytic of the weekly papers was always talking about ithad enabled him to rescue the prospect from any shade of vagueness or of ambiguity  five years before nick dormer went up to be questioned by the electors of crockhurst peter sherringham had appeared before a board of examiners who let him off much less easily though there were also some flattering prejudices in his favour such influences being a part of the copious light unembarrassing baggage with which each of the young men began life peter passed however passed high and had his reward in prompt assignment to small subordinate diplomatic duties in germany since then he had had his professional adventures which need not arrest us inasmuch as they had all paled in the light of his appointment nearly three years previous to the moment of our making his acquaintance to a secretaryship of embassy in paris he had done well and had gone fast and for the present could draw his breath at ease it pleased him better to remain in paris as a subordinate than to go to honduras as a principal and nick dormer had not put a false colour on the matter in speaking of his stall at the théâtre français as a sedative to his ambition nicks inferiority in age to his cousin sat on him more lightly than when they had been in their teens and indeed no one can very well be much older than a young man who has figured for a year however imperceptibly in the house of commons separation and diversity had made them reciprocally strange enough to give a price to what they shared they were friends without being particular friends that further degree could always hang before them as a suitable but not oppressive contingency and they were both conscious that it was in their interest to keep certain differences to chaff each other aboutso possible was it that they might have quarrelled if they had had everything in common peter as being wideminded was a little irritated to find his cousin always so intensely british while nick dormer made him the object of the same compassionate criticism recognised in him a rare knack with foreign tongues but reflected and even with extravagance declared that it was a pity to have gone so far from home only to remain so homely moreover nick had his ideas about the diplomatic mind finding in it for his own sympathy always the wrong turn dry narrow barren poor he pronounced it in familiar conversation with the clever secretary wanting in imagination in generosity in the finest perceptions and the highest courage this served as well as anything else to keep the peace between them it was a necessity of their friendly intercourse that they should scuffle a little and it scarcely mattered what they scuffled about nick dormers express enjoyment of paris the shopwindows on the quays the old books on the parapet the gaiety of the river the grandeur of the louvre every fine feature of that prodigious face struck his companion as a sign of insularity the appreciation of such things having become with sherringham an unconscious habit a contented assimilation if poor nick for the hour was demonstrative and lyrical it was because he had no other way of sounding the note of farewell to the independent life of which the term seemed now definitely in sightthe sense so pressed upon him that these were the last moments of his freedom he would waste time till halfpast seven because halfpast seven meant dinner and dinner meant his mother solemnly attended by the strenuous shade of his father and reenforced by julia     vi   when he arrived with the three members of his family at the restaurant of their choice peter sherringham was already seated there by one of the immaculate tables but mrs dallow was not yet on the scene and they had time for a sociable settlementtime to take their places and unfold their napkins crunch their rolls breathe the savoury air and watch the door before the usual raising of heads and suspension of forks the sort of stir that accompanied most of this ladys movements announced her entrance the dame de comptoir ducked and reducked the people looked round peter and nick got up there was a shuffling of chairsjulia had come peter was relating how he had stopped at her hotel to bring her with him and had found her according to her custom by no means ready on which fearing his guests would arrive first at the rendezvous and find no proper welcome he had come off without her leaving her to follow he had not brought a friend as he intended having divined that julia would prefer a pure family party if she wanted to talk about her candidate now she stood looking down at the table and her expectant kinsfolk drawing off her gloves letting her brother draw off her jacket lifting her hands for some rearrangement of her hat she looked at nick last smiling but only for a moment she said to peter are we going to dine here oh dear why didnt you have a private room  nick had not seen her at all for several weeks and had seen her but little for a year but her offhand cursory manner had not altered in the interval she spoke remarkably fast as if speech were not in itself a pleasureto have it over as soon as possible and her brusquerie was of the dark shade friendly critics account for by pleading shyness shyness had never appeared to him an ultimate quality or a real explanation of anything it only explained an effect by another effect neither with a cause to boast of what he suspected in julia was that her mind was less pleasing than her person an ugly a really blighting idea which as yet he had but half accepted it was a case in which she was entitled to the benefit of every doubt and oughtnt to be judged without a complete trial nick meanwhile was afraid of the trialthis was partly why he had been of late to see her so littlebecause he was afraid of the sentence afraid of anything that might work to lessen the charm it was actually in the power of her beauty to shed there were people who thought her rude and he hated rude women if he should fasten on that view or rather if that view should fasten on him what could still please and what he admired in her would lose too much of its sweetness if it be thought odd that he had not yet been able to read the character of a woman he had known since childhood the answer is that this character had grown faster than nicks observation the growth was constant whereas the observation was but occasional though it had begun early if he had attempted inwardly to phrase the matter as he probably had not he might have pronounced the effect she produced upon him too much a compulsion not the coercion of design of importunity nor the vulgar pressure of family expectation a betrayed desire he should like her enough to marry her but a mixture of divers urgent things of the sense that she was imperious and generousprobably more the former than the latterand of a certain prevision of doom the influence of the idea that he should come to it that he was predestined  this had made him shrink from knowing the worst about her not the wish to get used to it in time but what was more characteristic of him the wish to interpose a temporary illusion illusions and realities and hopes and fears however fell into confusion whenever he met her after a separation the separation so far as seeing her alone or as continuous talk was concerned had now been tolerably long had lasted really ever since his failure to regain his seat an impression had come to him that she judged that failure rather stiffly had thought and had somewhat sharply said that he ought to have done better this was a part of her imperious way and a part not all to be overlooked on a mere present basis if he were to marry her he should come to an understanding with her he should give her his own measure as well as take hers but the understanding might in the actual case suggest too much that he was to marry her you could quarrel with your wife because there were compensationsfor her but you mightnt be prepared to offer these compensations as prepayment for the luxury of quarrelling  it was not that such a luxury wouldnt be considerable our young man none the less thought as julia dallows fine head poised itself before him again a high spirit was of course better than a mawkish to be mismated with any day in the year she had much the same colour as her brother but as nothing else in her face was the same the resemblance was not striking her hair was of so dark a brown that it was commonly regarded as black and so abundant that a plain arrangement was required to keep it in natural relation to the rest of her person her eyes were of a grey sometimes pronounced too light and were not sunken in her face but placed well on the surface her nose was perfect but her mouth was too small and nick dormer and doubtless other persons as well had sometimes wondered how with such a mouth her face could have expressed decision her figure helped it for she appeared tallbeing extremely slenderyet was not and her head took turns and positions which though a matter of but half an inch out of the common this way or that somehow contributed to the air of resolution and temper if it had not been for her extreme delicacy of line and surface she might have been called bold but as it was she looked refined and quietrefined by tradition and quiet for a purpose and altogether she was beautiful with the gravity of her elegant head her hair like the depths of darkness her eyes like its earlier clearing her mouth like a rare pink flower  peter said he had not taken a private room because he knew biddys tastes she liked to see the worldshe had told him sothe curious people the coming and going of paris oh anything for biddy julia replied smiling at the girl and taking her place lady agnes and her elder daughter exchanged one of their looks and nick exclaimed jocosely that he didnt see why the whole party should be sacrificed to a presumptuous child the presumptuous child blushingly protested she had never expressed any such wish to peter upon which nick with broader humour revealed that peter had served them so out of stinginess he had pitchforked them together in the public room because he wouldnt go to the expense of a cabinet he had brought no guest no foreigner of distinction nor diplomatic swell to honour them and now they would see what a paltry dinner he would give them peter stabbed him indignantly with a long roll and lady agnes who seemed to be waiting for some manifestation on mrs dallows part which didnt come concluded with a certain coldness that they quite sufficed to themselves for privacy as well as for society nick called attention to this fine phrase of his mothers and said it was awfully neat while grace and biddy looked harmoniously at julias clothes nick felt nervous and joked a good deal to carry it offa levity that didnt prevent julias saying to him after a moment you might have come to see me today you know didnt you get my message from peter  scold him juliascold him well i begged him to go said lady agnes and to this grace added her voice with an oh julia do give it to him these words however had not the effect they suggested since mrs dallow only threw off for answer in her quick curt way that that would be making far too much of him it was one of the things in her that nick mentally pronounced ungraceful the perversity of pride or of shyness that always made her disappoint you a little if she saw you expected a thing she snubbed effusiveness in a way that yet gave no interesting hint of any wish to keep it herself in reserve effusiveness however certainly was the last thing of which lady agnes would have consented to be accused and nick while he replied to julia that he was sure he shouldnt have found her was not unable to perceive the operation on his mother of that shade of manner he ought to have gone he owed you that she went on but its very true he would have had the same luck as we i went with the girls directly after luncheon i suppose you got our card  he might have come after i came in said mrs dallow  dear julia im going to see you tonight ive been waiting for that nick returned  of course we had no idea when youd come in said lady agnes  im so sorry you must come tomorrow i hate calls at night julia serenely added  well then will you roam with me will you wander through paris on my arm nick asked smiling will you take a drive with me  oh that would be perfection cried grace  i thought we were all going somewhereto the hippodrome peter biddy said  oh not all just you and me laughed peter  im going home to my bed ive earned my rest lady agnes sighed  cant peter take us demanded grace nick can take you home mamma if julia wont receive him and i can look perfectly after peter and biddy  take them to something amusing please take them mrs dallow said to her brother her voice was kind but had the expectation of assent in it and nick observed both the good nature and the pressure youre tired poor dear she continued to lady agnes fancy your being dragged about so what did you come over for  my mother came because i brought her nick said its i who have dragged her about i brought her for a little change i thought it would do her good i wanted to see the salon  it isnt a bad time ive a carriage and you must use it you must use nothing else it shall take you everywhere ill drive you about tomorrow julia dropped these words with all her air of being able rather than of wanting but nick had already noted and he noted now afresh and with pleasure that her lack of unction interfered not a bit with her always acting it was quite sufficiently manifest to him that for the rest of the time she might be near his mother she would do for her numberless good turns she would give things to the girlshe had a private adumbration of that expensive parisian perhaps not perfectly useful things  lady agnes was a woman who measured outlays and returns but she was both too acute and too just not to recognise the scantest offer from which an advantage could proceed dear julia she exclaimed responsively and her tone made this brevity of acknowledgment adequate julias own few words were all she wanted its so interesting about harsh she added were immensely excited  yes nick looks it merci pas de vin its just the thing for you you know julia said to him  to be sure he knows it hes immensely grateful its really very kind of you  you do me a very great honour julia nick hastened to add  dont be tiresome please that lady returned  well talk about it later of course there are lots of points nick pursued at present lets be purely convivial somehow harsh is such a false note here nous causerons de ça  my dear fellow youve caught exactly the tone of mr gabriel nash peter sherringham declared on this  whos mr gabriel nash mrs dallow asked  nick is he a gentleman biddy says so grace dormer interposed before this inquiry was answered  its to be supposed that any one nick brings to lunch with us lady agnes rather coldly sighed  ah grace with your tremendous standard her son said while peter sherringham explained to his sister that mr nash was nicks new mentor or oraclewhom moreover she should see if she would come and have tea with him  i havent the least desire to see him julia made answer any more than i have to talk about harsh and bore poor peter  oh certainly dear youd bore me her brother rang out  one thing at a time then let us by all means be convivial only you must show me how mrs dallow went on to nick what does he mean cousin agnes does he want us to drain the winecup to flash with repartee  youll do very well said nick youre thoroughly charming tonight  do go to peters julia if you want something exciting youll see a wonderful girl biddy broke in with her smile on peter  wonderful for what  for thinking she can act when she cant said the roguish biddy  dear me what people you all know i hate peters theatrical people  and arent you going home julia lady agnes inquired  home to the hotel  dear no to harshto see about everything  im in the midst of telegrams i dont know yet  i suppose theres no doubt theyll have him lady agnes decided to pursue  wholl have whom  why the local people and the party managers im speaking of the question of my sons standing  theyll have the person i want them to have i daresay there are so many people in it in one way or anotherits dreadful i like the way you sit there julia went on to nick  so do i he smiled back at her and he thought she was charming now because she was gay and easy and willing really though she might plead incompetence to understand how jocose a dinner in a pothouse in a foreign town might be she was in good humour or was going to be and not grand nor stiff nor indifferent nor haughty nor any of the things people who disliked her usually found her and sometimes even a little made him believe her the spirit of mirth in some cold natures manifests itself not altogether happily their effort of recreation resembles too much the bath of the hippopotamus but when mrs dallow put her elbows on the table one felt she could be trusted to get them safely off again  for a family in mourning the dinner was lively the more so that before it was half over julia had arranged that her brother eschewing the inferior spectacle should take the girls to the théâtre français it was her idea and nick had a chance to observe how an idea was apt to be not successfully controverted when it was julias even the programme appeared to have been prearranged to suit it just the thing for the cheek of the young personil ne faut jurer de rien and mademoiselle de la seiglière peter was all willingness but it was julia who settled it even to sending for the newspaperhe was by a rare accident unconscious of the evenings billand to reassuring biddy who was happy but anxious on the article of their being too late for good places peter could always get good places a word from him and the best box was at his disposal she made him write the word on a card and saw a messenger despatched with it to the rue de richelieu and all this without loudness or insistence parenthetically and authoritatively the box was bespoken and the carriage as soon as they had had their coffee found to be in attendance peter drove off in it with the girls understanding that he was to send it back and nick waited for it over the finished repast with the two ladies after this his mother was escorted to it and conveyed to her apartments and all the while it had been julia who governed the succession of events do be nice to her lady agnes breathed to him as he placed her in the vehicle at the door of the café and he guessed it gave her a comfort to have left him sitting there with mrs dallow  he had every disposition to be nice to his charming cousin if things went as she liked them it was the proof of a certain fine force in herthe force of assuming they would julia had her differencessome of them were much for the better and when she was in a mood like this evenings liberally dominant he was ready to encourage most of what she took for granted while they waited for the return of the carriage which had rolled away with his mother she sat opposite him with her elbows on the table playing first with one and then with another of the objects that encumbered it after five minutes of which she exclaimed oh i say well go and got up abruptly asking for her jacket he said something about the carriage and its order to come back for them and she replied well it can go away again i dont want a carriage she added i want to walkand in a moment she was out of the place with the people at the tables turning round again and the caissière swaying in her high seat on the pavement of the boulevard she looked up and down there were people at little tables by the door there were people all over the broad expanse of the asphalt there was a profusion of light and a pervasion of sound and everywhere though the establishment at which they had been dining was not in the thick of the fray the tokens of a great traffic of pleasure that nightaspect of paris which represents it as a huge market for sensations beyond the boulevard des capucines it flared through the warm evening like a vast bazaar and opposite the café durand the madeleine rose theatrical a high artful décor before the footlights of the rue royale where shall we go what shall we do mrs dallow asked looking at her companion and somewhat to his surprise as he had supposed she wanted but to go home  anywhere you like its so warm we might drive instead of going indoors we might go to the bois that would be agreeable  yes but it wouldnt be walking however that doesnt matter its mild enough for anythingfor sitting out like all these people and ive never walked in paris at night it would amuse me  nick hesitated so it might but it isnt particularly recommended to ladies  i dont care for that if it happens to suit me  very well then well walk to the bastille if you like  julia hesitated on her side still looking about its too far im tired well sit here and she dropped beside an empty table on the terrace of m durand this will do its amusing enough and we can look at the madeleinethats respectable if we must have something well have a madèreis that respectable not particularly so much the better what are those people having bocks couldnt we have bocks are they very low then i shall have one ive been so wonderfully goodive been staying at versailles je me dois bien cela  she insisted but pronounced the thin liquid in the tall glass very disgusting when it was brought nick was amazed reflecting that it was not for such a discussion as this that his mother had left him with hands in his pockets he had been looking out but as his eloquence flowed faster he turned to his friend who had dropped upon a sofa with her face to the window she had given her jacket and gloves to her maid but had kept on her hat and she leaned forward a little as she sat clasping her hands together in her lap and keeping her eyes on him the lamp in a corner was so thickly veiled that the room was in tempered obscurity lighted almost equally from the street and the brilliant shopfronts opposite therefore why be sapient and solemn about it like an editorial in a newspaper nick added with a smile  she continued to look at him after he had spoken then she said if you dont want to stand youve only to say so you neednt give your reasons  its too kind of you to let me off that and then im a tremendous fellow for reasons thats my strong point dont you know ive a lot more besides those ive mentioned done up and ready for delivery the odd thing is that they dont always govern my behaviour i rather think i do want to stand  then what you said just now was a speech julia declared  a speech  the rot the humbug of the hustings  no those great truths remain and a good many others but an inner voice tells me im in for it and it will be much more graceful to embrace this opportunity accepting your cooperation than to wait for some other and forfeit that advantage  i shall be very glad to help you anywhere she went on  thanks awfully he returned still standing there with his hands in his pockets youd do it best in your own place and ive no right to deny myself such a help  julia calmly considered i dont do it badly  ah youre so political  of course i am its the only decent thing to be but i can only help you if youll help yourself i can do a good deal but i cant do everything if youll work ill work with you but if youre going into it with your hands in your pockets ill have nothing to do with you nick instantly changed the position of these members and sank into a seat with his elbows on his knees youre very clever but you must really take a little trouble things dont drop into peoples mouths  ill tryill try ive a great incentive he admitted  of course you have  my mother my poor mother julia breathed some vague sound and he went on and of course always my father dear good man my mothers even more political than you  i daresay she is and quite right said mrs dallow  and she cant tell me a bit more than you can what she thinks what she believes what she wants  pardon me i can tell you perfectly theres one thing i always immensely wantto keep out a tory  i see thats a great philosophy  it will do very well and i desire the good of the country im not ashamed of that  and can you give me an idea of what it isthe good of the country  i know perfectly what it isnt it isnt what the tories want to do  what do they want to do  oh it would take me long to tell you all sorts of trash  it would take you long and it would take them longer all they want to do is to prevent us from doing on our side we want to prevent them from preventing us thats about as clearly as we all see it so on both sides its a beautiful lucid inspiring programme  i dont believe in you mrs dallow replied to this leaning back on her sofa  i hope not julia indeed he paused a moment still with his face toward her and his elbows on his knees then he pursued youre a very accomplished woman and a very zealous one but you havent an idea you knownot to call an idea what you mainly want is to be at the head of a political salon to start one to keep it up to make it a success  much you know me julia protested but he could see through the dimness that her face spoke differently  youll have it in time but i wont come to it nick went on  you cant come less than you do  when i say youll have it i mean youve already got it thats why i dont come  i dont think you know what you mean said mrs dallow ive an idea thats as good as any of yours any of those youve treated me to this evening it seems to methe simple idea that one ought to do something or other for ones country  something or other certainly covers all the ground theres one thing one can always do for ones country which is not to be afraid  afraid of what  nick dormer waited a little as if his idea amused him but he presently said ill tell you another time its very well to talk so glibly of standing he added but it isnt absolutely foreign to the question that i havent got the cash  what did you do before she asked  the first time my father paid  and the other time  oh mr carteret  your expenses wont be at all large on the contrary said julia  they shant be i shall look out sharp for that i shall have the great hutchby  of course but you know i want you to do it well she paused an instant and then of course you can send the bill to me  thanks awfully youre tremendously kind i shouldnt think of that nick dormer got up as he spoke and walked to the window again his companions eyes resting on him while he stood with his back to her i shall manage it somehow he wound up  mr carteret will be delighted said julia  i daresay but i hate taking peoples money  thats nonsensewhen its for the country isnt it for them  when they get it back nick replied turning round and looking for his hat its startlingly late you must be tired mrs dallow made no response to this and he pursued his quest successful only when he reached a duskier corner of the room to which the hat had been relegated by his cousins maid mr carteret will expect so much if he pays and so would you  yes im bound to say i should i should expect a great dealeverything and mrs dallow emphasised this assertion by the way she rose erect if youre riding for a fall if youre only going in to miss it you had better stay out  how can i miss it with you the young man smiled she uttered a word impatiently but indistinguishably and he continued and even if i do it will have been immense fun  it is immense fun said julia but the best fun is to win if you dont  if i dont he repeated as she dropped  ill never speak to you again  how much you expect even when you dont pay  mrs dallows rejoinder was a justification of this remark expressing as it did the fact that should they receive on the morrow information on which she believed herself entitled to count information tending to show how hard the conservatives meant to fight she should look to him to be in the field as early as herself sunday was a lost day she should leave paris on monday  oh theyll fight it hard theyll put up kingsbury said nick smoothing his hat theyll all come downall that can get away and kingsbury has a very handsome wife  shes not so handsome as your cousin julia smiled  oh dear noa cousin sooner than a wife any day nick laughed as soon as he had said this as if the speech had an awkward side but the reparation perhaps scarcely mended it the exaggerated mockmeekness with which he added ill do any blessed thing you tell me  come here tomorrow thenas early as ten she turned round moving to the door with him but before they reached it she brought out pray isnt a gentleman to do anything to be anything  to be anything  if he doesnt aspire to serve the state  aspire to make his political fortune do you mean oh bless me yes there are other things  what other things that can compare with that  well i for instance im very fond of the arts  of the arts she echoed  did you never hear of them im awfully fond of painting  at this julia stopped short and her fine grey eyes had for a moment the air of being set further forward in her head dont be odious goodnight she said turning away and leaving him to go     book second     vii   peter sherringham reminded nick the next day that he had promised to be present at madame carrés interview with the ladies introduced to her by gabriel nash and in the afternoon conformably to this arrangement the two men took their way to the rue de constantinople they found mr nash and his friends in the small beflounced drawingroom of the old actress who as they learned had sent in a request for ten minutes grace having been detained at a lessona rehearsal of the comédie de salon about to be given for a charity by a fine lady at which she had consented to be present as an adviser mrs rooth sat on a black satin sofa with her daughter beside her while gabriel nash wandering about the room looked at the votive offerings which converted the little panelled box decorated in sallow white and gold into a theatrical museum the presents the portraits the wreaths the diadems the letters framed and glazed the trophies and tributes and relics collected by madame carré during half a century of renown the profusion of this testimony was hardly more striking than the confession of something missed something hushed which seemed to rise from it all and make it melancholy like a reference to clappings which in the nature of things could now only be present as a silence so that if the place was full of history it was the form without the fact or at the most a redundancy of the one to a pinch of the otherthe history of a mask of a squeak of a series of vain gestures  some of the objects exhibited by the distinguished artist her early portraits in lithograph or miniature represented the costume and embodied the manner of a period so remote that nick dormer as he glanced at them felt a quickened curiosity to look at the woman who reconciled being alive today with having been alive so long ago peter sherringham already knew how she managed this miracle but every visit he paid her added to his amused charmed sense that it was a miracle and that his extraordinary old friend had seen things he should never never see those were just the things he wanted to see most and her duration her survival cheated him agreeably and helped him a little to guess them his appreciation of the actors art was so systematic that it had an antiquarian side and at the risk of representing him as attached to an absurd futility it must be said that he had as yet hardly known a keener regret for anything than for the loss of that antecedent world and in particular for his having belatedly missed the great comédienne the light of the french stage in the early years of the century of whose example and instruction madame carré had had the inestimable benefit she had often described to him her rare predecessor straight from whose hands she had received her most celebrated parts and of whom her own manner was often a religious imitation but her descriptions troubled him more than they consoled only confirming his theory to which so much of his observation had already ministered that the actors art in general was going down and down descending a slope with abysses of vulgarity at its foot after having reached its perfection more than fifty years ago in the talent of the lady in question he would have liked to dwell for an hour beneath the meridian  gabriel nash introduced the newcomers to his companions but the younger of the two ladies gave no sign of lending herself to this transaction the girl was very white she huddled there silent and rigid frightened to death staring expressionless if bridget dormer had seen her at this moment she might have felt avenged for the discomfiture of her own spirit suffered at the salon the day before under the challenging eyes of maud vavasour it was plain at the present hour that miss vavasour would have run away had she not regarded the persons present as so many guards and keepers her appearance made nick feel as if the little temple of art in which they were collected had been the waitingroom of a dentist sherringham had seen a great many nervous girls tremble before the same ordeal and he liked to be kind to them to say things that would help them to do themselves justice the probability in a given case was almost overwhelmingly in favour of their having any other talent one could think of in a higher degree than the dramatic but he could rarely refrain from some care that the occasion shouldnt be even as against his conscience too cruel there were occasions indeed that could scarce be too cruel to punish properly certain examples of presumptuous ineptitude he remembered what mr nash had said about this blighted maiden and perceived that though she might be inept she was now anything but presumptuous gabriel fell to talking with nick dormer while peter addressed himself to mrs rooth there was no use as yet for any direct word to the girl who was too scared even to hear mrs rooth with her shawl fluttering about her nestled against her daughter putting out her hand to take one of miriams soothingly she had pretty silly nearsighted eyes a long thin nose and an upper lip which projected over the under as an ornamental cornice rests on its support so much dependsreally everything she said in answer to some sociable observation of sherringhams its either this and she rolled her eyes expressively about the room or itsi dont know what  perhaps were too many peter hazarded to her daughter but really youll find after you fairly begin that youll do better with four or five  before she answered she turned her head and lifted her fine eyes the next instant he saw they were full of tears the words she spoke however though uttered as if she had tapped a silver gong had not the note of sensibility oh i dont care for you he laughed at this declared it was very well said and that if she could give madame carré such a specimen as that the actress came in before he had finished his phrase and he observed the way the girl ruefully rose to the encounter hanging her head a little and looking out from under her brows there was no sentiment in her faceonly a vacancy of awe and anguish which had not even the merit of being fine of its kind for it spoke of no spring of reaction yet the head was good he noted at the same moment it was strong and salient and made to tell at a distance madame carré scarcely heeded her at first greeting her only in her order among the others and pointing to seats composing the circle with smiles and gestures as if they were all before the prompters box the old actress presented herself to a casual glance as a redfaced raddled woman in a wig with beady eyes a hooked nose and pretty hands but nick dormer who had a sense for the overscored human surface soon observed that these comparatively gross marks included a great deal of delicate detailan eyebrow a nostril a flitting of expressions as if a multitude of little facial wires were pulled from within this accomplished artist had in particular a mouth which was visibly a rare instrument a pair of lips whose curves and fine corners spoke of a lifetime of points unerringly made and verses exquisitely spoken helping to explain the purity of the sound that issued from them her whole countenance had the look of long serviceof a thing infinitely worn and used drawn and stretched to excess with its elasticity overdone and its springs relaxed yet religiously preserved and kept in repair even as some valuable old timepiece which might have quivered and rumbled but could be trusted to strike the hour at the first words she spoke gabriel nash exclaimed endearingly ah la voix de célimène célimène who wore a big red flower on the summit of her dense wig had a very grand air a toss of the head and sundry little majesties of manner in addition to which she was strange almost grotesque and to some people would have been even terrifying capable of reappearing with her hard eyes as a queer vision of the darkness she excused herself for having made the company wait and mouthed and mimicked in the drollest way with intonations as fine as a flute the performance and the pretensions of the belles dames to whom she had just been endeavouring to communicate a few of the rudiments mais celleslà cest une plaisanterie she went on to mrs rooth whereas you and your daughter chère madameim sure you are quite another matter  the girl had got rid of her tears and was gazing at her and mrs rooth leaned forward and said portentously she knows four languages  madame carré gave one of her histrionic stares throwing back her head thats three too many the things to do something proper with one  were very much in earnest continued mrs rooth who spoke excellent french  im glad to hear itil ny a que ça la tête est bienthe heads very good she said as she looked at the girl but let us see my dear child what youve got in it the young lady was still powerless to speak she opened her lips but nothing came with the failure of this effort she turned her deep sombre eyes to the three men un beau regardit carries well madame carré further commented but even as she spoke miss rooths fine gaze was suffused again and the next moment she had definitely begun to weep nick dormer sprung up he felt embarrassed and intrusivethere was such an indelicacy in sitting there to watch a poor workinggirls struggle with timidity there was a momentary confusion mrs rooths tears were seen also to flow mr nash took it gaily addressing however at the same time the friendliest most familiar encouragement to his companions and peter sherringham offered to retire with nick on the spot should their presence incommode the young lady but the agitation was over in a minute madame carré motioned mrs rooth out of her seat and took her place beside the girl and nash explained judiciously to the other men that shed be worse should they leave her her mother begged them to remain so that there should be at least some english she spoke as if the old actress were an army of frenchwomen the young heroine of the occasion quickly came round and madame carré on the sofa beside her held her hand and emitted a perfect music of reassurance the nerves the nervestheyre half our affair have as many as you like if youve got something else too voyonsdo you know anything  i know some pieces  some pieces of the répertoire  miriam rooth stared as if she didnt understand i know some poetry  english french italian german said her mother  madame carré gave mrs rooth a look which expressed irritation at the recurrence of this announcement does she wish to act in all those tongues the phrasebook isnt the comedy  its only to show you how she has been educated  ah chère madame theres no education that matters i mean save the right one your daughter must have a particular form of speech like me like ces messieurs  you see if i can speak french said the girl smiling dimly at her hostess she appeared now almost to have collected herself  you speak it in perfection  and english just as well said miss rooth  you oughtnt to be an actressyou ought to be a governess  oh dont tell us that its to escape from that pleaded mrs rooth  im very sure your daughter will escape from that peter sherringham was moved to interpose  oh if you could help her said the lady with a world of longing  she has certainly all the qualities that strike the eye peter returned  youre most kind sir mrs rooth declared elegantly draping herself  she knows célimène ive heard her do célimène gabriel nash said to madame carré  and she knows juliet she knows lady macbeth and cleopatra added mrs rooth  voyons my dear child do you wish to work for the french stage or for the english the old actress demanded  ours would have sore need of you miss rooth sherringham gallantly threw off  could you speak to any one in londoncould you introduce her her mother eagerly asked  dear madam i must hear her first and hear what madame carré says  she has a voice of rare beauty and i understand voices said mrs rooth  ah then if she has intelligence she has every gift  she has a most poetic mind the old lady went on  i should like to paint her portrait shes made for that nick dormer ventured to observe to mrs rooth partly because struck with the girls suitability for sitting partly to mitigate the crudity of inexpressive spectatorship  so all the artists say ive had three or four heads of her if you would like to see them she has been done in several styles if you were to do her im sure it would make her celebrated  and me too nick easily laughed  it would indeeda member of parliament nash declared  ah i have the honour murmured mrs rooth looking gratified and mystified  nick explained that she had no honour at all and meanwhile madame carré had been questioning the girl chère madame i can do nothing with your daughter she knows too much she broke out its a pity because i like to catch them wild  oh shes wild enough if thats all and thats the very point the question of where to try mrs rooth went on into what do i launch herupon what dangerous stormy sea ive thought of it so anxiously  try heretry the french public theyre so much the most serious said gabriel nash  ah no try the english theres such a rare opening sherringham urged in quick opposition  oh it isnt the public dear gentlemen its the private side the other peopleits the life its the moral atmosphere  je ne connais quune scènela nôtre madame carré declared im assured by every one who knows that theres no other  very correctly assured said mr nash the theatre in our countries is puerile and barbarous  theres something to be done for it and perhaps mademoiselles the person to do it sherringham contentiously suggested  ah but en attendant what can it do for her madame carré asked  well anything i can help to bring about said peter sherringham more and more struck with the girls rich type miriam rooth sat in silence while this discussion went on looking from one speaker to the other with a strange dependent candour  ah if your parts marked out i congratulate you mademoiselleand the old actress underlined the words as she had often underlined others on the stage she smiled with large permissiveness on the young aspirant who appeared not to understand her her tone penetrated however to certain depths in the mothers nature adding another stir to agitated waters  i feel the responsibility of what she shall find in the life the standards of the theatre mrs rooth explained where is the purest tonewhere are the highest standards thats what i ask the good lady continued with a misguided intensity which elicited a peal of unceremonious but sociable laughter from gabriel nash  the purest tonequestce que cest que ça madame carré demanded in the finest manner of modern comedy  were very very respectable mrs rooth went on but now smiling and achieving lightness too  what i want is to place my daughter where the conductand the picture of conduct in which she should take partwouldnt be quite absolutely dreadful now chère madame how about all that how about conduct in the french theatreall the things she should see the things she should hear the things she should learn  her hostess took it as sherringham felt de trèshaut i dont think i know what youre talking about theyre the things she may see and hear and learn everywhere only theyre better done theyre better said above all theyre better taught the only conduct that concerns an actress it seems to me is her own and the only way for her to behave herself is not to be a helpless stick i know no other conduct  but there are characters there are situations which i dont think i should like to see her undertake  there are many no doubt which she would do well to leave alone laughed the frenchwoman  i shouldnt like to see her represent a very bad womana really bad one mrs rooth serenely pursued  ah in england then and in your theatre every ones immaculately good your plays must be even more ingenious than i supposed  we havent any plays said gabriel nash  people will write them for miss roothit will be a new era sherringham threw in with wanton or at least with combative optimism  will you sirwill you do something a sketch of one of our grand english ideals the old lady asked engagingly  oh i know what you do with our piecesto show your superior virtue madame carré cried before he had time to reply that he wrote nothing but diplomatic memoranda bad women je nai joué que ça madame really bad i tried to make them real  i can say laventurière miriam interrupted in a cold voice which seemed to hint at a want of participation in the maternal solicitudes  allow us the pleasure of hearing you then madame carré will give you the réplique said peter sherringham  certainly my child i can say it without the book madame carré responded put yourself theremove that chair a little away she patted her young visitor encouraging her to rise settling with her the scene they should take while the three men sprang up to arrange a place for the performance miriam left her seat and looked vaguely about her then having taken off her hat and given it to her mother she stood on the designated spot with her eyes to the ground abruptly however instead of beginning the scene madame carré turned to the elder lady with an air which showed that a rejoinder to this visitors remarks of a moment before had been gathering force in her breast  you mix things up chère madame and i have it on my heart to tell you so i believe its rather the case with you other english and ive never been able to learn that either your morality or your talent is the gainer by it to be too respectable to go where things are done best is in my opinion to be very vicious indeed and to do them badly in order to preserve your virtue is to fall into a grossness more shocking than any other to do them well is virtue enough and not to make a mess of it the only respectability thats hard enough to merit paradise everything else is base humbug voilà chère madame the answer i have for your scruples  its admirableadmirable and i am glad my friend dormer here has had the great advantage of hearing you utter it nash exclaimed with a free designation of nick  that young man thought it in effect a speech denoting an intelligence of the question yet he rather resented the idea that gabriel should assume it would strike him as a revelation and to show his familiarity with the line of thought it indicated as well as to play his part appreciatively in the little circle he observed to mrs rooth as if they might take many things for granted in other words your daughter must find her safeguard in the artistic conscience but he had no sooner spoken than he was struck with the oddity of their discussing so publicly and under the poor girls handsome nose the conditions which miss rooth might find the best for the preservation of her personal integrity however the anomaly was light and unoppressivethe echoes of a public discussion of delicate questions seemed to linger so familiarly in the egotistical little room moreover the heroine of the occasion evidently was losing her embarrassment she was the priestess on the tripod awaiting the afflatus and thinking only of that her bared head of which she had changed the position holding it erect while her arms hung at her sides was admirable her eyes gazed straight out of the window and at the houses on the opposite side of the rue de constantinople  mrs rooth had listened to madame carré with startled respectful attention but nick considering her was very sure she hadnt at all taken in the great artists little lesson yet this didnt prevent her from exclaiming in answer to himself oh a fine artistic lifewhat indeed is more beautiful  peter sherringham had said nothing he was watching miriam and her attitude she wore a black dress which fell in straight folds her face under her level brows was pale and regularit had a strange strong tragic beauty i dont know whats in her he said to himself nothing it would seem from her persistent vacancy but such a face as that such a head is a fortune madame carré brought her to book giving her the first line of the speech of clorinde vous ne me fuyez pas mon enfant aujourdhui but still the girl hesitated and for an instant appeared to make a vain convulsive effort in this convulsion she frowned portentously her low forehead overhung her eyes the eyes themselves in shadow stared splendid and cold and her hands clinched themselves at her sides she looked austere and terrible and was during this moment an incarnation the vividness of which drew from sherringham a stifled cry elle est bien belleah ça murmured the old actress and in the pause which still preceded the issue of sound from the girls lips peter turned to his kinsman and said in a low tone you must paint her just like that  like that  as the tragic muse  she began to speak a long strong colourless voice quavered in her young throat she delivered the lines of clorinde in the admired interview with célie the gem of the third act with a rude monotony and then gaining confidence with an effort at modulation which was not altogether successful and which evidently she felt not to be so madame carré sent back the ball without raising her hand repeating the speeches of célie which her memory possessed from their having so often been addressed to her and uttering the verses with soft communicative art so they went on through the scene which when it was over had not precisely been a triumph for miriam rooth sherringham forbore to look at gabriel nash and madame carré said i think youve a voice ma fille somewhere or other we must try and put our hand on it then she asked her what instruction she had had and the girl lifting her eyebrows looked at her mother while her mother prompted her  mrs delamere in london she was once an ornament of the english stage she gives lessons just to a very few its a great favour such a very nice person but above all signor ruggierii think he taught us most mrs rooth explained that this gentleman was an italian tragedian in rome who instructed miriam in the proper manner of pronouncing his language and also in the art of declaiming and gesticulating  gesticulating ill warrant declared their hostess they mimic as for the deaf they emphasise as for the blind mrs delamere is doubtless an epitome of all the virtues but i never heard of her you travel too much madame carré went on thats very amusing but the way to study is to stay at home to shut yourself up and hammer at your scales mrs rooth complained that they had no home to stay at in reply to which the old actress exclaimed oh you english youre dune légèreté à faire frémir if you havent a home you must make or at least for decency pretend to one in our profession its the first requisite  but where thats what i ask said mrs rooth  why not here sherringham threw out  oh here and the good lady shook her head with a world of sad significance  come and live in london and then i shall be able to paint your daughter nick dormer interposed  is that all it will take my dear fellow asked gabriel nash  ah londons full of memories mrs rooth went on my father had a great house therewe always came up but all thats over  study here and then go to london to appear said peter feeling frivolous even as he spoke  to appear in french  no in the language of shakespeare  but we cant study that here  mr sherringham means that he will give you lessons madame carré explained let me not fail to say ithes an excellent critic  how do you know thatyou whore beyond criticism and perfect asked sherringham an inquiry to which the answer was forestalled by the girls rousing herself to make it public that she could recite the nights of alfred de musset  diable said the actress thats more than i can by all means give us a specimen  the girl again placed herself in position and rolled out a fragment of one of the splendid conversations of mussets poet with his muserolled it loudly and proudly tossed it and tumbled it about the room madame carré watched her at first but after a few moments she shut her eyes though the best part of the business was to take in her young candidates beauty sherringham had supposed miriam rather abashed by the flatness of her first performance but he now saw how little she could have been aware of this she was rather uplifted and emboldened she made a mush of the divine verses which in spite of certain sonorities and cadences an evident effort to imitate a celebrated actress a comrade of madame carré whom she had heard declaim them she produced as if she had been dashing blindfold at some playfellow she was to catch when she had finished madame carré passed no judgement only dropping perhaps you had better say something english she suggested some little piece of versesome fable if there were fables in english she appeared but scantily surprised to hear that there were notit was a language of which one expected so little mrs rooth said she knows her tennyson by heart i think hes much deeper than la fontaine and after some deliberation and delay miriam broke into the lotuseaters from which she passed directly almost breathlessly to edward gray sherringham had by this time heard her make four different attempts and the only generalisation very present to him was that she uttered these dissimilar compositions in exactly the same tonea solemn droning dragging measure suggestive of an exhortation from the pulpit and adopted evidently with the affecting intention and from a crude idea of style it was all funereal yet was artlessly rough sherringham thought her english performance less futile than her french but he could see that madame carré listened to it even with less pleasure in the way the girl wailed forth some of her tennysonian lines he detected a faint gleam as of something pearly in deep water but the further she went the more violently she acted on the nerves of mr gabriel nash that also he could discover from the way this gentleman ended by slipping discreetly to the window and leaning there with his head out and his back to the exhibition he had the art of mute expression his attitude said as clearly as possible no no you cant call me either illmannered or illnatured im the showman of the occasion moreover and i avert myself leaving you to judge if theres a thing in life i hate its this idiotic new fashion of the drawingroom recitation and of the insufferable creatures who practise it who prevent conversation and whom as theyre beneath it you cant punish by criticism therefore what im doings only too magnanimousbringing these benighted women here paying with my person stifling my just repugnance  while sherringham judged privately that the manner in which miss rooth had acquitted herself offered no element of interest he yet remained aware that something surmounted and survived her failure something that would perhaps be worth his curiosity it was the element of outline and attitude the way she stood the way she turned her eyes her head and moved her limbs these things held the attention they had a natural authority and in spite of their suggesting too much the schoolgirl in the tableauvivant a plastic grandeur her face moreover grew as he watched it something delicate dawned in it a dim promise of variety and a touching plea for patience as if it were conscious of being able to show in time more shades than the simple and striking gloom which had as yet mainly graced it these rather rude physical felicities formed in short her only mark of a vocation he almost hated to have to recognise them he had seen them so often when they meant nothing at all that he had come at last to regard them as almost a guarantee of incompetence he knew madame carré valued them singly so little that she counted them out in measuring an histrionic nature when deprived of the escort of other properties which helped and completed them she almost held them a positive hindrance to successsuccess of the only kind she esteemed far oftener than himself she had sat in judgement on young women for whom hair and eyebrows and a disposition for the statuesque would have worked the miracle of sanctifying their stupidity if the miracle were workable but that particular miracle never was the qualities she rated highest were not the gifts but the conquests the effects the actor had worked hard for had dug out of the mine by unwearied study sherringham remembered to have had in the early part of their acquaintance a friendly dispute with her on this subject he having been moved at that time to defend doubtless to excess the cause of the gifts she had gone so far as to say that a serious comedian ought to be ashamed of themashamed of resting his case on them and when sherringham had cited the great rachel as a player whose natural endowment was rich and who had owed her highest triumphs to it she had declared that rachel was the very instance that proved her pointa talent assisted by one or two primary aids a voice and a portentous brow but essentially formed by work unremitting and ferocious work i dont care a straw for your handsome girls she said but bring me one whos ready to drudge the tenth part of the way rachel drudged and ill forgive her her beauty of course notez bien rachel wasnt a grosse bête thats a gift if you like  mrs rooth who was evidently very proud of the figure her daughter had madeher daughter who for all one could tell affected their hostess precisely as a grosse bêteappealed to madame carré rashly and serenely for a verdict but fortunately this ladys voluble bonne came rattling in at the same moment with the teatray the old actress busied herself in dispensing this refreshment an hospitable attention to her english visitors and under cover of the diversion thus obtained while the others talked together sherringham put her the question well is there anything in my young friend  nothing i can see shes loud and coarse  shes very much afraid you must allow for that  afraid of me immensely but not a bit afraid of her authorsnor of you madame carré smiled  arent you prejudiced by what that fellow nash has told you  why prejudiced he only told me she was very handsome  and dont you think her so  admirable but im not a photographer nor a dressmaker nor a coiffeur i cant do anything with back hair nor with a mere big stare  the heads very noble said peter sherringham and the voice when she spoke english had some sweet tones  ah your englishpossibly all i can say is that i listened to her conscientiously and i didnt perceive in what she did a single nuance a single inflexion or intention but not one mon cher i dont think shes intelligent  but dont they often seem stupid at first  say always  then dont some succeedeven when theyre handsome  when theyre handsome they always succeedin one way or another  you dont understand us english said peter sherringham  madame carré drank her tea then she replied marry her my son and give her diamonds make her an ambassadress shell look very well  she interests you so little that you dont care to do anything for her  to do anything  to give her a few lessons  the old actress looked at him a moment after which rising from her place near the table on which the tea had been served she said to miriam rooth my dear child i give my voice for the scène anglaise you did the english things best  did i do them well asked the girl  youve a great deal to learn but youve rude force the main things sont encore a dégager but theyll come you must work  i think she has ideas said mrs rooth  she gets them from you madame carré replied  i must say that if its to be our theatre im relieved i do think ours safer the good lady continued  ours is dangerous no doubt  you mean youre more severe said the girl  your mothers right the actress smiled you have ideas  but what shall we do thenhow shall we proceed mrs rooth made this appeal plaintively and vaguely to the three gentlemen but they had collected a few steps off and were so occupied in talk that it failed to reach them  workworkwork exclaimed the actress  in english i can play shakespeare i want to play shakespeare miriam made known  thats fortunate as in english you havent any one else to play  but hes so greatand hes so pure said mrs rooth  that indeed seems the saving of you madame carré returned  you think me actually pretty bad dont you the girl demanded with her serious face  mon dieu que vous diraije of course youre rough but so was i at your age and if you find your voice it may carry you far besides what does it matter what i think how can i judge for your english public  how shall i find my voice asked miriam rooth  by trying il ny a que ça work like a horse night and day besides mr sherringham as he says will help you  that gentleman hearing his name turned round and the girl appealed to him will you help me really  to find her voice said madame carré  the voice when its worth anything comes from the heart so i suppose thats where to look for it gabriel nash suggested  much you know you havent got any miriam retorted with the first scintillation of gaiety she had shown on this occasion  any voice my child mr nash inquired  any heartor any manners  peter sherringham made the secret reflexion that he liked her better lugubrious as the note of pertness was not totally absent from her mode of emitting these few words he was irritated moreover for in the brief conference he had just had with the young ladys introducer he had had to meet the rather difficult call of speaking of her hopefully mr nash had said with his bland smile and what impression does my young friend makein respect to which peters optimism felt engaged by an awkward logic he answered that he recognised promise though he did nothing of the sortat the same time that the poor girl both with the exaggerated points of her person and the vanity of her attempt at expression constituted a kind of challenge struck him as a subject for inquiry a problem an explorable tract she was too bad to jump at and yet too takingperhaps after all only vulgarlyto overlook especially when resting her tragic eyes on him with the trust of her deep really this note affected him as addressed directly to his honour giving him a chance to brave verisimilitude to brave ridicule even a little in order to show in a special case what he had always maintained in general that the direction of a young persons studies for the stage may be an interest of as high an order as any other artistic appeal  mr nash has rendered us the great service of introducing us to madame carré and im sure were immensely indebted to him mrs rooth said to her daughter with an air affectionately corrective  but what good does that do us the girl asked smiling at the actress and gently laying her fingertips upon her hand madame carré listens to me with adorable patience and then sends me about my businessah in the prettiest way in the world  mademoiselle youre not so rough the tone of thats very juste a la bonne heure workwork the actress cried there was an inflexion thereor very nearly practise it till youve got it  come and practise it to me if your mother will be so kind as to bring you said peter sherringham  do you give lessonsdo you understand miriam asked  im an old playgoer and ive an unbounded belief in my own judgement  old sir is too much to say mrs rooth remonstrated my daughter knows your high position but shes very direct youll always find her so perhaps youll say there are less honourable faults well come to see you with pleasure oh ive been at the embassy when i was her age therefore why shouldnt she go today that was in lord davenants time  a few people are coming to tea with me tomorrow perhaps youll come then at five oclock  it will remind me of the dear old times said mrs rooth  thank you ill try and do better tomorrow miriam professed very sweetly  you do better every minute sherringham returnedand he looked at their hostess in support of this declaration  shes finding her voice madame carré acknowledged  shes finding a friend mrs rooth threw in  and dont forget when you come to london my hope that youll come and see me nick dormer said to the girl to try and paint youthat would do me good  shes finding even two said madame carré  its to make up for one ive lost and miriam looked with very good stagescorn at gabriel nash its he who thinks im bad  you say that to make me drive you home you know it will nash returned  well all take you home why not sherringham asked  madame carré looked at the handsome girl handsomer than ever at this moment and at the three young men who had taken their hats and stood ready to accompany her a deeper expression came for an instant into her hard bright eyes ah la jeunesse she sighed youd always have that my child if you were the greatest goose on earth     viii   at peter sherringhams the next day miriam had so evidently come with the expectation of saying something that it was impossible such a patron of the drama should forbear to invite her little as the exhibition at madame carrés could have contributed to render the invitation prompt his curiosity had been more appeased than stimulated but he felt none the less that he had taken up the darkbrowed girl and her reminiscential mother and must face the immediate consequences of the act this responsibility weighed upon him during the twentyfour hours that followed the ultimate dispersal of the little party at the door of the hôtel de la garonne  on quitting madame carré the two ladies had definitely declined mr nashs offered cab and had taken their way homeward on foot and with the gentlemen in attendance the streets of paris at that hour were bright and episodical and sherringham trod them goodhumouredly enough and not too fast leaning a little to talk with miriam as he went their pace was regulated by her mothers who advanced on the arm of gabriel nash nick dormer was on her other side in refined deprecation her sloping back was before them exempt from retentive stillness in spite of her rigid principles with the little drama of her lost and recovered shawl perpetually going on  sherringham said nothing to the girl about her performance or her powers their talk was only of her manner of life with her mothertheir travels their pensions their economies their want of a home the many cities she knew well the foreign tongues and the wide view of the world she had acquired he guessed easily enough the dolorous type of exile of the two ladies wanderers in search of continental cheapness inured to queer contacts and compromises remarkably well connected in england but going out for their meals the girl was but indirectly communicative though seemingly less from any plan of secrecy than from the habit of associating with people whom she didnt honour with her confidence she was fragmentary and abrupt as well as not in the least shy subdued to dread of madame carré as she had been for the time she gave sherringham a reason for this fear and he thought her reason innocently pretentious she admired a great artist more than anything in the world and in the presence of art of great art her heart beat so fast her manners were not perfect and the friction of a varied experience had rather roughened than smoothed her she said nothing that proved her intelligent even though he guessed this to be the design of two or three of her remarks but he parted from her with the suspicion that she was according to the contemporary french phrase a nature  the hôtel de la garonne was in a small unrenovated street in which the cobblestones of old paris still flourished lying between the avenue de lopéra and the place de la bourse sherringham had occasionally traversed the high dimness but had never noticed the tall stale maison meublée the aspect of which that of a thirdrate provincial inn was an illustration of mrs rooths shrunken standard we would ask you to come up but its quite at the top and we havent a sittingroom the poor lady bravely explained we had to receive mr nash at a café  nick dormer declared that he liked cafés and miriam looking at his cousin dropped with a flash of passion the demand do you wonder i should want to do somethingso that we can stop living like pigs  peter recognised the next day that though it might be boring to listen to her it was better to make her recite than to let her do nothing so effectually did the presence of his sister and that of lady agnes and even of grace and biddy appear by a strange tacit opposition to deprive hers ornamental as it was of a reason he had only to see them all together to perceive that she couldnt pass for having come to meet themeven her mothers insinuating gentility failed to put the occasion on that footingand that she must therefore be assumed to have been brought to show them something she was not subdued not colourless enough to sit there for nothing or even for conversationthe sort of conversation that was likely to come offso that it was inevitable to treat her position as connected with the principal place on the carpet with silence and attention and the pulling together of chairs even when so established it struck him at first as precarious in the light or the darkness of the inexpressive faces of the other ladies seated in couples and rows on sofasthere were several in addition to julia and the dormers mainly the wives with their husbands of sherringhams fellowsecretariesscarcely one of whom he felt he might count upon for a modicum of gush when the girl should have finished  miss rooth gave a representation of juliet drinking the potion according to the system as her mother explained of the famous signor ruggieria scene of high fierce sound of many cries and contortions she shook her hair which proved magnificent halfdown before the performance was over then she declaimed several short poems by victor hugo selected among many hundred by mrs rooth as the good lady was careful to make known after this she jumped to the american lyre regaling the company with specimens both familiar and fresh of longfellow lowell whittier holmes and of two or three poetesses now revealed to sherringham for the first time she flowed so copiously keeping the floor and rejoicing visibly in her luck that her host was mainly occupied with wondering how he could make her leave off he was surprised at the extent of her repertory which in view of the circumstance that she could never have received much encouragementit must have come mainly from her mother and he didnt believe in signor ruggieridenoted a very stiff ambition and a blundering energy it was her mother who checked her at last and he found himself suspecting that gabriel nash had intimated to the old woman that interference was necessary for himself he was chiefly glad madame carré hadnt come it was present to him that she would have judged the exhibition with its badness its impudence the absence of criticism wholly indecent  his only new impression of the heroine of the scene was that of this same high assuranceher coolness her complacency her eagerness to go on she had been deadly afraid of the old actress but was not a bit afraid of a cluster of femmes du monde of julia of lady agnes of the smart women of the embassy it was positively these personages who were rather in fear there was certainly a moment when even julia was scared for the first time he had ever remarked it the space was too small the cries the convulsions and rushes of the dishevelled girl were too near lady agnes wore much of the time the countenance she might have shown at the theatre during a play in which pistols were fired and indeed the manner of the young reciter had become more spasmodic and more explosive it appeared however that the company in general thought her very clever and successful which showed to sherringhams sense how little they understood the matter poor biddy was immensely struck she grew flushed and absorbed in proportion as miriam at her best moments became pale and fatal it was she who spoke to her first after it was agreed that they had better not fatigue her any more she advanced a few steps happening to be nearestshe murmured oh thank you so much i never saw anything so beautiful so grand  she looked very red and very pretty as she said this and peter sherringham liked her enough to notice her more and like her better when she looked prettier than usual as he turned away he heard miriam make answer with no great air of appreciation of her tribute ive seen you beforetwo days ago at the salon with mr dormer yes i know hes your brother ive made his acquaintance since he wants to paint my portrait do you think hell do it well he was afraid the girl was something of a brutealso somewhat grossly vain this impression would perhaps have been confirmed if a part of the rest of the short conversation of the two young women had reached his ear biddy ventured to observe that she herself had studied modelling a little and that she could understand how any artist would think miss rooth a splendid subject if indeed she could attempt her head that would be a chance indeed  thank you said miriam with a laugh as of high comedy i think i had rather not passer par toute la famille then she added if your brothers an artist i dont understand how hes in parliament  oh he isnt in parliament nowwe only hope he will be  ah i see  and he isnt an artist either biddy felt herself conscientiously bound to state  then he isnt anything said miss rooth  wellhes immensely clever  ah i see miss rooth again replied mr nash has puffed him up so  i dont know mr nash said biddy guilty of a little dryness as well as of a little misrepresentation and feeling rather snubbed  well you neednt wish to  biddy stood with her a moment longer still looking at her and not knowing what to say next but not finding her any less handsome because she had such odd manners biddy had an ingenious little mind which always tried as much as possible to keep different things separate it was pervaded now by the reflexion attended with some relief that if the girl spoke to her with such unexpected familiarity of nick she said nothing at all about peter two gentlemen came up two of peters friends and made speeches to miss rooth of the kind biddy supposed people learned to make in paris it was also doubtless in paris the girl privately reasoned that they learned to listen to them as this striking performer listened she received their advances very differently from the way she had received biddys sherringham noticed his young kinswoman turn away still very red to go and sit near her mother again leaving miriam engaged with the two men it appeared to have come over her that for a moment she had been strangely spontaneous and bold and that she had paid a little of the penalty the seat next her mother was occupied by mrs rooth toward whom lady agness head had inclined itself with a preoccupied tolerance he had the conviction mrs rooth was telling her about the nevillenugents of castle nugent and that lady agnes was thinking it odd she never had heard of them he said to himself that biddy was generous she had urged julia to come in order that they might see how bad the strange young woman would be but now that the event had proved dazzling she forgot this calculation and rejoiced in what she innocently supposed to be the performers triumph she kept away from julia however she didnt even look at her to invite her also to confess that in vulgar parlance they had been sold he himself spoke to his sister who was leaning back with a detached air in the corner of a sofa saying something which led her to remark in reply ah i daresay its extremely fine but i dont care for tragedy when it treads on ones toes shes like a cow who has kicked over the milkingpail she ought to be tied up  my poor julia it isnt extremely fine it isnt fine at all sherringham returned with some irritation  pardon me then i thought that was why you invited us  i imagined she was different peter said a little foolishly  ah if you dont care for her so much the better it has always seemed to me you make too awfully much of those people  oh i do care for her toorather shes interesting his sister gave him a momentary mystified glance and he added and shes dreadful he felt stupidly annoyed and was ashamed of his annoyance as he could have assigned no reason for it it didnt grow less for the moment from his seeing gabriel nash approach julia introduced by nick dormer he gave place to the two young men with some alacrity for he had a sense of being put in the wrong in respect to their specimen by nashs very presence he remembered how it had been a part of their bargain as it were that he should present that gentleman to his sister he was not sorry to be relieved of the office by nick and he even tacitly and ironically wished his kinsmans friend joy of a colloquy with mrs dallow sherringhams life was spent with people he was used to people and both as host and as guest he carried the social burden in general lightly he could observe especially in the former capacity without uneasiness and take the temperature without anxiety but at present his company oppressed him he felt worried and that he showed itwhich was the thing in the world he had ever held least an honour to a gentleman dedicated to diplomacy he was vexed with the levity that had made him call his roomful together on so poor a pretext and yet was vexed with the stupidity that made the witnesses so evidently find the pretext sufficient he inwardly groaned at the delusion under which he had saddled himself with the tragic musea tragic muse who was strident and pertand yet wished his visitors would go away and leave him alone with her  nick dormer said to mrs dallow that he wanted her to know an old friend of his one of the cleverest men he knew and he added the hope that she would be gentle and encouraging with him he was so timid and so easily disconcerted mr nash hereupon dropped into a chair by the arm of her sofa their companion went away and mrs dallow turned her glance upon her new acquaintance without a perceptible change of position then she emitted with rapidity the remark its very awkward when people are told ones clever  its only awkward if one isnt gabriel smiled  yes but so few people areenough to be talked about  isnt that just the reason why such a matter such an exception ought to be mentioned to them he asked they mightnt find it out for themselves of course however as you say there ought to be a certainty then theyre surer to know it dormers a dear fellow but hes rash and superficial  mrs dallow at this incitement turned her glance a second time on her visitor but during the rest of the conversation she rarely repeated the movement if she liked nick dormer extremelyand it may without more delay be communicated to the reader that she didher liking was of a kind that opposed no difficulty whatever to her not liking in case of such a complication a person attached or otherwise belonging to him it was not in her nature to put up with others for the sake of an individual she loved the putting up was usually consumed in the loving and with nothing left over if the affection that isolates and simplifies its object may be distinguished from the affection that seeks communications and contracts for it julia dallows was quite of the encircling not to say the narrowing sort she was not so much jealous as essentially exclusive she desired no experience for the familiar and yet partly unsounded kinsman in whom she took an interest that she wouldnt have desired for herself and indeed the cause of her interest in him was partly the vision of his helping her to the particular extensions she did desirethe taste and thrill of great affairs and of public action to have such ambitions for him appeared to her the highest honour she could do him her conscience was in it as well as her inclination and her scheme to her sense was noble enough to varnish over any disdain she might feel for forces drawing him another way she had a prejudice in general against his existing connexions a suspicion of them and a supply of offhand contempt in waiting it was a singular circumstance that she was sceptical even when knowing her as well as he did he thought them worth recommending to her the recommendation indeed mostly confirmed the suspicion  this was a law from which gabriel nash was condemned to suffer if suffering could on any occasion be predicated of gabriel nash his pretension was in truth that he had purged his life of such possibilities of waste though probably he would have admitted that if that fair vessel should spring a leak the wound in its side would have been dealt by a womans hand in dining two evenings before with her brother and with the dormers mrs dallow had been moved to exclaim that peter and nick knew the most extraordinary people as regards peter the attitudinising girl and her mother now pointed that moral with sufficient vividness so that there was little arrogance in taking a similar quality for granted of the conceited man at her elbow who sat there as if he might be capable from one moment to another of leaning over the arm of her sofa she had not the slightest wish to talk with him about himself and was afraid for an instant that he was on the point of passing from the chapter of his cleverness to that of his timidity it was a false alarm however for he only animadverted on the pleasures of the elegant extract hurledliterally hurlé in generalfrom the centre of the room at ones defenceless head he intimated that in his opinion these pleasures were all for the performers the auditors had at any rate given miss rooth a charming afternoon that of course was what mrs dallows kind brother had mainly intended in arranging the little party julia hated to hear him call her brother kind the term seemed offensively patronising but he himself he related was now constantly employed in the same beneficence listening twothirds of his time to intonations and shrieks she had doubtless observed it herself how the great current of the age the adoration of the mime was almost too strong for any individual how it swept one along and dashed one against the rocks as she made no response to this proposition gabriel nash asked her if she hadnt been struck with the main sign of the time the preponderance of the mountebank the glory and renown the personal favour he enjoyed hadnt she noticed what an immense part of the public attention he held in london at least for in paris society was not so pervaded with him and the women of the profession in particular were not in every drawingroom  i dont know what you mean mrs dallow said i know nothing of any such people  arent they under your feet wherever you turntheir performances their portraits their speeches their autobiographies their names their manners their ugly mugs as the people say and their idiotic pretensions  i daresay it depends on the places one goes to if theyre everywhereand she paused a momenti dont go everywhere  i dont go anywhere but they mount on my back at home like the old man of the sea just observe a little when you return to london mr nash went on with friendly instructiveness julia got up at thisshe didnt like receiving directions but no other corner of the room appeared to offer her any particular reason for crossing to it she never did such a thing without a great inducement so she remained standing there as if she were quitting the place in a moment which indeed she now determined to do and her interlocutor rising also lingered beside her unencouraged but unperturbed he proceeded to remark that mr sherringham was quite right to offer miss rooth an afternoons sport she deserved it as a fine brave amiable girl she was highly educated knew a dozen languages was of illustrious lineage and was immensely particular  immensely particular mrs dallow repeated  perhaps i should say rather that her mothers so on her behalf particular about the sort of people they meetthe tone the standard im bound to say theyre like you they dont go everywhere that spirits not so common in the mob calling itself good society as not to deserve mention  she said nothing for a moment she looked vaguely round the room but not at miriam rooth nevertheless she presently dropped as in forced reference to her an impatient shake shes dreadfully vulgar  ah dont say that to my friend dormer mr nash laughed  are you and he such great friends mrs dallow asked meeting his eyes  great enough to make me hope we shall be greater  again for a little she said nothing but then went on why shouldnt i say to him that shes vulgar  because he admires her so much he wants to paint her  to paint her  to paint her portrait  oh i see i daresay shed do for that  mr nash showed further amusement if thats your opinion of her youre not very complimentary to the art he aspires to practise  he aspires to practise she echoed afresh  havent you talked with him about it ah you must keep him up to it  julia dallow was conscious for a moment of looking uncomfortable but it relieved her to be able to demand of her neighbour with a certain manner are you an artist  i try to be nash smiled but i work in such difficult material  he spoke this with such a clever suggestion of mysterious things that she was to hear herself once more pay him the attention of taking him up difficult material  i work in life  at this she turned away leaving him the impression that she probably misunderstood his speech thinking he meant that he drew from the living model or some such platitude as if there could have been any likelihood he would have dealings with the dead this indeed would not fully have explained the abruptness with which she dropped their conversation gabriel however was used to sudden collapses and even to sudden ruptures on the part of those addressed by him and no man had more the secret of remaining gracefully with his conversational wares on his hands he saw mrs dallow approach nick dormer who was talking with one of the ladies of the embassy and apparently signify that she wished to speak to him he got up and they had a minutes talk after which he turned and took leave of his fellowvisitors she said a word to her brother nick joined her and they then came together to the door in this movement they had to pass near nash and it gave her an opportunity to nod goodbye to him which he was by no means sure she would have done if nick hadnt been with her the young man just stopped he said to nash i should like to see you this evening late you must meet me somewhere  well take a walki should like that nash replied i shall smoke a cigar at the café on the corner of the place de lopérayoull find me there he prepared to compass his own departure but before doing so he addressed himself to the duty of a few civil words to lady agnes this effort proved vain for on one side she was defended by the wall of the room and on the other rendered inaccessible by miriams mother who clung to her with a quicklyrooted fidelity showing no symptom of desistance nash declined perforce upon her daughter grace who said to him you were talking with my cousin mrs dallow  to her rather than with her he smiled  ah shes very charming grace said  shes very beautiful  and very clever the girl continued  very very intelligent his conversation with miss dormer went little beyond this and he presently took leave of peter sherringham remarking to him as they shook hands that he was very sorry for him but he had courted his fate  what do you mean by my fate sherringham asked  youve got them for life  why for life when i now clearly and courageously recognise that she isnt good  ah but shell become so said gabriel nash  do you think that sherringham brought out with a candour that made his visitor laugh  you willthats more to the purpose the latter declared as he went away  ten minutes later lady agnes substituted a general vague assent for all further particular ones drawing off from mrs rooth and from the rest of the company with her daughters peter had had very little talk with biddy but the girl kept her disappointment out of her pretty eyes and said to him you told us she didnt know howbut she does there was no suggestion of disappointment in this  sherringham held her hand a moment ah its you who know how dear biddy he answered and he was conscious that if the occasion had been more private he would have all lawfully kissed her  presently three more of his guests took leave and mr nashs assurance that he had them for life recurred to him as he observed that mrs rooth and her damsel quite failed to profit by so many examples the lovicks remaineda colleague and his sociable wifeand peter gave them a hint that they were not to plant him there only with the two ladies miriam quitted mrs lovick who had attempted with no great subtlety to engage her and came up to her host as if she suspected him of a design of stealing from the room and had the idea of preventing it  i want some more tea will you give me some more i feel quite faint you dont seem to suspect how this sort of thing takes it out of one  peter apologised extravagantly for not having seen to it that she had proper refreshment and took her to the round table in a corner on which the little collation had been served he poured out tea for her and pressed bread and butter on her and petits fours of all which she profusely and methodically partook it was late the afternoon had faded and a lamp been brought in the wide shade of which shed a fair glow on the teaservice and the plates of pretty food the lovicks sat with mrs rooth at the other end of the room and the girl stood at the table drinking her tea and eating her bread and butter she consumed these articles so freely that he wondered if she had been truly in want of a mealif they were so poor as to have to count with that sort of privation this supposition was softening but still not so much so as to make him ask her to sit down she appeared indeed to prefer to stand she looked better so as if the freedom the conspicuity of being on her feet and treading a stage were agreeable to her while sherringham lingered near her all vaguely his hands in his pockets and his mind now void of everything but a planned evasion of the theatrical questionthere were moments when he was so plentifully tired of itshe broke out abruptly confess you think me intolerably bad  intolerablyno  only tolerably i find that worse  every now and then you do something very right sherringham said  how many such things did i do today  oh three or four i dont know that i counted very carefully  she raised her cup to her lips looking at him over the rim of ita proceeding that gave her eyes a strange expression it bores you and you think it disagreeable she then saidi mean a girl always talking about herself he protested she could never bore him and she added oh i dont want complimentsi want the hard the precious truth an actress has to talk about herself what else can she talk about poor vain thing  she can talk sometimes about other actresses  that comes to the same thing you wont be serious im awfully serious there was something that caught his attention in the note of thisa longing half hopeless half argumentative to be believed in if one really wants to do anything one must worry it out of course everything doesnt come the first day she kept on i cant see everything at once but i can see a little morestep by stepas i go cant i  thats the waythats the way he gently enough returned when you see the things to do the art of doing them will comeif you hammer away the great points to see them  yes and you dont think me clever enough for that  why do you say so when ive asked you to come here on purpose  youve asked me to come but ive had no success  on the contrary every one thought you wonderful  oh but they dont know said miriam rooth youve not said a word to me i dont mind your not having praised me that would be too banal but if im badand i know im dreadfuli wish youd talk to me about it  its delightful to talk to you peter found himself saying  no it isnt but its kind and she looked away from him  her voice had with this a quality which made him exclaim every now and then you say something  she turned her eyes back to him and her face had a light i dont want it to come by accident then she added if theres any good to be got from trying from showing ones self how can it come unless one hears the simple truth the truth that turns one inside out its all for thatto know what one is if ones a stick  youve great courage youve rare qualities sherringham risked she had begun to touch him to seem different he was glad she had not gone  but for a little she made no answer putting down her empty cup and yearning over the table as for something more to eat suddenly she raised her head and broke out with vehemence i will i will i will  youll do what you want evidently  i will succeedi will be great of course i know too little ive seen too little but ive always liked it ive never liked anything else i used to learn things and do scenes and rant about the room when i was but five years old she went on communicative persuasive familiar egotistical as was necessary and slightly common or perhaps only natural with reminiscences reasons and anecdotes an unexpected profusion and with an air of comradeship of freedom in any relation which seemed to plead that she was capable at least of embracing that side of the profession she desired to adopt he noted that if she had seen very little as she said she had also seen a great deal but both her experience and her innocence had been accidental and irregular she had seen very little actingthe theatre was always too expensive if she could only go oftenin paris for instance every night for six monthsto see the best the worst everything she would make things out would observe and learn what to do what not to do it would be a school of schools but she couldnt without selling the clothes off her back it was vile and disgusting to be poor and if ever she were to know the bliss of having a few francs in her pocket she would make up for itthat she could promise she had never been acquainted with any one who could tell her anythingif it was good or bad or right or wrongexcept mrs delamere and poor ruggieri she supposed they had told her a great deal but perhaps they hadnt and she was perfectly willing to give it up if it was bad evidently madame carré thought so she thought it was horrid wasnt it perfectly divine the way the old woman had said those verses those speeches of célie if she would only let her come and listen to her once in a while like that it was all she would ask she had got lots of ideas just from that halfhour she had practised them over over and over again the moment she got home he might ask her motherhe might ask the people next door if madame carré didnt think she could work she might have heard could she have listened at the door something that would show her but she didnt think her even good enough to criticisesince that wasnt criticism telling her her head was good of course her head was goodshe neednt travel up to the quartiers excentriques to find that out it was her mother the way she talked who gave the idea that she wanted to be elegant and moral and a femme du monde and all that sort of trash of course that put people off when they were only thinking of the real right way didnt she know miriam herself that this was the one thing to think of but any one would be kind to her mother who knew what a dear she was she doesnt know when any things right or wrong but shes a perfect saint said the girl obscuring considerably her vindication she doesnt mind when i say things over by the hour dinning them into her ears while she sits there and reads shes a tremendous reader shes awfully up in literature she taught me everything herself i mean all that sort of thing of course im not so fond of reading i go in for the book of life sherringham wondered if her mother had not at any rate taught her that phrasehe thought it highly probable it would give on my nerves the life i lead her miriam continued but shes really a delicious woman  the oddity of this epithet made peter laugh and altogether in a few minutes which is perhaps a sign that he abused his right to be a man of moods the young lady had produced in him a revolution of curiosity set his sympathy in motion her mixture as it spread itself before him was an appeal and a challenge she was sensitive and dense she was underbred and fine certainly she was very various and that was rare quite not at this moment the heavyeyed frightened creature who had pulled herself together with such an effort at madame carrés nor the elated phenomenon who had just been declaiming nor the rather affected and contradictious young person with whom he had walked home from the rue de constantinople was this succession of phases a sign she was really a case of the celebrated artistic temperament the nature that made people provoking and interesting that sherringham himself was of this shifting complexion is perhaps proved by his odd capacity for being of two different minds very nearly at the same time miriam was pretty now with felicities and graces with charming unusual eyes yes there were things he could do for her he had already forgotten the chill of mr nashs irony of his prophecy he was even scarce conscious how little in general he liked hints insinuations favours asked obliquely and plaintively that was doubtless also because the girl was suddenly so taking and so fraternising perhaps indeed it was unjust to qualify as roundabout the manner in which miss rooth conveyed that it was open to him not only to pay for her lessons but to meet the expense of her nightly attendance with her mother at instructive exhibitions of theatrical art it was a large order sending the pair to all the plays but what peter now found himself thinking of was not so much its largeness as the possible interest of going with them sometimes and pointing the moralthe technical oneof showing her the things he liked the things he disapproved she repeated her declaration that she recognised the fallacy of her mothers view of heroines impossibly virtuous and of the importance of her looking out for such tremendously proper people one must let her talk but of course it creates a prejudice she said with her eyes on mr and mrs lovick who had got up terminating their communion with mrs rooth its a great muddle i know but she cant bear anything coarse or nastyand quite right too i shouldnt either if i didnt have to but i dont care a sou where i go if i can get to act or who they are if theyll help me i want to actthats what i want to do i dont want to meddle in peoples affairs i can look out for myselfim all right the girl exclaimed roundly frankly with a ring of honesty which made her crude and pure as for doing the bad ones im not afraid of that  the bad ones  the bad women in the playslike madame carré ill do any vile creature  i think youll do best what you areand sherringham laughed for the interest of it youre a strange girl  je crois bien doesnt one have to be to want to go and exhibit ones self to a loathsome crowd on a platform with trumpets and a big drum for moneyto parade ones body and ones soul  he looked at her a moment her face changed constantly now it had a fine flush and a noble delicacy give it up youre too good for it he found himself pleading i doubt if youve an idea of what girls have to go through  never nevernever till im pelted she cried  then stay on here a bit ill take you to the theatres  oh you dear miriam delightedly exclaimed mr and mrs lovick accompanied by mrs rooth now crossed the room to them and the girl went on in the same tone mamma dear hes the best friend weve ever hadhes a great deal nicer than i thought  so are you mademoiselle said peter sherringham  oh i trust mr sherringhami trust him infinitely mrs rooth returned covering him with her mild respectable wheedling eyes the kindness of every one has been beyond everything mr and mrs lovick cant say enough they make the most obliging offers they want you to know their brother  oh i say hes no brother of mine mr lovick protested goodnaturedly  they think hell be so suggestive hell put us up to the right things mrs rooth went on  its just a little brother of minesuch a dear amusing clever boy mrs lovick explained  do you know she has got nine upon my honour she has said her husband this one is the sixth fancy if i had to take them all over  yes it makes it rather awkward mrs lovick amiably conceded he has gone on the stage poor darlingbut he acts rather well  he tried for the diplomatic service but he didnt precisely dazzle his examiners mr lovick further mentioned  edmunds very nasty about him there are lots of gentlemen on the stagehes not the first  its such a comfort to hear that said mrs rooth  im much obliged to you has he got a theatre miriam asked  my dear young lady he hasnt even got an engagement replied the young mans terrible brotherinlaw  he hasnt been at it very long but im sure hell get on hes immensely in earnest and very goodlooking i just said that if he should come over to see us you might rather like to meet him he might give you some tips as my husband says  i dont care for his looks but i should like his tips miriam liberally smiled  and is he coming over to see you asked sherringham to whom while this exchange of remarks which he had not lost was going on mrs rooth had in lowered accents addressed herself  not if i can help it i think but mr lovick was so gaily rude that it wasnt embarrassing  oh sir im sure youre fond of him mrs rooth remonstrated as the party passed together into the antechamber  no really i like some of the othersfour or five of them but i dont like arty  well make it up to him then well like him miriam answered with spirit and her voice rang in the staircasesherringham attended them a little waywith a charm which her host had rather missed in her loudness of the day before     ix   nick dormer found his friend nash that evening at the place of their trystsmoking a cigar in the warm bright night on the terrace of the café forming one of the angles of the place de lopéra he sat down with him but at the end of five minutes uttered a protest against the crush and confusion the publicity and vulgarity of the place the shuffling procession of the crowd the jostle of fellowcustomers the perpetual brush of waiters come away i want to talk to you and i cant talk here i dont care where we go it will be pleasant to walk well stroll away to the quartiers sérieux each time i come to paris i at the end of three days take the boulevard with its conventional grimace into greater aversion i hate even to cross iti go half a mile round to avoid it  the young men took their course together down the rue de la paix to the rue de rivoli which they crossed passing beside the gilded rails of the tuileries the beauty of the nightthe only defect of which was that the immense illumination of paris kept it from being quite night enough made it a sort of bedizened rejuvenated daygave a charm to the quieter streets drew our friends away to the right to the river and the bridges the older duskier city the pale ghost of the palace that had perished by fire hung over them a while and by the passage now open at all times across the garden of the tuileries they came out upon the seine they kept on and on moving slowly smoking talking pausing stopping to look to emphasise to compare they fell into discussion into confidence into inquiry sympathetic or satiric and into explanations which needed in turn to be explained the balmy night the time for talk the amusement of paris the memory of younger passages gave a lift to the occasion nick had already forgotten his little brush with julia on his leaving peters teaparty at her side and that he had been almost disconcerted by the asperity with which she denounced the odious man he had taken it into his head to force upon her impertinent and fatuous she had called him and when nick began to plead that he was really neither of these things though he could imagine his manner might sometimes suggest them she had declared that she didnt wish to argue about him or ever to hear of him again nick hadnt counted on her liking gabriel nash but had thought her not liking him wouldnt perceptibly matter he had given himself the diversion not cruel surely to any one concerned of seeing what she would make of a type she had never before met she had made even less than he expected and her intimation that he had played her a trick had been irritating enough to prevent his reflecting that the offence might have been in some degree with nash but he had recovered from his resentment sufficiently to ask this personage with every possible circumstance of implied consideration for the lady what had been the impression made by his charming cousin  upon my word my dear fellow i dont regard that as a fair question gabriel said besides if you think mrs dallow charming what on earth need it matter to you what i think the superiority of one mans opinion over anothers is never so great as when the opinions about a woman  it was to help me to find out what i think of yourself nick returned  oh that youll never do i shall bewilder you to the end the lady with whom you were so good as to make me acquainted is a beautiful specimen of the english gardenflower the product of high cultivation and much tending a tall delicate stem with the head set upon it in a manner which as a thing seen and remembered should doubtless count for us as a gift of the gods shes the perfect type of the object raised or bred and everything about her hangs together and conduces to the effect from the angle of her elbow to the way she drops that vague conventional dry little oh which dispenses with all further performance that degree of completeness is always satisfying but i didnt satisfy her and she didnt understand me i dont think they usually understand  shes no worse than i then  ah she didnt try  no she doesnt try but she probably thought you a monster of conceit and she would think so still more if she were to hear you talk about her trying  very likelyvery likely said gabriel nash ive an idea a good many people think that it strikes me as comic i suppose its a result of my little system  what little system  oh nothing more wonderful than the idea of being just the same to every one people have so bemuddled themselves that the last thing they can conceive is that one should be simple  lord do you call yourself simple nick ejaculated  absolutely in the sense of having no interest of my own to push no nostrum to advertise no power to conciliate no axe to grind im not a savageah far from itbut i really think im perfectly independent  well thats always provoking nick knowingly returned  so it would appear to the great majority of ones fellowmortals and i well remember the pang with which i originally made that discovery it darkened my spirit at a time when i had no thought of evil what we like when were unregenerate is that a newcomer should give us a password come over to our side join our little camp or religion get into our little boat in short whatever it is and help us to row it its natural enough were mostly in different tubs and cockles paddling for life our opinions our convictions and doctrines and standards are simply the particular thing that will make the boat goour boat naturally for they may very often be just the thing that will sink another if you wont get in people generally hate you  your metaphors very lame said nick its the overcrowded boat that goes to the bottom  oh ill give it another leg or two boats can be big in the infinite of space and a doctrines a raft that floats the better the more passengers it carries a passenger jumps over from time to time not so much from fear of sinking as from a want of interest in the course or the company he swims he plunges he dives he dips down and visits the fishes and the mermaids and the submarine caves he goes from craft to craft and splashes about on his own account in the blue cool water the regenerate as i call them are the passengers who jump over in search of better fun i jumped over long ago  and now of course youre at the head of the regenerate for in your turnnick found the figure delightfulyou all form a select school of porpoises  not a bit and i know nothing about headsin the sense you mean ive grown a tail if you will im the merman wandering free its the jolliest of trades  before they had gone many steps further nick dormer stopped short with a question i say my dear fellow do you mind mentioning to me whether youre the greatest humbug and charlatan on earth or a genuine intelligence one that has sifted things for itself  i do lead your poor british wit a danceim so sorry nash replied benignly but im very sincere and i have tried to straighten out things a bit for myself  then why do you give people such a handle  such a handle  for thinking youre anfor thinking youre a mere farceur  i daresay its my manner theyre so unused to any sort of candour  well then why dont you try another nick asked  one has the manner that one can and mine moreovers a part of my little system  ah if you make so much of your little system youre no better than any one else nick returned as they went on  i dont pretend to be better for were all miserable sinners i only pretend to be bad in a pleasanter brighter wayby what i can see its the simplest thing in the world just take for granted our right to be happy and brave whats essentially kinder and more helpful than that whats more beneficent but the tradition of dreariness of stodginess of dull dense literal prose has so sealed peoples eyes that theyve ended by thinking the most natural of all things the most perverse why so keep up the dreariness in our poor little day no one can tell me why and almost every one calls me names for simply asking the question but i go on for i believe one can do a little good by it i want so much to do a little good gabriel nash continued taking his companions arm my persistence is systematic dont you see what i mean i wont be drearyno no no and i wont recognise the necessity or even if there be any way out of it the accident of dreariness in the life that surrounds me thats enough to make people stare theyre so damned stupid  they think you so damned impudent nick freely explained  at this nash stopped him short with a small cry and turning his eyes nick saw under the lamps of the quay that he had brought a flush of pain into his friends face i dont strike you that way  oh me wasnt it just admitted that i dont in the least make you out  thats the last thing nash declared as if he were thinking the idea over with an air of genuine distress but with a little patience well clear it up togetherif you care enough about it he added more cheerfully letting his companion proceed again he continued heaven help us all what do people mean by impudence there are many i think who dont understand its nature or its limits and upon my word ive literally seen mere quickness of intelligence or of perception the jump of a step or two a little whirr of the wings of talk mistaken for it yes ive encountered men and women who thought you impudent if you werent simply so stupid as they the only impudence is unprovoked or even mere dull aggression and i indignantly protest that im never guilty of that clumsiness ah for what do they take one with their beastly presumption even to defend myself sometimes ive to make believe to myself that i care i always feel as if i didnt successfully make others think so perhaps they see impudence in that but i daresay the offence is in the things that i take as i say for granted for if one tries to be pleased one passes perhaps inevitably for being pleased above all with ones self thats really not my casei find my capacity for pleasure deplorably below the mark ive set this is why as ive told you i cultivate it i try to bring it up and im actuated by positive benevolence ive that impudent pretension thats what i mean by being the same to every one by having only one manner if ones conscious and ingenious to that end whats the harmwhen ones motives are so pure by never never making the concession one may end by becoming a perceptible force for good  what concession are you talking about in gods name nick demanded  why that were here all for dreariness its impossible to grant it sometimes if you wish to deny it ever  and what do you mean then by dreariness thats modern slang and terribly vague many good things are drearyvirtue and decency and charity and perseverance and courage and honour  say at once that lifes dreary my dear fellow gabriel nash exclaimed  thats on the whole my besetting impression  cest là que je vous attends im precisely engaged in trying what can be done in taking it the other way its my little personal experiment life consists of the personal experiments of each of us and the point of an experiment is that it shall succeed what we contribute is our treatment of the material our rendering of the text our style a sense of the qualities of a style is so rare that many persons should doubtless be forgiven for not being able to read or at all events to enjoy us but is that a reason for giving it upfor not being in this other sphere if one possibly can an addison a ruskin a renan ah we must write our best its the great thing we can do in the world on the right side one has ones form que diable and a mighty good thing that one has im not afraid of putting all life into mine and without unduly squeezing it im not afraid of putting in honour and courage and charitywithout spoiling them on the contrary i shall only do them good people may not read you at sight may not like you but theres a chance theyll come round and the only way to court the chance is to keep it upalways to keep it up thats what i do my dear manif you dont think ive perseverance if some ones touched here and there if you give a little impression of truth and charm thats your reward besides of course the pleasure for yourself  dont you think your styles a trifle affected nick asked for further amusement  thats always the charge against a personal manner if youve any at all people think youve too much perhaps perhapswho can say the lurking unexpressed is infinite and affectation must have begun long ago with the first act of reflective expressionthe substitution of the few placed articulate words for the cry or the thump or the hug of course one isnt perfect but thats the delightful thing about art that theres always more to learn and more to do it grows bigger the more one uses it and meets more questions the more they come up no doubt im rough still but im in the right direction i make it my business to testify for the fine  ah the finethere it stands over there said nick dormer im not so sure about yoursi dont know what ive got hold of but notre dame is truth notre dame is charm on notre dame the distracted mind can rest come over with me and look at her  they had come abreast of the low island from which the great cathedral disengaged today from her old contacts and adhesions rises high and fair with her front of beauty and her majestic mass darkened at that hour or at least simplified under the stars but only more serene and sublime for her happy union far aloft with the cool distance and the night our young men fantasticating as freely as i leave the reader to estimate crossed the wide short bridge which made them face toward the monuments of old paristhe palais de justice the conciergerie the holy chapel of saint louis they came out before the church which looks down on a square where the past once so thick in the very heart of paris has been made rather a blank pervaded however by the everlasting freshness of the vast cathedralface it greeted nick dormer and gabriel nash with a kindness the long centuries had done nothing to dim the lamplight of the old city washed its foundations but the towers and buttresses the arches the galleries the statues the vast rosewindow the large full composition seemed to grow clearer while they climbed higher as if they had a conscious benevolent answer for the upward gaze of men  how it straightens things out and blows away ones vapoursanything thats done said nick while his companion exclaimed blandly and affectionately  the dear old thing  the great points to do something instead of muddling and questioning and by jove it makes me want to  want to build a cathedral nash inquired  yes just that  its you who puzzle me then my dear fellow you cant build them out of words  what is it the great poets do asked nick  their words are ideastheir words are images enchanting collocations and unforgettable signs but the verbiage of parliamentary speeches  well said nick with a candid reflective sigh you can rear a great structure of many thingsnot only of stones and timbers and painted glass they walked round this example of one pausing criticising admiring and discussing mingling the grave with the gay and paradox with contemplation behind and at the sides the huge dusky vessel of the church seemed to dip into the seine or rise out of it floating expansivelya ship of stone with its flying buttresses thrown forth like an array of mighty oars nick dormer lingered near it in joy in soothing content as if it had been the temple of a faith so dear to him that there was peace and security in its precinct and there was comfort too and consolation of the same sort in the company at this moment of nashs equal appreciation of his response by his own signs to the great effect he took it all in so and then so gave it all out that nick was reminded of the radiance his boyish admiration had found in him of old the easy grasp of everything of that kind everything of that kind was to nicks sense the description of a wide and bright domain  they crossed to the farther side of the river where the influence of the gothic monument threw a distinction even over the parisian smartnessesthe municipal rule and measure the importunate symmetries the handsomeness of everything the extravagance of gaslight the perpetual click on the neat bridges in front of a quiet little café on the left bank gabriel nash said lets sit downhe was always ready to sit down it was a friendly establishment and an unfashionable quarter far away from the caravanseries there were the usual little tables and chairs on the quay the muslin curtains behind the glazed front the general sense of sawdust and of drippings of watery beer the place was subdued to stillness but not extinguished by the lateness of the hour no vehicles passed only now and then a light parisian foot beyond the parapet they could hear the flow of the seine nick dormer said it made him think of the old paris of the great revolution of madame roland quoi gabriel said they could have watery beer but were not obliged to drink it they sat a long time they talked a great deal and the more they said the more the unsaid came up presently nash found occasion to throw out i go about my business like any good citizenthats all  and what is your business  the spectacle of the world  nick laughed out and what do you do with that  what does any one do with spectacles i look at it i see  youre full of contradictions and inconsistencies nick however objected you described yourself to me half an hour ago as an apostle of beauty  wheres the inconsistency i do it in the broad light of day whatever i do thats virtually what i meant if i look at the spectacle of the world i look in preference at whats charming in it sometimes ive to go far to find itvery likely but thats just what i do i go faras far as my means permit me last year i heard of such a delightful little spot a place where a wild figtree grows in the south wall the outer side of an old spanish city i was told it was a deliciously brown cornerthe sun making it warm in winter as soon as i could i went there  and what did you do  i lay on the first green grassi liked it  if that sort of things all you accomplish youre not encouraging  i accomplish my happinessit seems to me thats something i have feelings i have sensations let me tell you thats not so common its rare to have them and if you chance to have them its rare not to be ashamed of them i go after themwhen i judge they wont hurt any one  youre lucky to have money for your travelling expenses said nick  no doubt no doubt but i do it very cheap i take my stand on my nature on my fortunate character im not ashamed of it i dont think its so horrible my character but weve so befogged and befouled the whole question of liberty of spontaneity of good humour and inclination and enjoyment that theres nothing that makes people stare so as to see one natural  youre always thinking too much of people  they say i think too little gabriel smiled  well ive agreed to stand for harsh said nick with a roundabout transition  its you then who are lucky to have money  i havent nick explained my expenses are to be paid  then you too must think of people  nick made no answer to this but after a moment said i wish very much you had more to show for it  to show for what  your little systemthe æsthetic life  nash hesitated tolerantly gaily as he often did with an air of being embarrassed to choose between several answers any one of which would be so right oh having something to shows such a poor business its a kind of confession of failure  yes youre more affected than anything else said nick impatiently  no my dear boy im more goodnatured dont i prove it im rather disappointed to find you not more accessible to esoteric doctrine but there is i confess another plane of intelligence honourable and very honourable in its way from which it may legitimately appear important to have something to show if you must confine yourself to that plane i wont refuse you my sympathy after all thats what i have to show but the degree of my sympathy must of course depend on the nature of the demonstration you wish to make  you know it very wellyouve guessed it nick returned looking before him in a conscious modest way which would have been called sheepish had he been a few years younger  ah youve broken the scent with telling me youre going back to the house of commons said nash  no wonder you dont make it out my situations certainly absurd enough what i really hanker for is to be a painter and of portraits on the whole i think thats the abject crude ridiculous fact in this outoftheway corner at the dead of night in lowered tones i venture to disclose it to you isnt that the æsthetic life  do you know how to paint asked nash  not in the least no element of burlesque is therefore wanting to my position  that makes no difference im so glad  so glad i dont know how  so glad of it all yes that only makes it better youre a delightful case and i like delightful cases we must see it through i rejoice i met you again  do you think i can do anything nick inquired  paint good pictures how can i tell without seeing some of your work doesnt it come back to me that at oxford you used to sketch very prettily but thats the last thing that matters  what does matter then nick asked with his eyes on his companion  to be on the right sideon the side of the fine  therell be precious little of the fine if i produce nothing but daubs  ah you cling to the old false measure of success i must cure you of that therell be the beauty of having been disinterested and independent of having taken the world in the free brave personal way  i shall nevertheless paint decently if i can nick presently said  im almost sorry it will make your case less clear your example less grand  my example will be grand enough with the fight i shall have to make  the fight with whom  with myself first of all im awfully against it  ah but youll have me on the other side nash smiled  well youll have more than a handful to meeteverything every one that belongs to me that touches me near or far my family my blood my heredity my traditions my promises my circumstances my prejudices my little pastsuch as it is my great futuresuch as it has been supposed it may be  i see i see its splendid nash exclaimed and mrs dallow into the bargain he added  yes mrs dallow if you like  are you in love with her  not in the least  well she is with youso i understood  dont say that said nick dormer with sudden sternness  ah you are you are his companion pronounced judging apparently from this accent  i dont know what i amheaven help me nick broke out tossing his hat down on his little tin table with vehemence im a freak of nature and a sport of the mocking gods why should they go out of their way to worry me why should they do everything so inconsequent so improbable so preposterous its the vulgarest practical joke there has never been anything of the sort among us were all philistines to the core with about as much esthetic sense as that hat its excellent soili dont complain of itbut not a soil to grow that flower from where the devil then has the seed been dropped i look back from generation to generation i scour our annals without finding the least little sketching grandmother any sign of a building or versifying or collecting or even tulipraising ancestor they were all as blind as bats and none the less happy for that im a wanton variation an unaccountable monster my dear father rest his soul went through life without a suspicion that theres anything in it that cant be boiled into bluebooks and became in that conviction a very distinguished person he brought me up in the same simplicity and in the hope of the same eminence it would have been better if i had remained so i think its partly your fault that i havent nick went on at oxford you were very bad company for memy evil genius you opened my eyes you communicated the poison since then little by little it has been working within me vaguely covertly insensibly at first but during the last year or two with violence pertinacity cruelty ive resorted to every antidote in life but its no useim stricken cest vénus toute entière à sa proie attachéeputting venus for art it tears me to pieces as i may say  i see i follow you said nash who had listened to this recital with radiant interest and curiosity and thats why you are going to stand  preciselyits an antidote and at present youre another  another  thats why i jumped at you a bigger dose of you may disagree with me to that extent that i shall either die or get better  i shall control the dilution said nash poor fellowif youre elected he added  poor fellow either way you dont know the atmosphere in which i live the horror the scandal my apostasy would provoke the injury and suffering it would inflict i believe it would really kill my mother she thinks my fathers watching me from the skies  jolly to make him jump nash suggested  hed jump indeedcome straight down on top of me and then the grotesqueness of itto begin all of a sudden at my age  its perfect indeed its too lovely a case nash raved  think how it soundsa paragraph in the london papers mr nicholas dormer m p for harsh and son of the late right honourable and so forth and so forth is about to give up his seat and withdraw from public life in order to devote himself to the practice of portraitpaintingand with the more commendable perseverance by reason of all the dreadful time he has lost orders in view of this respectfully solicited  the nineteenth centurys a sweeter time than i thought said nash its the portrait then that haunts your dreams  i wish you could see you must of course come immediately to my place in london  perfidious wretch youre capable of having talentwhich of course will spoil everything gabriel wailed  no im too old and was too early perverted its too late to go through the mill  you make me young dont miss your election at your peril think of the edification  the edification  of your throwing it all up the next moment  that would be pleasant for mr carteret nick brooded  mr carteret  a dear old family friend wholl wish to pay my agents bill  serve him right for such depraved tastes  you do me good said nick as he rose and turned away  dont call me useless then  ah but not in the way you mean its only if i dont get in that i shall perhaps console myself with the brush nick returned with humorous edifying elegance while they retraced their steps  for the sake of all the muses then dont stand for you will get in  very likely at any rate ive promised  youve promised mrs dallow  its her placeshell put me in nick said  baleful woman but ill pull you out cried gabriel nash     x   for several days peter sherringham had business in hand which left him neither time nor freedom of mind to occupy himself actively with the ladies of the hôtel de la garonne there were moments when they brushed across his memory but their passage was rapid and not lighted with complacent attention for he shrank from bringing to the proof the question of whether miriam would be an interest or only a bore she had left him after their second meeting with a quickened sympathy but in the course of a few hours that flame had burned dim like most other men he was a mixture of impulse and reflexion but was peculiar in this that thinking things over almost always made him think less conveniently he found illusions necessary so that in order to keep an adequate number going he often forbade himself any excess of that exercise mrs rooth and her daughter were there and could certainly be trusted to make themselves felt he was conscious of their anxiety and their calculations as of a frequent oppression and knew that whatever results might ensue he should have to do the costly thing for them an idea of tenacity of worrying feminine duration associated itself with their presence he would have assented with a silent nod to the propositionenunciated by gabriel nashthat he was saddled with them remedies hovered before him but these figured also at the same time as complications ranging vaguely from the expenditure of money to the discovery that he was in love this latter accident would be particularly tedious he had a full perception of the arts by which the girls mother might succeed in making it so it wouldnt be a compensation for trouble but a trouble which in itself would require compensations would that balm spring from the spectacle of the young ladys genius the genius would have to be very great to justify a rising young diplomatist in making a fool of himself  with the excuse of pressing work he put off miss rooth from day to day and from day to day he expected to hear her knock at his door it would be time enough when they ran him to earth again and he was unable to see how after all he could serve them even then he had proposed impetuously a course of the theatres but that would be a considerable personal effort now that the summer was about to begina free bid for bad air stale pieces and tired actors when however more than a week had elapsed without a reminder of his neglected promise it came over him that he must himself in honour give a sign there was a delicacy in such unexpected and such difficult discretionhe was touched by being let alone the flurry of work at the embassy was over and he had time to ask himself what in especial he should do he wanted something definite to suggest before communicating with the hôtel de la garonne  as a consequence of this speculation he went back to madame carré to ask her to reconsider her stern judgement and give the young english ladyto oblige hima dozen lessons of the sort she knew so well how to give he was aware that this request scarcely stood on its feet for in the first place madame carré never reconsidered when once she had got her impression and in the second never wasted herself on subjects whom nature had not formed to do her honour he knew his asking her to strain a point to please him would give her a false ideasave that for that matter she had it alreadyof his relations actual or prospective with the girl but he decided he neednt care for this since miriam herself probably wouldnt care what he had mainly in mind was to say to the old actress that she had been mistakenthe jeune anglaise wasnt such a grue this would take some courage but it would also add to the amusement of his visit  he found her at home but as soon as he had expressed his conviction she began oh your jeune anglaise i know a great deal more about her than you she has been back to see me twice she doesnt go the longest way round she charges me like a grenadier and asks me to give herguess a little whatprivate recitations all to herself if she doesnt succeed it wont be for want of knowing how to thump at doors the other day when i came in she was waiting for me she had been there two hours my private recitationshave you an idea what people pay for them  between artists you know there are easier conditions sherringham laughed  how do i know if shes an artist she wont open her mouth to me what she wants is to make me say things to her she does make mei dont know howand she sits there gaping at me with her big eyes they look like open pockets  i daresay shell profit by it said sherringham  i daresay you will her face is stupid while she watches me and when she has tired me out she simply walks away however as she comes back  madame carré paused a moment listened and then cried didnt i tell you  sherringham heard a parley of voices in the little antechamber and the next moment the door was pushed open and miriam rooth bounded into the room she was flushed and breathless without a smile very direct  will you hear me today i know four things she immediately broke out then seeing sherringham she added in the same brisk earnest tone as if the matter were of the highest importance oh how dye do im very glad youre here she said nothing else to him than this appealed to him in no way made no allusion to his having neglected her but addressed herself to madame carré as if he had not been there making no excuses and using no flattery taking rather a tone of equal authorityall as if the famous artist had an obvious duty toward her this was another variation peter thought it differed from each of the attitudes in which he had previously seen her it came over him suddenly that so far from there being any question of her having the histrionic nature she simply had it in such perfection that she was always acting that her existence was a series of parts assumed for the moment each changed for the next before the perpetual mirror of some curiosity or admiration or wondersome spectatorship that she perceived or imagined in the people about her interested as he had ever been in the profession of which she was potentially an ornament this idea startled him by its novelty and even lent on the spot a formidable a really appalling character to miriam rooth it struck him abruptly that a woman whose only being was to make believe to make believe she had any and every being you might like and that would serve a purpose and produce a certain effect and whose identity resided in the continuity of her personations so that she had no moral privacy as he phrased it to himself but lived in a high wind of exhibition of figurationsuch a woman was a kind of monster in whom of necessity there would be nothing to be fond of because there would be nothing to take hold of he felt for a moment how simple he had been not to have achieved before this analysis of the actress the girls very face made it vivid to him nowthe discovery that she positively had no countenance of her own but only the countenance of the occasion a sequence a varietycapable possibly of becoming immenseof representative movements she was always trying them practising them for her amusement or profit jumping from one to the other and extending her range and this would doubtless be her occupation more and more as she acquired ease and confidence the expression that came nearest belonging to her as it were was the one that came nearest being a blankan air of inanity when she forgot herself in some act of sincere attention then her eye was heavy and her mouth betrayed a commonness though it was perhaps just at such a moment that the fine line of her head told most she had looked slightly bête even when sherringham on their first meeting at madame carrés said to nick dormer that she was the image of the tragic muse  now at any rate he seemed to see that she might do what she liked with her face it was an elastic substance an element of guttapercha like the flexibility of the gymnast the lady at the musichall who is shot from the mouth of a cannon he winced a little at this coarser view of the actress he had somehow always looked more poetically at that priestess of art yet what was she the priestess when one came to think of it but a female gymnast a mountebank at higher wages she didnt literally hang by her heels from a trapeze and hold a fat man in her teeth but she made the same use of her tongue of her eyes of the imitative trick that her muscular sister made of leg and jaw it was an odd circumstance that miss rooths face seemed to him today a finer instrument than old madame carrés it was doubtless that the girls was fresh and strong and had a future in it while poor madame carrés was worn and weary and had only a past  the old woman said something half in jest half in real resentment about the brutality of youth while miriam went to a mirror and quickly took off her hat patting and arranging her hair as a preliminary to making herself heard sherringham saw with surprise and amusement that the keen frenchwoman who had in her long life exhausted every adroitness was in a manner helpless and coerced obliging all in spite of herself her young friend had taken but a few days and a couple of visits to become a successful force she had imposed herself and madame carré while she laughedyet looked terrible too with such high artifices of eye and gesturewas reduced to the last line of defence that of pronouncing her coarse and clumsy saying she might knock her down but that this proved nothing she spoke jestingly enough not to offend but her manner betrayed the irritation of an intelligent woman who at an advanced age found herself for the first time failing to understand what she didnt understand was the kind of social product thus presented to her by gabriel nash and this suggested to sherringham that the jeune anglaise was perhaps indeed rare a new type as madame carré must have seen innumerable varieties he saw the girl was perfectly prepared to be abused and that her indifference to what might be thought of her discretion was a proof of life health and spirit the insolence of conscious resources  when she had given herself a touch at the glass she turned round with a rapid ecoutez maintenant and stood leaning a momentslightly lowered and inclined backward her hands behind her and supporting heron the console before the mirror she waited an instant turning her eyes from one of her companions to the other as to take possession of theman eminently conscious intentional proceeding which made sherringham ask himself what had become of her former terror and if that and her tears had all been a comedy after which abruptly straightening herself she began to repeat a short french poem an ingenious thing of the day that she had induced madame carré to say over to her she had learned it practised it rehearsed it to her mother and had now been childishly eager to show what she could do with it what she mainly did was to reproduce with a crude fidelity but in extraordinary detail the intonations the personal quavers and cadences of her model  how bad you make me seem to myself and if i were you how much better i should say it was madame carrés first criticism  miriam allowed her however little time to develop it for she broke out at the shortest intervals with the several other specimens of verse to which the old actress had handed her the key they were all fine lyrics of tender or ironic intention by contemporary poets but depending for effect on taste and art a mastery of the rare shade and the right touch in the interpreter miriam had gobbled them up and she gave them forth in the same way as the first with close rude audacious mimicry there was a moment for sherringham when it might have been feared their hostess would see in the performance a designed burlesque of her manner her airs and graces her celebrated simpers and grimaces so extravagant did it all cause these refinements to appear when it was over the old woman said should you like now to hear how you do and without waiting for an answer phrased and trilled the last of the pieces from beginning to end exactly as her visitor had done making this imitation of an imitation the drollest thing conceivable if she had suffered from the sound of the girls echo it was a perfect revenge miriam had dropped on a sofa exhausted and she stared at first flushed and wild then she frankly gave way to pleasure to interest and large laughter she said afterwards to defend herself that the verses in question and indeed all those she had recited were of the most difficult sort you had to do them they didnt do themselvesthey were things in which the gros moyens were of no avail  ah my poor child your means are all gros moyens you appear to have no others madame carré replied you do what you can but there are people like that its the way theyre made they can never come nearer to fine truth to the just indication shades dont exist for them they dont see certain differences it was to show you a difference that i repeated that thing as you repeat it as you represent my doing it if youre struck with the little the two ways have in common so much the better but you seem to me terribly to alourdir everything you touch  peter read into this judgement a deep irritationmiriam clearly set the teeth of her instructress on edge she acted on her nerves was made up of roughnesses and thicknesses unknown hitherto to her fine freeplaying fingertips this exasperation however was a degree of flattery it was neither indifference nor simple contempt it acknowledged a mystifying reality in the jeune anglaise and even a shade of importance the latter remarked serenely enough that the things she wanted most to do were just those that were not for the gros moyens the vulgar obvious dodges the starts and shouts that any one could think of and that the gros public liked she wanted to do what was most difficult and to plunge into it from the first and she explained as if it were a discovery of her own that there were two kinds of scenes and speeches those which acted themselves of which the treatment was plain the only way so that you had just to take it and those open to interpretation with which you had to fight every step rendering arranging doing the thing according to your idea some of the most effective passages and the most celebrated and admired like the frenzy of juliet with her potion were of the former sort but it was the others she liked best  madame carré received this revelation goodnaturedly enough considering its want of freshness and only laughed at the young lady for looking so nobly patronising while she gave it her laughter appeared partly addressed to the good faith with which miriam described herself as preponderantly interested in the subtler problems of her art sherringham was charmed with the girls pluckif it was pluck and not mere density the stout patience with which she submitted for a purpose to the old womans rough usage he wanted to take her away to give her a friendly caution to advise her not to become a bore not to expose herself but she held up her beautiful head as to show how little she cared at present for any exposure and that it was half coarsenessmadame carré was so far rightand half fortitude she had no intention of coming away so long as there was anything to be picked up she sat and still she sat challenging her hostess with every sort of questionsome reasonable some ingenious some strangely futile and some highly indiscreet but all with the effect that contrary to peters expectation their distinguished friend warmed to the work of answering and explaining became interested was content to keep her and to talk yes she took her ease she relieved herself with the rare cynicism of the artistall the crudity the irony and intensity of a discussion of esoteric thingsof personal mysteries of methods and secrets it was the oddest hour our young man had ever spent even in the course of investigations which had often led him into the cuisine the distillery or back shop of the admired profession he got up several times to come away then he remained partly in order not to leave miriam alone with her terrible initiatress partly because he was both amused and edified and partly because madame carré held him by the appeal of her sharp confidential old eyes addressing her talk to himself with miriam but a pretext and subject a vile illustration she undressed this young lady as it were from head to foot turned her inside out weighed and measured and sounded her it was all for sherringham a new revelation of the point to which in her profession and nation an intelligence of the business a ferocious analysis had been carried and a special vocabulary developed what struck him above all was the way she knew her grounds and reasons so that everything was sharp and clear in her mind and lay under her hand if she had rare perceptions she had traced them to their source she could give an account of what she did she knew perfectly why could explain it defend it amplify it fight for it all of which was an intellectual joy to her allowing her a chance to abound and insist and discriminate there was a kind of cruelty or at least of hardness in it all to poor peters shy english sense that sense which can never really reconcile itself to any question of method and form and has extraneous sentiments to square to pacify with compromises and superficialities the general plea for innocence in everything and often the flagrant proof of it in theory there was nothing he valued more than just such a logical passion as madame carrés but it was apt in fact when he found himself at close quarters with it to appear an ado about nothing  if the old woman was hard it was not that many of her present conclusions about the jeune anglaise were not indulgent but that she had a vision of the great manner of right and wrong of the just and the false so high and religious that the individual was nothing before ita prompt and easy sacrifice it made our friend uncomfortable as he had been made uncomfortable by certain feuilletons reviews of the theatres in the paris newspapers which he was committed to thinking important but of which when they were very good he was rather ashamed when they were very good that is when they were very thorough they were very personal as was inevitable in dealing with the most personal of the arts they went into details they put the dots on the is they discussed impartially the qualities of appearance the physical gifts of the poor aspirant finding them in some cases reprehensibly inadequate peter could never rid himself of a dislike to these pronouncements in the case of the actresses especially they struck him as brutal and offensiveunmanly as launched by an ensconced moustachioed critic over a cigar at the same time he was aware of the dilemma he hated it it made him blush still more in which his objection lodged him if one was right in caring for the actors art one ought to have been interested in every honest judgement of it which given the peculiar conditions would be useful in proportion as it should be free if the criticism that recognised frankly these conditions seemed an inferior or an unholy thing then what was to be said for the art itself what an implication if the criticism was tolerable only so long as it was worthlessso long as it remained vague and timid this was a knot peter had never straightened out he contented himself with feeling that there was no reason a theatrical critic shouldnt be a gentleman at the same time that he often dubbed it an odious trade which no gentleman could possibly follow the best of the fraternity so conspicuous in paris were those who didnt follow itthose who while pretending to write about the stage wrote about everything else  it was as if madame carré in pursuance of her inflamed sense that the art was everything and the individual nothing save as he happened to serve it had said well if she will have it she shall she shall know what shes in for what i went through battered and broken in as we all have beenall who are worthy who have had the honour she shall know the real point of view it was as if she were still beset with mrs rooths twaddle and muddle her hypocrisy her idiotic scruplessomething she felt all need to belabour to trample on miriam took it all as a bath a baptism with shuddering joy and gleeful splashes staring wondering sometimes blushing and failing to follow but not shrinking nor wounded laughing when convicted at her own expense and feeling evidently that this at last was the high cold air of art an initiation a discipline that nothing could undo sherringham said he would see her homehe wanted to talk to her and she must walk away with him and its understood then she may come back he added to madame carré its my affair of course youll take an interest in her for a month or two shell sit at your feet  the old actress had an admirable shrug oh ill knock her aboutshe seems stout enough     xi   when they had descended to the street miriam mentioned to peter that she was thirsty dying to drink something upon which he asked her if she should have an objection to going with him to a café  objection ive spent my life in cafés theyre warm in winter and you get your lamplight for nothing she explained mamma and i have sat in them for hours many a time with a consommation of three sous to save fire and candles at home weve lived in places we couldnt sit in if you want to knowwhere there was only really room if we were in bed mammas moneys sent out from england and sometimes it usednt to come once it didnt come for monthsfor months and months i dont know how we lived there wasnt any to come there wasnt any to get home that isnt amusing when youre away in a foreign town without any friends mamma used to borrow but people wouldnt always lend you neednt be afraidshe wont borrow of you were rather better nowsomething has been done in england i dont understand what its only fivepence a year but it has been settled it comes regularly it used to come only when we had written and begged and waited but it made no differencemamma was always up to her ears in books they served her for food and drink when she had nothing to eat she began a novel in ten volumesthe oldfashioned ones they lasted longest she knows every cabinet de lecture in every town the little cheap shabby ones i mean in the back streets where they have odd volumes and only ask a sou and the books are so old that they smell like close rooms she takes them to the cafésthe little cheap shabby cafés tooand she reads there all the evening thats very well for her but it doesnt feed me i dont like a diet of dirty old novels i sit there beside her with nothing to do not even a stocking to mend she doesnt think that comme il faut i dont know what the people take me for however weve never been spoken to any one can see mammas a great lady as for me i daresay i might be anything dreadful if youre going to be an actress you must get used to being looked at there were people in england who used to ask us to stay some of them were our cousinsor mamma says they were ive never been very clear about our cousins and i dont think they were at all clear about us some of them are dead the others dont ask us any more you should hear mamma on the subject of our visits in england its very convenient when your cousins are deadthat explains everything mamma has delightful phrases my family is almost extinct then your family may have been anything you like ours of course was magnificent we did stay in a place once where there was a deerpark and also private theatricals i played in them i was only fifteen years old but i was very big and i thought i was in heaven ill go anywhere you like you neednt be afraid weve been in places ive learned a great deal that waysitting beside mamma and watching people their faces their types their movements theres a great deal goes on in cafés people come to them to talk things over their private affairs their complications they have important meetings oh ive observed scenes between men and womenvery quiet terribly quiet but awful pathetic tragic once i saw a woman do something that im going to do some day when im greatif i can get the situation ill tell you what it is sometimeill do it for you oh it is the book of life  so miriam discoursed familiarly disconnectedly as the pair went their way down the rue de constantinople and she continued to abound in anecdote and remark after they were seated face to face at a little marble table in an establishment peter had selected carefully and where he had caused her at her request to be accommodated with sirop dorgeat i know what it will come to madame carré will want to keep me this was one of the felicities she presently threw off  to keep you  for the french stage she wont want to let you have me she said things of that kind astounding in selfcomplacency the assumption of quick success she was in earnest evidently prepared to work but her imagination flew over preliminaries and probations took no account of the steps in the process especially the first tiresome ones the hard test of honesty he had done nothing for her as yet given no substantial pledge of interest yet she was already talking as if his protection were assured and jealous certainly however she seemed to belong to him very much indeed as she sat facing him at the paris café in her youth her beauty and her talkative confidence this degree of possession was highly agreeable to him and he asked nothing more than to make it last and go further the impulse to draw her out was irresistible to encourage her to show herself all the way for if he was really destined to take her career in hand he counted on some good equivalentsuch for instance as that she should at least amuse him  its very singular i know nothing like it he saidyour equal mastery of two languages  say of halfadozen miriam smiled  oh i dont believe in the others to the same degree i dont imagine that with all deference to your undeniable facility youd be judged fit to address a german or an italian audience in their own tongue but you might a french perfectly and theyre the most particular of all for their idioms supersensitive and theyre incapable of enduring the baragouinage of foreigners to which we listen with such complacency in fact your french is better than your englishits more conventional there are little queernesses and impurities in your english as if you had lived abroad too much ah you must work that  ill work it with you i like the way you speak  you must speak beautifully you must do something for the standard  for the standard  well there isnt any after all peter had a drop it has gone to the dogs  oh ill bring it back i know what you mean  no one knows no one cares the sense is goneit isnt in the public he continued ventilating a grievance he was rarely able to forget the vision of which now suddenly made a mission full of possible sanctity for his companion purity of speech on our stage doesnt exist every one speaks as he likes and audiences never notice its the last thing they think of the place is given up to abominable dialects and individual tricks any vulgarity flourishes and on top of it all the americans with every conceivable crudity come in to make confusion worse confounded and when one laments it people stare they dont know what one means  do you mean the grand manner certain pompous pronunciations the style of the kembles  i mean any style that is a style thats a system a consistency an art that contributes a positive beauty to utterance when i pay ten shillings to hear you speak i want you to know how que diable say that to people and theyre mostly lost in stupor only a few the very intelligent exclaim then you want actors to be affected  and do you asked miriam full of interest  my poor child what else under the sun should they be isnt their whole art the affectation par excellence the public wont stand that today so one hears it said if that be true it simply means that the theatre as i care for it that is as a personal art is at an end  never never never the girl cried in a voice that made a dozen people look round  i sometimes think itthat the personal art is at an end and that henceforth we shall have only the arts capable no doubt of immense development in their wayindeed theyve already reached itof the stagecarpenter and the costumer in london the drama is already smothered in scenery the interpretation scrambles off as it can to get the old personal impression which used to be everything you must go to the poor countries and most of all to italy  oh ive had it its very personal said miriam knowingly  youve seen the nudity of the stage the poor painted tattered screen behind and before that void the histrionic figure doing everything it knows how in complete possession the personality isnt our english personality and it may not always carry us with it but the directions right and it has the superiority that its a human exhibition not a mechanical one  i can act just like an italian miriam eagerly proclaimed  id rather you acted like an englishwoman if an englishwoman would only act  oh ill show you  but youre not english said peter sociably his arms on the table  i beg your pardon you should hear mamma about our race  youre a jewessim sure of that he went on  she jumped at this as he was destined to see later she would ever jump at anything that might make her more interesting or striking even at things that grotesquely contradicted or excluded each other thats always possible if ones clever im very willing because i want to be the english rachel  then you must leave madame carré as soon as youve got from her what she can give  oh you neednt fear you shant lose me the girl replied with charming gross fatuity my names jewish she went on but it was that of my grandmother my fathers mother she was a baroness in germany that is she was the daughter of a baron  peter accepted this statement with reservations but he replied put all that together and it makes you very sufficiently of rachels tribe  i dont care if im of her tribe artistically im of the family of the artistsje me fiche of any other im in the same style as that womani know it  you speak as if you had seen her he said amused at the way she talked of that woman oh i know all about heri know all about all the great actors but that wont prevent me from speaking divine english  you must learn lots of verse you must repeat it to me sherringham went on you must break yourself in till you can say anything you must learn passages of milton passages of wordsworth  did they write plays  oh it isnt only a matter of plays you cant speak a part properly till you can speak everything else anything that comes up especially in proportion as its difficult that gives you authority  oh yes im going in for authority theres more chance in english the girl added in the next breath there are not so many othersthe terrible competition there are so many herenot that im afraid she chattered on but weve got america and they havent americas a great place  you talk like a theatrical agent theyre lucky not to have it as we have it some of them do go and it ruins them  why it fills their pockets miriam cried  yes but see what they pay its the death of an actor to play to big populations that dont understand his language its nothing then but the gros moyens all his delicacy perishes however theyll understand you  perhaps i shall be too affected she said  you wont be more so than garrick or mrs siddons or john kemble or edmund kean they understood edmund kean all reflexion is affectation and all actings reflexion  i dont knowmines instinct miriam contended  my dear young lady you talk of yours but dont be offended if i tell you that yours doesnt exist some day it willif the thing comes off madame carrés does because she has reflected the talent the desire the energy are an instinct but by the time these things become a performance theyre an instinct put in its place  madame carrés very philosophic i shall never be like her  of course you wontyoull be original but youll have your own ideas  i daresay i shall have a good many of yoursand she smiled at him across the table  they sat a moment looking at each other dont go in for coquetry peter then said its a waste of time  well thats civil the girl cried  oh i dont mean for me i mean for yourself i want you to be such good faith im bound to give you stiff advice you dont strike me as flirtatious and that sort of thing and its much in your favour  in my favour  it does save time  perhaps it saves too much dont you think the artist ought to have passions  peter had a pause he thought an examination of this issue premature flirtations are not passions he replied no youre simpleat least i suspect you are for of course with a woman one would be clever to know  she asked why he pronounced her simple but he judged it best and more consonant with fair play to defer even a treatment of this branch of the question so that to change the subject he said be sure you dont betray me to your friend mr nash  betray you do you mean about your recommending affectation  dear me no he recommends it himself that is he practises it and on a scale  but he makes one hate it  he proves what i mean said sherringham that the great comedians the one who raises it to a science if we paid ten shillings to listen to mr nash we should think him very fine but we want to know what its supposed to be  its too odious the way he talks about us miriam cried assentingly  about us  us poor actors  its the competition he dislikes peter laughed  however hes very goodnatured he lent mamma thirty pounds the girl added honestly our young man at this information was not able to repress a certain small twinge noted by his companion and of which she appeared to mistake the meaning of course hell get it back she went on while he looked at her in silence a little fortune had not supplied him profusely with money but his emotion was caused by no foresight of his probably having also to put his hand in his pocket for mrs rooth it was simply the instinctive recoil of a fastidious nature from the idea of familiar intimacy with people who lived from hand to mouth together with a sense that this intimacy would have to be defined if it was to go much further he would wish to know what it was supposed to be like nashs histrionics miriam after a moment mistook his thought still more completely and in doing so flashed a portent of the way it was in her to strike from time to time a note exasperatingly almost consciously vulgar which one would hate for the reason along with others that by that time one would be in love with her well then he wontif you dont believe it she easily laughed he was saying to himself that the only possible form was that they should borrow only from him youre a funny man i make you blush she persisted  i must reply with the tu quoque though ive not that effect on you  i dont understand said the girl  youre an extraordinary young lady  you mean im horrid well i daresay i am but im better when you know me  he made no direct rejoinder to this but after a moment went on your mother must repay that money ill give it her  you had better give it him cried miriam if once mamma has it she interrupted herself and with another and a softer tone one of her professional transitions remarked i suppose youve never known any one that was poor  im poor myself that is im very far from rich but why receive favours and here he in turn checked himself with the sense that he was indeed taking a great deal on his back if he pretended alreadyhe had not seen the pair three timesto regulate their intercourse with the rest of the world but the girl instantly carried out his thought and more than his thought  favours from mr nash oh he doesnt count  the way she dropped these wordsthey would have been admirable on the stagemade him reply with prompt ease what i meant just now was that youre not to tell him after all my swagger that i consider that you and i are really required to save our theatre  oh if we can save it he shall know it she added that she must positively get home her mother would be in a state she had really scarce ever been out alone he mightnt think it but so it was her mothers ideas those awfully proper ones were not all talk she did keep her sherringham accepted thishe had an adequate and indeed an analytic vision of mrs rooths conservatism but he observed at the same time that his companion made no motion to rise he made none either he only said  were very frivolous the way we chatter what you want to do to get your foot in the stirrup is supremely difficult theres everything to overcome youve neither an engagement nor the prospect of an engagement  oh youll get me one her manner presented this as so certain that it wasnt worth dilating on so instead of dilating she inquired abruptly a second time why do you think im so simple  i dont then didnt i tell you just now that you were extraordinary thats the term moreover that you applied to yourself when you came to see mewhen you said a girl had to be a kind of monster to wish to go on the stage it remains the right term and your simplicity doesnt mitigate it whats rare in you is that you haveas i suspect at leastno nature of your own miriam listened to this as if preparing to argue with it or not only as it should strike her as a sufficiently brave picture but as yet naturally she failed to understand youre always at concert pitch or on your horse there are no intervals its the absence of intervals of a fond or background that i dont comprehend youre an embroidery without a canvas  yesperhaps the girl replied her head on one side as if she were looking at the pattern of this rarity but im very honest  you cant be everything both a consummate actress and a flower of the field youve got to choose  she looked at him a moment im glad you think im so wonderful  your feigning may be honest in the sense that your only feeling is your feigned one peter pursued thats what i mean by the absence of a ground or of intervals its a kind of thing thats a labyrinth  i know what i am she said sententiously  but her companion continued following his own train were you really so frightened the first day you went to madame carrés  she stared then with a flush threw back her head do you think i was pretending  i think you always are however your vanityif you had anywould be natural  ive plenty of that im not a bit ashamed to own it  youd be capable of trying to do the human peacock but excuse the audacity and the crudity of my speculationsit only proves my interest what is it that you know you are  why an artist isnt that a canvas  yes an intellectual but not a moral  ah its everything and im a good girl toowont that do  it remains to be seen sherringham laughed a creature whos absolutely all an artistim curious to see that  surely it has been seenin lots of painters lots of musicians  yes but those arts are not personal like yours i mean not so much so theres something left forwhat shall i call itfor character  she stared again with her tragic light and do you think i havent a character as he hesitated she pushed back her chair rising rapidly  he looked up at her an instantshe seemed so plastic and then rising too answered delightful being youve a hundred     xii   the summer arrived and the dense air of the paris theatres became in fact a still more complicated mixture yet the occasions were not few on which sherringham having placed a box near the stage most often a stuffy dusky baignoire at the disposal of mrs rooth and her daughter found time just to look in as he said to spend a part of the evening with them and point the moral of the performance the pieces the successes of the winter had entered the automatic phase they went on by the force of the impetus acquired deriving little fresh life from the interpretation and in ordinary conditions their strong points as rendered by the actors would have been as wearisome to this student as an importunate repetition of a good story but it was not long before he became aware that the conditions couldnt be taken for ordinary there was a new infusion in his consciousnessan element in his life which altered the relations of things he was not easy till he had found the right name for ita name the more satisfactory that it was simple comprehensive and plausible a new distraction in the french sense was what he flattered himself he had discovered he could recognise that as freely as possible without being obliged to classify the agreeable resource as a new entanglement he was neither too much nor too little diverted he had all his usual attention to give to his work he had only an employment for his odd hours which without being imperative had over various others the advantage of a certain continuity  and yet i hasten to add he was not so well pleased with it but that among his friends he maintained for the present a rich reserve about it he had no irresistible impulse to describe generally how he had disinterred a strange handsome girl whom he was bringing up for the theatre she had been seen by several of his associates at his rooms but was not soon to be seen there again his reserve might by the illnatured have been termed dissimulation inasmuch as when asked by the ladies of the embassy what had become of the young person who had amused them that day so cleverly he gave it out that her whereabouts was uncertain and her destiny probably obscure he let it be supposed in a word that his benevolence had scarcely survived an accidental a charitable occasion as he went about his customary business and perhaps even put a little more conscience into the transaction of it there was nothing to suggest to others that he was engaged in a private speculation of an absorbing kind it was perhaps his weakness that he carried the apprehension of ridicule too far but his excuse may have dwelt in his holding it unpardonable for a man publicly enrolled in the service of his country to be markedly ridiculous it was of course not out of all order that such functionaries their private situation permitting should enjoy a personal acquaintance with stars of the dramatic the lyric or even the choregraphic stage high diplomatists had indeed not rarely and not invisibly cultivated this privilege without its proving the sepulchre of their reputation that a gentleman who was not a fool should consent a little to become one for the sake of a celebrated actress or singercela sétait vu though it was not perhaps to be recommended it was not a tendency that was encouraged at headquarters where even the most rising young men were not incited to believe they could never fall still it might pass if kept in its place and there were ancient worthies yet in the professionthough not those whom the tradition had helped to go furthestwho held that something of the sort was a graceful ornament of the diplomatic character sherringham was aware he was very rising but miriam rooth was not yet a celebrated actress she was only a young artist in conscientious process of formation and encumbered with a mother still more conscientious than herself she was a jeune anglaisea lady withalvery earnest about artistic about remunerative problems he had accepted the office of a formative influence and that was precisely what might provoke derision he was a ministering angelhis patience and good nature really entitled him to the epithet and his rewards would doubtless some day define themselves but meanwhile other promotions were in precarious prospect for the failure of which these would not even in their abundance be a compensation he kept an unembarrassed eye on downing street and while it may frankly be said for him that he was neither a pedant nor a prig he remembered that the last impression he ought to wish to produce there was that of a futile estheticism  he felt the case sufficiently important however when he sat behind miriam at the play and looked over her shoulder at the stage her observation being so keen and her comments so unexpected in their vivacity that his curiosity was refreshed and his attention stretched beyond its wont if the exhibition before the footlights had now lost much of its annual brilliancy the fashion in which she followed it was perhaps exhibition enough the attendance of the little party was moreover in most cases at the théâtre français and it has been sufficiently indicated that our friend though the child of a sceptical age and the votary of a cynical science was still candid enough to take the serious the religious view of that establishment the view of m sarcey and of the unregenerate provincial mind in the trade i follow we see things too much in the hard light of reason of calculation he once remarked to his young charge but its good for the mind to keep up a superstition or two it leaves a marginlike having a second horse to your brougham for nightwork the arts the amusements the esthetic part of life are nightwork if i may say so without suggesting that theyre illicit at any rate you want your second horseyour superstition that stays at home when the suns highto go your rounds with the français is my second horse  miriams appetite for this interest showed him vividly enough how rarely in the past it had been within her reach and she pleased him at first by liking everything seeing almost no differences and taking her deep draught undiluted she leaned on the edge of the box with bright voracity tasting to the core yet relishing the surface watching each movement of each actor attending to the way each thing was said or done as if it were the most important thing and emitting from time to time applausive or restrictive sounds it was a charming show of the critical spirit in ecstasy sherringham had his wonder about it as a part of the attraction exerted by this young lady was that she caused him to have his wonder about everything she did was it in fact a conscious show a line taken for effect so that at the comédie her own display should be the most successful of all that question danced attendance on the liberal intercourse of these young people and fortunately as yet did little to embitter sherringhams share of it his general sense that she was personating had its especial moments of suspense and perplexity and added variety and even occasionally a degree of excitement to their commerce at the theatre for the most part she was really flushed with eagerness and with the spectators who turned an admiring eye into the dim compartment of which she pervaded the front she might have passed for a romantic or at least an insatiable young woman from the country  mrs rooth took a more general view but attended immensely to the story in respect to which she manifested a patient good faith which had its surprises and its comicalities for her daughters patron she found no play too tedious no entracte too long no baignoire too hot no tissue of incidents too complicated no situation too unnatural and no sentiments too sublime she gave him the measure of her power to sit and sitan accomplishment to which she owed in the struggle for existence such superiority as she might be said to have achieved she could outsit everybody and everything looking as if she had acquired the practice in repeated years of small frugality combined with large leisureperiods when she had nothing but hours and days and years to spend and had learned to calculate in any situation how long she could stay staying was so often a savinga saving of candles of fire and even as it sometimes implied a scheme for stray refection of food peter saw soon enough how bravely her shreds and patches of gentility and equanimity hung together with the aid of whatever casual pins and other makeshifts and if he had been addicted to studying the human mixture in its different combinations would have found in her an interesting compendium of some of the infatuations that survive a hard discipline he made indeed without difficulty the reflexion that her life might have taught her something of the real at the same time that he could scarce help thinking it clever of her to have so persistently declined the lesson she appeared to have put it by with a deprecating ladylike smilea plea of being too soft and bland for experience  she took the refined sentimental tender view of the universe beginning with her own history and feelings she believed in everything high and pure disinterested and orthodox and even at the hôtel de la garonne was unconscious of the shabby or the ugly side of the world she never despaired otherwise what would have been the use of being a nevillenugent only not to have been onethat would have been discouraging she delighted in novels poems perversions misrepresentations and evasions and had a capacity for smooth superfluous falsification which made our young man think her sometimes an amusing and sometimes a tedious inventor but she wasnt dangerous even if you believed her she wasnt even a warning if you didnt it was harsh to call her a hypocrite since you never could have resolved her back into her character there being no reverse at all to her blazonry she built in the air and was not less amiable than she pretended only that was a pretension too she moved altogether in a world of elegant fable and fancy and sherringham had to live there with her for miriams sake live there in sociable vulgar assent and despite his feeling it rather a low neighbourhood he was at a loss how to take what she saidshe talked sweetly and discursively of so many thingstill he simply noted that he could only take it always for untrue when miriam laughed at her he was rather disagreeably affected dear mammas fine stories was a sufficiently cynical reference to the immemorial infirmity of a parent but when the girl backed her up as he phrased it to himself he liked that even less  mrs rooth was very fond of a moral and had never lost her taste for edification she delighted in a beautiful character and was gratified to find so many more than she had supposed represented in the contemporary french drama she never failed to direct miriams attention to them and to remind her that there is nothing in life so grand as a sublime act above all when sublimely explained peter made much of the difference between the mother and the daughter thinking it singularly markedthe way one took everything for the sense or behaved as if she did caring only for the plot and the romance the triumph or defeat of virtue and the moral comfort of it all and the way the other was alive but to the manner and the art of it the intensity of truth to appearances mrs rooth abounded in impressive evocations and yet he saw no link between her facile genius and that of which miriam gave symptoms the poor lady never could have been accused of successful deceit whereas the triumph of fraud was exactly what her clever child achieved she made even the true seem fictive while miriams effort was to make the fictive true sherringham thought it an odd unpromising stock that of the nevillenugents for a dramatic talent to have sprung from till he reflected that the evolution was after all natural the figurative impulse in the mother had become conscious and therefore higher through finding an aim which was beauty in the daughter likely enough the hebraic mr rooth with his love of old pots and christian altarcloths had supplied in the girls composition the esthetic element the sense of colour and form in their visits to the theatre there was nothing mrs rooth more insisted on than the unprofitableness of deceit as shown by the most distinguished authorsthe folly and degradation the corrosive effect on the spirit of tortuous ways their companion soon gave up the futile task of piecing together her incongruous references to her early life and her family in england he renounced even the doctrine that there was a residuum of truth in her claim of great relationships since existent or not he cared equally little for her ramifications the principle of this indifference was at bottom a certain desire to disconnect and isolate miriam for it was disagreeable not to be independent in dealing with her and he could be fully so only if she herself were  the early weeks of that summerthey went on indeed into augustwere destined to establish themselves in his memory as a season of pleasant things the ambassador went away and peter had to wait for his own holiday which he did during the hot days contentedly enoughwaited in spacious halls and a vast dim birdhaunted garden the official world and most other worlds withdrew from paris and the place de la concorde a larger whiter desert than ever became by a reversal of custom explorable with safety the champs elysées were dusty and rural with little creaking booths and exhibitions that made a noise like grasshoppers the arc de triomphe threw its cool thick shadow for a mile the palais de lindustrie glittered in the light of the long days the cabmen in their red waistcoats dozed inside their boxes while sherringham permitted himself a pot hat and rarely met a friend thus was miriam as islanded as the chained andromeda and thus was it possible to deal with her even perseuslike in deep detachment the theatres on the boulevard closed for the most part but the great temple of the rue de richelieu with an esthetic responsibility continued imperturbably to dispense examples of style madame carré was going to vichy but had not yet taken flight which was a great advantage for miriam who could now solicit her attention with the consciousness that she had no engagements en ville  i make her listen to mei make her tell me said the ardent girl who was always climbing the slope of the rue de constantinople on the shady side where of july mornings a smell of violets came from the moist flowerstands of fat whitecapped bouquetières in the angles of doorways miriam liked the paris of the summer mornings the clever freshness of all the little trades and the openair life the cries the talk from door to door which reminded her of the south where in the multiplicity of her habitations she had lived and most of all the great amusement or nearly of her walk the enviable baskets of the laundress piled up with frilled and fluted whitenessthe certain luxury she felt while she passed with quick prevision of her own dawn of glory the greatest amusement perhaps was to recognise the pretty sentiment of earliness the particular congruity with the hour in the studied selected dress of the little tripping women who were taking the day for important advantages while it was tender at any rate she mostly brought with her from her passage through the town good humour enoughwith the penny bunch of violets she always stuck in the front of her dressfor whatever awaited her at madame carrés she declared to her friend that her dear mistress was terribly severe giving her the most difficult the most exhausting exercises showing a kind of rage for breaking her in  so much the better sherringham duly answered but he asked no questions and was glad to let the preceptress and the pupil fight it out together he wanted for the moment to know as little as possible about their ways together he had been overdosed with that knowledge while attending at their second interview he would send madame carré her moneyshe was really most obligingand in the meantime was certain miriam could take care of herself sometimes he remarked to her that she neednt always talk shop to him there were times when he was mortally tired of shopof hers moreover he frankly admitted that he was tired of his own so that the restriction was not brutal when she replied staring why i thought you considered it as such a beautiful interesting art he had no rejoinder more philosophic than well i do but there are moments when im quite sick of it all the same at other times he put it oh yes the results the finished thing the dish perfectly seasoned and served not the mess of preparationat least not alwaysnot the experiments that spoil the material  i supposed you to feel just these questions of study of the artistic education as youve called it to me so fascinating the girl persisted she was sometimes so flatly lucid  well after all im not an actor myself he could but impatiently sigh  you might be one if you were serious she would imperturbably say to this her friend replied that mr gabriel nash ought to hear this which made her promise with a certain grimness that she would settle him and his theories some day not to seem too inconsistentfor it was cruel to bewilder her when he had taken her up to enlightenpeter repeated over that for a man like himself the interest of the whole thing depended on its being considered in a large liberal way and with an intelligence that lifted it out of the question of the little tricks of the trade gave it beauty and elevation but she hereupon let him know that madame carré held there were no little tricks that everything had its importance as a means to a great end and that if you were not willing to try to approfondir the reason why in a given situation you should scratch your nose with your left hand rather than with your right you were not worthy to tread any stage that respected itself  thats very well but if i must go into details read me a little shelley groaned the young man in the spirit of a high raffiné  youre worse than madame carré you dont know what to invent between you youll kill me the girl declared i think theres a secret league between you to spoil my voice or at least to weaken my souffle before i get it but à la guerre comme à la guerre how can i read shelley however when i dont understand him  thats just what i want to make you do its a part of your general training you may do without that of coursewithout culture and taste and perception but in that case youll be nothing but a vulgar cabotine and nothing will be of any consequence he had a theory that the great lyric poetshe induced her to read and recite as well long passages of wordsworth and swinburnewould teach her many of the secrets of the large utterance the mysteries of rhythm the communicableness of style the latent music of the language and the art of composing copious speeches and of retaining her stores of free breath he held in perfect sincerity that there was a general sense of things things of the mind which would be of the highest importance to her and to which it was by good fortune just in his power to contribute she would do better in proportion as she had more knowledgeeven knowledge that might superficially show but a remote connexion with her business the actors talent was essentially a gift a thing by itself implanted instinctive accidental equally unconnected with intellect and with virtuesherringham was completely of that opinion but it struck him as no bêtise to believe at the same time that intellectleaving virtue for the moment out of the questionmight be brought into fruitful relation with it it would be a bigger thing if a better mind were projected upon itprojected without sacrificing the mind so he lent his young friend books she never readshe was on almost irreconcilable terms with the printed page save for spouting itand in the long summer days when he had leisure took her to the louvre to admire the great works of painting and sculpture here as on all occasions he was struck with the queer jumble of her taste her mixture of intelligence and puerility he saw she never read what he gave her though she sometimes would shamelessly have liked him to suppose so but in the presence of famous pictures and statues she had remarkable flashes of perception she felt these things she liked them though it was always because she had an idea she could use them the belief was often presumptuous but it showed what an eye she had to her business i could look just like that if i tried thats the dress i mean to wear when i do portia such were the observations apt to drop from her under the suggestion of antique marbles or when she stood before a titian or a bronzino  when she uttered them and many others besides the effect was sometimes irritating to her adviser who had to bethink himself a little that she was no more egotistical than the histrionic conscience required he wondered if there were necessarily something vulgar in the histrionic consciencesomething condemned only to feel the tricky personal question wasnt it better to be perfectly stupid than to have only one eye open and wear for ever in the great face of the world the expression of a knowing wink at the theatre on the numerous july evenings when the comédie française exhibited the repertory by the aid of exponents determined the more sparse and provincial audience should have a taste of the tradition her appreciation was tremendously technical and showed it was not for nothing she was now in and out of madame carrés innermost counsels but there were moments when even her very acuteness seemed to him to drag the matter down to see it in a small and superficial sense what he flattered himself he was trying to do for herand through her for the stage of his time since she was the instrument and incontestably a fine one that had come to his handwas precisely to lift it up make it rare keep it in the region of distinction and breadth however she was doubtless right and he was wrong he eventually reasoned you could afford to be vague only if you hadnt a responsibility he had fine ideas but she was to act them out that is to apply them and not he and application was of necessity a vulgarisation a smaller thing than theory if she should some day put forth the great art it wasnt purely fanciful to forecast for her the matter would doubtless be by that fact sufficiently transfigured and it wouldnt signify that some of the onward steps should have been lame  this was clear to him on several occasions when she recited or motioned or even merely looked something for him better than usual then she quite carried him away making him wish to ask no more questions but only let her disembroil herself in her own strong fashion in these hours she gave him forcibly if fitfully that impression of beauty which was to be her justification it was too soon for any general estimate of her progress madame carré had at last given her a fine understanding as well as a sore personal an almost physical sense of how bad she was she had therefore begun on a new basis had returned to the alphabet and the drill it was a phase of awkwardness the splashing of a young swimmer but buoyancy would certainly come out of it for the present there was mainly no great alteration of the fact that when she did things according to her own idea they were not as yet and seriously judged worth the devil as madame carré said and when she did them according to that of her instructress were too apt to be a gross parody of that ladys intention none the less she gave glimpses and her glimpses made him feel not only that she was not a foolthis was small reliefbut that he himself was not  he made her stick to her english and read shakespeare aloud to him mrs rooth had recognised the importance of apartments in which they should be able to receive so beneficent a visitor and was now mistress of a small salon with a balcony and a rickety flowerstandto say nothing of a view of many roofs and chimneysa very uneven waxed floor an empire clock an armoire à glace highly convenient for miriams posturings and several cupboard doors covered over allowing for treacherous gaps with the faded magenta paper of the wall the thing had been easily done for sherringham had said oh we must have a sittingroom for our studies you know and ill settle it with the landlady mrs rooth had liked his weindeed she liked everything about himand he saw in this way that she heaved with no violence under pecuniary obligations so long as they were distinctly understood to be temporary that he should have his money back with interest as soon as miriam was launched was a comfort so deeply implied that it only added to intimacy the window stood open on the little balcony and when the sun had left it peter and miriam could linger there leaning on the rail and talking above the great hum of paris with nothing but the neighbouring tiles and tall tubes to take account of mrs rooth in limp garments much ungirdled was on the sofa with a novel making good her frequent assertion that she could put up with any life that would yield her these two conveniences there were romantic works peter had never read and as to which he had vaguely wondered to what class they were addressedthe earlier productions of m eugène sue the oncefashionable compositions of madame sophie gaywith which mrs rooth was familiar and which she was ready to enjoy once more if she could get nothing fresher she had always a greasy volume tucked under her while her nose was bent upon the pages in hand she scarcely looked up even when miriam lifted her voice to show their benefactor what she could do these tragic or pathetic notes all went out of the window and mingled with the undecipherable concert of paris so that no neighbour was disturbed by them the girl shrieked and wailed when the occasion required it and mrs rooth only turned her page showing in this way a great esthetic as well as a great personal trust  she rather annoyed their visitor by the serenity of her confidencefor a reason he fully understood only latersave when miriam caught an effect or a tone so well that she made him in the pleasure of it forget her parents contiguity he continued to object to the girls english with its foreign patches that might pass in prose but were offensive in the recitation of verse and he wanted to know why she couldnt speak like her mother he had justly to acknowledge the charm of mrs rooths voice and tone which gave a richness even to the foolish things she said they were of an excellent insular tradition full both of natural and of cultivated sweetness and they puzzled him when other indications seemed to betray herto refer her to more common air they were like the reverberation of some faroff tutored circle  the connexion between the development of miriams genius and the necessity of an occasional excursion to the countrythe charming country that lies in so many directions beyond the parisian banlieuewould not have been immediately apparent to a superficial observer but a day and then another at versailles a day at fontainebleau and a trip particularly harmonious and happy to rambouillet took their places in our young mans plan as a part of the indirect but contributive culture an agency in the formation of taste intimations of the grand manner for instance would proceed in abundance from the symmetrical palace and gardens of louis xiv peter adored versailles and wandered there more than once with the ladies of the hôtel de la garonne they chose quiet hours when the fountains were dry and mrs rooth took an armful of novels and sat on a bench in the park flanked by clipped hedges and old statues while her young companions strolled away walked to the trianon explored the long straight vistas of the woods rambouillet was vague and vivid and sweet they felt that they found a hundred wise voices there and indeed there was an old white chateau which contained nothing but ghostly sounds they found at any rate a long luncheon and in the landscape the very spirit of silvery summer and of the french pictorial brush  i have said that in these days sherringham wondered about many things and by the time his leave of absence came this practice had produced a particular speculation he was surprised that he shouldnt be in love with miriam rooth and considered at moments of leisure the causes of his exemption he had felt from the first that she was a nature and each time she met his eyes it seemed to come to him straighter that her beauty was rare you had to get the good view of her face but when you did so it was a splendid mobile mask and the wearer of this high ornament had frankness and courage and varietyno end of the unusual and the unexpected she had qualities that seldom went togetherimpulses and shynesses audacities and lapses something coarse popular and strong all intermingled with disdains and languors and nerves and then above all she was there was accessible almost belonged to him he reflected ingeniously that he owed his escape to a peculiar causeto the fact that they had together a positive outside object objective as it were was all their communion not personal and selfish but a matter of art and business and discussion discussion had saved him and would save him further for they would always have something to quarrel about sherringham who was not a diplomatist for nothing who had his reasons for steering straight and wished neither to deprive the british public of a rising star nor to exchange his actual situation for that of a yoked impresario blessed the beneficence the salubrity the pure exorcism of art at the same time rather inconsistently and feeling that he had a completer vision than before of that oddest of animals the artist who happens to have been born a woman he felt warned against a serious connexionhe made a great point of the seriouswith so slippery and ticklish a creature the two ladies had only to stay in paris save their candleends and as madame carré had enjoined practise their scales there were apparently no autumn visits to english countryhouses in prospect for mrs rooth peter parted with them on the understanding that in london he would look as thoroughly as possible into the question of an engagement the day before he began his holiday he went to see madame carré who said to him vous devriez bien nous la laisser  she has something then  she has most things shell go far its the first time in my life of my beginning with a mistake but dont tell her so i dont flatter her shell be too puffed up  is she very conceited sherringham asked  mauvais sujet said madame carré  it was on the journey to london that he indulged in some of those questionings of his state that i have mentioned but i must add that by the time he reached charing crosshe smoked a cigar deferred till after the channel in a compartment by himselfit had suddenly come over him that they were futile now that he had left the girl a subversive unpremeditated heartbeat told himit made him hold his breath a minute in the carriagethat he had after all not escaped he was in love with her he had been in love with her from the first hour     book third     xiii   the drive from harsh to the place as it was called thereabouts could be achieved by swift horses in less than ten minutes and if mrs dallows ponies were capital trotters the general high pitch of the occasion made it all congruous they should show their speed the occasion was the pollingday an hour after the battle the ponies had kept pace with other driven forces for the week before passing and repassing the neat windows of the flat little townmrs dallow had the complacent belief that there was none in the kingdom in which the flowerstands looked more respectable between the stiff muslin curtainswith their mistress behind them on her all but silver wheels very often she was accompanied by the liberal candidate but even when she was not the equipage seemed scarce less to represent his easy friendly confidence it moved in a radiance of ribbons and handbills and handshakes and smiles of quickened commerce and sudden intimacy of sympathy which assumed without presuming and gratitude which promised without soliciting but under julias guidance the ponies pattered now with no indication of a loss of freshness along the firm wide avenue which wound and curved to make up in large effect for not undulating from the gates opening straight on the town to the palladian mansion high square grey and clean which stood among terraces and fountains in the centre of the park a generous steed had been sacrificed to bring the good news from ghent to aix but no such extravagance was after all necessary for communicating with lady agnes  she had remained at the house not going to the wheatsheaf the liberal inn with the others preferring to await in privacy and indeed in solitude the momentous result of the poll she had come down to harsh with the two girls in the course of the proceedings julia hadnt thought they would do much good but she was expansive and indulgent now and had generously asked them lady agnes had not a nice canvassing manner effective as she might have been in the character of the high benignant affable motherlooking sweet participation but not interferingof the young and handsome the shining convincing wonderfully clever and certainly irresistible aspirant grace dormer had zeal without art and lady agnes who during her husbands lifetime had seen their affairs follow the satisfactory principle of a tendency to defer to supreme merit had never really learned the lesson that voting goes by favour however she could pray god if she couldnt make love to the cheesemonger and nick felt she had stayed at home to pray for him i must add that julia dallow was too happy now flicking her whip in the bright summer air to say anything so ungracious even to herself as that her companion had been returned in spite of his nearest female relatives besides biddy had been a rosy help she had looked persuasively pretty in white and blue on platforms and in recurrent carriages out of which she had tossed blushing and making people feel they would remember her eyes several words that were telling for their very simplicity  mrs dallow was really too glad for any definite reflexion even for personal exultation the vanity of recognising her own large share of the work nick was in and was now beside her tired silent vague beflowered and beribboned and he had been splendid from beginning to end beautifully goodhumoured and at the same time beautifully cleverstill cleverer than she had supposed he could be the sense of her having quickened his cleverness and been repaid by it or by his gratitudeit came to the same thingin a way she appreciated was not assertive and jealous it was lost for the present in the general happy break of the long tension so nothing passed between them in their progress to the house there was no sound in the park but the pleasant rustle of summerit seemed an applausive murmurand the swift roll of the vehicle  lady agnes already knew for as soon as the result was declared nick had despatched a mounted man to her carrying the figures on a scrawled card he himself had been far from getting away at once having to respond to the hubbub of acclamation to speak yet again to thank his electors individually and collectively to chaff the tories without cheap elation to be carried hither and yon and above all to pretend that the interest of the business was now greater for him than ever if he had said never a word after putting himself in julias hands to go home it was partly perhaps because the consciousness had begun to glimmer within him on the contrary of some sudden shrinkage of that interest he wanted to see his mother because he knew she wanted to fold him close in her arms they had been open there for this purpose the last halfhour and her expectancy now no longer an ache of suspense was the reason of julias round pace yet this very impatience in her somehow made nick wince a little meeting his mother was like being elected over again  the others had not yet come back and lady agnes was alone in the large bright drawingroom when nick went in with julia he saw her at the further end she had evidently been walking up and down the whole length of it and her tall upright black figure seemed in possession of the fair vastness after the manner of an exclamationpoint at the bottom of a blank page the room rich and simple was a place of perfection as well as of splendour in delicate tints with precious specimens of french furniture of the last century ranged against walls of pale brocade and here and there a small almost priceless picture george dallow had made it caring for these things and liking to talk about themscarce ever about anything else so that it appeared to represent him still what was best in his kindly limited nature his friendly competent tiresome insistence on harmonyon identity of period nick could hear him yet and could see him too fat and with a congenital thickness in his speech lounging there in loose clothes with his eternal cigarette now my dear fellow thats what i call form i dont know what you call itthat was the way he used to begin all round were flowers in rare vases but it looked a place of which the beauty would have smelt sweet even without them  lady agnes had taken a white rose from one of the clusters and was holding it to her face which was turned to the door as nick crossed the threshold the expression of her figure instantly told himhe saw the creased card he had sent her lying on one of the beautiful bare tableshow she had been sailing up and down in a majesty of satisfaction the inflation of her long plain dress and the brightened dimness of her proud face were still in the air in a moment he had kissed her and was being kissed not in quick repetition but in tender prolongation with which the perfume of the white rose was mixed but there was something else tooher sweet smothered words in his ear oh my boy my boyoh your father your father neither the sense of pleasure nor that of pain with lady agnesas indeed with most of the persons with whom this history is concernedwas a liberation of chatter so that for a minute all she said again was i think of sir nicholas and wish he were here addressing the words to julia who had wandered forward without looking at the mother and son  poor sir nicholas said mrs dallow vaguely  did you make another speech lady agnes asked  i dont know did i nick appealed  i dont knowand julia spoke with her back turned doing something to her hat before the glass  oh of course the confusion the bewilderment said lady agnes in a tone rich in political reminiscence  it was really immense fun mrs dallow went so far as to drop  dearest julia lady agnes deeply breathed then she added it was you who made it sure  there are a lot of people coming to dinner said julia  perhaps youll have to speak again lady agnes smiled at her son  thank you i like the way you talk about it cried nick im like iago from this time forth i never will speak word  dont say that nick said his mother gravely  dont be afraidhell jabber like a magpie and julia went out of the room  nick had flung himself on a sofa with an air of weariness though not of completely extinct cheer and lady agnes stood fingering her rose and looking down at him his eyes kept away from her they seemed fixed on something she couldnt see i hope youve thanked julia handsomely she presently remarked  why of course mother  she has done as much as if you hadnt been sure  i wasnt in the least sureand she has done everything  she has been too goodbut weve done something i hope you dont leave out your father lady agnes amplified as nicks glance appeared for a moment to question her we  never never nick uttered these words perhaps a little mechanically but the next minute he added as if suddenly moved to think what he could say that would give his mother most pleasure of course his name has worked for me gone as he is hes still a living force he felt a good deal of a hypocrite but one didnt win such a seat every day in the year probably indeed he should never win another  he hears you he watches you he rejoices in you lady agnes opined  this idea was oppressive to nickthat of the rejoicing almost as much as of the watching he had made his concession but with a certain impulse to divert his mother from following up her advantage he broke out julias a tremendously effective woman  of course she is said lady agnes knowingly  her charming appearance is half the battlenick explained a little coldly what he meant but he felt his coldness an inadequate protection to him when he heard his companion observe with something of the same sapience  a womans always effective when she likes a person so much  it discomposed him to be described as a person liked and so much and by a woman and he simply said abruptly when are you going away  the first moment thats civiltomorrow morning youll stay on i hope  stay on what shall i stay on for  why you might stay to express your appreciation  nick considered ive everything to do  i thought everything was done said lady agnes  well thats just why her son replied not very lucidly i want to do other thingsquite other things i should like to take the next train and he looked at his watch  when there are people coming to dinner to meet you  theyll meet youthats better  im sorry any ones coming lady agnes said in a tone unencouraging to a deviation from the reality of things i wish we were alonejust as a family it would please julia today to feel that we are one do stay with her tomorrow  how will that dowhen shes alone  she wont be alone with mrs gresham  mrs gresham doesnt count  thats precisely why i want you to stop and her cousin almost her brother what an idea that it wont do havent you stayed here before when there has been no one  ive never stayed much and there have always been people at any rate its now different  its just because its different besides it isnt different and it never was said lady agnes more incoherent in her earnestness than it often happened to her to be she always liked you and she likes you now more than everif you call that different nick got up at this and without meeting her eyes walked to one of the windows where he stood with his back turned and looked out on the great greenness she watched him a moment and she might well have been wishing while he appeared to gaze with intentness that it would come to him with the same force as it had come to herselfvery often before but during these last days more than everthat the level lands of harsh stretching away before the window the french garden with its symmetry its screens and its statues and a great many more things of which these were the superficial token were julias very own to do with exactly as she liked no word of appreciation or envy however dropped from the young mans lips and his mother presently went on what could be more natural than that after your triumphant contest you and she should have lots to settle and to talk aboutno end of practical questions no end of urgent business arent you her member and cant her member pass a day with her and she a great proprietor  nick turned round at this with an odd expression her memberam i hers  lady agnes had a pauseshe had need of all her tact well if the place is hers and you represent the place she began but she went no further for nick had interrupted her with a laugh  what a droll thing to represent when one thinks of it and what does it represent poor stupid little borough with its strong though i admit clean smell of meal and its curiously fatfaced inhabitants did you ever see such a collection of fat faces turned up at the hustings they looked like an enormous sofa with the cheeks for the gathers and the eyes for the buttons  oh well the next time you shall have a great town lady agnes returned smiling and feeling that she was tactful  it will only be a bigger sofa im joking of course nick pursued and i ought to be ashamed of myself theyve done me the honour to elect me and i shall never say a word thats not civil about them poor dears but even a new member may blaspheme to his mother  i wish youd be serious to your motherand she went nearer him  the difficulty is that im two men its the strangest thing that ever was nick professed with his bright face on her im two quite distinct human beings who have scarcely a point in common not even the memory on the part of one of the achievements or the adventures of the other one man wins the seat but its the other fellow who sits in it  oh nick dont spoil your victory by your perversity she cried as she clasped her hands to him  i went through it with great gleei wont deny that it excited me interested me amused me when once i was in it i liked it but now that im out of it again  out of it his mother stared isnt the whole point that youre in  ah now im only in the house of commons  for an instant she seemed not to understand and to be on the point of laying her finger quickly to her lips with a hushas if the late sir nicholas might have heard the only then while a comprehension of the young mans words promptly superseded that impulse she replied with force youll be in the lords the day you determine to get there  this futile remark made nick laugh afresh and not only laugh but kiss her which was always an intenser form of mystification for poor lady agnes and apparently the one he liked best to inflict after which he said the odd thing is you know that harsh has no wants at least its not sharply not articulately conscious of them we all pretended to talk them over together and i promised to carry them in my heart of hearts but upon my honour i cant remember one of them julia says the wants of harsh are simply the national wantsrather a pretty phrase for julia she means she does everything for the place shes really their member and this house in which we stand their legislative chamber therefore the lacunae ive undertaken to fill out are the national wants it will be rather a job to rectify some of them wont it i dont represent the appetites of harshharsh is gorged i represent the ideas of my party thats what julia says  oh never mind what julia says lady agnes broke out impatiently this impatience made it singular that the very next word she uttered should be my dearest son i wish to heaven youd marry her it would be so fitting now she added  why now nick frowned  she has shown you such sympathy such devotion  is it for that she has shown it  ah you might feeli cant tell you said lady agnes reproachfully  he blushed at this as if what he did feel was the reproach must i marry her because you like her  i why were all as fond of her as we can be  dear mother i hope that any woman i ever may marry will be a person agreeable not only to you but also since you make a point of it to grace and biddy but i must tell you thisthat i shall marry no woman im not unmistakably in love with  and why are you not in love with juliacharming clever generous as she is lady agnes laid her hands on himshe held him tight dearest nick if you care anything in the world to make me happy youll stay over here tomorrow and be nice to her  he waited an instant do you mean propose to her  with a single word with the glance of an eye the movement of your little fingerand she paused looking intensely imploringly up into his facein less time than it takes me to say what i say now you may have it all as he made no answer only meeting her eyes she added insistently you know shes a fine creatureyou know she is  dearest mother what i seem to know better than anything else in the world is that i love my freedom i set it far above everything  your freedom what freedom is there in being poor lady agnes fiercely demanded talk of that when julia puts everything she possesses at your feet  i cant talk of it motherits too terrible an idea and i cant talk of her nor of what i think of her you must leave that to me i do her perfect justice  you dont or youd marry her tomorrow she passionately argued youd feel the opportunity so beautifully rare with everything in the world to make it perfect your father would have valued it for you beyond everything think a little what would have given him pleasure thats what i meant when i spoke just now of us all it wasnt of grace and biddy i was thinkingfancyit was of him hes with you always he takes with you at your side every step you take yourself hed bless devoutly your marriage to julia hed feel what it would be for you and for us all i ask for no sacrifice and hed ask for none we only ask that you dont commit the crime  nick dormer stopped her with another kiss he murmured mother mother mother as he bent over her he wished her not to go on to let him off but the deep deprecation in his voice didnt prevent her saying  you know ityou know it perfectly all and more than all that i can tell you you know he drew her closer kissed her again held her as he would have held a child in a paroxysm soothing her silently till it could abate her vehemence had brought with it tears she dried them as she disengaged herself the next moment however she resumed attacking him again for a public man shed be the perfect companion shes made for public lifeshes made to shine to be concerned in great things to occupy a high position and to help him on shed back you up in everything as she has backed you in this together theres nothing you couldnt do you can have the first house in englandyes the very first what freedom is there in being poor how can you do anything without money and what money can you make for yourselfwhat money will ever come to you thats the crimeto throw away such an instrument of power such a blessed instrument of good  it isnt everything to be rich mother said nick looking at the floor with a particular patiencethat is with a provisional docility and his hands in his pockets and it isnt so fearful to be poor  its vileits abject dont i know  are you in such acute want he smiled  ah dont make me explain what youve only to look at to see his mother returned as if with a richness of allusion to dark elements in her fate  besides he easily went on theres other money in the world than julias i might come by some of that  do you mean mr carterets the question made him laugh as her feeble reference five minutes before to the house of lords had done but she pursued too full of her idea to take account of such a poor substitute for an answer let me tell you one thing for ive known charles carteret much longer than you and i understand him better theres nothing you could do that would do you more good with him than to marry julia i know the way he looks at things and i know exactly how that would strike him it would please him it would charm him it would be the thing that would most prove to him that youre in earnest you need you know to do something of that sort she said as for plain speaking  havent i come in for harsh asked nick  oh hes very canny he likes to see people rich then he believes in themthen hes likely to believe more hes kind to you because youre your fathers son but im sure your being poor takes just so much off  he can remedy that so easily said nick smiling still is my being kept by julia what you call my making an effort for myself  lady agnes hesitated then you neednt insult julia she replied  moreover if ive her money i shant want his nick unheedingly remarked  again his mother waited before answering after which she produced and pray wouldnt you wish to be independent  youre delightful dear motheryoure very delightful i particularly like your conception of independence doesnt it occur to you that at a pinch i might improve my fortune by some other means than by making a mercenary marriage or by currying favour with a rich old gentleman doesnt it occur to you that i might work  work at politics how does that make money honourably  i dont mean at politics  what do you mean thenand she seemed to challenge him to phrase it if he dared this demonstration of her face and voice might have affected him for he remained silent and she continued are you elected or not  it seems a dream he rather flatly returned  if you are act accordingly and dont mix up things that are as wide asunder as the poles she spoke with sternness and his silence appeared again to represent an admission that her sternness counted for him possibly she was touched by it after a few moments at any rate during which nothing more passed between them she appealed to him in a gentler and more anxious key which had this virtue to touch him that he knew it was absolutely the first time in her life she had really begged for anything she had never been obliged to beg she had got on without it and most things had come to her he might judge therefore in what a light she regarded this boon for which in her bereft old age she humbled herself to be a suitor there was such a pride in her that he could feel what it cost her to go on her knees even to her son he did judge how it was in his power to gratify her and as he was generous and imaginative he was stirred and shaken as it came over him in a wave of figurative suggestion that he might make up to her for many things he scarcely needed to hear her ask with a pleading wail that was almost tragic dont you see how things have turned out for us dont you know how unhappy i am dont you know what a bitterness she stopped with a sob in her voice and he recognised vividly this last tribulation the unhealed wound of her change of life and her lapse from eminence to flatness you know what percival is and the comfort i have of him you know the property and what hes doing with it and what comfort i get from that everythings dreary but what you can do for us everythings odious down to living in a hole with ones girls who dont marry grace is impossiblei dont know whats the matter with her no one will look at her and shes so conceited with itsometimes i feel as if i could beat her and biddy will never marry and were three dismal women in a filthy house and what are three dismal women more or less in london  so with an unexpected rage of selfexposure she poured out her disappointments and troubles tore away the veil from her sadness and soreness it almost scared him to see how she hated her life though at another time it might have been amusing to note how she despised her gardenless house of course it wasnt a countryhouse and she couldnt get used to that better than he could dofor it was the sort of thing into which in any case a woman enters more than a manshe felt what a lift into brighter air what a regilding of his sisters possibilities his marriage to julia would effect for them he couldnt trace the difference but his mother saw it all as a shining picture she hung the bright vision before him nowshe stood there like a poor woman crying for a kindness what was filial in him all the piety he owed especially to the revived spirit of his father more than ever present on a day of such public pledges became from one moment to the other as the very handle to the door of the chamber of concessions he had the impulse so embarrassing when it is a question of consistent action to see in a touching an interesting light any forcibly presented side of the life of another such things effected a union with something in his life and in the recognition of them was no soreness of sacrifice and no consciousness of merit  rapidly at present this change of scene took place before his spiritual eye he found himself believing because his mother communicated the belief that it depended but on his own conduct richly to alter the social outlook of the three women who clung to him and who declared themselves forlorn this was not the highest kind of motive but it contained a spring it touched into life again old injunctions and appeals julias wide kingdom opened out round him and seemed somehow to wear the face of his own possible future his mother and sisters floated in the rosy element as if he had breathed it about them the first house in england she had called it but it might be the first house in europe the first in the world by the fine air and the high humanities that should fill it everything beautiful in his actual his material view seemed to proclaim its value as never before the house rose over his head as a museum of exquisite rewards and the image of poor george dallow hovered there obsequious expressing that he had only been the modest tasteful organiser or even upholsterer appointed to set it all in order and punctually retire lady agness tone in fine penetrated further than it had done yet when she brought out with intensity dont desert usdont desert us  dont desert you  be greatbe great im old ive lived ive seen go in for a great material position that will simplify everything else  ill do what i can for youanything everything i can trust meleave me alone nick went on  and youll stay overyoull spend the day with her  ill stay till she turns me out  his mother had hold of his hand again now she raised it to her lips and kissed it my dearest son my only joy then i dont see how you can resist her she added  no more do i  she looked aboutthere was so much to look atwith a deep exhalation if youre so fond of art what art is equal to all this the joy of living in the midst of itof seeing the finest works every day youll have everything the world can give  thats exactly what was just passing in my own mind its too much nick reasoned  dont be selfish  selfish he echoed  unselfish then youll share it with us  and with julia a little i hope he said  god bless you cried his mother looking up at him her eyes were detained by the sudden sense of something in his own that was not clear to her but before she could challenge it he asked abruptly  why do you talk so of poor biddy why wont she marry  you had better ask peter sherringham said lady agnes  what has he to do with it  how odd of you not to knowwhen its so plain how she thinks of him that its a matter of common gossip  yes if you willweve made it so and she takes it as an angel but peter likes her  does he then its the more shame to him to behave as he does he had better leave his wretched actresses alone thats the love of art too mocked lady agnes  but nick glossed it all over biddys so charming shell easily marry some one else  never if she loves him however julia will bring it aboutjulia will help her his mother pursued more cheerfully thats what youll do for usthat shell do everything  why then more than now he asked  because we shall be yours  youre mine already  yes but she isnt however shes as good lady agnes exulted  shell turn me out of the house said nick  come and tell me when she does but there she isgo to her and she gave him a push toward one of the windows that stood open to the terrace their hostess had become visible outside she passed slowly along the terrace with her long shadow go to her his mother repeatedshes waiting for you  nick went out with the air of a man as ready to pass that way as another and at the same moment his two sisters still flushed with participation appeared in a different quarter  we go home tomorrow but nick will stay a day or two lady agnes said to them  dear old nick grace ejaculated looking at her with intensity  hes going to speak she went on but dont mention it  dont mention it biddy asked with a milder stare hasnt he spoken enough poor fellow  i mean to julia lady agnes replied  dont you understand you gooseand grace turned on her sister     xiv   the next morning brought the young man many letters and telegrams and his coffee was placed beside him in his room where he remained until noon answering these communications when he came out he learned that his mother and sisters had left the house this information was given him by mrs gresham whom he found dealing with her own voluminous budget at one of the tables in the library she was a lady who received thirty letters a day the subjectmatter of which as well as of her punctual answers in a hand that would have been ladylike in a manageress was a puzzle to those who observed her  she told nick that lady agnes had not been willing to disturb him at his work to say goodbye knowing she should see him in a day or two in town he was amused at the way his mother had stolen offas if she feared further conversation might weaken the spell she believed herself to have wrought the place was cleared moreover of its other visitors so that as mrs gresham said the fun was at an end this lady expressed the idea that the fun was after all rather a bore at any rate now they could rest mrs dallow and nick and she and she was glad nick was going to stay for a little quiet she liked harsh best when it was not en fête then one could see what a sympathetic old place it was she hoped nick was not dreadfully faggedshe feared julia was completely done up julia however had transported her exhaustion to the groundsshe was wandering about somewhere she thought more people would be coming to the house people from the town people from the country and had gone out so as not to have to see them she had not gone farnick could easily find her nick intimated that he himself was not eager for more people whereupon mrs gresham rather archly smiled and of course you hate me for being here he made some protest and she added but im almost part of the house you knowim one of the chairs or tables nick declared that he had never seen a house so well furnished and mrs gresham said i believe there are to be some people to dinner rather an interference isnt it julia lives so in public but its all for you and after a moment she added its a wonderful constitution nick at first failed to seize her allusionhe thought it a retarded political reference a sudden tribute to the great unwritten instrument by which they were all governed and under the happy operation of which his fight had been so successful he was on the point of saying the british wonderful when he gathered that the intention of his companion had been simply to praise mrs dallows fine robustness the surface so delicate the action so easy yet the frame of steel  he left mrs gresham to her correspondence and went out of the house wondering as he walked if she wanted him to do the same thing his mother wanted so that her words had been intended for a prickwhether even the two ladies had talked over their desire together mrs gresham was a married woman who was usually taken for a widow mainly because she was perpetually sent for by her friends who in no event sent for mr gresham she came in every case with her air of being répandue at the expense of dingier belongings her figure was admiredthat is it was sometimes mentionedand she dressed as if it was expected of her to be smart like a young woman in a shop or a servant much in view she slipped in and out accompanied at the piano talked to the neglected visitors walked in the rain and after the arrival of the post usually had conferences with her hostess during which she stroked her chin and looked familiarly responsible it was her peculiarity that people were always saying things to her in a lowered voice she had all sorts of acquaintances and in small establishments sometimes wrote the menus great ones on the other hand had no terrors for hershe had seen too many no one had ever discovered whether any one else paid her people only knew what they did  if lady agnes had in the minor key discussed with her the propriety of a union between the mistress of harsh and the hope of the dormers this last personage could take the circumstance for granted without irritation and even with cursory indulgence for he was got unhappy now and his spirit was light and clear the summer day was splendid and the world as he looked at it from the terrace offered no more worrying ambiguity than a vault of airy blue arching over a lap of solid green the wide still trees in the park appeared to be waiting for some daily inspection and the rich fields with their official frill of hedges to rejoice in the light that smiled upon them as named and numbered acres nick felt himself catch the smile and all the reasons of it they made up a charm to which he had perhaps not hitherto done justicesomething of the impression he had received when younger from showy views of fine countryseats that had pressed and patted nature as by the fat hands of benches of magistrates and landlords into supreme respectability and comfort there were a couple of peacocks on the terrace and his eye was caught by the gleam of the swans on a distant lake where was also a little temple on an island and these objects fell in with his humour which at another time might have been ruffled by them as aggressive triumphs of the conventional  it was certainly a proof of youth and health on his part that his spirits had risen as the plot thickened and that after he had taken his jump into the turbid waters of a contested election he had been able to tumble and splash not only without a sense of awkwardness but with a considerable capacity for the frolic tepid as we saw him in paris he had found his relation to his opportunity surprisingly altered by his little journey across the channel had seen things in a new perspective and breathed an air that set him and kept him in motion there had been something in it that went to his headan element that his mother and his sisters his father from beyond the grave julia dallow the liberal party and a hundred friends were both secretly and overtly occupied in pumping into it if he but halfbelieved in victory he at least liked the wind of the onset in his ears and he had a general sense that when one was stuck there was always the nearest thing at which one must pull the embarrassment that is the revival of scepticism which might produce an inconsistency shameful to exhibit and yet difficult to conceal was safe enough to come later indeed at the risk of presenting our young man as too whimsical a personage i may hint that some such sickly glow had even now begun to tinge one quarter of his inward horizon  i am afraid moreover that i have no better excuse for him than the one he had touched on in that momentous conversation with his mother which i have thought it useful to reproduce in full he was conscious of a double nature there were two men in him quite separate whose leading features had little in common and each of whom insisted on having an independent turn at life meanwhile then if he was adequately aware that the bed of his moral existence would need a good deal of making over if he was to lie upon it without unseemly tossing he was also alive to the propriety of not parading his inconsistencies not letting his unregulated passions become a spectacle to the vulgar he had none of that wish to appear deep which is at the bottom of most forms of fatuity he was perfectly willing to pass for decently superficial he only aspired to be decently continuous when you were not suitably shallow this presented difficulties but he would have assented to the proposition that you must be as subtle as you can and that a high use of subtlety is in consuming the smoke of your inner fire the fire was the great thing not the chimney he had no view of life that counted out the need of learning it was teaching rather as to which he was conscious of no particular mission he enjoyed life enjoyed it immensely and was ready to pursue it with patience through as many channels as possible he was on his guard however against making an ass of himself that is against not thinking out his experiments before trying them in public it was because as yet he liked life in general better than it was clear to him he liked particular possibilities that on the occasion of a constituencys holding out a cordial hand to him while it extended another in a different direction a certain bloom of boyhood that was on him had not paled at the idea of a match  he had risen to the fray as he had risen to matches at school for his boyishness could still take a pleasure in an inconsiderate show of agility he could meet electors and conciliate bores and compliment women and answer questions and roll off speeches and chaff adversarieshe could do these things because it was amusing and slightly dangerous like playing football or ascending an alp pastimes for which nature had conferred on him an aptitude not so very different in kind from a due volubility on platforms there were two voices to admonish him that all this was not really action at all but only a pusillanimous imitation of it one of them fitfully audible in the depths of his own spirit and the other speaking in the equivocal accents of a very crabbed hand from a letter of four pages by gabriel nash however nick carried the imitation as far as possible and the flood of sound floated him what more could a working faith have done he had not broken with the axiom that in a case of doubt one should hold off for this applied to choice and he had not at present the slightest pretension to choosing he knew he was lifted along that what he was doing was not firstrate that nothing was settled by it and that if there was a hard knot in his life it would only grow harder with keeping doing ones sum tomorrow instead of today doesnt make the sum easier but at least makes today so  sometimes in the course of the following fortnight it seemed to him he had gone in for harsh because he was sure he should lose sometimes he foresaw that he should win precisely to punish him for having tried and for his want of candour and when presently he did win he was almost scared at his success then it appeared to him he had done something even worse than not choosehe had let others choose for him the beauty of it was that they had chosen with only their own object in their eye for what did they know about his strange alternative he was rattled about so for a fortnightjulia taking care of thisthat he had no time to think save when he tried to remember a quotation or an american story and all his life became an overflow of verbiage thought couldnt hear itself for the noise which had to be pleasant and persuasive had to hang more or less together without its aid nick was surprised at the airs he could play and often when the last thing at night he shut the door of his room found himself privately exclaiming that he had had no idea he was such a mountebank  i must add that if this reflexion didnt occupy him long and if no meditation after his return from paris held him for many moments there was a reason better even than that he was tired that he was busy that he appreciated the coincidence of the hit and the hurrah the hurrah and the hit that reason was simply mrs dallow who had suddenly become a still larger fact in his consciousness than his having turned actively political she was indeed his being soin the sense that if the politics were his how little soever the activity was hers she had better ways of showing she was clever than merely saying clever thingswhich in general only prove at the most that one would be clever if one could the accomplished fact itself was almost always the demonstration that mrs dallow could and when nick came to his senses after the proclamation of the victor and the drop of the uproar her figure was of the whole violent dance of shadows the only thing that came back that stayed she had been there at each of the moments passing repassing returning before him beside him behind him she had made the business infinitely prettier than it would have been without her added music and flowers and ices a finer charm converting it into a kind of heroic function the form of sport most dangerous it had been a gardenparty say with ones life at stake from pressure of the crowd the concluded affair had bequeathed him thus not only a seat in the house of commons but a perception of what may come of women in high embodiments and an abyss of intimacy with one woman in particular  she had wrapped him up in something he didnt know whata sense of facility an overpowering fragranceand they had moved together in an immense fraternity there had been no lovemaking no contact that was only personal no vulgarity of flirtation the hurry of the days and the sharpness with which they both tended to an outside object had made all that irrelevant it was as if she had been too near for him to see her separate from himself but none the less when he now drew breath and looked back what had happened met his eyes as a composed picturea picture of which the subject was inveterately julia and her ponies julia wonderfully fair and fine waving her whip cleaving the crowd holding her head as if it had been a banner smiling up into secondstorey windows carrying him beside her carrying him to his doom he had not reckoned at the time in the few days how much he had driven about with her but the image of it was there in his consulted conscience as well as in a personal glow not yet chilled it looked large as it rose before him the things his mother had said to him made a rich enough frame for it all and the whole impression had that night kept him much awake     xv   while after leaving mrs gresham he was hesitating which way to go and was on the point of hailing a gardener to ask if mrs dallow had been seen he noticed as a spot of colour in an expanse of shrubbery a faraway parasol moving in the direction of the lake he took his course toward it across the park and as the bearer of the parasol strolled slowly it was not five minutes before he had joined her he went to her soundlessly on the grasshe had been whistling at first but as he got nearer stoppedand it was not till he was at hand that she looked round he had watched her go as if she were turning things over in her mind while she brushed the smooth walks and the clean turf with her dress slowly made her parasol revolve on her shoulder and carried in the other hand a book which he perceived to be a monthly review  i came out to get away she said when he had begun to walk with her  away from me  ah thats impossible then she added the days so very nice  lovely weather nick dropped you want to get away from mrs gresham i suppose  she had a pause from everything  well i want to get away too  it has been such a racket listen to the dear birds  yes our noise isnt so good as theirs said nick i feel as if i had been married and had shoes and rice thrown after me he went on but not to you julianothing so good as that  julia made no reply she only turned her eyes on the ornamental water stretching away at their right in a moment she exclaimed how nasty the lake looks and nick recognised in her tone a sign of that odd shynessa perverse stiffness at a moment when she probably but wanted to be softwhich taken in combination with her other qualities was so far from being displeasing to him that it represented her nearest approach to extreme charm he was not shy now for he considered this morning that he saw things very straight and in a sense altogether superior and delightful this enabled him to be generously sorry for his companionif he were the reason of her being in any degree uncomfortable and yet left him to enjoy some of the motions not in themselves without grace by which her discomfort was revealed he wouldnt insist on anything yet so he observed that her standard in lakes was too high and then talked a little about his mother and the girls their having gone home his not having seen them that morning lady agness deep satisfaction in his victory and the fact that she would be obliged to do something for the autumntake a house or something or other  ill lend her a house said mrs dallow  oh julia julia nick half groaned  but she paid no attention to his sound she only held up her review and said see what ive brought with me to readmr hoppuss article  thats right then i shant have to youll tell me about it he uttered this without believing she had meant or wished to read the article which was entitled the revision of the british constitution in spite of her having encumbered herself with the stiff fresh magazine he was deeply aware she was not in want of such inward occupation as periodical literature could supply they walked along and he added but is that what were in for reading mr hoppus is it the sort of thing constituents expect or even worse pretending to have read him when one hasnt oh what a tangled web we weave  people are talking about it one has to know its the article of the month  nick looked at her askance you say things every now and then for which i could really kill you the article of the month for instance i could kill you for that  well kill me mrs dallow returned  let me carry your book he went on irrelevantly the hand in which she held it was on the side of her on which he was walking and he put out his own hand to take it but for a couple of minutes she forbore to give it up so that they held it together swinging it a little before she surrendered it he asked where she was going  to the island she answered  well ill go with youand ill kill you there  the things i say are the right things julia declared  its just the right things that are wrong its because youre so political nick too lightly explained its your horrible ambition the woman who has a salon should have read the article of the month see how one dreadful thing leads to another  there are some things that lead to nothing said mrs dallow  no doubtno doubt and how are you going to get over to your island  i dont know  isnt there a boat  i dont know  nick had paused to look round for the boat but his hostess walked on without turning her head can you row he then asked  dont you know i can do everything  yes to be sure thats why i want to kill you theres the boat  shall you drown me she asked  oh let me perish with you nick answered with a sigh the boat had been hidden from them by the bole of a great tree which rose from the grass at the waters edge it was moored to a small place of embarkation and was large enough to hold as many persons as were likely to wish to visit at once the little temple in the middle of the lake which nick liked because it was absurd and which mrs dallow had never had a particular esteem for the lake fed by a natural spring was a liberal sheet of water measured by the scale of park scenery and though its principal merit was that taken at a distance it gave a gleam of abstraction to the concrete verdure doing the office of an open eye in a dull face it could also be approached without derision on a sweet summer morning when it made a lapping sound and reflected candidly various things that were probably finer than itselfthe sky the great trees the flight of birds a man of taste coming back from rome a hundred years before had caused a small ornamental structure to be raised from artificial foundations on its bosom and had endeavoured to make this architectural pleasantry as nearly as possible a reminiscence of the small ruined rotunda which stands on the bank of the tiber and is pronounced by ciceroni once sacred to vesta it was circular roofed with old tiles surrounded by white columns and considerably dilapidated george dallow had taken an interest in itit reminded him not in the least of rome but of other things he likedand had amused himself with restoring it give me your handsit there and ill ferry you nick said  julia complied placing herself opposite him in the boat but as he took up the paddles she declared that she preferred to remain on the waterthere was too much malice prepense in the temple he asked her what she meant by that and she said it was ridiculous to withdraw to an island a few feet square on purpose to meditate she had nothing to meditate about that required so much scenery and attitude  on the contrary it would be just to change the scene and the pose its what we have been doing for a week thats attitude and to be for half an hour where nobodys looking and one hasnt to keep it up is just what i wanted to put in an idle irresponsible day for im not keeping it up nowi suppose youve noticed nick went on as they floated and he scarcely dipped the oars  i dont understand youand julia leaned back in the boat  he gave no further explanation than to ask in a minute have you people to dinner tonight  i believe there are three or four but ill put them off if you like  must you always live in public julia he continued  she looked at him a moment and he could see how she coloured well go homeill put them off  ah no dont go home its too jolly here let them come let them come poor wretches  how little you know me julia presently broke out when ever so many times ive lived here for months without a creature  except mrs gresham i suppose  i have had to have the house going i admit  youre perfect youre admirable and i dont criticise you  i dont understand you she tossed back  that only adds to the generosity of what youve done for me nick returned beginning to pull faster he bent over the oars and sent the boat forward keeping this up for a succession of minutes during which they both remained silent his companion in her place motionless recliningthe seat in the stern was most comfortablelooked only at the water the sky the trees at last he headed for the little temple saying first however shant we visit the ruin  if you like i dont mind seeing how they keep it  they reached the white steps leading up to it he held the boat and his companion got out then when he had made it fast they mounted together to the open door they keep the place very well nick said looking round its a capital place to give up everything in  it might do at least for you to explain what you mean and julia sat down  i mean to pretend for half an hour that i dont represent the burgesses of harsh its charmingits very delicate work surely it has been retouched  the interior of the pavilion lighted by windows which the circle of columns was supposed outside and at a distance to conceal had a vaulted ceiling and was occupied by a few pieces of lastcentury furniture spare and faded of which the colours matched with the decoration of the walls these and the ceiling tinted and not exempt from indications of damp were covered with fine mouldings and medallions it all made a very elegant little teahouse the mistress of which sat on the edge of a sofa rolling her parasol and remarking you ought to read mr hoppuss article to me  why is this your salon nick smiled  what makes you always talk of that my salons an invention of your own  but isnt it the idea youre most working for  suddenly nervously she put up her parasol and sat under it as if not quite sensible of what she was doing how much you know me im not working for anythingthat youll ever guess  nick wandered about the room and looked at various things it containedthe odd volumes on the tables the bits of quaint china on the shelves they do keep it very well youve got charming things  theyre supposed to come over every day and look after them  they must come over in force  oh no one knows  its spick and span how well you have everything done  i think youve some reason to say so said mrs dallow her parasol was now down and she was again rolling it tight  but youre right about my not knowing you why were you so ready to do so much for me  he stopped in front of her and she looked up at him her eyes rested long on his own then she broke out why do you hate me so  was it because you like me personally nick pursued as if he hadnt heard her you may think that an odd or positively an odious question but isnt it natural my wanting to know  oh if you dont know julia quite desperately sighed  its a question of being sure  well then if youre not sure  was it done for me as a friend as a man  youre not a manyoure a child his hostess declared with a face that was cold though she had been smiling the moment before  after all i was a good candidate nick went on  what do i care for candidates  youre the most delightful woman julia he said as he sat down beside her and i cant imagine what you mean by my hating you  if you havent discovered that i like you you might as well  might as well discover it  she was gravehe had never seen her so pale and never so beautiful she had stopped rolling her parasol her hands were folded in her lap and her eyes bent on them nick sat looking at them as wella trifle awkwardly might as well have hated me she said  weve got on so beautifully together all these days why shouldnt we get on as well for ever and ever he brought out she made no answer and suddenly he said ah julia i dont know what youve done to me but youve done it youve done it by strange ways but it will serve yes i hate you he added in a different tone and with his face all nearer  dear nick dear nick she began but she stopped feeling his nearness and its intensity a nearness now so great that his arm was round her that he was really in possession of her she closed her eyes but heard him ask again why shouldnt it be for ever for ever in a voice that had for her ear a vibration none had ever had  youve done it youve done it nick repeated  what do you want of me she appealed  to stay with methis wayalways  ah not this way she answered softly but as if in pain and making an effort with a certain force to detach herself  this way thenor this he took such pressing advantage of her that he had kissed her with repetition she rose while he insisted but he held her yet and as he did so his tenderness turned to beautiful words if youll marry me why shouldnt it be so simple so right and good he drew her closer again too close for her to answer but her struggle ceased and she rested on him a minute she buried her face in his breast  youre hard and its cruel she then exclaimed shaking herself free  hardcruel  you do it with so little and with this unexpectedly to nick julia burst straight into tears before he could stop her she was at the door of the pavilion as if she wished to get immediately away there however he stayed her bending over her while she sobbed unspeakably gentle with her  so little its with everythingwith everything i have  ive done it you say what do you accuse me of doing her tears were already over  of making me yours of being so precious julia so exactly what a man wants as it seems to me i didnt know you could he went on smiling down at her i didntno i didnt  its what i saythat youve always hated me  ill make it up to you he laughed  she leaned on the doorway with her forehead against the lintel you dont even deny it  contradict you now ill admit it though its rubbish on purpose to live it down  it doesnt matter she said slowly for however much you might have liked me youd never have done so half as much as ive cared for you  oh im so poor nick murmured cheerfully  with her eyes looking at him as in a new light she slowly shook her head then she declared you never can live it down  i like that havent i asked you to marry me when did you ever ask me  every day of my life as i say its hardfor a proud woman  yes youre too proud even to answer me  we must think of it we must talk of it  think of it ive thought of it ever so much  i mean together there are many things in such a question  the principal thing is beautifully to give me your word  she looked at him afresh all strangely then she threw off i wish i didnt adore you she went straight down the steps  you dont adore me at all you know if you leave me now why do you go its so charming here and were so delightfully alone  untie the boat well go on the water julia said  nick was at the top of the steps looking down at her ah stay a littledo stay he pleaded  ill get in myself ill pull off she simply answered  at this he came down and bent a little to undo the rope he was close to her and as he raised his head he felt it caught she had seized it in her hands and she pressed her lips as he had never felt lips pressed to the first place they encountered the next instant she was in the boat  this time he dipped the oars very slowly indeed and while for a period that was longer than it seemed to them they floated vaguely they mainly sat and glowed at each other as if everything had been settled there were reasons enough why nick should be happy but it is a singular fact that the leading one was the sense of his having escaped a great and ugly mistake the final result of his mothers appeal to him the day before had been the idea that he must act with unimpeachable honour he was capable of taking it as an assurance that julia had placed him under an obligation a gentleman could regard but in one way if she herself had understood it so putting the vision or at any rate the appreciation of a closer tie into everything she had done for him the case was conspicuously simple and his course unmistakably plain that is why he had been gay when he came out of the house to look for her he could be gay when his course was plain he could be all the gayer naturally i must add that in turning things over as he had done half the night what he had turned up oftenest was the recognition that julia now had a new personal power with him it was not for nothing that she had thrown herself personally into his life she had by her act made him live twice as intensely and such an office such a service if a man had accepted and deeply tasted it was certainly a thing to put him on his honour he took it as distinct that there was nothing he could do in preference that wouldnt be spoiled for him by any deflexion from that point his mother had made him uncomfortable by bringing it so heavily up that julia was in love with himhe didnt like in general to be told such things but the responsibility seemed easier to carry and he was less shy about it when once he was away from other eyes with only julias own to express that truth and with indifferent nature all about besides what discovery had he made this morning but that he also was in love  youve got to be a very great man you know she said to him in the middle of the lake i dont know what you mean about my salon but i am ambitious  we must look at life in a large bold way he concurred while he rested his oars  thats what i mean if i didnt think you could i wouldnt look at you  i could what  do everything you oughteverything i imagine i dream of you are clever you can never make me believe the contrary after your speech on tuesday dont speak to me ive seen ive heard and i know whats in you i shall hold you to it youre everything you pretend not to be  nick looked at the water while she talked will it always be so amusing he asked  will what always be  why my career  shant i make it so  then it will be yoursit wont be mine said nick  ah dont say thatdont make me out that sort of woman if they should say its me id drown myself  if they should say whats you  why your getting on if they should say i push you and do things for you things i mean that you cant do yourself  well wont you do them its just what i count on  dont be dreadful julia said it would be loathsome if i were thought the cleverest thats not the sort of man i want to marry  oh i shall make you work my dear  ah that she sounded in a tone that might come back to a man after years  youll do the great thing youll make my life the best life nick brought out as if he had been touched to deep conviction i daresay that will keep me in heart  in heart why shouldnt you be in heart and her eyes lingering on him searching him seemed to question him still more than her lips  oh it will be all right he made answer  youll like success as well as any one else dont tell meyoure not so ethereal  yes i shall like success  so shall i and of course im glad youll now be able to do things julia went on im glad youll have things im glad im not poor  ah dont speak of that nick murmured only be nice to my mother we shall make her supremely happy  it wouldnt be for your mother id do ityet im glad i like your people mrs dallow rectified leave them to me  youre generousyoure noble he stammered  your mother must live at broadwood she must have it for life its not at all bad  ah julia her companion replied its well i love you  why shouldnt you she laughed and after this no more was said between them till the boat touched shore when she had got out she recalled that it was time for luncheon but they took no action in consequence strolling in a direction which was not that of the house there was a vista that drew them on a grassy path skirting the foundations of scattered beeches and leading to a stile from which the charmed wanderer might drop into another division of mrs dallows property she said something about their going as far as the stile then the next instant exclaimed how stupid of youyouve forgotten mr hoppus  nick wondered we left him in the temple of vesta darling i had other things to think of there  ill send for him said julia  lord can you think of him now he asked  of course i canmore than ever  shall we go back for himand he pulled up  she made no direct answer but continued to walk saying they would go as far as the stile of course i know youre fearfully vague she presently resumed  i wasnt vague at all but you were in such a hurry to get away  it doesnt signify ive another at home  another summerhouse he more lightly suggested  a copy of mr hoppus  mercy how you go in for him fancy having two  he sent me the number of the magazine and the others the one that comes every month  every month i seebut his manner justified considerably her charge of vagueness they had reached the stile and he leaned over it looking at a great mild meadow and at the browsing beasts in the distance  did you suppose they come every day julia went on  dear no thank god they remained there a little he continued to look at the animals and before long added delightful english pastoral scene why do they say it wont paint  who says it wont  i dont knowsome of them it will in france but somehow it wont here  what are you talking about mrs dallow demanded  he appeared unable to satisfy her on this point instead of answering her directly he at any rate said is broadwood very charming  have you never been there it shows how youve treated me we used to go there in august george had ideas about it she added she had never affected not to speak of her late husband especially with nick whose kinsman he had in a manner been and who had liked him better than some others did  george had ideas about a great many things  yet she appeared conscious it would be rather odd on such an occasion to take this up it was even odd in nick to have said it broadwoods just right she returned at last its neither too small nor too big and it takes care of itself theres nothing to be done you cant spend a penny  and dont you want to use it  we can go and stay with them said julia  theyll think i bring them an angel and nick covered her white hand which was resting on the stile with his own large one  as they regard you yourself as an angel theyll take it as natural of you to associate with your kind  oh my kind he quite wailed looking at the cows  but his very extravagance perhaps saved it and she turned away from him as if starting homeward while he began to retrace his steps with her suddenly she said what did you mean that night in paris  that night  when you came to the hotel with me after we had all dined at that place with peter  what did i mean  about your caring so much for the fine arts you seemed to want to frighten me  why should you have been frightened i cant imagine what i had in my head not now  you are vague said julia with a little flush  not about the great thing  the great thing  that i owe you everything an honest man has to offer how can i care about the fine arts now  she stopped with lighted eyes on him is it because you think you owe it and she paused still with the heightened colour in her cheek then went onthat youve spoken to me as you did there she tossed her head toward the lake  i think i spoke to you because i couldnt help it  you are vague and she walked on again  you affect me differently from any other woman  oh other women why shouldnt you care about the fine arts now she added  therell be no time all my days and my years will be none too much for what you expect of me  i dont expect you to give up anything i only expect you to do more  to do more i must do less ive no talent  no talent  i mean for painting  julia pulled up again thats odious you haveyou must  he burst out laughing youre altogether delightful but how little you know about itabout the honourable practice of any art  what do you call practice youll have all our thingsyoull live in the midst of them  certainly i shall enjoy looking at them being so near them  dont say ive taken you away then  taken me away  from the love of art i like them myself now poor georges treasures i didnt of old so much because it seemed to me he made too much of themhe was always talking  well i wont always talk said nick  you may do as you liketheyre yours  give them to the nation nick went on  i like that when weve done with them  we shall have done with them when your vandykes and moronis have cured me of the delusion that i may be of their family surely that wont take long  you shall paint me said julia  never never never he spoke in a tone that made his companion starethen seemed slightly embarrassed at this result of his emphasis to relieve himself he said as they had come back to the place beside the lake where the boat was moored shant we really go and fetch mr hoppus  she hesitated you may go i wont please  thats not what i want  oblige me by going ill wait here with which she sat down on the bench attached to the little landing  nick at this got into the boat and put off he smiled at her as she sat there watching him he made his short journey disembarked and went into the pavilion but when he came out with the object of his errand he saw she had quitted her station had returned to the house without him he rowed back quickly sprang ashore and followed her with long steps apparently she had gone fast she had almost reached the door when he overtook her  why did you basely desert me he asked tenderly stopping her there  i dont know because im so happy  may i tell mother then  you may tell her she shall have broadwood     xvi   he lost no time in going down to see mr carteret to whom he had written immediately after the election and who had answered him in twelve revised pages of historical parallel he used often to envy mr carterets leisure a sense of which came to him now afresh in the summer evening as he walked up the hill toward the quiet house where enjoyment had ever been mingled for him with a vague oppression he was a little boy again under mr carterets roofa little boy on whom it had been duly impressed that in the wide plain peaceful rooms he was not to touch when he paid a visit to his fathers old friend there were in fact many thingsmany topicsfrom which he instinctively kept his hands even mr chayter the immemorial blank butler who was so like his master that he might have been a twin brother helped to remind him that he must be good mr carteret seemed to nick a very grave person but he had the sense that chayter thought him rather frivolous  our young man always came on foot from the station leaving his portmanteau to be carried the direct way was steep and he liked the slow approach which gave him a chance to look about the place and smell the newmown hay at this season the air was full of itthe fields were so near that it was in the clean still streets nick would never have thought of rattling up to mr carterets door which had on an old brass plate the proprietors name as if he had been the principal surgeon the house was in the high part and the neat roofs of other houses lower down the hill made an immediate prospect for it scarcely counting however since the green country was just below these familiar and interpenetrating in the shape of small but thicktufted gardens free gardengrowths flourished in all the intervals but the only disorder of the place was that there were sometimes oats on the pavements a crooked lane with postern doors and cobblestones opened near mr carterets house and wandered toward the old abbey for the abbey was the secondary fact of beauclereit came after mr carteret mr carteret sometimes went away and the abbey never did yet somehow what was most of the essence of the place was that it could boast of the resident in the squarest of the square red houses the one with the finest of the arched hallwindows in three divisions over the widest of the lastcentury doorways you saw the great church from the doorstep beyond gardens of course and in the stillness you could hear the flutter of the birds that circled round its huge short towers the towers had been finished only as time finishes things by lending assurances to their lapses there is something right in old monuments that have been wrong for centuries some such moral as that was usually in nicks mind as an emanation of beauclere when he saw the grand line of the roof ride the sky and draw out its length  when the door with the brass plate was opened and mr chayter appeared in the middle distancehe always advanced just to the same spot as a prime minister receives an ambassadornick felt anew that he would be wonderfully like mr carteret if he had had an expression he denied himself this freedom never giving a sign of recognition often as the young man had been at the house he was most attentive to the visitors wants but apparently feared that if he allowed a familiarity it might go too far there was always the same question to be askedhad mr carteret finished his nap he usually had not finished it and this left nick what he likedtime to smoke a cigarette in the garden or even to take before dinner a turn about the place he observed now every time he came that mr carterets nap lasted a little longer there was each year a little more strength to be gathered for the ceremony of dinner this was the principal symptomalmost the only onethat the clearcheeked old gentleman gave of not being so fresh as of yore he was still wonderful for his age today he was particularly careful chayter went so far as to mention to nick that four gentlemen were expected to dinneran exuberance perhaps partly explained by the circumstance that lord bottomley was one of them  the prospect of lord bottomley was somehow not stirring it only made the young man say to himself with a quick thin sigh this time i am in for it and he immediately had the unpolitical sense again that there was nothing so pleasant as the way the quiet bachelor house had its best rooms on the big garden which seemed to advance into them through their wide windows and ruralise their dulness  i expect it will be a lateish eight sir said mr chayter superintending in the library the production of tea on a large scale everything at mr carterets seemed to nick on a larger scale than anywhere elsethe teacups the knives and forks the doorhandles the chairbacks the legs of mutton the candles and the lumps of coal they represented and apparently exhausted the masters sense of pleasing effect for the house was not otherwise decorated nick thought it really hideous but he was capable at any time of extracting a degree of amusement from anything strongly characteristic and mr carterets interior expressed a whole view of life our young man was generous enough to find in it a hundred instructive intimations even while it came over himas it always did at beauclerethat this was the view he himself was expected to take nowhere were the boiled eggs at breakfast so big or in such big receptacles his own shoes arranged in his room looked to him vaster there than at home he went out into the garden and remembered what enormous strawberries they should have for dinner in the house was a great deal of landseer of oilcloth of woodwork painted and grained  finding there would be time before the evening meal or before mr carteret was likely to see him he quitted the house and took a stroll toward the abbey it covered acres of ground on the summit of the hill and there were aspects in which its vast bulk reminded him of the ark left high and dry upon ararat it was the image at least of a great wreck of the indestructible vessel of a faith washed up there by a storm centuries before the injury of time added to this appearancethe infirmities round which as he knew the battle of restoration had begun to be fought the cry had been raised to save the splendid pile and the countercry by the purists the sentimentalists whatever they were to save it from being saved they were all exchanging compliments in the morning papers  nick sauntered about the churchit took a good while he leaned against low things and looked up at it while he smoked another cigarette it struck him as a great pity such a pile should be touched so much of the past was buried there that it was like desecrating like digging up a grave since the years were letting it down so gently why jostle the elbow of slowfingering time the fading afternoon was exquisitely pure the place was empty he heard nothing but the cries of several children which sounded sweet who were playing on the flatness of the very old tombs he knew this would inevitably be one of the topics at dinner the restoration of the abbey it would give rise to a considerable deal of orderly debate lord bottomley oddly enough would probably oppose the expensive project but on grounds that would be characteristic of him even if the attitude were not nicks nerves always knew on this spot what it was to be soothed but he shifted his position with a slight impatience as the vision came over him of lord bottomleys treating a question of esthetics it was enough to make one want to take the other side the idea of having the same taste as his lordship one would have it for such different reasons  dear mr carteret would be deliberate and fair all round and would like his noble friend exhibit much more architectural knowledge than he nick possessed which would not make it a whit less droll to our young man that an artistic idea so little really assimilated should be broached at that table and in that air it would remain so outside of their minds and their minds would remain so outside of it it would be dropped at last however after half an hours gentle worrying and the conversation would incline itself to public affairs mr carteret would find his natural levelthe production of anecdote in regard to the formation of early ministries he knew more than any one else about the personages of whom certain cabinets would have consisted if they had not consisted of others his favourite exercise was to illustrate how different everything might have been from what it was and how the reason of the difference had always been somebodys inability to see his way to accept the view of somebody elsea view usually at the time discussed in strict confidence with mr carteret who surrounded his actual violation of that confidence thirty years later with many precautions against scandal in this retrospective vein at the head of his table the old gentleman enjoyed a hearing or at any rate commanded a silence often intense every one left it to some one else to ask another question and when by chance some one else did so every one was struck with admiration at any ones being able to say anything nick knew the moment when he himself would take a glass of a particular port and surreptitiously looking at his watch perceive it was ten oclock that timepiece might as well mark 1830  all this would be a part of the suggestion of leisure that invariably descended upon him at beauclerethe image of a sloping shore where the tide of time broke with a ripple too faint to be a warning but there was another admonition almost equally sure to descend upon his spirit during a stroll in a summer hour about the grand abbey to sink into it as the light lingered on the rough red walls and the local accent of the children sounded soft in the churchyard it was simply the sense of englanda sort of apprehended revelation of his country the dim annals of the place were sensibly heavily in the airfoundations bafflingly early a great monastic life wars of the roses with battles and blood in the streets and then the long quietude of the respectable centuries all cornfields and magistrates and vicarsand these things were connected with an emotion that arose from the green country the rich land so infinitely lived in and laid on him a hand that was too ghostly to press and yet somehow too urgent to be light it produced a throb he couldnt have spoken of it was so deep and that was half imagination and half responsibility these impressions melted together and made a general appeal of which with his new honours as a legislator he was the sentient subject if he had a love for that particular scene of life mightnt it have a love for him and expect something of him what fate could be so high as to grow old in a national affection what a fine sort of reciprocity making mere soreness of all the balms of indifference  the great church was still open and he turned into it and wandered a little in the twilight that had gathered earlier there the whole structure with its immensity of height and distance seemed to rest on tremendous factsfacts of achievement and enduranceand the huge norman pillars to loom through the dimness like the ghosts of heroes nick was more struck with its thick earthly than with its fine spiritual reference and he felt the oppression of his conscience as he walked slowly about it was in his mind that nothing in life was really clear all things were mingled and charged and that patriotism might be an uplifting passion even if it had to allow for lord bottomley and for mr carterets blindness on certain sides he presently noticed that halfpast seven was about to strike and as he went back to his old friends he couldnt have said if he walked in gladness or in gloom  mr carteret will be in the drawingroom at a quarter to eight sir chayter mentioned and nick as he went to dress asked himself what was the use of being a member of parliament if one was still sensitive to an intimation on the part of such a functionary that one ought already to have begun that business chayters words but meant that mr carteret would expect to have a little comfortable conversation with him before dinner nicks usual rapidity in dressing was however quite adequate to the occasion so that his host had not appeared when he went down there were flowers in the unfeminine saloon which contained several paintings in addition to the engravings of pictures of animals but nothing could prevent its reminding nick of a comfortable committeeroom  mr carteret presently came in with his goldheaded stick a laugh like a series of little warning coughs and the air of embarrassment that our young man always perceived in him at first he was almost eighty but was still shyhe laughed a great deal faintly and vaguely at nothing as if to make up for the seriousness with which he took some jokes he always began by looking away from his interlocutor and it was only little by little that his eyes came round after which their limpid and benevolent blue made you wonder why they should ever be circumspect he was cleanshaven and had a long upper lip when he had seated himself he talked of majorities and showed a disposition to converse on the general subject of the fluctuation of liberal gains he had an extraordinary memory for facts of this sort and could mention the figures relating to the returns from innumerable places in particular years to many of these facts he attached great importance in his simple kindly presupposing way correcting himself five minutes later if he had said that in 1857 some one had had 6014 instead of 6004  nick always felt a great hypocrite as he listened to him in spite of the old mans courtesya thing so charming in itself that it would have been grossness to speak of him as a bore the difficulty was that he took for granted all kinds of positive assent and nick in such company found himself steeped in an element of tacit pledges which constituted the very medium of intercourse and yet made him draw his breath a little in pain when for a moment he measured them there would have been no hypocrisy at all if he could have regarded mr carteret as a mere sweet spectacle the last or almost the last illustration of a departing tradition of manners but he represented something more than manners he represented what he believed to be morals and ideas ideas as regards which he took your personal deferencenot discovering how natural that wasfor participation nick liked to think that his father though ten years younger had found it congruous to make his best friend of the owner of so nice a nature it gave a softness to his feeling for that memory to be reminded that sir nicholas had been of the same general typea type so pure so disinterested so concerned for the public good just so it endeared mr carteret to him to perceive that he considered his father had done a definite work prematurely interrupted which had been an absolute benefit to the people of england the oddity was however that though both mr carterets aspect and his appreciation were still so fresh this relation of his to his late distinguished friend made the latter appear to nick even more irrecoverably dead the good old man had almost a vocabulary of his own made up of oldfashioned political phrases and quite untainted with the new terms mostly borrowed from america indeed his language and his tone made those of almost any one who might be talking with him sound by contrast rather american he was at least nowadays never severe nor denunciatory but sometimes in telling an anecdote he dropped such an expression as the rascal said to me or such an epithet as the vulgar dog  nick was always struck with the rare simplicityit came out in his countenanceof one who had lived so long and seen so much of affairs that draw forth the passions and perversities of men it often made him say to himself that mr carteret must have had many odd parts to have been able to achieve with his means so many things requiring cleverness it was as if experience though coming to him in abundance had dealt with him so cleanhandedly as to leave no stain and had moreover never provoked him to any general reflexion he had never proceeded in any ironic way from the particular to the general certainly he had never made a reflexion upon anything so unparliamentary as life he would have questioned the taste of such an extravagance and if he had encountered it on the part of another have regarded it as an imported foreign toy with the uses of which he was unacquainted life for him was a purely practical function not a question of more or less showy phrasing it must be added that he had to nicks perception his variationshis back windows opening into grounds more private that was visible from the way his eye grew cold and his whole polite face rather austere when he listened to something he didnt agree with or perhaps even understand as if his modesty didnt in strictness forbid the suspicion that a thing he didnt understand would have a probability against it at such times there was something rather deadly in the silence in which he simply waited with a lapse in his face not helping his interlocutor out nick would have been very sorry to attempt to communicate to him a matter he wouldnt be likely to understand this cut off of course a multitude of subjects  the evening passed exactly as he had foreseen even to the markedly prompt dispersal of the guests two of whom were local men earnest and distinct though not particularly distinguished the third was a young slim uninitiated gentleman whom lord bottomley brought with him and concerning whom nick was informed beforehand that he was engaged to be married to the honourable jane his lordships second daughter there were recurrent allusions to nicks victory as to which he had the fear that he might appear to exhibit less interest in it than the company did he took energetic precautions against this and felt repeatedly a little spent with them for the subject always came up once more yet it was not as his but as theirs that they liked the triumph mr carteret took leave of him for the night directly after the other guests had gone using at this moment the words he had often used before  you may sit up to any hour you like i only ask that you dont read in bed     xvii   nicks little visit was to terminate immediately after luncheon the following day much as the old man enjoyed his being there he wouldnt have dreamed of asking for more of his time now that it had such great public uses he liked infinitely better that his young friend should be occupied with parliamentary work than only occupied in talking it over with him talking it over however was the next best thing as on the morrow after breakfast mr carteret showed nick he considered they sat in the garden the morning being warm and the old man had a table beside him covered with the letters and newspapers the post had poured forth he was proud of his correspondence which was altogether on public affairs and proud in a manner of the fact that he now dictated almost everything that had more in it of the statesman in retirement a character indeed not consciously assumed by mr carteret but always tacitly attributed to him by nick who took it rather from the pictorial point of viewremembering on each occasion only afterwards that though he was in retirement he had not exactly been a statesman a young man a very sharp handy young man came every morning at ten oclock and wrote for him till luncheon the young man had a holiday today in honour of nicks visita fact the mention of which led nick to make some not particularly sincere speech about his being ready to write anything if mr carteret were at all pressed  ah but your own budgetwhat will become of that the old gentleman objected glancing at nicks pockets as if rather surprised not to see them stuffed out with documents in split envelopes his visitor had to confess that he had not directed his letters to meet him at beauclere he should find them in town that afternoon this led to a little homily from mr carteret which made him feel quite guilty there was such an implication of neglected duty in the way the old man said you wont do them justiceyou wont do them justice he talked for ten minutes in his rich simple urbane way about the fatal consequences of getting behind it was his favourite doctrine that one should always be a little before and his own eminently regular respiration seemed to illustrate the idea a man was certainly before who had so much in his rear  this led to the bestowal of a good deal of general advice on the mistakes to avoid at the beginning of a parliamentary careeras to which mr carteret spoke with the experience of one who had sat for fifty years in the house of commons nick was amused but also mystified and even a little irritated by his talk it was founded on the idea of observation and yet our young man couldnt at all regard him as an observer he doesnt observe me he said to himself if he did he would see he wouldnt think the end of this private cogitation was a vague impatience of all the things his venerable host took for granted he didnt see any of the things nick saw some of these latter were the light touches the summer morning scattered through the sweet old garden the time passed there a good deal as if it were sitting still with a plaid under its feet while mr carteret distilled a little more of the wisdom he had laid up in his fifty years this immense term had something fabulous and monstrous for nick who wondered whether it were the sort of thing his companion supposed he had gone in for it was not strange mr carteret should be different he might originally have been morewell to himself nick was not obliged to phrase it what our young man meant was more of what it was perceptible to him that his old friend was not should even he nick be like that at the end of fifty years what mr carteret was so good as to expect for him was that he should be much more distinguished and wouldnt this exactly mean much more like that of course nick heard some things he had heard before as for instance the circumstances that had originally led the old man to settle at beauclere he had been returned for that boroughit was his second seatin years far remote and had come to live there because he then had a conscientious conviction modified indeed by later experience that a member should be constantly resident he spoke of this now smiling rosily as he might have spoken of some wild aberration of his youth yet he called nicks attention to the fact that he still so far clung to his conviction as to holdthough of what might be urged on the other side he was perfectly awarethat a representative should at least be as resident as possible this gave nick an opening for something that had been on and off his lips all the morning  according to that i ought to take up my abode at harsh  in the measure of the convenient i shouldnt be sorry to see you do it  it ought to be rather convenient nick largely smiled ive got a piece of news for you which ive kept as one keeps that sort of thingfor its very goodtill the last he waited a little to see if mr carteret would guess and at first thought nothing would come of this but after resting his younglooking eyes on him for a moment the old man said  i should indeed be very happy to hear that youve arranged to take a wife  mrs dallow has been so good as to say shell marry me nick returned  thats very suitable i should think it would answer  its very jolly said nick it was well mr carteret was not what his guest called observant or he might have found a lower pitch in the sound of this sentence than in the sense  your dear father would have liked it  so my mother says  and she must be delighted  mrs dallow do you mean nick asked  i was thinking of your mother but i dont exclude the charming lady i remember her as a little girl i must have seen her at windrush now i understand the fine spirit with which she threw herself into your canvass  it was her they elected said nick  i dont know his host went on that ive ever been an enthusiast for political women but theres no doubt that in approaching the mass of electors a graceful affable manner the manner of the real english lady is a force not to be despised  julias a real english lady and at the same time a very political woman nick remarked  isnt it rather in the family i remember once going to see her mother in town and finding the leaders of both parties sitting with her  my principal friend of the others is her brother peter i dont think he troubles himself much about that sort of thing said nick  what does he trouble himself about mr carteret asked with a certain gravity  hes in the diplomatic service hes a secretary in paris  that may be serious said the old man  he takes a great interest in the theatre i suppose youll say that may be serious too nick laughed  ohand mr carteret looked as if he scarcely understood then he continued well it cant hurt you  it cant hurt me  if mrs dallow takes an interest in your interests  when a mans in my situation he feels as if nothing could hurt him  im very glad youre happy said mr carteret he rested his mild eyes on our young man who had a sense of seeing in them for a moment the faint ghost of an old story the last strange flicker as from cold ashes of a flame that had become the memory of a memory this glimmer of wonder and envy the revelation of a life intensely celibate was for an instant infinitely touching nick had harboured a theory suggested by a vague allusion from his father who had been discreet that their benevolent friend had had in his youth an unhappy loveaffair which had led him to forswear for ever the commerce of woman what remained in him of conscious renunciation gave a throb as he looked at his bright companion who proposed to take the matter so much the other way its good to marry and i think its right ive not done right i know that if shes a good woman its the best thing mr carteret went on its what ive been hoping for you sometimes ive thought of speaking to you  shes a very good woman said nick  and i hope shes not poor mr carteret spoke exactly with the same blandness  no indeed shes rich her husband whom i knew and liked left her a large fortune  and on what terms does she enjoy it  i havent the least idea said nick  mr carteret considered i see it doesnt concern you it neednt concern you he added in a moment  nick thought of his mother at this but he returned i daresay she can do what she likes with her money  so can i my dear young friend said mr carteret  nick tried not to look conscious for he felt a significance in the old mans face he turned his own everywhere but toward it thinking again of his mother that must be very pleasant if one has any  i wish you had a little more  i dont particularly care said nick  your marriage will assist you you cant help that mr carteret declared but i should like you to be under obligations not quite so heavy  oh im so obliged to her for caring for me  that the rest doesnt count certainly its nice of her to like you but why shouldnt she other people do  some of them make me feel as if i abused it said nick looking at his host that is they dont make me but i feel it he corrected  ive no son and mr carteret spoke as if his companion mightnt have been sure shant you be very kind to her he pursued youll gratify her ambition  oh she thinks me cleverer than i am  thats because shes in love the old gentleman hinted as if this were very subtle however you must be as clever as we think you if you dont prove so and he paused with his folded hands  well if i dont asked nick  oh it wont doit wont do said mr carteret in a tone his companion was destined to remember afterwards i say ive no son he continued but if i had had one he should have risen high  its well for me such a person doesnt exist i shouldnt easily have found a wife  he would have gone to the altar with a little money in his pocket  that would have been the least of his advantages sir nick declared  when are you to be married mr carteret asked  ah thats the question julia wont yet say  well said the old man without the least flourish you may consider that when it comes off ill make you a settlement  i feel your kindness more than i can express nick replied but that will probably be the moment when i shall be least conscious of wanting anything  youll appreciate it lateryoull appreciate it very soon i shall like you to appreciate it mr carteret went on as if he had a just vision of the way a young man of a proper spirit should feel then he added your father would have liked you to appreciate it  poor father nick exclaimed vaguely rather embarrassed reflecting on the oddity of a position in which the ground for holding up his head as the husband of a rich woman would be that he had accepted a present of money from another source it was plain he was not fated to go in for independence the most that he could treat himself to would be dependence that was duly grateful how much do you expect of me he inquired with a grave face  well nicholas only what your father did he so often spoke of you i remember at the last just after you had been with him aloneyou know i saw him then he was greatly moved by his interview with you and so was i by what he told me of it he said he should live on in youhe should work in you it has always given me a special feeling if i may use the expression about you  the feelings are indeed not usual dear mr carteret which take so munificent a form but you dooh you doexpect too much nick brought himself to say  i expect you to repay me the old man returned gaily as for the form i have it in my mind  the form of repayment  the form of repayment  ah dont talk of that now said nick for you see nothing else is settled no one has been told except my mother she has only consented to my telling you  lady agnes do you mean  ah no dear mother would like to publish it on the housetops shes so gladshe wants us to have it over tomorrow but julia herself nick explained wishes to wait therefore kindly mention it for the present to no one  my dear boy theres at this rate nothing to mention what does julia want to wait for  till i like her betterthats what she says  its the way to make you like her worse mr carteret knowingly declared hasnt she your affection  so much so that her delay makes me exceedingly unhappy  mr carteret looked at his young friend as if he didnt strike him as quite wretched but he put the question then what more does she want nick laughed out at this though perceiving his host hadnt meant it as an epigram while the latter resumed i dont understand youre engaged or youre not engaged  she is but im not thats what she says about it the trouble is she doesnt believe in me  mr carteret shone with his candour doesnt she love you then  thats what i ask her her answer is that she loves me only too well shes so afraid of being a burden to me that she gives me my freedom till ive taken another year to think  i like the way you talk about other years mr carteret cried you had better do it while im here to bless you  she thinks i proposed to her because she got me in for harsh said nick  well im sure it would be a very pretty return  ah she doesnt believe in me the young man repeated  then i dont believe in her  dont say thatdont say that shes a very rare creature but shes proud shy suspicious  suspicious of what  of everything she thinks im not persistent  oh ohnicks host deprecated such freedom  she cant believe i shall arrive at true eminence  a good wife should believe what her husband believes said mr carteret  ah unfortunatelyand nick took the words at a runi dont believe it either  mr carteret who might have been watching an odd physical rush spoke with a certain dryness your dear father did  i think of thati think of that nick replied  certainly it will help me if i say were engaged he went on its because i consider it so she gives me my liberty but i dont take it  does she expect you to take back your word  thats what i ask her she never will therefore were as good as tied  i dont like it said mr carteret after a moment i dont like ambiguous uncertain situations they please me much better when theyre definite and clear the retreat of expression had been sounded in his facethe aspect it wore when he wished not to be encouraging but after an instant he added in a tone more personal dont disappoint me dear boy  ah not willingly his visitor protested  ive told you what i should like to do for you see that the conditions come about promptly in which i may do it are you sure you do everything to satisfy mrs dallow mr carteret continued  i think im very nice to her nick declared but shes so ambitious frankly speaking its a pity for her that she likes me  she cant help that the old man charmingly said  possibly but isnt it a reason for taking me as i am what she wants to do is to take me as i may be a year hence  i dont understandsince you tell me that even then she wont take back her word said mr carteret  if she doesnt marry me i think shell never marry again at all  what then does she gain by delay  simply this as i make it out said nickthat shell feel she has been very magnanimous she wont have to reproach herself with not having given me a chance to change  to change what does she think you liable to do  nick had a pause i dont know he then saidnot at all candidly  everything has altered young people in my day looked at these questions more naturally mr carteret observed a woman in love has no need to be magnanimous if she plays too fair she isnt in love he added shrewdly  oh julias safeshes safe nick smiled  if it were a question between you and another gentleman one might comprehend but what does it mean between you and nothing  im much obliged to you sir nick returned the trouble is that she doesnt know what she has got hold of  ah if you cant make it clear to herand his friend showed the note of impatience  im such a humbug said the young man and while his companion stared he continued i deceive people without in the least intending it  what on earth do you mean are you deceiving me  i dont knowit depends on what you think  i think youre flighty said mr carteret with the nearest approach to sternness nick had ever observed in him i never thought so before  forgive me its all right im not frivolous that i promise you im not  you have deceived me if you are  its all right nick stammered with a blush  remember your namecarry it high  i willas high as possible  youve no excuse dont tell me after your speeches at harsh nick was on the point of declaring again that he was a humbug so vivid was his inner sense of what he thought of his factitious public utterances which had the cursed property of creating dreadful responsibilities and importunate credulities for him if he was clever ah the idiotic clever what fools many other people were he repressed his impulse and mr carteret pursued if as you express it mrs dallow doesnt know what she has got hold of wont it clear the matter up a little by informing her that the day before your marriage is definitely settled to take place youll come into something comfortable  a quick vision of what mr carteret would be likely to regard as something comfortable flitted before nick but it didnt prevent his replying oh im afraid that wont do any good it would make her like you better but it wouldnt make her like me im afraid she wont care for any benefit that comes to me from another hand than hers her affections a very jealous sentiment  its a very peculiar one sighed mr carteret mines a jealous sentiment too however if she takes it that way dont tell her  ill let you know as soon as she comes round said nick  and youll tell your mother mr carteret returned i shall like her to know  it will be delightful news to her but shes keen enough already  i know that i may mention now that she has written to me the old man added  so i suspected  weveacorresponded on the subject mr carteret continued to confess my view of the advantageous character of such an alliance has entirely coincided with hers  it was very goodnatured of you then to leave me to speak first said nick  i should have been disappointed if you hadnt i dont like all youve told me but dont disappoint me now  dear mr carteret nick vaguely and richly sounded  i wont disappoint you that gentleman went on with a finer point while he looked at his big oldfashioned watch     book fourth     xviii   at first peter sherringham thought of asking to be transferred to another post and went so far in london as to take what he believed good advice on the subject the advice perhaps struck him as the better for consisting of a strong recommendation to do nothing so foolish two or three reasons were mentioned to him why such a request would not in the particular circumstances raise him in the esteem of his superiors and he promptly recognised their force he next became aware that it might help himnot with his superiors but with himselfto apply for an extension of leave and then on further reflexion made out that though there are some dangers before which it is perfectly consistent with honour to flee it was better for every one concerned that he should fight this especial battle on the spot during his holiday his plan of campaign gave him plenty of occupation he refurbished his arms rubbed up his strategy laid down his lines of defence  there was only one thing in life his mind had been much made up to but on this question he had never wavered he would get on to the utmost in his profession that was a point on which it was perfectly lawful to be unamiable to othersto be vigilant eager suspicious selfish he had not in fact been unamiable to others for his affairs had not required it he had got on well enough without hardening his heart fortune had been kind to him and he had passed so many competitors on the way that he could forswear jealousy and be generous but he had always flattered himself his hand wouldnt falter on the day he should find it necessary to drop bitterness into his cup this day would be sure to dawn since no career could be all clear water to the end and then the sacrifice would find him ready his mind was familiar with the thought of a sacrifice it is true that no great plainness invested beforehand the occasion the object or the victim all that particularly stood out was that the propitiatory offering would have to be some cherished enjoyment very likely indeed this enjoyment would be associated with the charms of another persona probability pregnant with the idea that such charms would have to be dashed out of sight at any rate it never had occurred to sherringham that he himself might be the sacrifice you had to pay to get on but at least you borrowed from others to do it when you couldnt borrow you didnt get on for what was the situation in life in which you met the whole requisition yourself  least of all had it occurred to our friend that the wrench might come through his interest in that branch of art on which nick dormer had rallied him the beauty of a love of the theatre was precisely in its being a passion exercised on the easiest terms this was not the region of responsibility it was sniffed at to its discredit by the austere but if it was not as such people said a serious field was not the compensation just that you couldnt be seriously entangled in it sherringhams great advantage as he regarded the matter was that he had always kept his taste for the drama quite in its place his facetious cousin was free to pretend that it sprawled through his life but this was nonsense as any unprejudiced observer of that life would unhesitatingly attest there had not been the least sprawling and his interest in the art of garrick had never he was sure made him in any degree ridiculous it had never drawn down from above anything approaching a reprimand a remonstrance a remark sherringham was positively proud of his discretion for he was not a little proud of what he did know about the stage trifling for trifling there were plenty of his fellows who had in their lives infatuations less edifying and less confessable hadnt he known men who collected old invitationcards and were ready to commit bassesses for those of the eighteenth century hadnt he known others who had a secret passion for shuffleboard his little weaknesses were intellectualthey were a part of the life of the mind all the same on the day they showed a symptom of interfering they should be plucked off with a turn of the wrist  sherringham scented interference now and interference in rather an invidious form it might be a bore from the point of view of the profession to find ones self as a critic of the stage in love with a coquine but it was a much greater bore to find ones self in love with a young woman whose character remained to be estimated miriam rooth was neither fish nor flesh one had with her neither the guarantees of ones own class nor the immunities of hers what was hers if one came to that a rare ambiguity on this point was part of the fascination she had ended by throwing over him poor peters scheme for getting on had contained no proviso against his falling in love but it had embodied an important clause on the subject of surprises it was always a surprise to fall in love especially if one was looking out for it so this contingency had not been worth official paper but it became a man who respected the service he had undertaken for the state to be on his guard against predicaments from which the only issue was the rigour of matrimony ambition in the career was probably consistent with marryingbut only with opening ones eyes very wide to do it that was the fatal surpriseto be led to the altar in a dream sherringhams view of the proprieties attached to such a step was high and strict and if he held that a man in his position was above all as the position improved essentially a representative of the greatness of his country he considered that the wife of such a personage would exercise in her degreefor instance at a foreign courta function no less symbolic she would in short always be a very important quantity and the scene was strewn with illustrations of this general truth she might be such a help and might be such a blight that common prudence required some test of her in advance sherringham had seen women in the career who were stupid or vulgar make such a mess of things as would wring your heart then he had his positive idea of the perfect ambassadress the fullblown lily of the future and with this idea miriam rooth presented no analogy whatever  the girl had described herself with characteristic directness as all right and so she might be so she assuredly was only all right for what he had made out she was not sentimentalthat whatever capacity she might have for responding to a devotion or for desiring it was at any rate not in the direction of vague philandering with him certainly she had no disposition to philander sherringham almost feared to dwell on this lest it should beget in him a rage convertible mainly into caring for her more rage or no rage it would be charming to be in love with her if there were no complications but the complications were just what was clearest in the prospect he was perhaps coldblooded to think of them but it must be remembered that they were the particular thing his training had equipped him for dealing with he was at all events not too coldblooded to have for the two months of his holiday very little inner vision of anything more abstract than miriams face the desire to see it again was as pressing as thirst but he tried to practise the endurance of the traveller in the desert he kept the channel between them but his spirit consumed every day an inch of the interval untiland it was not longthere were no more inches left the last thing he expected the future ambassadress to have been was fille de théâtre the answer to this objection was of course that miriam was not yet so much of one but that he could easily by a handsome worldly offer arrest her development then came worrying retorts to that chief among which was the sense that to his artistic conscience arresting her development would be a plan combining on his part fatuity not to say imbecility with baseness it was exactly to her development the poor girl had the greatest right and he shouldnt really alter anything by depriving her of it wasnt she the artist to the tips of her tressesthe ambassadress never in the worldand wouldnt she take it out in something else if one were to make her deviate so certain was that demonic gift to insist ever on its own  besides could one make her deviate if she had no disposition to philander what was his warrant for supposing she could be corrupted into respectability how could the careerhis careerspeak to a nature that had glimpses as vivid as they were crude of such a different range and for which success meant quite another sauce to the dish would the brilliancy of marrying peter sherringham be such a bribe to relinquishment how could he think so without pretensions of the sort he pretended exactly not to flaunthow could he put himself forward as so high a prize relinquishment of the opportunity to exercise a rare talent was not in the nature of things an easy effort to a young lady who was herself presumptuous as well as ambitious besides she might eat her cake and have itmight make her fortune both on the stage and in the world successful actresses had ended by marrying dukes and was not that better than remaining obscure and marrying a commoner there were moments when he tried to pronounce the girls gift not a force to reckon with there was so little to show for it as yet that the caprice of believing in it would perhaps suddenly leave him but his conviction that it was real was too uneasy to make such an experiment peaceful and he came back moreover to his deepest impressionthat of her being of the inward mould for which the only consistency is the play of genius hadnt madame carré declared at the last that she could do anything it was true that if madame carré had been mistaken in the first place she might also be mistaken in the second but in this latter case she would be mistaken with himand such an error would be too like a truth  how further shall we exactly measure for himsherringham felt the discomfort of the advantage miriam had of himthe advantage of her presenting herself in a light that rendered any passion he might entertain an implication of duty as well as of pleasure why there should have been this implication was more than he could say sometimes he held himself rather abject or at least absurdly superstitious for seeing it he didnt know he could scarcely conceive of another case of the same general type in which he would have recognised it in foreign countries there were very few ladies of miss rooths intended profession who would not have regarded it as too strong an order that to console them for not being admitted into drawingrooms they should have no offset but the exercise of a virtue in which no one would believe this was because in foreign countries actresses were not admitted into drawingrooms that was a pure english drollery ministering equally little to real histrionics and to the higher tone of these resorts did the oppressive sanctity which made it a burden to have to reckon with his young friend come then from her being english peter could recall cases in which that privilege operated as little as possible as a restriction it came a great deal from mrs rooth in whom he apprehended depths of calculation as to what she might achieve for her daughter by working the idea of a life blameless amid dire obsessions her romantic turn of mind wouldnt in the least prevent her regarding that idea as a substantial capital to be laid out to the best worldly advantage miriams essential irreverence was capable on a pretext of making mincemeat of itthat he was sure of for the only capital she recognised was the talent which some day managers and agents would outbid each other in paying for yet as a creature easy at so many points she was fond of her mother would do anything to obligethat might work in all sorts of waysand would probably like the loose slippers of blamelessness quite as well as having to meet some of the queer high standards of the opposite camp  sherringham i may add had no desire that she should indulge a different preference it was distasteful to him to compute the probabilities of a young ladys misbehaving for his advantagethat seemed to him definitely baseand he would have thought himself a blackguard if even when a prey to his desire he had not wished the thing that was best for the object of it the thing best for miriam might be to become the wife of the man to whose suit she should incline her ear that this would be the best thing for the gentleman in question by no means however equally followed and sherringhams final conviction was that it would never do for him to act the part of that hypothetic personage he asked for no removal and no extension of leave and he proved to himself how well he knew what he was about by never addressing a line during his absence to the hôtel de la garonne he would simply go straight inflicting as little injury on peter sherringham as on any one else he remained away to the last hour of his privilege and continued to act lucidly in having nothing to do with the mother and daughter for several days after his return to paris  it was when this discipline came to an end one afternoon after a week had passed that he felt most the force of the reference we have just made to mrs rooths private calculations he found her at home alone writing a letter under the lamp and as soon as he came in she cried out that he was the very person to whom the letter was addressed she could bear it no longer she had permitted herself to reproach him with his terrible silenceto ask why he had quite forsaken them it was an illustration of the way in which her visitor had come to regard her that he put rather less than more faith into this description of the crumpled papers lying on the table he was not even sure he quite believed miriam to have just gone out he told her mother how busy he had been all the while he was away and how much time above all he had had to give in london to seeing on her daughters behalf the people connected with the theatres  ah if you pity me tell me youve got her an engagement mrs rooth cried while she clasped her hands  i took a great deal of trouble i wrote ever so many notes sought introductions talked with peoplesuch impossible people some of them in short i knocked at every door i went into the question exhaustively and he enumerated the things he had done reported on some of the knowledge he had gathered the difficulties were immense and even with the influence he could command such as it was there was very little to be achieved in face of them still he had gained ground two or three approachable fellows men with inferior theatres had listened to him better than the others and there was one in particular whom he had a hope he really might have interested from him he had extracted benevolent assurances this person would see miriam would listen to her would do for her what he could the trouble was that no one would lift a finger for a girl unless she were known and yet that she never could become known till innumerable fingers had been lifted you couldnt go into the water unless you could swim and you couldnt swim until you had been in the water  but new performers appear they get theatres they get audiences they get notices in the newspapers mrs rooth objected i know of these things only what miriam tells me its no knowledge that i was born to  its perfectly true its all done with money  and how do they come by money mrs rooth candidly asked  when theyre women people give it to them  well what people now  people who believe in them  as you believe in miriam  peter had a pause no rather differently a poor man doesnt believe in anything the same way that a rich man does  ah dont call yourself poor groaned mrs rooth  what good would it do me to be rich  why you could take a theatre you could do it all yourself  and what good would that do me  ah dont you delight in her genius demanded mrs rooth  i delight in her mother you think me more disinterested than i am sherringham added with a certain soreness of irritation  i know why you didnt write mrs rooth declared archly  you must go to london peter said without heeding this remark  ah if we could only get there it would be a relief i should draw a long breath there at least i know where i am and what people are but here one lives on hollow ground  the sooner you get away the better our young man went on  i know why you say that  its just what im explaining  i couldnt have held out if i hadnt been so sure of miriam said mrs rooth  well you neednt hold out any longer  dont you trust her asked sherringhams hostess  trust her  you dont trust yourself thats why you were silent why we might have thought you were dead why we might have perished ourselves  i dont think i understand you i dont know what youre talking about peter returned but it doesnt matter  doesnt it let yourself go why should you struggle the old woman agreeably inquired  her unexpected insistence annoyed her visitor and he was silent again meeting her eyes with reserve and on the point of telling her that he didnt like her tone but he had his tongue under such control that he was able presently to say instead of thisand it was a relief to him to give audible voice to the reflexionits a great mistake either way for a man to be in love with an actress either it means nothing serious and whats the use of that or it means everything and thats still more delusive  delusive  idle unprofitable  surely a pure affection is its own beautiful reward mrs rooth pleaded with soft reasonableness  in such a case how can it be pure  i thought you were talking of an english gentleman she replied  call the poor fellow whatever you like a man with his life to lead his way to make his work his duties his career to attend to if it means nothing as i say the thing it means least of all is marriage  oh my own miriam mrs rooth wailed  fancy on the other hand the complication when such a man marries a woman whos on the stage  mrs rooth looked as if she were trying to follow miriam isnt on the stage yet  go to london and she soon will be  yes and then youll have your excuse  my excuse  for deserting us altogether  he broke into laughter at this the logic was so droll then he went on show me some good acting and i wont desert you  good acting ah whats the best acting compared with the position of a true english lady if youll take her as she is you may have her mrs rooth suddenly added  as she is with all her ambitions unassuaged  to marry youmight not that be an ambition  a very paltry one dont answer for her dont attempt that said peter you can do much better  do you think you can smiled mrs rooth  i dont want to i only want to let it alone shes an artist you must give her her head the young man pursued you must always give an artist his head  but ive known great ladies who were artists in english society theres always a field  dont talk to me of english society thank goodness in the first place i dont live in it do you want her to give up her genius he demanded  i thought you didnt care for it  shed say no i thank you dear mamma  my wonderful child mrs rooth almost comprehendingly murmured  have you ever proposed it to her  proposed it  that she should give up trying  mrs rooth hesitated looking down not for the reason you mean we dont talk about love she simpered  then its so much less time wasted dont stretch out your hand to the worse when it may some day grasp the better peter continued mrs rooth raised her eyes at him as if recognising the force there might be in that and he added let her blaze out let her look about her then you may talk to me if you like  its very puzzling the old woman artlessly sighed  he laughed again and then said now dont tell me im not a good friend  you are indeedyoure a very noble gentleman thats just why a quiet life with you  it wouldnt be quiet for me he broke in and thats not what miriam was made for  dont say that for my precious one mrs rooth quavered  go to londongo to london her visitor repeated  thoughtfully after an instant she extended her hand and took from the table the letter on the composition of which he had found her engaged then with a quick movement she tore it up thats what mr dashwood says  mr dashwood  i forgot you dont know him hes the brother of that lady we met the day you were so good as to receive us the one who was so kind to usmrs lovick  i never heard of him  dont you remember how she spoke of him and that mr lovick didnt seem very nice about him she told us that if he were to meet usand she was so good as to intimate that it would be a pleasure to him to do sohe might give us as she said a tip  peter achieved the effort to recollect yes he comes back to me hes an actor  hes a gentleman too said mrs rooth  and youve met him and he has given you a tip  as i say he wants us to go to london  i see but even i can tell you that  oh yes said mrs rooth but he says he can help us  keep hold of him then if hes in the business peter was all for that  hes a perfect gentleman said mrs rooth hes immensely struck with miriam  better and better keep hold of him  well im glad you dont object she grimaced  why should i object  you dont regard us as all your own  my own why i regard you as the publicsthe worlds  she gave a little shudder theres a sort of chill in that its grand but its cold however i neednt hesitate then to tell you that its with mr dashwood miriam has gone out  why hesitate gracious heaven but in the next breath sherringham asked where have they gone  you dont like it his hostess laughed  why should it be a thing to be enthusiastic about  well hes charming and i trust him  so do i said sherringham  theyve gone to see madame carré  she has come back then  she was expected back last week miriam wants to show her how she has improved  and has she improved  how can i tellwith my mothers heart asked mrs rooth i dont judge i only wait and pray but mr dashwood thinks shes wonderful  thats a blessing and when did he turn up  about a fortnight ago we met mrs lovick at the english church and she was so good as to recognise us and speak to us she said she had been away with her childrenotherwise shed have come to see us she had just returned to paris  yes ive not yet seen her i see lovick peter added but he doesnt talk of his brotherinlaw  i didnt that day like his tone about him mrs rooth observed we walked a little way with mrs lovick after church and she asked miriam about her prospects and if she were working miriam said she had no prospects  that wasnt very nice to me sherringham commented  but when you had left us in black darkness what were our prospects  i see its all right go on  then mrs lovick said her brother was to be in paris a few days and she would tell him to come and see us he arrived she told him and he came voilà said mrs rooth  so that nowso far as he is concernedmiss rooth has prospects  he isnt a manager unfortunately she qualified  where does he act  he isnt acting just now he has been abroad he has been to italy i believe and is just stopping here on his way to london  i see he is a perfect gentleman said sherringham  ah youre jealous of him  no but youre trying to make me so the more competitors there are for the glory of bringing her out the better for her  mr dashwood wants to take a theatre said mrs rooth  then perhaps hes our man  oh if youd help him she richly cried  help him  help him to help us  well all work together it will be very jolly said sherringham gaily its a sacred cause the love of art and we shall be a happy band dashwoods his name he added in a moment mrs lovick wasnt a dashwood  its his nom de théâtrebasil dashwood do you like it mrs rooth wonderfully inquired  you say that as miriam might her talents catching  shes always practisingalways saying things over and over to seize the tone ive her voice in my ears he wants her not to have any  not to have any what  any nom de théâtre he wants her to use her own he likes it so much he says it will do so wellyou cant better it  hes a capital adviser said sherringham getting up ill come back tomorrow  i wont ask you to wait for themthey may be so long his hostess returned  will he come back with her peter asked while he smoothed his hat  i hope so at this hour with my child in the streets i tremble we dont live in cabs as you may easily suppose  did they go on foot sherringham continued  oh yes they started in high spirits  and is mr basil dashwood acquainted with madame carré  ah no but he longed to be introduced to her he persuaded miriam to take him naturally she wishes to oblige him shes very nice to himif he can do anything  quite right thats the way peter cheerfully rang out  and she also wanted him to see what she can do for the great critic mrs rooth addedthat terrible old woman in the red wig  thats what i should like to see too peter permitted himself to acknowledge  oh she has gone ahead shes pleased with herself work work work said madame carré well she has worked worked worked thats what mr dashwood is pleased with even more than with other things  what do you mean by other things  oh her genius and her fine appearance  he approves of her fine appearance i ask because you think he knows what will take  i know why you ask mrs rooth bravely mocked he says it will be worth hundreds of thousands to her  thats the sort of thing i like to hear peter returned ill come in tomorrow he repeated  and shall you mind if mr dash woods here  does he come every day  oh theyre always at it  at it he was vague  why she acts to himevery sort of thingand he says if it will do  how many days has he been here then  mrs rooth reflected oh i dont know since he turned up theyve passed so quickly  so far from minding it im eager to see him sherringham declared and i can imagine nothing better than what you describeif he isnt an awful ass  dear me if he isnt clever you must tell us we cant afford to be deceived mrs rooth innocently wailed what do we knowhow can we judge she appealed  he had a pause his hand on the latch oh ill tell you frankly what i think of him     xix   when he got into the street he looked about him for a cab but was obliged to walk some distance before encountering one in this little interval he saw no reason to modify the determination he had formed in descending the steep staircase of the hôtel de la garonne indeed the desire prompting it only quickened his pace he had an hour to spare and would also go to see madame carré if miriam and her companion had proceeded to the rue de constantinople on foot he would probably reach the house as soon as they it was all quite logical he was eager to see miriamthat was natural enough and he had admitted to mrs rooth that he was keen on the subject of mrs lovicks theatrical brother in whom such effective aid might perhaps reside to catch miriam really revealing herself to the old actress after the jump she believed herself to have takensince that was her errandwould be a very happy stroke the thought of which made her benefactor impatient he presently found his cab and as he bounded in bade the coachman drive fast he learned from madame carrés portress that her illustrious locataire was at home and that a lady and a gentleman had gone up some time before  in the little antechamber after his admission he heard a high voice come from the salon and stopping a moment to listen noted that miriam was already launched in a recitation he was able to make out the words all the more that before he could prevent the movement the maidservant who had led him in had already opened the door of the roomone of the leaves of it there being as in most french doors two of thesebefore which within a heavy curtain was suspended miriam was in the act of rolling out some speech from the english poetic drama      for i am sick and capable of fears     oppressed with wrongs and therefore full of fears  he recognised one of the great tirades of shakespeares constance and saw she had just begun the magnificent scene at the beginning of the third act of king john in which the passionate injured mother and widow sweeps in wild organtones the entire scale of her irony and wrath the curtain concealed him and he lurked three minutes after he had motioned to the femme de chambre to retire on tiptoe the trio in the salon absorbed in the performance had apparently not heard his entrance or the opening of the door which was covered by the girls splendid declamation peter listened intently arrested by the spirit with which she attacked her formidable verses he had needed to hear her set afloat but a dozen of them to measure the long stride she had taken in his absence they assured him she had leaped into possession of her means he remained where he was till she arrived at      then speak again not all thy former tale     but this one word whether thy tale be true  this apostrophe briefly responded to in another voice gave him time quickly to raise the curtain and show himself passing into the room with a go on go on and a gesture earnestly deprecating a stop  miriam in the full swing of her part paused but for an instant and let herself ring out again while peter sank into the nearest chair and she fixed him with her illumined eyes that is with those of the raving constance madame carré buried in a chair kissed her hand to him and a young man who near the girl stood giving the cue stared at him over the top of a little book admirable magnificent go on sherringham repeatedgo on to the end of the scene do it all miriams colour rose yet he as quickly felt that she had no personal emotion in seeing him again the cold passion of art had perched on her banner and she listened to herself with an ear as vigilant as if she had been a paganini drawing a fiddlebow this effect deepened as she went on rising and rising to the great occasion moving with extraordinary ease and in the largest clearest style at the dizzy height of her idea that she had an idea was visible enough and that the whole thing was very different from all sherringham had hitherto heard her attempt it belonged quite to another class of effort she was now the finished statue lifted from the ground to its pedestal it was as if the sun of her talent had risen above the hills and she knew she was moving and would always move in its guiding light this conviction was the one artless thing that glimmered like a young joy through the tragic mask of constance and sherringhams heart beat faster as he caught it in her face it only showed her as more intelligent and yet there had been a time when he thought her stupid masterful the whole spirit in which she carried the scene making him cry to himself from point to point how she feels it sees it and really renders it  he looked now and again at madame carré and saw she had in her lap an open book apparently a french prose version brought by her visitors of the play but she never either glanced at him or at the volume she only sat screwing into the girl her hard bright eyes polished by experience like fine old brasses the young man uttering the lines of the other speakers was attentive in another degree he followed miriam in his own copy to keep sure of the cue but he was elated and expressive was evidently even surprised he coloured and smiled and when he extended his hand to assist constance to rise after the performer acting out her text had seated herself grandly on the huge firm earth he bowed over her as obsequiously as if she had been his veritable sovereign he was a goodlooking young man tall wellproportioned straightfeatured and fair of whom manifestly the first thing to be said on any occasion was that he had remarkably the stamp of a gentleman he earned this appearance which proved inveterate and importunate to a point that was almost a denial of its spirit so prompt the question of whether it could be in good taste to wear any character even that particular one so much on ones sleeve it was literally on his sleeve that this young man partly wore his own for it resided considerably in his garments and in especial in a certain closefitting dark blue frockcoat a miracle of a fit which moulded his juvenility just enough and not too much and constituted as sherringham was destined to perceive later his perpetual uniform or badge it was not till afterwards that peter began to feel exasperated by basil dashwoods typethe young stranger was of course basil dashwoodand even by his blue frockcoat the recurrent unvarying imperturbable good form of his aspect this unprofessional air ended by striking the observer as the very profession he had adopted and was indeed so far as had as yet been indicated his mimetic capital his main qualification for the stage  the ample and powerful manner in which miriam handled her scene produced its full impression the art with which she surmounted its difficulties the liberality with which she met its great demand upon the voice and the variety of expression that she threw into a torrent of objurgation it was a real composition studded with passages that called a suppressed tribute to the lips and seeming to show that a talent capable of such an exhibition was capable of anything      but thou art fair and at thy birth dear boy     nature and fortune joind to make thee great     of natures gifts thou mayst with lilies boast     and with the halfblown rose  as the girl turned to her imagined child with this exquisite apostropheshe addressed mr dashwood as if he were playing arthur and he lowered his book dropped his head and his eyes and looked handsome and ingenuousshe opened at a stroke to sherringhams vision a prospect that they would yet see her express tenderness better even than anything else her voice was enchanting in these lines and the beauty of her performance was that though she uttered the full fury of the part she missed none of its poetry  where did she get hold of thatwhere did she get hold of that peter wondered while his whole sense vibrated she hadnt got hold of it when i went away and the assurance flowed over him again that she had found the key to her box of treasures in the summer during their weeks of frequent meeting she had only fumbled with the lock one october day while he was away the key had slipped in had fitted or her finger at last had touched the right spring and the capricious casket had flown open  it was during the present solemnity that excited by the way she came out and with a hundred stirred ideas about her wheeling through his mind he was for the first time and most vividly visited by a perception that ended by becoming frequent with himthat of the perfect presence of mind unconfused unhurried by emotion that any artistic performance requires and that all whatever the instrument require in exactly the same degree the application in other words clear and calculated crystalfirm as it were of the idea conceived in the glow of experience of suffering of joy he was afterwards often to talk of this with miriam who however was never to be able to present him with a neat theory of the subject she had no knowledge that it was publicly discussed she only ranged herself in practice on the side of those who hold that at the moment of production the artist cant too much have his wits about him when peter named to her the opinion of those maintaining that at such a crisis the office of attention ceases to be filled she stared with surprise and then broke out ah the poor idiots she eventually became in her judgements in impatience and the expression of contempt very free and absolutely irreverent  what a splendid scolding the new visitor exclaimed when on the entrance of the popes legate her companion closed the book on the scene peter pressed his lips to madame carrés fingertips the old actress got up and held out her arms to miriam the girl never took her eyes off sherringham while she passed into that ladys embrace and remained there they were full of their usual sombre fire and it was always the case that they expressed too much anything they could express at all but they were not defiant nor even triumphant nowthey were only deeply explicative they seemed to say thats the sort of thing i meant thats what i had in mind when i asked you to try to do something for me madame carré folded her pupil to her bosom holding her there as the old marquise in a comédie de moeurs might in the last scene have held her goddaughter the ingénue  have you got me an engagementthe young woman then appealed eagerly to her friend yes he has done something splendid for me she went on to madame carré resting her hand caressingly on one of the actresss while the old woman discoursed with mr dashwood who was telling her in very pretty french that he was tremendously excited about miss rooth madame carré looked at him as if she wondered how he appeared when he was calm and how as a dramatic artist he expressed that condition  yes yes something splendid for a beginning peter answered radiantly recklessly feeling now only that he would say anything and do anything to please her he spent on the spot in imagination his last penny  its such a pity you couldnt follow it youd have liked it so much better mr dashwood observed to their hostess  couldnt follow it do you take me for une sotte the celebrated artist cried i suspect i followed it de plus près que vous monsieur  ah you see the language is so awfully fine basil dashwood replied looking at his shoes  the language why she rails like a fishwife is that what you call language ours is another business  if you understood if you understood youd see all the greatness of it miriam declared and then in another tone such delicious expressions  on dit que cest trèsfort but who can tell if you really say it madame carré demanded  ah par exemple i can sherringham answered  oh youyoure a frenchman  couldnt he make it out if he werent asked basil dashwood  the old woman shrugged her shoulders he wouldnt know  thats flattering to me  oh youdont you pretend to complain madame carré said i prefer our imprecationsthose of camille she went on they have the beauty des plus belles choses  i can say them too miriam broke in  insolente smiled madame carré camille doesnt squat down on the floor in the middle of them      for grief is proud and makes his owner stoop     to me and to the state of my great grief     let kings assemble  miriam quickly declaimed ah if you dont feel the way she makes a throne of it  its really tremendously fine chère madame sherringham said theres nothing like it  vous êtes insupportables the old woman answered stay with us ill teach you phèdre  ah phædra phædra basil dashwood vaguely ejaculated looking more gentlemanly than ever  youve learned all ive taught you but where the devil have you learned what i havent madame carré went on  ive workedi have youd call it workall through the bright late summer all through the hot dull empty days ive battered down the doori did hear it crash one day but im not so very good yet im only in the right direction  malicieuse growled madame carré  oh i can beat that the girl went on  did you wake up one morning and find you had grown a pair of wings peter asked because thats what the difference amounts toyou really soar moreover youre an angel he added charmed with her unexpectedness the good nature of her forbearance to reproach him for not having written to her and it seemed to him privately that she was angelic when in answer to this she said ever so blandly  you know you read king john with me before you went away i thought over immensely what you said i didnt understand it much at the timei was so stupid but it all came to me later  i wish you could see yourself peter returned  my dear fellow i do what sort of a dunce do you take me for i didnt miss a vibration of my voice a fold of my robe  well i didnt see you troubling about it peter handsomely insisted  no one ever will do you think id ever show it  ars celare artem basil dashwood jocosely dropped  you must first have the art to hide said sherringham wondering a little why miriam didnt introduce her young friend to him she was however both then and later perfectly neglectful of such cares never thinking never minding how other people got on together when she found they didnt get on she jeered at them that was the nearest she came to arranging for them our young man noted in her from the moment she felt her strength an immense increase of this goodhumoured inattention to detailall detail save that of her work to which she was ready to sacrifice holocausts of feelings when the feelings were other peoples this conferred on her a large profanity an absence of ceremony as to her social relations which was both amusing because it suggested that she would take what she gave and formidable because it was inconvenient and you mightnt care to give what she would take  if you havent any art its not quite the same as if you didnt hide it is it basil dashwood ingeniously threw out  thats rightsay one of your clever things miriam sweetly responded  youre always acting he declared in english and with a simpleminded laugh while sherringham remained struck with his expressing just what he himself had felt weeks before  and when youve shown them your fishwife to your public de làbas what will you do next asked madame carré  ill do julietill do cleopatra  rather a big bill isnt it mr dashwood volunteered to sherringham in a friendly but discriminating manner  constance and juliettake care you dont mix them said sherringham  i want to be various you once told me i had a hundred characters miriam returned  ah vous en êtes là cried the old actress you may have a hundred characters but youve only three plays im told thats all there are in english  miriam admirably indifferent to this charge appealed to peter what arrangements have you made what do the people want  the people at the theatre  im afraid they dont want king john and i dont believe they hunger for antony and cleopatra basil dashwood suggested ships and sieges and armies and pyramids you know we mustnt be too heavy  oh i hate scenery the girl sighed  elle est superbe said madame carré you must put those pieces on the stage how will you do it  oh we know how to get up a play in london madame carrémr dashwood was all geniality they put money on it you know  on it but what do they put in it wholl interpret them wholl manage a style like thatthe style of which the rhapsodies she has just repeated are a specimen whom have you got that one has ever heard of  oh youll hear of a good deal when once she gets started dashwood cheerfully contended  madame carré looked at him a moment then i feel that youll become very bad she said to miriam im glad i shant see it  people will do things for meill make them the girl declared ill stir them up so that theyll have ideas  what people pray  ah terrible woman peter theatrically groaned  we translate your piecesthere will be plenty of parts basil dashwood said  why then go out of the door to come in at the windowespecially if you smash it an english arrangement of a french piece is a pretty woman with her back turned  do you really want to keep her sherringham asked of madame carréquite as if thinking for a moment that this after all might be possible  she bent her strange eyes on him no youre all too queer together we couldnt be bothered with you and youre not worth it  im glad its together that were queer thenwe can console each other  if you only would but you dont seem to in short i dont understand youi give you up but it doesnt matter said the old woman wearily for the theatres dead and even you ma toutebelle wont bring it to life everythings going from bad to worse and i dont care what becomes of you you wouldnt understand us here and they wont understand you there and everythings impossible and no ones a whit the wiser and its not of the least consequence only when you raise your arms lift them just a little higher madame carré added  my mother will be happier chez nous said miriam throwing her arms straight up and giving them a noble tragic movement  you wont be in the least in the right path till your mothers in despair  well perhaps we can bring that about even in london sherringham patiently laughed  dear mrs roothshes great fun mr dashwood as imperturbably dropped  miriam transferred the dark weight of her gaze to him as if she were practising you wont upset her at any rate then she stood with her beautiful and fatal mask before her hostess i want to do the modern too i want to do le drame with intense realistic effects  and do you want to look like the portico of the madeleine when its draped for a funeral her instructress mocked never never i dont believe youre various thats not the way i see you youre pure tragedy with de grands éclats de voix in the great style or youre nothing  be beautifulbe only that peter urged with high interest be only what you can be so wellsomething that one may turn to for a glimpse of perfection to lift one out of all the vulgarities of the day  thus apostrophised the girl broke out with one of the speeches of racines phædra hushing her companions on the instant youll be the english rachel said basil dashwood when she stopped  acting in french madame carré amended i dont believe in an english rachel  i shall have to work it out what i shall be miriam concluded with a rich pensive effect  youre in wonderfully good form today sherringham said to her his appreciation revealing a personal subjection he was unable to conceal from his companions much as he wished it  i really mean to do everything  very well after all garrick did  then i shall be the garrick of my sex  theres a very clever author doing something for me i should like you to see it said basil dashwood addressing himself equally to miriam and to her diplomatic friend  ah if youve very clever authors and madame carré spun the sound to the finest satiric thread  i shall be very happy to see it peter returned  this response was so benevolent that basil dashwood presently began may i ask you at what theatre youve made arrangements  sherringham looked at him a moment come and see me at the embassy and ill tell you then he added i know your sister mrs lovick  so i supposed thats why i took the liberty of asking such a question  its no liberty but mr sherringham doesnt appear to be able to tell you said miriam  well you know its a very curious world all those theatrical people over there peter conceded  ah dont say anything against them when im one of them basil dashwood laughed  i might plead the absence of information peter returned as miss rooth has neglected to make us acquainted  miriam vaguely smiled i know you both so little but she presented them with a great stately air to each other and the two men shook hands while madame carré observed them  tiens you gentlemen meet here for the first time you do right to become friendsthats the best thing live together in peace and mutual confidence cest de beaucoup le plus sage  certainly for yokefellows said sherringham  he began the next moment to repeat to his new acquaintance some of the things he had been told in london but their hostess stopped him off waving the talk away with charming overdone stage horror and the young hands of the heroines of marivaux ah wait till you gofor that do you suppose i care for news of your mountebanks booths     xx   as many people know there are not in the famous théâtre français more than a dozen good seats accessible to ladies the stalls are forbidden them the boxes are a quarter of a mile from the stage and the balcony is a delusion save for a few chairs at either end of its vast horseshoe but there are two excellent baignoires davantscène which indeed are by no means always to be had it was however into one of them that immediately after his return to paris sherringham ushered mrs rooth and her daughter with the further escort of basil dashwood he had chosen the evening of the reappearance of the celebrated mademoiselle voisinshe had been enjoying a congé of three monthsan actress whom miriam had seen several times before and for whose method she professed a high though somewhat critical esteem it was only for the return of this charming performer that peter had been waiting to respond to miriams most ardent wishthat of spending an hour in the foyer des artistes of the great theatre she was the person whom he knew best in the house of molière he could count on her to do them the honours some night when she was in the bill and to make the occasion sociable miriam had been impatient for itshe was so convinced that her eyes would be opened in the holy of holies but wishing as particularly as he did to participate in her impression he had made her promise she wouldnt taste of this experience without himnot let madame carré for instance take her in his absence there were questions the girl wished to put to mademoiselle voisinquestions which having admired her from the balcony she felt she was exactly the person to answer she was more in it now after all than madame carré in spite of her slenderer talent she was younger fresher more modern andmiriam found the wordless academic she was in fine less vieux jeu peter perfectly foresaw the day when his young friend would make indulgent allowances for poor madame carré patronising her as an old woman of good intentions   1890  the play tonight was six months old a large serious successful comedy by the most distinguished of authors with a thesis a chorus embodied in one character a scène à faire and a part full of opportunities for mademoiselle voisin there were things to be said about this artist strictures to be dropped as to the general quality of her art and miriam leaned back now making her comments as if they cost her less but the actress had knowledge and distinction and pathos and our young lady repeated several times how quiet she is how wonderfully quiet scarcely anything moves but her face and her voice le geste rare but really expressive when it comes i like that economy its the only way to make the gesture significant  i dont admire the way she holds her arms basil dash wood said like a demoiselle de magasin trying on a jacket  well she holds them at any rate i daresay its more than you do with yours  oh yes she holds them theres no mistake about that i hold them i hope hein she seems to say to all the house the young english professional laughed goodhumouredly and sherringham was struck with the pleasant familiarity he had established with their brave companion he was knowing and ready and he said in the first entractethey were waiting for the second to go behindamusing perceptive things they teach them to be ladylike and voisins always trying to show that see how i walk see how i sit see how quiet i am and how i have le geste rare now can you say i aint a lady she does it all as if she had a class  well tonight im her class said miriam  oh i dont mean of actresses but of femmes du monde she shows them how to act in society  you had better take a few lessons miriam retorted  ah you should see voisin in society peter interposed  does she go into it mrs rooth demanded with interest  her friend hesitated she receives a great many people  why shouldnt they when theyre nice mrs rooth frankly wanted to know  when the people are nice miriam asked  now dont tell me shes not what one would wish said mrs rooth to sherringham  it depends on what that is he darkly smiled  what i should wish if she were my daughter the old woman rejoined blandly  ah wish your daughter to act as well as that and youll do the handsome thing for her  well she seems to feel what she says mrs rooth piously risked  she has some stiff things to say i mean about her past basil dashwood remarked the pastthe dreadful paston the stage  wait till the end to see how she comes out we must all be merciful sighed mrs rooth  weve seen it before you know what happens miriam observed to her mother  ive seen so many i get them mixed  yes theyre all in queer predicaments poor old motherwhat we show you laughed the girl  ah it will be what you show mesomething noble and wise  i want to do this its a magnificent part said miriam  you couldnt put it on in londonthey wouldnt swallow it basil dashwood declared  arent there things they do there to get over the difficulties the girl inquired  you cant get over what she didher companion had a rueful grimace  yes we must pay we must expiate mrs rooth moaned as the curtain rose again  when the second act was over our friends passed out of their baignoire into those corridors of tribulation where the bristling ouvreuse like a pawnbroker driving a roaring trade mounts guard upon piles of heterogeneous clothing and gaining the top of the fine staircase which forms the state entrance and connects the statued vestibule of the basement with the grand tier of boxes opened an ambiguous door composed of little mirrors and found themselves in the society of the initiated the janitors were courteous folk who greeted sherringham as an acquaintance and he had no difficulty in marshalling his little troop toward the foyer they traversed a low curving lobby hung with pictures and furnished with velvetcovered benches where several unrecognised persons of both sexes looked at them without hostility and arrived at an opening on the right from which by a short flight of steps there was a descent to one of the wings of the stage here miriam paused in silent excitement like a young warrior arrested by a glimpse of the battlefield her vision was carried off through a lane of light to the point of vantage from which the actor held the house but there was a hushed guard over the place and curiosity could only glance and pass  then she came with her companions to a sort of parlour with a polished floor not large and rather vacant where her attention flew delightedly to a coattree in a corner from which three or four dresses were suspendeddresses she immediately perceived to be costumes in that nights playaccompanied by a saucer of something and a muchworn powderpuff casually left on a sofa this was a familiar note in the general impression of high decorum which had begun at the thresholda sense of majesty in the place miriam rushed at the powderpuffthere was no one in the roomsnatched it up and gazed at it with droll veneration then stood rapt a moment before the charming petticoats thats dunoyers first underskirt she said to her mother while sherringham explained that in this apartment an actress traditionally changed her gown when the transaction was simple enough to save the long ascent to her loge he felt himself a cicerone showing a church to a party of provincials and indeed there was a grave hospitality in the air mingled with something academic and important the tone of an institution a temple which made them all out of respect and delicacy hold their breath a little and tread the shining floors with discretion  these precautions increasedmrs rooth crept about like a friendly but undomesticated catafter they entered the foyer itself a square spacious saloon covered with pictures and relics and draped in official green velvet where the genius loci holds a reception every night in the year the effect was freshly charming to peter he was fond of the place always saw it again with pleasure enjoyed its honourable look and the way among the portraits and scrolls the records of a splendid history the green velvet and the waxed floors the genius loci seemed to be at home in the quiet lamplight at the end of the room in an ample chimney blazed a fire of logs miriam said nothing they looked about noting that most of the portraits and pictures were oldfashioned and basil dashwood expressed disappointment at the absence of all the people they wanted most to see three or four gentlemen in evening dress circulated slowly looking like themselves at the pictures and another gentleman stood before a lady with whom he was in conversation seated against the wall the foyer resembled in these conditions a ballroom cleared for the dance before the guests or the music had arrived  oh its enough to see this it makes my heart beat said miriam its full of the vanished past it makes me cry i feel them here all the great artists i shall never see think of rachellook at her grand portrait thereand how she stood on these very boards and trailed over them the robes of hermione and phèdre the girl broke out theatrically as on the spot was right not a bit afraid of her voice as soon as it rolled through the room appealing to her companions as they stood under the chandelier and making the other persons present who had already given her some attention turn round to stare at so unusual a specimen of the english miss she laughed musically when she noticed this and her mother scandalised begged her to lower her tone its all right i produce an effect said miriam it shant be said that i too havent had my little success in the maison de molière and sherringham repeated that it was all rightthe place was familiar with mirth and passion there was often wonderful talk there and it was only the setting that was still and solemn it happened that this eveningthere was no knowing in advancethe scene was not characteristically brilliant but to confirm his assertion at the moment he spoke mademoiselle dunoyer who was also in the play came into the room attended by a pair of gentlemen  she was the celebrated the perpetual the necessary ingénue who with all her talent couldnt have represented a woman of her actual age she had the gliding hopping movement of a small bird the same air of having nothing to do with time and the clear sure piercing note a miracle of exact vocalisation she chaffed her companions she chaffed the room she might have been a very clever little girl trying to personate a more innocent big one she scattered her amiability aboutshowing miriam how the children of molière took their easeand it quickly placed her in the friendliest communication with peter sherringham who already enjoyed her acquaintance and who now extended it to his companions and in particular to the young lady sur le point dentrer au théâtre  you deserve a happier lot said the actress looking up at miriam brightly as if to a great height and taking her in upon which sherringham left them together a little and led mrs rooth and young dashwood to consider further some of the pictures  most delightful most curious the old woman murmured about everything while basil dashwood exclaimed in the presence of most of the portraits but their uglinesstheir ugliness did you ever see such a collection of hideous people and those who were supposed to be goodlookingthe beauties of the pasttheyre worse than the others ah you may say what you will nous sommes mieux que ça sherringham suspected him of irritation of not liking the theatre of the great rival nation to be thrust down his throat they returned to miriam and mademoiselle dunoyer and peter asked the actress a question about one of the portraits to which there was no name attached she replied like a child who had only played about the room that she was toute honteuse not to be able to tell him the original she had forgotten she had never askedvous allez me trouver bien légère she appealed to the other persons present who formed a gallery for her and laughed in delightful ripples at their suggestions which she covered with ridicule she bestirred herself she declared she would ascertain she shouldnt be happy till she did and swam out of the room with the prettiest paddles to obtain the information leaving behind her a perfume of delicate kindness and gaiety she seemed above all things obliging and peter pronounced her almost as natural off the stage as on she didnt come back     xxi   whether he had prearranged it is more than i can say but mademoiselle voisin delayed so long to show herself that mrs rooth who wished to see the rest of the play though she had sat it out on another occasion expressed a returning relish for her corner of the baignoire and gave her conductor the best pretext he could have desired for asking basil dashwood to be so good as to escort her back when the young actor of whose personal preference peter was quite aware had led mrs rooth away with an absence of moroseness which showed that his striking resemblance to a gentleman was not kept for the footlights the two others sat on a divan in the part of the room furthest from the entrance so that it gave them a degree of privacy and miriam watched the coming and going of their fellowvisitors and the indefinite people attached to the theatre hanging about while her companion gave a name to some of the figures parisian celebrities  fancy poor dashwood cooped up there with mamma the girl exclaimed whimsically  youre awfully cruel to him but thats of course said sherringham  it seems to me im as kind as you you sent him off  that was for your mother she was tired  oh gammon and why if i were cruel should it be of course  because you must destroy and torment and wear outthats your nature but you cant help your type can you  my type she echoed  its bad perverse dangerous its essentially insolent  and pray whats yours when you talk like that would you say such things if you didnt know the depths of my good nature  your good nature all comes back to that said sherringham its an abyss of ruinfor others youve no respect im speaking of the artistic characterin the direction and in the plentitude in which you have it its unscrupulous nervous capricious wanton  i dont know about respect one can be good miriam mused and reasoned  it doesnt matter so long as ones powerful he returned we cant have everything and surely we ought to understand that we must pay for things a splendid organisation for a special end like yours is so rare and rich and fine that we oughtnt to grudge it its conditions  what do you call its conditions miriam asked as she turned and looked at him  oh the need to take its ease to take up space to make itself at home in the world to square its elbows and knock others about thats large and free its the good nature you speak of you must forage and ravage and leave a track behind you you must live upon the country you traverse and you give such delight that after all youre welcomeyoure infinitely welcome  i dont know what you mean i only care for the idea the girl said  thats exactly what i pretendand we must all help you to it you use us you push us about you break us up were your tables and chair the simple furniture of your life  whom do you mean by we  peter gave an ironic laugh oh dont be afraidthere will be plenty of others  she made no return to this but after a moment broke out again poor dashwood immured with mammahes like a lame chair that one has put into the corner  dont break him up before he has served i really believe something will come out of him her companion went on however youll break me up first he added and him probably never at all  and why shall i honour you so much more  because im a better article and youll feel that  youve the superiority of modestyi see  im better than a young mountebankive vanity enough to say that  she turned on him with a flush in her cheek and a splendid dramatic face how you hate us yes at bottom below your little cold taste you hate us she repeated  he coloured too met her eyes looked into them a minute seemed to accept the imputation and then said quickly give it up come away with me  come away with you  leave this place give it up  you brought me here you insisted it should be only you and now you must stay she declared with a headshake and a high manner you should know what you want dear mr sherringham  i doi know now come away before you see her  before she seemed to wonder  shes success this wonderful voisin shes triumph shes full accomplishment the hard brilliant realisation of what i want to avert for you miriam looked at him in silence the cold light still in her face and he repeated give it upgive it up  her eyes softened after a little she smiled and then said yes youre better than poor dashwood  give it up and well live for ourselves in ourselves in something that can have a sanctity  all the same you do hate us the girl went on  i dont want to be conceited but i mean that im sufficiently fine and complicated to tempt you im an expensive modern watch with a wonderful escapementtherefore youll smash me if you can  nevernever she said as she got up you tell me the hour too well she quitted her companion and stood looking at gérômes fine portrait of the pale rachel invested with the antique attributes of tragedy the rise of the curtain had drawn away most of the company peter from his bench watched his friend a little turning his eyes from her to the vivid image of the dead actress and thinking how little she suffered by the juxtaposition presently he came over and joined her again and she resumed i wonder if thats what your cousin had in his mind  my cousin  what was his name mr dormer that first day at madame carrés he offered to paint my portrait  i remember i put him up to it  was he thinking of this  i doubt if he has ever seen it i daresay i was  well when we go to london he must do it said miriam  oh theres no hurry peter was moved to reply  dont you want my picture asked the girl with one of her successful touches  im not sure i want it from him i dont know quite what hed make of you  he looked so cleveri liked him i saw him again at your party  hes a jolly good fellow but whats one to say peter put to her of a painter who goes for his inspiration to the house of commons  to the house of commons she echoed  he has lately got himself elected  dear me what a pity i wanted to sit for him but perhaps he wont have meas im not a member of parliament  its my sister rather who has got him in  your sister who was at your house that day what has she to do with it miriam asked  why shes his cousin just as i am and in addition sherringham went on shes to be married to him  marriedreally she had a pause but she continued so he paints her i suppose  not much probably his talent in that line isnt what she esteems in him most  it isnt great then  i havent the least idea  and in the political line the girl persisted  i scarcely can tell hes very clever  he does paint decently then  i daresay  miriam looked once more at gérômes picture fancy his going into the house of commons and your sister put him there  she worked she canvassed  ah youre a queer family she sighed turning round at the sound of a step  were lostheres mademoiselle voisin said sherringham  this celebrity presented herself smiling and addressing miriam i acted for you tonighti did my best  what a pleasure to speak to you to thank you the girl murmured admiringly she was startled and dazzled  i couldnt come to you before but now ive got a restfor half an hour the actress went on gracious and passive as if a little spent she let sherringham without looking at him take her hand and raise it to his lips im sorry i make you lose the otherstheyre so good in this act she added  weve seen them before and theres nothing so good as you miriam promptly returned  i like my part said mademoiselle voisin gently smiling still at our young lady with clear charming eyes ones always better in that case  shes so bad sometimes you know peter jested to miriam leading the actress thus to glance at him kindly and vaguely in a short silence which you couldnt call on her part embarrassment but which was still less affectation  and its so interesting to be hereso interesting miriam protested  ah you like our old house yes were very proud of it and mademoiselle voisin smiled again at sherringham all goodhumouredly but as if to say well here i am and what do you want of me dont ask me to invent it myself but if youll tell me ill do it miriam admired the note of discreet interrogation in her voicethe slight suggestion of surprise at their old house being liked this performer was an astonishment from her seeming still more perfect on a nearer viewwhich was not the girl had an idea what performers usually did this was very encouraging to herit widened the programme of a young lady about to embrace the scenic career to have so much to show before the footlights and yet to have so much left when you came offthat was really wonderful mademoiselle voisins eyes as one looked into them were still more agreeable than the distant spectator would have supposed and there was in her appearance an extreme finish which instantly suggested to miriam that she herself in comparison was big and rough and coarse  youre lovely tonightyoure particularly lovely sherringham said very frankly translating miriams own impression and at the same time giving her an illustration of the way that in paris at least gentlemen expressed themselves to the stars of the drama she thought she knew her companion very well and had been witness of the degree to which in such general conditions his familiarity could increase but his address to the slim distinguished harmonious woman before them had a different quality the note of a special usage if miriam had had an apprehension that such directness might be taken as excessive it was removed by the manner in which mademoiselle voisin returned  oh ones always well enough when ones made up ones always exactly the same that served as an example of the good taste with which a star of the drama could receive homage that was wanting in originality miriam determined on the spot that this should be the way she would ever receive it the grace of her new acquaintance was the greater as the becoming bloom to which she alluded as artificial was the result of a science so consummate that it had none of the grossness of a mask the perception of all this was exciting to our young aspirant and her excitement relieved itself in the inquiry which struck her as rude as soon as she had uttered it  you acted for me how did you know what am i to you  monsieur sherringham has told me about you he says were nothing beside youthat youre to be the great star of the future im proud that youve seen me  that of course is what i tell every one peter acknowledged a trifle awkwardly to miriam  i can believe it when i see you je vous ai bien observée the actress continued in her sweet conciliatory tone  miriam looked from one of her interlocutors to the other as if there were joy for her in this report of sherringhams remarksjoy accompanied and partly mitigated however by a quicker vision of what might have passed between a secretary of embassy and a creature so exquisite as mademoiselle voisin ah youre wonderful peoplea most interesting impression she yearningly sighed  i was looking for you he had prepared me were such old friends said the actress in a tone courteously exempt from intention upon which sherringham again taking her hand raised it to his lips with a tenderness which her whole appearance seemed to bespeak for her a sort of practical consideration and carefulness of touch as if she were an object precious and frail an instrument for producing rare sounds to be handled like a legendary violin with a recognition of its value  your dressingroom is so prettyshow her your dressingroom he went on  willingly if shell come up vous savez que cest une montée  its a shame to inflict it on you miriam objected  comment donc if it will interest you in the least they exchanged civilities almost caresses trying which could have the nicest manner to the other it was the actresss manner that struck miriam most it denoted such a training so much taste expressed such a ripe conception of urbanity  no wonder she acts well when she has that tactfeels perceives is so remarkable mon dieu mon dieu the girl said to herself as they followed their conductress into another corridor and up a wide plain staircase the staircase was spacious and long and this part of the establishment sombre and still with the gravity of a college or a convent they reached another passage lined with little doors on each of which the name of a comedian was painted and here the aspect became still more monastic like that of a row of solitary cells mademoiselle voisin led the way to her own door all obligingly and as if wishing to be hospitable she dropped little subdued friendly attempts at explanation on the way at her threshold the monasticism stoppedmiriam found herself in a wonderfully upholstered nook a nest of lamplight and delicate cretonne save for its pair of long glasses it might have been a tiny boudoir with a watercolour drawing of value in each of its panels of stretched stuff with its crackling fire and its charming order it was intensely bright and extremely hot singularly pretty and exempt from litter nothing lay about but a small draped doorway led into an inner sanctuary to miriam it seemed royal it immediately made the art of the comedian the most distinguished thing in the world it was just such a place as they should have for their intervals if they were expected to be great artists it was a result of the same evolution as mademoiselle voisin herselfnot that our young lady found this particular term at hand to express her idea but her mind was flooded with an impression of style of refinement of the long continuity of a tradition the actress said voilà cest tout as if it were little enough and there were even something clumsy in her having brought them so far for nothing and in their all sitting there waiting and looking at each other till it was time for her to change her dress but to miriam it was occupation enough to note what she did and said these things and her whole person and carriage struck our young woman as exquisite in their adaptation to the particular occasion she had had an idea that foreign actresses were rather of the cabotin order but her hostess suggested to her much more a princess than a cabotine she would do things as she liked and do them straight off miriam couldnt fancy her in the gropings and humiliations of rehearsal everything in her had been sifted and formed her tone was perfect her amiability complete and she might have been the charming young wife of a secretary of state receiving a pair of strangers of distinction the girl observed all her movements and then as sherringham had said she was particularly lovely but she suddenly told this gentleman that she must put him à la porteshe wanted to change her dress he retired and returned to the foyer where miriam was to rejoin him after remaining the few minutes more with mademoiselle voisin and coming down with her he waited for his companion walking up and down and making up his mind and when she presently came in he said to her  please dont go back for the rest of the play stay here they now had the foyer virtually to themselves  i want to stay here i like it better she moved back to the chimneypiece from above which the cold portrait of rachel looked down and as he accompanied her he went on  i meant what i said just now  what you said to voisin  no no to you give it up and live with me  give it up she turned her stage face on him  give it up and ill marry you tomorrow  this is a happy time to ask it she said with superior amusement and this is a good place  very good indeed and thats why i speak its a place to make one chooseit puts it all before one  to make you choose you mean im much obliged but thats not my choice laughed miriam  you shall be anything you like except this  except what i most want to be i am much obliged  dont you care for me havent you any gratitude sherringham insisted  gratitude for kindly removing the blest cup from my lips i want to be what she isi want it more than ever  ah what she is he took it impatiently  do you mean i cant well see if i cant tell me more about hertell me everything  havent you seen for yourself and knowing things as you do cant you judge  shes strange shes mysterious miriam allowed looking at the fire she showed us nothingnothing of her real self  so much the better all things considered  are there all sorts of other things in her life thats what i believe the girl went on raising her eyes to him  i cant tell you what there is in the life of such a woman  imaginewhen shes so perfect she exclaimed thoughtfully ah she kept me offshe kept me off her charming manner is in itself a kind of contempt its an abyssits the wall of china she has a hard polish an inimitable surface like some wonderful porcelain that costs more than youd think  do you want to become like that sherringham asked  if i could i should be enchanted one can always try  you must act better than she he went on  better i thought you wanted me to give it up  ah i dont know what i want he cried and you torment me and turn me inside out what i want is you yourself  oh dont worry said miriamnow all kindly then she added that mademoiselle voisin had invited her to call to which sherringham replied with a certain dryness that she would probably not find that necessary this made the girl stare and she asked do you mean it wont do on account of mammas prejudices  say this time on account of mine  do you mean because she has lovers  her lovers are none of our business  none of mine i see so youve been one of them  no such luck  what a pity she richly wailed i should have liked to see that one must see everythingto be able to do everything and as he pressed for what in particular she had wished to see she replied the way a woman like that receives one of the old ones  peter gave a groan at this which was at the same time partly a laugh and turning away to drop on a bench ejaculated youll doyoull do  he sat there some minutes with his elbows on his knees and his face in his hands his friend remained looking at the portrait of rachel after which she put to him doesnt such a woman as that receivereceive every one  every one who goes to see her no doubt  and who goes  lots of menclever men eminent men  ah what a charming life then doesnt she go out  not what we philistines mean by thatnot into society never she never enters a ladys drawingroom  how strange when ones as distinguished as that except that she must escape a lot of stupidities and corvées then where does she learn such manners  she teaches manners à ses heures she doesnt need to learn them  oh she has given me ideas but in london actresses go into society miriam continued  oh into ours such as it is in london nous mêlons les genres  and shant i goi mean if i want  youll have every facility to bore yourself dont doubt it  and doesnt she feel excluded miriam asked  excluded from what she has the fullest life  the fullest  an intense artistic life the cleverest men in paris talk over her work with her the principal authors of plays discuss with her subjects and characters and questions of treatment she lives in the world of art  ah the world of arthow i envy her and you offer me dashwood  sherringham rose in his emotion i offer you  miriam burst out laughing you look so droll you offer me yourself then instead of all these things  my dear child i also am a very clever man he said trying to sink his consciousness of having for a moment stood gaping  you areyou are i delight in you no ladies at allno femmes comme il faut she began again  ah what do they matter your business is the artistic life he broke out with inconsequence irritated moreover at hearing her sound that trivial note again  youre a dearyour charming good sense comes back to you what do you want of me then  i want you for myselfnot for others and now in time before anythings done  why then did you bring me here everythings donei feel it tonight  i know the way you should look at itif you do look at it at all sherringham conceded  thats so easy i thought you liked the stage so miriam artfully added  dont you want me to be a great swell  and dont you want me to be  you will beyoull share my glory  so will you share mine  the husband of an actress yes i see myself that peter cried with a frank ring of disgust  its a silly position no doubt but if youre too good for it why talk about it dont you think im important she demanded her companion met her eyes and she suddenly said in a different tone ah why should we quarrel when youve been so kind so generous cant we always be friendsthe truest friends  her voice sank to the sweetest cadence and her eyes were grateful and good as they rested on him she sometimes said things with such perfection that they seemed dishonest but in this case he was stirred to an expressive response just as he was making it however he was moved to utter other words take care heres dashwood mrs rooths tried attendant was in the doorway he had come back to say that they really must relieve him     book fifth     xxii   mrs dallow came up to london soon after the meeting of parliament she made no secret of the fact that she was fond of town and that in present conditions it would of course not have become less attractive to her but she prepared to retreat again for the easter vacation not to go back to harsh but to pay a couple of country visits she did not however depart with the crowdshe never did anything with the crowdbut waited till the monday after parliament rose facing with composure in great stanhope street the horrors as she had been taught to consider them of a sunday out of the session she had done what she could to mitigate them by asking a handful of stray men to dine with her that evening several members of this disconsolate class sought comfort in great stanhope street in the afternoon and them for the most part she also invited to return at eight oclock there were accordingly almost too many people at dinner there were even a couple of wives nick dormer was then present though he had not been in the afternoon each of the other persons had said on coming in so youve not goneim awfully glad mrs dallow had replied no ive not gone but she had in no case added that she was glad nor had she offered an explanation she never offered explanations she always assumed that no one could invent them so well as those who had the florid taste to desire them  and in this case she was right since it is probable that few of her visitors failed to say to themselves that her not having gone would have had something to do with dormer that could pass for an explanation with many of mrs dallows friends who as a general thing were not morbidly analytic especially with those who met nick as a matter of course at dinner his figuring at this ladys entertainments being in her house whenever a candle was lighted was taken as a sign that there was something rather particular between them nick had said to her more than once that people would wonder why they didnt marry but he was wrong in this inasmuch as there were many of their friends to whom it wouldnt have occurred that his position could be improved that they were cousins was a fact not so evident to others as to themselves in consequence of which they appeared remarkably intimate the person seeing clearest in the matter was mrs gresham who lived so much in the world that being left now and then to ones own company had become her idea of true sociability she knew very well that if she had been privately engaged to a young man as amiable as nick dormer she would have managed that publicity shouldnt play such a part in their intercourse and she had her secret scorn for the stupidity of people whose conception of nicks relation to julia rested on the fact that he was always included in her parties if he never was there they might talk she said to herself but mrs gresham was supersubtle to her it would have appeared natural that her friend should celebrate the parliamentary recess by going down to harsh and securing the young mans presence there for a fortnight she recognised mrs dallows actual plan as a comparatively poor substitutethe project of spending the holidays in other peoples houses to which nick had also promised to come mrs gresham was romantic she wondered what was the good of mere snippets and snatches the chances that any one might have when large still days à deux were open to youchances of which half the sanctity was in what they excluded however there were more unsettled matters between mrs dallow and her queer kinsman than even mrs greshams fine insight could embrace she was not on the sunday evening before easter among the guests in great stanhope street but if she had been julias singular indifference to observation would have stopped short of encouraging her to remain in the drawingroom along with nick after the others had gone i may add that mrs greshams extreme curiosity would have emboldened her as little to do so she would have taken for granted that the pair wished to be alone together though she would have regarded this only as a snippet the company had at all events stayed late and it was nearly twelve oclock when the last of them standing before the fire in the room they had quitted broke out to his companion  see here julia how long do you really expect me to endure this kind of thing julia made him no answer she only leaned back in her chair with her eyes upon his he met her gaze a moment then he turned round to the fire and for another moment looked into it after this he faced his hostess again with the exclamation its so foolishits so damnably foolish  she still said nothing but at the end of a minute she spoke without answering him i shall expect you on tuesday and i hope youll come by a decent train  what do you mean by a decent train  i mean i hope youll not leave it till the last thing before dinner so that we can have a little walk or something  whats a little walk or something why if you make such a point of my coming to griffin do you want me to come at all  she hesitated an instant then she returned i knew you hated it  you provoke me so said nick you try to i think  and severals is still worse youll get out of that if you can mrs dallow went on  if i can whats to prevent me  you promised lady whiteroy but of course thats nothing  i dont care a straw for lady whiteroy  and you promised me but thats less still  it is foolishits quite idiotic said nick with his hands in his pockets and his eyes on the ceiling  there was another silence at the end of which julia remarked you might have answered mr macgeorge when he spoke to you  mr macgeorgewhat has he to do with it  he has to do with your getting on a little if you think thats the way  nick broke into a laugh i like lessons in getting onin other words i suppose you mean in urbanityfrom you julia  why not from me  because you can do nothing base youre incapable of putting on a flattering manner to get something by it therefore why should you expect me to youre unflatteringthat is youre austerein proportion as there may be something to be got  she sprang from her chair coming toward him theres only one thing i want in the worldyou know very well  yes you want it so much that you wont even take it when its pressed on you how long do you seriously expect me to bear it nick repeated  i never asked you to do anything base she said as she stood in front of him if im not clever about throwing myself into things its all the more reason you should be  if youre not clever my dear julia nick close to her placed his hands on her shoulders and shook her with a mixture of tenderness and passion youre clever enough to make me furious sometimes  she opened and closed her fan looking down at it while she submitted to his mild violence all i want is that when a man like mr macgeorge talks to you you shouldnt appear bored to death you used to be so charming under those inflictions now you appear to take no interest in anything at dinner tonight you scarcely opened your lips you treated them all as if you only wished theyd go  i did wish theyd go havent i told you a hundred times what i think of your salon  how then do you want me to live she asked am i not to have a creature in the house  as many creatures as you like your freedoms complete and as far as im concerned always will be only when you challenge me and overhaul menot justly i thinki must confess the simple truth that there are many of your friends i dont delight in  oh your idea of pleasant people julia lamented i should like once for all to know what it really is  i can tell you what it really isnt it isnt mr macgeorge hes a being almost grotesquely limited  hell be where youll never beunless you change  to be where mr macgeorge is not would be very much my desire therefore why should i change nick demanded however i hadnt the least intention of being rude to him and i dont think i was he went on to the best of my ability i assume a virtue if i havent it but apparently im not enough of a comedian  if you havent it she echoed its when you say things like that that youre so dreadfully tiresome as if there were anything that you havent or mightnt have  nick turned away from her he took a few impatient steps in the room looking at the carpet his hands always in his pockets then he came back to the fire with the observation its rather hard to be found so wanting when one has tried to play ones part so beautifully he paused with his eyes on her own and then went on with a vibration in his voice ive imperilled my immortal soul or at least bemuddled my intelligence by all the things i dont care for that ive tried to do and all the things i detest that ive tried to be and all the things i never can be that ive tried to look as if i wereall the appearances and imitations the pretences and hypocrisies in which ive steeped myself to the eyes and at the end of it it serves me right my reward is simply to learn that im still not half humbug enough  julia looked away from him as soon as he had spoken these words she attached her eyes to the clock behind him and observed irrelevantly im very sorry but i think you had better go i dont like you to stay after midnight  ah what you like and what you dont like and where one begins and the other endsall thats an impenetrable mystery the young man declared but he took no further notice of her allusion to his departure adding in a different tone a man like mr macgeorge when you say a thing of that sort in a certain particular way i should rather like to suffer you to perish  mrs dallow stared it might have seemed for an instant that she was trying to look stupid how can i help it if a few years hence hes certain to be at the head of any liberal government  we cant help it of course but we can help talking about it nick smiled if we dont mention it it maynt be noticed  youre trying to make me angry youre in one of your vicious moods she returned blowing out on the chimneypiece a guttering candle  that im exasperated ive already had the honour very positively to inform you all the same i maintain that i was irreproachable at dinner i dont want you to think i shall always be as good as that  you looked so out of it you were as gloomy as if every earthly hope had left you and you didnt make a single contribution to any discussion that took place dont you think i observe you she asked with an irony tempered by a tenderness unsuccessfully concealed  ah my darling what you observe nick cried with a certain bitterness of amusement but he added the next moment more seriously as if his tone had been disrespectful you probe me to the bottom no doubt  you neednt come either to griffin or to severals if you dont want to  give them up yourself stay here with me  she coloured quickly as he said this and broke out lord how you hate political houses  how can you say that when from february to august i spend every blessed night in one  yes and hate that worst of all  so do half the people who are in it you my dear must have so many things so many people so much miseenscène and such a perpetual spectacle to live nick went on perpetual motion perpetual visits perpetual crowds if you go into the country youll see forty people every day and be mixed up with them all day the idea of a quiet fortnight in town when by a happy if idiotic superstition everybody goes out of it disconcerts and frightens you its the very time its the very place to do a little work and possess ones soul  this vehement allocution found her evidently somewhat unprepared but she was sagacious enough instead of attempting for the moment a general rejoinder to seize on a single phrase and say work what work can you do in london at such a moment as this  nick considered i might tell you i want to get up a lot of subjects to sit at home and read bluebooks but that wouldnt be quite what i mean  do you mean you want to paint  yes thats it since you gouge it out of me  why do you make such a mystery about it youre at perfect liberty julia said  she put out her hand to rest it on the mantelshelf but her companion took it on the way and held it in both his own youre delightful julia when you speak in that tonethen i know why it is i love you but i cant do anything if i go to griffin if i go to severals  i seei see she answered thoughtfully and kindly  ive scarcely been inside of my studio for months and i feel quite homesick for it the idea of putting in a few quiet days there has taken hold of me i rather cling to it  it seems so odd your having a studio julia dropped speaking so quickly that the words were almost incomprehensible  doesnt it sound absurd for all the good it does me or i do in it of course one can produce nothing but rubbish on such termswithout continuity or persistence with just a few days here and there i ought to be ashamed of myself no doubt but even my rubbish interests me guenille si lon veut ma guenille mest chère but ill go down to harsh with you in a moment julia nick pursued that would do as well if we could be quiet there without people without a creature and i should really be perfectly content youd beautifully sit for me it would be the occasion weve so often wanted and never found  she shook her head slowly and with a smile that had a meaning for him thank you my dear nothing would induce me to go to harsh with you  he looked at her hard whats the matter whenever its a question of anything of that sort are you afraid of me she pulled her hand from him quickly turning away but he went on stay with me here then when everythings so right for it we shall do beautifullyhave the whole place have the whole day to ourselves hang your engagements telegraph you wont come well live at the studioyoull sit to me every day now or nevers our chancewhen shall we have so good a one think how charming it will be ill make you wish awfully that i may do something  i cant get out of griffinits impossible julia said moving further away and with her back presented to him  then you are afraid of mesimply  she turned straight round very pale of course i am youre welcome to know it  he went toward her and for a moment she seemed to make another slight movement of retreat this however was scarcely perceptible and there was nothing to alarm in the tone of reasonable entreaty in which he spoke as he stood there put an end julia to our absurd situationit really cant go on youve no right to expect a man to be happy or comfortable in so false a position were spoken of odiouslyof that we may be sure and yet what good have we of it  spoken of do i care for that  do you mean youre indifferent because there are no grounds thats just why i hate it  i dont know what youre talking about she returned with sharp disdain  be my wife tomorrowbe my wife next week let us have done with this fantastic probation and be happy  leave me nowcome back tomorrow ill write to you she had the air of pleading with him at present pleading as he pleaded  you cant resign yourself to the idea of ones looking out of it nick laughed  come tomorrow before lunch she went on  to be told i must wait six months more and then be sent about my business ah julia julia the young man groaned  something in this simple lamentit sounded natural and perfectly unstudiedseemed straightway to make a great impression on her you shall wait no longer she said after a short silence  what do you mean by no longer  give me about five weekssay till the whitsuntide recess  five weeks are a great deal smiled nick  there are things to be doneyou ought to understand  i only understand how i love you  she let herself godearest nickand he caught her and kept her in his arms  ive your promise then for five weeks hence to a day he demanded as she at last released herself  well settle thatthe exact day there are things to consider and to arrange come to luncheon tomorrow  ill come earlyill come at one he said and for a moment they stood all deeply and intimately taking each other in  do you think i want to wait any more than you she asked in congruity with this  i dont feel so much out of it now he declared by way of answer youll stay of course nowyoull give up your visits  she had hold of the lappet of his coat she had kept it in her hand even while she detached herself from his embrace there was a white flower in his buttonhole that she looked at and played with a moment before she said ive a better ideayou neednt come to griffin stay in your studiodo as you likepaint dozens of pictures  dozens barbarian nick wailed  the epithet apparently had an endearing suggestion for her it at any rate led her to let him possess himself of her head and so holding it kiss herled her to say what on earth do i want but that you should do absolutely as you please and be as happy as you can  he kissed her in another place at this but he put it to her what dreadful proposition is coming now  ill go off and do up my visits and come back  and leave me alone  dont be affected you know youll work much better without me youll live in your studioi shall be well out of the way  thats not what one wants of a sitter how can i paint you  you can paint me all the rest of your life i shall be a perpetual sitter  i believe i could paint you without looking at youand his lighted face shone down on her you do excuse me then from those dreary places  how can i insist after what you said about the pleasure of keeping these days she admirablyit was so all sincerelyasked  youre the best woman on earththough it does seem odd you should rush away as soon as our little business is settled  we shall make it up i know what im about and now go she ended by almost pushing him out of the room     xxiii   it was certainly singular in the light of other matters that on sitting down in his studio after she had left town nick should not as regards the effort to project plastically some beautiful form have felt more chilled by the absence of a friend who was such an embodiment of beauty she was away and he missed her and longed for her and yet without her the place was more filled with what he wanted to find in it he turned into it with confused feelings the strongest of which was a sense of release and recreation it looked blighted and lonely and dusty and his old studies as he rummaged them out struck him even as less inspired than the last time he had ventured to face them but amid this neglected litter in the colourless and obstructed light of a high north window which needed washing he came nearer tasting the possibility of positive happiness it appeared to him that as he had said to julia he was more in possession of his soul it was frivolity and folly it was puerility to spend valuable hours pottering over the vain implements of an art he had relinquished and a certain shame that he had felt in presenting his plea to julia that sunday night arose from the sense not of what he clung to but of what he had given up he had turned his back on serious work so that pottering was now all he could aspire to it couldnt be fruitful it couldnt be anything but ridiculous almost ignoble but it soothed his nerves it was in the nature of a secret dissipation he had never suspected he should some day have nerves on his own part to count with but this possibility had been revealed to him on the day it became clear that he was letting something precious go he was glad he had not to justify himself to the critical for this might have been a delicate business the critical were mostly absent and besides shut up all day in his studio how should he ever meet them it was the place in the world where he felt furthest away from his constituents that was a part of the pleasurethe consciousness that for the hour the coast was clear and his mind independent his mother and his sister had gone to broadwood lady agnesthe phrase sounds brutal but represents his state of mindwas well out of the way he had written to her as soon as julia left townhe had apprised her of the fact that his weddingday was fixed a relief for poor lady agnes to a period of intolerable mystification of dark dumb wondering and watching she had said her say the day of the poll at harsh she was too proud to ask and too discreet to nag so she could only wait for something that didnt come the unconditioned loan of broadwood had of course been something of a bribe to patience she had at first felt that on the day she should take possession of that capital house julia would indeed seem to have entered the family but the gift had confirmed expectations just enough to make disappointment more bitter and the discomfort was greater in proportion as she failed to discover what was the matter her daughter grace was much occupied with this question and brought it up for discussion in a manner irritating to her ladyship who had a high theory of being silent about it but who however in the long run was more unhappy when in consequence of a reprimand the girl suggested no reasons at all than when she suggested stupid ones it eased lady agnes a little to advert to the mystery when she could have the air of not having begun  the letter nick received from her the first day of passion week in reply to his important communication was the only one he read at that moment not counting of course the several notes mrs dallow addressed to him from griffin there were letters piled up as he knew in calcutta gardens which his servant had strict orders not to bring to the studio nick slept now in the bedroom attached to this retreat got things as he wanted them from calcutta gardens and dined at his club where a stray surviving friend or two seeing him prowl about the library in the evening was free to impute to such eccentricity some subtly political basis when he thought of his neglected letters he remembered mr carterets convictions on the subject of not getting behind they made him laugh in the slightly sonorous paintingroom as he bent over one of the old canvases that he had ventured to turn to the light he was fully determined however to master his correspondence before going down the last thing before parliament should reassemble to spend another day at beauclere mastering his correspondence meant in nicks mind breaking open envelopes writing answers was scarcely involved in the idea but mr carteret would never guess that nick was not moved even to write to him that the affair with julia was on the point of taking the form he had been so good as to desire he reserved the pleasure of this announcement for a personal interview  the day before good friday in the morning his stillness was broken by a rattattat on the outer door of his studio administered apparently by the knob of a walkingstick his servant was out and he went to the door wondering who his visitor could be at such a time especially of the rather presuming class the class was indicated by the visitors failure to look for the bellsince there was a bell though it required a little research in a moment the mystery was solved the gentleman who stood smiling at him from the threshold could only be gabriel nash nick had not seen this whimsical personage for several months and had had no news of him beyond a general intimation that he was following his fancy in foreign parts his old friend had sufficiently prepared him at the time of their reunion in paris for the idea of the fitful in intercourse and he had not been ignorant on his return from paris that he should have had an opportunity to miss him if he had not been too busy to take advantage of it in london after the episode at harsh gabriel had not reappeared he had redeemed none of the pledges given the night they walked together to notre dame and conversed on important matters he was to have interposed in nicks destiny but he had not interposed he was to have pulled him hard and in the opposite sense from julia but there had been no pulling he was to have saved him as he called it and yet nick was lost this circumstance indeed formed his excuse the member for harsh had rushed so wantonly to perdition nick had for the hour seriously wished to keep hold of him he valued him as a salutary influence yet on coming to his senses after his election our young man had recognised that nash might very well have reflected on the thanklessness of such a slippery subjectmight have held himself released from his vows of course it had been particularly in the event of a liberal triumph that he had threatened to make himself felt the effect of a brand plucked from the burning would be so much greater if the flames were already high yet nick had not kept him to the letter of this pledge and had so fully admitted the right of a thorough connoisseur let alone a faithful friend to lose patience with him that he was now far from greeting his visitor with a reproach he felt much more thrown on his defence  gabriel however forbore at first to attack him he brought in only blandness and benevolence and a great content at having obeyed the mystic voiceit was really a remarkable case of second sightwhich had whispered him that the recreant comrade of his prime was in town he had just come back from sicily after a southern winter according to a custom frequent with him and had been moved by a miraculous prescience unfavourable as the moment might seem to go and ask for nick in calcutta gardens where he had extracted from his friends servant an address not known to all the world he showed nick what a mistake it had been to fear a dull arraignment and how he habitually ignored all lapses and kept up the standard only by taking a hundred fine things for granted he also abounded more than ever in his own sense reminding his relieved listener how no recollection of him no evocation of him in absence could ever do him justice you couldnt recall him without seeming to exaggerate him and then acknowledged when you saw him that your exaggeration had fallen short he emerged out of vaguenesshis sicily might have been the sicily of a winters taleand would evidently be reabsorbed in it but his presence was positive and pervasive enough he was duly intense while he lasted his connexions were with beauty urbanity and conversation as usual but they made up a circle you couldnt find in the court guide nick had a sense that he knew a lot of esthetic people but he dealt in ideas much more than in names and addresses he was genial and jocose sunburnt and romantically allusive it was to be gathered that he had been living for many days in a saracenic tower where his principal occupation was to watch for the flushing of the west he had retained all the serenity of his opinions and made light with a candour of which the only defect was apparently that it was not quite enough a conscious virtue of many of the objects of common esteem when nick asked him what he had been doing he replied oh living you know and the tone of the words offered them as the story of a great deed he made a long visit staying to luncheon and after luncheon so that the little studio heard all at once a greater quantity of brave talk than in the several previous years of its history with much of our tale left to tell it is a pity that so little of this colloquy may be reported here since as affairs took their course it marked reallyif the question be of noting the exact pointa turn of the tide in nick dormers personal situation he was destined to remember the accent with which nash exclaimed on his drawing forth sundry specimens of amateurish earnestness  i sayi sayi say  he glanced round with a heightened colour theyre pretty bad eh  oh youre a deep one nash went on  whats the matter  do you call your conduct that of a man of honour  scarcely perhaps but when no one has seen them  thats your villainy cest de lexquis du pur exquis come my dear fellow this is very seriousits a bad business said gabriel nash then he added almost with austerity youll be so good as to place before me every patch of paint every sketch and scrap that this room contains  nick complied in great good humour he turned out his boxes and drawers shovelled forth the contents of bulging portfolios mounted on chairs to unhook old canvases that had been severely skied he was modest and docile and patient and amused above all he was quite thrilledthrilled with the idea of eliciting a note of appreciation so late in the day it was the oddest thing how he at present in fact found himself imputing value to his visitorattributing to him among attributions more confused the dignity of judgement the authority of knowledge nash was an ambiguous character but an excellent touchstone the two said very little for a while and they had almost half an hours silence during which after our young man had hastily improvised an exhibition there was only a puffing of cigarettes gabriel walked about looking at this and that taking up rough studies and laying them down asking a question of fact fishing with his umbrella on the floor amid a pile of unarranged sketches nick accepted jocosely the attitude of suspense but there was even more of it in his heart than in his face so few people had seen his young workalmost no one who really counted he had been ashamed of it never showing it to bring on a conclusion since a conclusion was precisely what he feared he whistled now while he let his companion take time he rubbed old panels with his sleeve and dabbed wet sponges on surfaces that had sunk it was a long time since he had felt so gay strange as such an assertion sounds in regard to a young man whose bridalday had at his urgent solicitation lately been fixed he had stayed in town to be alone with his imagination and suddenly paradoxically the sense of that result had arrived with poor nash  nicholas dormer this personage remarked at last for grossness of immorality i think ive never seen your equal  that sounds so well nick returned that i hesitate to risk spoiling it by wishing it explained  dont you recognise in any degree the grand idea of duty  if i dont grasp it with a certain firmness im a deadly failure for i was quite brought up on it nick said  then youre indeed the wretchedest failure i know life is ugly after all  do i gather that you yourself recognise obligations of the order you allude to  do you gather nash stared why arent they the very flame of my faith the burden of my song  my dear fellow duty is doing and ive inferred that you think rather poorly of doingthat it spoils ones style  doing wrong assuredly  but what do you call right whats your canon of certainty there nick asked  the conscience thats in usthat charming conversible infinite thing the intensest thing we know but you must treat the oracle civilly if you wish to make it speak you mustnt stride into the temple in muddy jackboots and with your hat on your head as the puritan troopers tramped into the dear old abbeys one must do ones best to find out the right and your criminality appears to be that youve not taken the commonest trouble  i hadnt you to ask smiled nick but duty strikes me as doing something in particular if youre too afraid it may be the wrong thing you may let everything go  being is doing and if doing is duty being is duty do you follow  at a very great distance  to be what one may be really and efficaciously nash went on to feel it and understand it to accept it adopt it embrace itthats conduct thats life  and suppose ones a brute or an ass wheres the efficacy  in ones very want of intelligence in such cases ones out of itthe question doesnt exist one simply becomes a part of the duty of others the brute the ass nicks visitor developed neither feels nor understands nor accepts nor adopts those fine processes in themselves classify us they educate they exalt they preserve so that to profit by them we must be as perceptive as we can we must recognise our particular form the instrument that each of useach of us who carries anythingcarries in his being mastering this instrument learning to play it in perfectionthats what i call duty what i call conduct what i call success  nick listened with friendly attention and the air of general assent was in his face as he said every one has it then this individual pipe  every one my dear fellow is too much to say for the worlds full of the crudest remplissage the book of lifes padded ah but paddeda deplorable want of editing i speak of every one whos any one of course there are pipes and pipeslittle quavering flutes for the concerted movements and big cornetsàpiston for the great solos  i see i see and what might your instrument be  nash hesitated not a moment his answer was radiantly there to speak to people just as im speaking to you to prevent for instance a great wrong being done  a great wrong  yesto the human race i talki talk i say the things other people dont the things they cant the things they wont gabriel went on with his inimitable candour  if its a question of mastery and perfection you certainly have them his companion replied  and you havent alas thats the pity of it thats the scandal thats the wrong i want to set right before it becomes too public a shame if i called you just now grossly immoral its on account of the spectacle you presenta spectacle to be hidden from the eye of ingenuous youth that of a man neglecting his own fiddle to blunder away on that of one of his fellows we cant afford such mistakes we cant tolerate such licence  you think then i have a fiddleand our young man in spite of himself attached to the question a quaver of suspense finer doubtless than any that had ever passed his lips  a regular stradivarius all these things youve shown me are remarkably interesting youve a talent of a wonderfully pure strain  i sayi sayi say nick exclaimed hovering there with his hands in his pockets and a blush on his lighted face while he repeated with a change of accent nashs exclamation of half an hour before  i like it your talent i measure it i appreciate it i insist upon it that critic went on between the whiffs of his cigarette i have to be awfully wise and good to do so but fortunately i am in such a case thats my duty i shall make you my business for a while therefore he added piously dont say im unconscious of the moral law  a stradivarius said nick interrogatively and with his eyes wide open the thought in his mind was of how different this seemed from his having gone to griffin     xxiv   his counsellor had plenty of further opportunity to develop this and other figurative remarks for he not only spent several of the middle hours of the day at the studio but came back in the eveningthe pair had dined together at a little foreign pothouse in soho revealed to nick on this occasionand discussed the great question far into the night the great question was whether on the showing of those examples of his ability with which the scene of their discourse was now densely bestrewn nick dormer would be justified in really going in for the practice of pictorial art this may strike many readers of his history as a limited and even trivial inquiry with little of the heroic or the romantic in it but it was none the less carried to the finest point by our impassioned young men nick suspected nash of exaggerating his encouragement in order to play a malign trick on the political world at whose expense it was his fond fancy to divert himselfwithout indeed making that organisation perceptibly totterand reminded him that his present accusation of immorality was strangely inconsistent with the wanton hope expressed by him in paris the hope that the liberal candidate at harsh would be returned nash replied first oh i hadnt been in this place then but he defended himself later and more effectually by saying that it was not of nicks having got elected he complained it was of his visible hesitancy to throw up his seat nick begged that he wouldnt mention this and his gallantry failed to render him incapable of saying the fact is i havent the nerve for it they talked then for a while of what he could do not of what he couldnt of the mysteries and miracles of reproduction and representation of the strong sane joys of the artistic life nick made afresh with more fulness his great confession that his private ideal of happiness was the life of a great painter of portraits he uttered his thought on that head so copiously and lucidly that nashs own abundance was stilled and he listened almost as if he had been listening to something newdifficult as it was to conceive a point of view for such a matter with which he was unacquainted  there it is said nick at lasttheres the naked preposterous truth that if i were to do exactly as i liked i should spend my years reproducing the more or less vacuous countenances of my fellowmortals i should find peace and pleasure and wisdom and worth i should find fascination and a measure of success in itout of the din and the dust and the scramble the world of party labels party cries party bargains and party treacheries of humbuggery hypocrisy and cant the cleanness and quietness of it the independent effort to do something to leave something which shall give joy to man long after the howling has died away to the last ghost of an echosuch a vision solicits me in the watches of night with an almost irresistible force  as he dropped these remarks he lolled on a big divan with one of his long legs folded up while his visitor stopped in front of him after moving about the room vaguely and softly almost on tiptoe so as not to interrupt him you speak nash said with the special and dreadful eloquence that rises to a mans lips when he has practically whatever his theory may be renounced the right and dropped hideously into the wrong then his regret for the right a certain exquisite appreciation of it puts on an accent i know well how to recognise  nick looked up at him a moment youve hit it if you mean by that that i havent resigned my seat and that i dont intend to  i thought you took it only to give it up dont you remember our talk in paris  i like to be a part of the spectacle that amuses you nick returned but i could scarcely have taken so much trouble as that for it  isnt it then an absurd comedy the life you lead  comedy or tragedyi dont know which whatever it is i appear to be capable of it to please two or three people  then you can take trouble said nash  yes for the woman im to marry  oh youre to marry  thats what has come on since we met in paris nick explained and it makes just the difference  ah my poor friend smiled gabriel much arrested no wonder youve an eloquence an accent  its a pity i have them in the wrong place im expected to have them in the house of commons  you will when you make your farewell speech thereto announce that you chuck it up and may i venture to ask whos to be your wife the visitor pursued  mrs dallow has kindly consented to accept that yoke i think you saw her in paris  ah yes you spoke of her to me and i remember asking you even then if you were in love with her  i wasnt then said nick  nash had a grave pause and are you now  oh dear yes  that would be betterif it wasnt worse  nothing could be better nick declared its the best thing that can happen to me  well his friend continued you must let me very respectfully approach this lady you must let me bring her round  bring her round to what  to everything talk her over  talk her under nick laughedbut making his joke a little as to gain time he remembered the effect this adviser had produced on juliaan effect that scantly ministered to the idea of another meeting julia had had no occasion to allude again to nicks imperturbable friend he had passed out of her life at once and for ever but there flickered up a quick memory of the contempt he had led her to express together with a sense of how odd she would think it her intended should have thrown over two pleasant visits to cultivate such company  over to a proper pride in what you may do nash returnedwhat you may do above all if shell help you  i scarcely see how she can help me said nick with an air of thinking  shes extremely handsome as i remember her you could do great things with her  ah theres the rub nick went on i wanted her to sit for me this week but she wouldnt hear of it  elle a bien tort you should attack some fine strong type is mrs dallow in london nash inquired  for what do you take her shes paying visits  then ive a model for you  then you have nick stared what has that to do with mrs dallows being away  doesnt it give you more time  oh the time flies sighed nick with a spontaneity that made his companion again laugh outa demonstration in which for a moment he himself rather ruefully joined  does she like you to paint that personage asked with one of his candid intonations  so she says  well do something fine to show her  id rather show it to you nick confessed  my dear fellow i see it from hereif you do your duty do you remember the tragic muse nash added for explanation  the tragic muse  that girl in paris whom we heard at the old actresss and afterwards met at the charming entertainment given by your cousinisnt hethe secretary of embassy  oh peters girl of course i remember her  dont call her peters call her rather mine nash said with easy rectification i invented her i introduced her i revealed her  i thought you on the contrary ridiculed and repudiated her  as a fine handsome young woman surely noti seem to myself to have been all the while rendering her services i said i disliked teaparty ranters and so i do but if my estimate of her powers was below the mark she has more than punished me  what has she done nick asked  she has become interesting as i suppose you know  how should i know  well you must see her you must paint her nash returned she tells me something was said about it that day at madame carrés  oh i remembersaid by peter  then it will please mr sherringhamyoull be glad to do that i suppose you know all he has done for miriam gabriel pursued  not a bit i know nothing about peters affairs nick said unless it be in general that he goes in for mountebanks and mimes and that it occurs to me ive heard one of my sisters mentionthe rumour had come to herthat he has been backing miss rooth  miss rooth delights to talk of his kindness shes charming when she speaks of it its to his good offices that she owes her appearance here  here nicks interest rose is she in london  doù tombezvous i thought you people read the papers  what should i read when i sitsometimesthrough the stuff they put into them  of course i see thatthat your engagement at your own varietyshow with its interminable turns keeps you from going to the others learn then said gabriel nash that youve a great competitor and that youre distinctly not much as you may suppose it the rising comedian the tragic muse is the great modern personage havent you heard people speak of her havent you been taken to see her  nick bethought himself i daresay ive heard of her but with a good many other things on my mind i had forgotten it  certainly i can imagine what has been on your mind she remembers you at any rate she repays neglect with sympathy she wants said nash to come and see you  see me it was all for nick now a wonder  to be seen by youit comes to the same thing shes really worth seeing you must let me bring her youll find her very suggestive that idea that you should paint hershe appears to consider it a sort of bargain  a bargain our young man entered as he believed into the humour of the thing what will she give me  a splendid model she is splendid  oh then bring her said nick     xxv   nash brought her the great modern personage as he had described her the very next day and it took his friend no long time to test his assurance that miriam rooth was now splendid she had made an impression on him ten months before but it had haunted him only a day soon overlaid as it had been with other images yet after nash had talked of her a while he recalled her better some of her attitudes some of her looks and tones began to hover before him he was charmed in advance with the notion of painting her when she stood there in fact however it seemed to him he had remembered her wrong the brave free rather grand creature who instantly filled his studio with such an unexampled presence had so shaken off her clumsiness the rudeness and crudeness that had made him pity her a whole provincial and secondrate side miss rooth was light and bright and direct todaydirect without being stiff and bright without being garish to nicks perhaps inadequately sophisticated mind the model the actress were figures of a vulgar setting but it would have been impossible to show that taint less than this extremely natural yet extremely distinguished aspirant to distinction she was more natural even than gabriel nashnature was still nicks formula for his amusing old friendand beside her he appeared almost commonplace  nash recognised her superiority with a frankness honourable to both of themtestifying in this manner to his sense that they were all three serious beings worthy to deal with fine realities she attracted crowds to her theatre but to his appreciation of such a fact as that important doubtless in its way there were the limits he had already expressed what he now felt bound in all integrity to register was his perception that she had in general and quite apart from the question of the boxoffice a remarkable a very remarkable artistic nature he allowed that she had surprised him here knowing of her in other days mainly that she was hungry to adopt an overrated profession he had not imputed to her the normal measure of intelligence now he sawhe had had some talks with herthat she was capable almost of a violent play of mind so much so that he was sorry for the embarrassment it would be to her nick could imagine the discomfort of having anything in the nature of a mind to arrange for in such conditions shes a woman of the best intentions really of the best nash explained kindly and lucidly almost paternally and the quite rare head you can see for yourself  miriam smiling as she sat on an old venetian chair held aloft with the noblest effect that quarter of her person to which this patronage was extended remarking to her host that strange as it might appear she had got quite to like poor mr nash she could make him go about with herit was a relief to her mother  when i take him she has perfect peace the girl said then she can stay at home and see the interviewers she delights in that and i hate it so our friend here is a great comfort of course a femme de théâtre is supposed to be able to go out alone but theres a kind of smartness an added chic in having some one people think hes my companion  im sure they fancy i pay him id pay him if hed take itand perhaps he will yetrather than give him up for it doesnt matter that hes not a lady he is one in tact and sympathy as you see and base as he thinks the sort of thing i do he cant keep away from the theatre when youre celebrated people will look at you who could never before find out for themselves why they should  when youre celebrated you grow handsomer at least thats what has happened to you though you were pretty too of old gabriel placidly argued i go to the theatre to look at your head it gives me the greatest pleasure i take up anything of that sort as soon as i find it one never knows how long it may last  are you attributing that uncertainty to my appearance miriam beautifully asked  dear no to my own pleasure the first precious bloom of it nash went on dormer at least let me tell you in justice to him hasnt waited till you were celebrated to want to see you againhe stands there openeyedfor the simple reason that he hadnt the least idea of your renown i had to announce it to him  havent you seen me act miriam put without reproach to her host  ill go tonight he handsomely declared  you have your terrible house havent you what do they call itthe demands of public life miriam continued in answer to which gabriel explained that he had the demands of private life as well inasmuch as he was in lovehe was on the point of being married she listened to this with participation then she said ah then do bring yourwhat do they call her in english im always afraid of saying something improperyour future ill send you a box under the circumstances youll like that better she added that if he were to paint her he would have to see her often on the stage wouldnt he to profit by the optique de la scènewhat did they call that in englishstudying her and fixing his impression but before he had time to meet this proposition she asked him if it disgusted him to hear her speak like that as if she were always posing and thinking about herself living only to be looked at thrusting forward her person she already often got sick of doing so but à la guerre comme à la guerre  thats the fine artistic nature you seea sort of divine disgust breaking out in her nash expounded  if you want to paint me at all at all of course im struck with the way im taking that for granted the girl decently continued when mr nash spoke of it to me i jumped at the idea i remembered our meeting in paris and the kind things you said to me but no doubt one oughtnt to jump at ideas when they represent serious sacrifices on the part of others  doesnt she speak well nash demanded of nick oh shell go far  its a great privilege to me to paint you what title in the world have i to pretend to such a model nick replied to miriam the sacrifice is yoursa sacrifice of time and good nature and credulity you come in your bright beauty and your genius to this shabby place where ive nothing worth speaking of to show not a guarantee to offer you and i wonder what ive done to deserve such a gift of the gods  doesnt he speak welland nash appealed with radiance to their companion  she took no notice of him only repeating to nick that she hadnt forgotten his friendly attitude in paris and when he answered that he surely had done very little she broke out first resting her eyes on him with a deep reasonable smile and then springing up quickly ah well if i must justify myself i liked you  fancy my appearing to challenge you laughed nick in deprecation to see you again is to want tremendously to try something but you must have an infinite patience because im an awful duffer  she looked round the walls i see what youve donebien des choses  she understandsshe understands gabriel dropped and he added to their visitor imagine when he might do something his choosing a life of shams at bottom hes like youa wonderful artistic nature  ill have patience said the girl smiling at nick  then my children i leave youthe peace of the lord be with you with which words nash took his departure  the others chose a position for the young womans sitting after she had placed herself in many different attitudes and different lights but an hour had elapsed before nick got to workbegan on a large canvas to knock her in as he called it he was hindered even by the fine element of agitation the emotion of finding himself out of a clear sky confronted with such a subject and launched in such a task what could the situation be but incongruous just after he had formally renounced all manner of artthe renunciation taking effect not a bit the less from the whim he had all consciously treated himself to as a whim the last he should ever descend to the freak of a fortnights relapse into a fingering of old sketches for the purpose as he might have said of burning them up of clearing out his studio and terminating his lease there were both embarrassment and inspiration in the strange chance of snatching back for an hour a relinquished joy the jump with which he found he could still rise to such an occasion took away his breath a little at the same time that the ideathe idea of what one might make of such materialtouched him with an irresistible wand on the spot to his inner vision miriam became a rich result drawing a hundred formative forces out of their troubled sleep defying him where he privately felt strongest and imposing herself triumphantly in her own strength he had the good fortune without striking matches to see her as a subject in a vivid light and his quick attempt was as exciting as a sudden gallophe might have been astride in a boundless field of a runaway horse  she was in her way so fine that he could only think how to do her that hard calculation soon flattened out the consciousness lively in him at first that she was a beautiful woman who had sought him out of his retirement at the end of their first sitting her having done so appeared the most natural thing in the world he had a perfect right to entertain her thereexplanations and complications were engulfed in the productive mood the business of knocking her in held up a lamp to her beauty showed him how much there was of it and that she was infinitely interesting he didnt want to fall in love with herthat would be a sell he said to himselfand she promptly became much too interesting for it nick might have reflected for simplifications sake as his cousin peter had done but with more validity that he was engaged with miss rooth in an undertaking which didnt in the least refer to themselves that they were working together seriously and that decent work quite gainsaid sensibilitythe humbugging sorts alone had to help themselves out with it but after her first sittingshe came poor girl but twicethe need of such exorcisms passed from his spirit he had so thoroughly so practically taken her up as to whether his visitor had the same bright and still sense of cooperation to a definite end the sense of the distinctively technical nature of the answer to every question to which the occasion might give birth that mystery would be lighted only were it open to us to regard this young lady through some other medium than the mind of her friends we have chosen as it happens for some of the great advantages it carries with it the indirect vision and it fails as yet to tell uswhat nick of course wondered about before he ceased to care as indeed he intimated to herwhy a budding celebrity should have dreamed of there being something for her in so blighted a spot she should have gone to one of the regular people the great people they would have welcomed her with open arms when nick asked her if some of the ras hadnt expressed a wish for a crack at her she replied oh dear no only the tiresome photographers and fancy them in the future if mamma could only do that for me and she added with the charming fellowship for which she was conspicuous at these hours you know i dont think any one yet has been quite so much struck with me as you  not even peter sherringham her host jested while he stepped back to judge of the effect of a line  oh mr sherringhams different youre an artist  for pitys sake dont say that he cried and as regards your art i thought peter knew more than any one  ah youre severe said miriam  severe  because thats what the poor dear thinks but he does know a lothe has been a providence to me  then why hasnt he come over to see you act  she had a pause how do you know he hasnt come  because i take for granted hed have called on me if he had  does he like you very much the girl asked  i dont know i like him  hes a gentlemanpour cela she said  oh yes for that nick went on absently labouring hard  but hes afraid of meafraid to see me  doesnt he think you good enough  on the contraryhe believes i shall carry him away and hes in a terror of my doing it  he ought to like that said nick with conscious folly  thats what i mean when i say hes not an artist however he declares he does like it only it appears to be not the right thing for him oh the right thinghes ravenous for that but its not for me to blame him since i am too hes coming some night however then she added almost grimly he shall have a dose  poor peter nick returned with a compassion none the less real because it was mirthful the girls tone was so expressive of easy unscrupulous power  hes such a curious mixture she luxuriously went on sometimes i quite lose patience with him it isnt exactly trying to serve both god and mammon but its muddling up the stage and the world the world be hanged the stage or anything of that sorti mean ones artistic conscience ones true faithcomes first  brava brava you do me good nick murmured still amused beguiled and at work but its very kind of you when i was in this absurd state of ignorance to impute to me the honour of having been more struck with you than any one else he continued after a moment  yes i confess i dont quite seewhen the shops were full of my photographs  oh im so poori dont go into shops he explained  are you very poor  i live on alms  and dont they pay youthe government the ministry  dear young lady for whatfor shutting myself up with beautiful women  ah youve others then she extravagantly groaned  theyre not so kind as you i confess  ill buy it from youwhat youre doing ill pay you well when its done said the girl ive got money now i make it you knowa good lot of it its too delightful after scraping and starving try it and youll see give up the base bad world  but isnt it supposed to be the base bad world that pays  precisely make it pay without mercyknock it silly squeeze it dry thats what its meant forto pay for art ah if it wasnt for that ill bring you a quantity of photographs tomorrowyou must let me come back tomorrow its so amusing to have them by the hundred all for nothing to give away thats what takes mamma most she cant get over it thats luxury and glory even at castle nugent they didnt do that people used to sketch me but not so much as mamma veut bien le dire and in all my life i never had but one poor little cartedevisite when i was sixteen in a plaid frock with the banks of a river at three francs the dozen     xxvi   it was success the member for harsh felt that had made her finerthe full possession of her talent and the sense of the recognition of it there was an intimation in her presence if he had given his mind to it that for him too the same cause would produce the same effectthat is would show him how being launched in the practice of an art makes strange and prompt revelations nick felt clumsy beside a person who manifestly now had such an extraordinary familiarity with the esthetic point of view he remembered too the clumsiness that had been in his visitorsomething silly and shabby pert rather than proper and of quite another value than her actual smartness as london people would call it her wellappointedness and her evident command of more than one manner handsome as she had been the year before she had suggested sordid lodgings bread and butter heavy tragedy and tears and if then she was an illdressed girl with thick hair who wanted to be an actress she was already in these few weeks a performer who could even produce an impression of not performing she showed what a light hand she could have forbore to startle and looked as well for unprofessional life as julia which was only the perfection of her professional character  this function came out much in her talk for there were many little bursts of confidence as well as many familiar pauses as she sat there and she was ready to tell nick the whole history of her débutthe chance that had suddenly turned up and that she had caught with a fierce leap as it passed he missed some of the details in his attention to his own task and some of them he failed to understand attached as they were to the name of mr basil dashwood which he heard for the first time it was through mr dashwoods extraordinary exertions that a hearinga morning performance at a london theatrehad been obtained for her that had been the great step for it had led to the putting on at night of the play at the same theatre in place of a wretched thing they were trying it was no use to keep on its feet and to her engagement for the principal part she had made a hit in itshe couldnt pretend not to know that but she was already tired of it there were so many other things she wanted to do and when she thought it would probably run a month or two more she fell to cursing the odious conditions of artistic production in such an age the play was a more or less idiotised version of a new french piece a thing that had taken in paris at a thirdrate theatre and was now proving itself in london good enough for houses mainly made up of tenshilling stalls it was dashwood who had said it would go if they could get the rights and a fellow to make some changes he had discovered it at a nasty little place she had never been to over the seine they had got the rights and the fellow who had made the changes was practically dashwood himself there was another man in london mr gushmoremiriam didnt know if nick had heard of him nick hadnt who had done some of it it had been awfully chopped down to a mere bone with the meat all gone but that was what people in london seemed to like they were very innocentthousands of little dogs amusing themselves with a bone at any rate she had made something she had made a figure of the womana dreadful stick with what dashwood had muddled her into and miriam added in the complacency of her young expansion oh give me fifty words any time and the ghost of a situation and ill set you up somebody besides i mustnt abuse poor yolandeshe has saved us she said  yolande  our ridiculous play thats the name of the impossible woman she has put bread into our mouths and shes a loaf on the shelf for the future the rights are mine  youre lucky to have them said nick a little vaguely troubled about his sitters nose which was somehow jewish without the convex arch  indeed i am he gave them to me wasnt it charming  he gave themmr dashwood  dear me nowhere should poor dashwood have got them he hasnt a penny in the world besides if he had got them hed have kept them i mean your blessed cousin  i seetheyre a present from peter  like many other things isnt he a dear if it hadnt been for him the shelf would have remained bare he bought the play for this country and america for four hundred pounds and on the chance fancy there was no rush for it and how could he tell and then he gracefully pressed it on me so ive my little capital isnt he a duck youve nice cousins  nick assented to the proposition only inserting an amendment to the effect that surely peter had nice cousins too and making as he went on with his work a tacit preoccupied reflexion or two such as that it must be pleasant to render little services like that to youth beauty and geniushe rather wondered how peter could afford themand that duck as he was miss rooths benefactor was rather taken for granted sic vos non vobis softly sounded in his brain this community of interests or at least of relations quickened the flight of time so that he was still fresh when the sitting came to an end it was settled miriam should come back on the morrow to enable her artist to make the most of the few days of the parliamentary recess and just before she left him she asked  then you will come tonight  without fail i hate to lose an hour of you  then ill place you it will be my affair  youre very kindhe quite rose to it isnt it a simple matter for me to take a stall this week i suppose theyre to be had  ill send you a box said miriam you shall do it well there are plenty now  why should i be lost all alone in the grandeur of a box  cant you bring your friend  my friend  the lady youre engaged to  unfortunately shes out of town  miriam looked at him in the grand manner does she leave you alone like that  she thought i should like iti should be more free to paint you see i am  yes perhaps its good for me have you got her portrait miriam asked  she doesnt like me to paint her  really perhaps then she wont like you to paint me  thats why i want to be quick laughed nick  before she knows it  shell know it tomorrow i shall write to her  the girl faced him again portentously i see youre afraid of her but she added mention my name theyll give you the box at the office  whether or no nick were afraid of mrs dallow he still waved away this bounty protesting that he would rather take a stall according to his wont and pay for it which led his guest to declare with a sudden flicker of passion that if he didnt do as she wished she would never sit to him again  ah then you have me he had to reply only i dont see why you should give me so many things  what in the world have i given you  why an idea and nick looked at his picture rather ruefully i dont mean to say though that i havent let it fall and smashed it  ah an ideathat is a great thing for people in our line but youll see me much better from the box and ill send you gabriel nash she got into the hansom her hosts servant had fetched for her and as nick turned back into his studio after watching her drive away he laughed at the conception that they were in the same line  he did share in the event his box at the theatre with nash who talked during the entractes not in the least about the performance or the performer but about the possible greatness of the art of the portraitistits reach its range its fascination the magnificent examples it had left us in the past windows open into history into psychology things that were among the most precious possessions of the human race he insisted above all on the interest the importance of this great peculiarity of it that unlike most other forms it was a revelation of two realities the man whom it was the artists conscious effort to reveal and the manthe interpreterexpressed in the very quality and temper of that effort it offered a double vision the strongest dose of life that art could give the strongest dose of art that life could give nick dormer had already become aware of having two states of mind when listening to this philosopher one in which he laughed doubted sometimes even reprobated failed to follow or accept and another in which his old friend seemed to take the words out of his mouth to utter for him better and more completely the very things he was on the point of saying gabriels saying them at such moments appeared to make them true to set them up in the world and tonight he said a good many especially as to the happiness of cultivating ones own garden growing there in stillness and freedom certain strong pure flowers that would bloom for ever bloom long after the rank weeds of the hour were withered and blown away  it was to keep miriam rooth in his eye for his current work that nick had come to the play and she dwelt there all the evening being constantly on the stage he was so occupied in watching her facefor he now saw pretty clearly what he should attempt to make of itthat he was conscious only in a secondary degree of the story she illustrated and had in regard to her acting a surprised sense that she was extraordinarily quiet he remembered her loudness her violence in paris at peter sherringhams her wild wails the first time at madame carrés compared with which her present manner was eminently temperate and modern nick dormer was not critical at the theatre he believed what he saw and had a pleasant sense of the inevitable therefore he wouldnt have guessed what gabriel nash had to tell himthat for this young woman with her tragic cast and her peculiar attributes her present performance full of actuality of light fine indications and at moments of pointed touches of comedy was a rare tour de force it went on altogether in a register he hadnt supposed her to possess and in which as he said she didnt touch her capital doing it all with her wonderful little savings it conveyed to him that she was capable of almost anything  in one of the intervals they went round to see her but for nick this purpose was partly defeated by the extravagant transports as they struck him of mrs rooth whom they found sitting with her daughter and who attacked him with a hundred questions about his dear mother and his charming sisters she had volumes to say about the day in paris when they had shown her the kindness she should never forget she abounded also in admiration of the portrait he had so cleverly begun declaring she was so eager to see it however little he might as yet have accomplished that she should do herself the honour to wait upon him in the morning when miriam came to sit  im acting for you tonight the girl more effectively said before he returned to his place  no thats exactly what youre not doing nash interposed with one of his happy sagacities youve stopped acting youve reduced it to the least that will do you simply areyoure just the visible image the picture on the wall it keeps you wonderfully in focus ive never seen you so beautiful  miriam stared at this then it could be seen that she coloured what a luxury in life to have everything explained hes the great explainer she herself explained to nick  he shook hands with her for goodnight well then we must give him lots to do  she came to his studio in the morning but unaccompanied by her mother in allusion to whom she simply said mamma wished to come but i wouldnt let her they proceeded promptly to business the girl divested herself of her hat and coat taking the position already determined after they had worked more than an hour with much less talk than the day before nick being extremely absorbed and miriam wearing in silence an air of noble compunction for the burden imposed on him at the end of this period of patience pervaded by a holy calm our young lady suddenly got up and exclaimed i say i must see itwith which quickly she stepped down from her place and came round to the canvas she had at nicks request not looked at his work the day before he fell back glad to rest and put down his palette and brushes  ah bien cest tapé she cried as she stood before the easel nick was pleased with her ejaculation he was even pleased with what he had done he had had a long happy spurt and felt excited and sanctioned miriam retreating also a little sank into a highbacked oldfashioned chair that stood two or three yards from the picture and reclined in it her head on one side looking at the rough resemblance she made a remark or two about it to which nick replied standing behind her and after a moment leaning on the top of the chair he was away from his work and his eyes searched it with a shy fondness of hope they rose however as he presently became conscious that the door of the large room opposite him had opened without making a sound and that some one stood upon the threshold the person on the threshold was julia dallow  as soon as he was aware nick wished he had posted a letter to her the night before he had written only that morning there was nevertheless genuine joy in the words with which he bounded toward herah my dear julia what a jolly surprisefor her unannounced descent spoke to him above all of an irresistible desire to see him again sooner than they had arranged she had taken a step forward but she had done no more stopping short at the sight of the strange woman so divested of visitinggear that she looked halfundressed who lounged familiarly in the middle of the room and over whom nick had been still more familiarly hanging julias eyes rested on this embodied unexpectedness and as they did so she grew paleso pale that nick observing it instinctively looked back to see what miriam had done to produce such an effect she had done nothing at all which was precisely what was embarrassing she only stared at the intruder motionless and superb she seemed somehow in easy possession of the place and even at that instant nick noted how handsome she looked so that he said to himself inaudibly in some deeper depth of consciousness how i should like to paint her that way mrs dallows eyes moved for a single moment to her friends then they turned awayaway from miriam ranging over the room  ive got a sitter but you mustnt mind that were taking a rest im delighted to see youhe was all cordiality he closed the door of the studio behind her his servant was still at the outer door which was open and through which he saw julias carriage drawn up this made her advance a little further but still she said nothing she dropped no answer even when nick went on with a sense of awkwardness when did you come back i hope nothing has gone wrong you come at a very interesting moment he continued aware as soon as he had spoken of something in his words that might have made her laugh she was far from laughing however she only managed to look neither at him nor at miriam and to say after a little when he had repeated his question about her return  i came back this morningi came straight here  and nothings wrong i hope  oh noeverythings all right she returned very quickly and without expression she vouchsafed no explanation of her premature descent and took no notice of the seat nick offered her neither did she appear to hear him when he begged her not to look yet at the work on the easelit was in such a dreadful state he was conscious as he phrased it that this request gave to miriams position directly in front of his canvas an air of privilege which her neglect to recognise in any way mrs dallows entrance or her importance did nothing to correct but that mattered less if the appeal failed to reach julias intelligence as he judged seeing presently how deeply she was agitated nothing mattered in face of the sense of danger taking possession of him after she had been in the room a few moments he wanted to say whats the difficulty has anything happened but he felt how little she would like him to utter words so intimate in presence of the person she had been rudely startled to find between them he pronounced miriams name to her and her own to miriam but julias recognition of the ceremony was so slight as to be scarcely perceptible miriam had the air of waiting for something more before she herself made a sign and as nothing more came she continued to say nothing and not to budge nick added a remark to the effect that julia would remember to have had the pleasure of meeting her the year beforein paris that day at old peters to which mrs dallow made answer ah yes without any qualification while she looked down at some rather rusty studies on panels ranged along the floor and resting against the base of the wall her discomposure was a clear pain to herself she had had a shock of extreme violence and nick saw that as miriam showed no symptom of offering to give up her sitting her stay would be of the briefest he wished that young woman would do somethingsay she would go get up move about as it was she had the appearance of watching from her point of vantage the others upset he made a series of inquiries about julias doings in the country to two or three of which she gave answers monosyllabic and scarcely comprehensible only turning her eyes round and round the room as in search of something she couldnt findof an escape of something that was not miriam at last she saidit was at the end of a very few minutes  i didnt come to staywhen youre so busy i only looked in to see if you were here goodbye  its charming of you to have come im so glad youve seen for yourself how well im occupied nick replied not unconscious of how red he was this made mrs dallow look at him while miriam considered them both julias eyes had a strange light he had never seen beforea flash of fear by which he was himself frightened of course ill see you later he added in awkward in really misplaced gaiety while she reached the door which she opened herself getting out with no further attention to miriam i wrote to you this morningyouve missed my letter he repeated behind her having already given her this information the door of the studio was very near that of the house but before she had reached the street the visitors bell was set ringing the passage was narrow and she kept in advance of nick anticipating his motion to open the streetdoor the bell was tinkling still when by the action of her own hand a gentleman on the step stood revealed  ah my dear dont go nick heard pronounced in quick soft dissuasion and in the now familiar accents of gabriel nash the rectification followed more quickly still if that were a rectification which so little improved the matter i beg a thousand pardonsi thought you were miriam  gabriel gave way and julia the more sharply pursued her retreat her carriage a victoria with a pair of precious heated horses had taken a turn up the street but the coachman had already seen his mistress and was rapidly coming back he drew near not so fast however but that gabriel nash had time to accompany mrs dallow to the edge of the pavement with an apology for the freedom into which he had blundered nick was at her other hand waiting to put her into the carriage and freshly disconcerted by the encounter with nash who somehow as he stood making julia an explanation that she didnt listen to looked less eminent than usual though not more conscious of difficulties our young man coloured deeper and watched the footman spring down as the victoria drove up he heard nash say something about the honour of having met mrs dallow in paris nick wanted him to go into the house he damned inwardly his lack of delicacy he desired a word with julia aloneas much alone as the two annoying servants would allow but nash was not too much discouraged to say you came for a glimpse of the great model doesnt she sit thats what i wanted too this morningjust a look for a blessing on the day ah but you madam  julia had sprung into her corner while he was still speaking and had flashed out to the coachman a home which of itself set the horses in motion the carriage went a few yards but while gabriel with an undiscouraged bow turned away nick dormer his hand on the edge of the hood moved with it  you dont like it but ill explain he tried to say for its occupant alone  explain what she asked still very pale and grave but in a voice that showed nothing she was thinking of the servantsshe could think of them even then  oh its all right ill come in at five nick returned gallantly jocular while she was whirled away  gabriel had gone into the studio and nick found him standing in admiration before miriam who had resumed the position in which she was sitting lord shes good today isnt she good today he broke out seizing their host by the arm to give him a particular view miriam looked indeed still handsomer than before and she had taken up her attitude again with a splendid sphinxlike air of being capable of keeping it for ever nick said nothing but went back to work with a tingle of confusion which began to act after he had resumed his palette as a sharp a delightful stimulus miriam spoke never a word but she was doubly grand and for more than an hour till nick exhausted declared he must stop the industrious silence was broken only by the desultory discourse of their friend     xxvii   nick went to great stanhope street at five oclock and learned rather to his surprise that julia was not at hometo his surprise because he had told her he would come at that hour and he attributed to her with a certain simplicity an eager state of mind in regard to his explanation apparently she was not eager the eagerness was his ownhe was eager to explain he recognised not without a certain consciousness of magnanimity in doing so that there had been some reason for her quick withdrawal from his studio or at any rate for her extreme discomposure there he had a few days before put in a plea for a snatch of worship in that sanctuary and she had accepted and approved it but the worship when the curtain happened to blow back showed for that of a magnificent young woman an actress with disordered hair who wore in a singular degree the appearance of a person settled for many hours the explanation was easy it dwelt in the simple truth that when one was painting even very badly and only for a moment one had to have models nick was impatient to give it with frank affectionate lips and a full pleasant admission that it was natural julia should have been startled and he was the more impatient that though he would not in the least have expected her to like finding a strange woman intimately installed with him she had disliked it even more than would have seemed probable or natural that was because not having heard from him about the matter the impression was for the moment irresistible with her that a trick had been played her but three minutes with him alone would make the difference  they would indeed have a considerable difference to make nick reflected as minutes much more numerous elapsed without bringing mrs dallow home for he had said to the butler that he would come in and waitthough it was odd she should not have left a message for him she would doubtless return from one moment to the other he had of course full licence to wait anywhere he preferred and he was ushered into julias particular sittingroom and supplied with tea and the evening papers after a quarter of an hour however he gave little attention to these beguilements thanks to his feeling still more acutely that since she definitely knew he was coming she might have taken the trouble to be at home he walked up and down and looked out of the window took up her books and dropped them again and then as half an hour had elapsed became aware he was really sore what could she be about when with london a thankless void she was of course not paying visits a footman came in to attend to the fire whereupon nick questioned him as to the manner in which she was possibly engaged the man disclosed the fact that his mistress had gone out but a quarter of an hour before nicks arrival and as if appreciating the opportunity for a little decorous conversation gave him still more information than he invited from this it appeared that as nick knew or could surmise she had the evening before from the country wired for the victoria to meet her in the morning at paddington and then gone straight from the station to the studio while her maid with her luggage proceeded in a cab to great stanhope street on leaving the studio however she had not come directly home she had chosen this unusual season for an hours drive in the park she had finally reentered her house but had remained upstairs all day seeing no one and not coming down to luncheon at four oclock she had ordered the brougham for four fortyfive and had got into it punctually saying to the park as she did so  nick after the footman had left him made what he could of julias sudden passion for the banks of the serpentine forsaken and foggy now inasmuch as the afternoon had come on grey and the light was waning she usually hated the park and hated a closed carriage he had a gruesome vision of her shrunken into a corner of her brougham and veiled as if in consequence of tears revolving round the solitude of the drive she had of course been deeply displeased and was not herself the motion of the carriage soothed her had an effect on her nerves nick remembered that in the morning at his door she had appeared to be going home so she had plunged into the drearier resort on second thoughts and as she noted herself near it he lingered another halfhour walked up and down the room many times and thought of many things had she misunderstood him when he said he would come at five couldnt she be sure even if she had that he would come early rather than late and mightnt she have left a message for him on the chance going out that way a few minutes before he was to come had even a little the air of a thing done on purpose to offend him as if she had been so displeased that she had taken the nearest occasion of giving him a sign she meant to break with him but were these the things julia did and was that the way she did themhis fine proud delicate generous julia  when six oclock came poor nick felt distinctly resentful but he stayed ten minutes longer on the possibility that she would in the morning have understood him to mention that hour the april dusk began to gather and the unsociability of her behaviour especially if she were still rumbling round the park became absurd anecdotes came back to him vaguely remembered heard he couldnt have said when or where of poor artists for whom life had been rendered difficult by wives who wouldnt allow them the use of the living female model and who made scenes if they encountered on the staircase such sources of inspiration these ladies struck him as vulgar and odious persons with whom it seemed grotesque that julia should have anything in common of course she was not his wife yet and of course if she were he should have washed his hands of every form of activity requiring the services of the sitter but even these qualifications left him with a power to wince at the way in which the woman he was so sure he loved just escaped ranking herself with the philistines  at a quarter past six he rang a bell and told the servant who answered it that he was going and that mrs dallow was to be informed as soon as she came in that he had expected to find her and had waited an hour and a quarter but he had just reached the doorstep of departure when her brougham emerging from the evening mist stopped in front of the house nick stood there hanging back till she got out allowing the servants only to help her she saw himshe was less veiled than his mental vision of her but this didnt prevent her pausing to give an order to the coachman a matter apparently requiring some discussion when she came to the door her visitor remarked that he had been waiting an eternity to which she replied that he must make no grievance of thatshe was too unwell to do him justice he immediately professed regret and sympathy adding however that in that case she had much better not have gone out she made no answer to thisthere were three servants in the hall who looked as if they might understand at least what was not said to them only when he followed her in she asked if his idea had been to stay longer  certainly if youre not too ill to see me  come in then julia said turning back after having gone to the foot of the stairs  this struck him immediately as a further restriction of his visit she wouldnt readmit him to the drawingroom or to her boudoir she would receive him in the impersonal apartment downstairs where she saw people on business what did she want to do to him he was prepared by this time for a scene of jealousy since he was sure he had learned to read her character justly in feeling that if she had the appearance of a cold woman a forked flame in her was liable on occasion to break out she was very still but from time to time she would fire off a pistol as soon as he had closed the door she said without sitting down  i daresay you saw i didnt like that at all  my having a sitter in that professional way i was very much annoyed at it myself nick answered  why were you annoyed shes very handsome mrs dallow perversely said  i didnt know you had looked at her nick laughed  julia had a pause was i very rude  oh it was all right it was only awkward for me because you didnt know he replied  i did know thats why i came  how do you mean my letter couldnt have reached you  i dont know anything about your letter julia cast about her for a chair and then seated herself on the edge of a sofa with her eyes on the floor  she sat to me yesterday she was there all the morning but i didnt write to tell you i went at her with great energy and absurd as it may seem to you found myself very tired afterwards besides in the evening i went to see her act  does she act asked mrs dallow  shes an actress its her profession dont you remember her that day at peters in paris shes already a celebrity she has great talent shes engaged at a theatre here and is making a sensation as i tell you i saw her last night  you neednt tell me julia returned looking up at him with a face of which the intense the tragic sadness startled him  he had been standing before her but at this he instantly sat down close taking her passive hand i want to please otherwise it must seem so odd to you i knew she was coming when i wrote to you the day before yesterday but i didnt tell you then because i didnt know how it would turn out and i didnt want to exult in advance over a poor little attempt that might come to nothing moreover it was no use speaking of the matter at all unless i told you exactly how it had come about nick went on explaining kindly and copiously it was the result of a visit unexpectedly paid me by gabriel nash  that manthe man who spoke to me her memory of him shuddered into life  he did what he thought would please you but i daresay it didnt you met him in paris and didnt like him so i judged best to hold my tongue about him  do you like him  very much  great heaven julia ejaculated almost under her breath  the reason i was annoyed was because somehow when you came in i suddenly had the air of having got out of those visits and shut myself up in town to do something that i had kept from you and i have been very unhappy till i could explain  you dont explainyou cant explain mrs dallow declared turning on her companion eyes which in spite of her studied stillness expressed deep excitement i knew iti knew everything thats why i came  it was a sort of secondsightwhat they call a brainwave nick smiled  i felt uneasy i felt a kind of call it came suddenly yesterday it was irresistible nothing could have kept me this morning  thats very serious but its still more delightful you mustnt go away again said nick we must stick togetherforever and ever  he put his arm round her but she detached herself as soon as she felt its pressure she rose quickly moving away while mystified he sat looking up at her as she had looked a few moments before at him ive thought it all over ive been thinking of it all day she began thats why i didnt come in  dont think of it too much it isnt worth it  you like it more than anything else you doyou cant deny it she went on  my dear child what are you talking about nick asked gently  thats what you likedoing what you were this morning with women lolling with their things off to be painted and people like that man  nick slowly got up hesitating my dear julia apart from the surprise this morning do you object to the living model  not a bit for you  whats the inconvenience then since in my studio theyre only for me  you love it you revel in it thats what you wantthe only thing you want julia broke out  to have models lolling undressed women do you mean  thats what i felt what i knew she went onwhat came over me and haunted me yesterday so that i couldnt throw it off it seemed to me that if i could see it with my eyes and have the perfect proof i should feel better i should be quiet and now i am quietafter a struggle of some hours i confess i have seen the whole things before me and im satisfied  im notto me neither the whole thing nor half of it is before me what exactly are you talking about nick demanded  about what you were doing this morning thats your innermost preference thats your secret passion  a feeble scratch at something serious yes it was almost serious he said but it was an accident this morning and yesterday i got on less wretchedly than i intended  im sure youve immense talent julia returned with a dreariness that was almost droll  no no i might have had ive plucked it up its too late for it to flower my dear julia im perfectly incompetent and perfectly resigned  yes you looked so this morning when you hung over her oh shell bring back your talent  shes an obliging and even an intelligent creature and ive no doubt she would if she could nick conceded but ive received from you all the help any womans destined to give me no one can do for me again what youve done  i shouldnt try it again i acted in ignorance oh ive thought it all out julia declared and then with a strange face of anguish resting on his own before its too latebefore its too late  too late for what  for you to be freefor you to be free and for mefor me to be free too you hate everything i like she flashed out dont pretend dont pretend she went on as a sound of protest broke from him  i thought you so awfully wanted me to paint he gasped flushed and staring  i doi do thats why you must be free why we must part  why we must part  oh ive turned it well over ive faced the hard truth it wouldnt do at all julia rang out  i like the way you talk of itas if it were a trimming for your dress nick retorted with bitterness wont it do for you to be loved and cherished as well as any woman in england  she turned away from him closing her eyes as not to see something dangerous you mustnt give anything up for me i should feel it all the while and i should hate it im not afraid of the truth but you are  the truth dear julia i only want to know it nick insisted it seems to me in fact just what ive got hold of when two persons are united by the tenderest affection and are sane and generous and just no difficulties that occur in the union their life makes for them are insurmountable no problems are insoluble  she appeared for a moment to reflect upon this it was spoken in a tone that might have touched her yet at the end of the moment lifting her eyes she brought out i hate art as you call it i thought i did i knew i did but till this morning i didnt know how much  bless your dear soul that wasnt art nick pleaded the real thing will be a thousand miles away from us it will never come into the house soyez tranquille it knows where to look in and where to flee shrieking why then should you worry  because i want to understand i want to know what im doing youre an artist you are you are julia cried accusing him passionately  my poor julia it isnt so easy as that nor a character one can take on from one day to the other there are all sorts of things one must be caught young and put through the millone must see things as they are there are very few professions that goes with there would be sacrifices i never can make  well then there are sacrifices for both of us and i cant make them either i daresay its all right for you but for me it would be a terrible mistake when i think im doing a certain thing i mustnt do just the opposite she kept on as for true lucidity there are things ive thought of the things i like best and theyre not what you mean it would be a great deception and its not the way i see my life and it would be misery if we dont understand  he looked at her with eyes not lighted by her words if we dont understand what  that were utterly differentthat youre doing it all for me  and is that an objection to mewhat i do for you he asked  you do too much youre awfully good youre generous youre a dear oh yesa dear but that doesnt make me believe in it i didnt at bottom from the firstthats why i made you wait why i gave you your freedom oh ive suspected you julia continued i had my ideas its all right for you but it wont do for me im different altogether why should it always be put upon me when i hate it what have i done i was drenched with it before these last words as they broke forth were attended with a quick blush so that nick could as quickly discern in them the uncalculated betrayal of an old irritation an old shame almosther late husbands flat inglorious taste for pretty things his indifference to every chance to play a public part this had been the humiliation of her youth and it was indeed a perversity of fate that a new alliance should contain for her even an oblique demand for the same spirit of accommodation impose on her the secret bitterness of the same concessions as nick stood there before her struggling sincerely with the force that he now felt to be strong in her the intense resolution to break with him a force matured in a few hours he read a riddle that hitherto had baffled him saw a great mystery become simple a personal passion for him had all but thrown her into his arms the sort of thing that even a vain manand nick was not especially vainmight hesitate to recognise the strength of held in check at moments with a strain of the cord that he could still feel vibrate by her deep her rare ambition and arrested at the last only just in time to save her calculations his present glimpse of the immense extent of these calculations didnt make him think her cold or poor there was in fact a positive strange heat in them and they struck him rather as grand and high the fact that she could drop him even while she longed for himdrop him because it was now fixed in her mind that he wouldnt after all serve her resolve to be associated so far as a woman could with great affairs that she could postpone and postpone to an uncertainty the satisfaction of an aching tenderness and plan for the long runthis exhibition of will and courage of the larger scheme that possessed her commanded his admiration on the spot he paid the heavy price of the man of imagination he was capable of far excursions of the spirit disloyalties to habit and even to faith he was open to rare communications he ached on his side for the moment to convince her that he would achieve what he wouldnt for the vision of his future she had tried to entertain shone before him as a bribe and a challenge it struck him there was nothing he couldnt work for enough with her to be so worked with by her presently he said  you want to be sure the man you marry will be prime minister of england but how can you be really sure with any one  i can be really sure some men wont julia returned  the only safe thing perhaps would be tomarry mr macgeorge he suggested  possibly not even him  youre a prime minister yourself nick made answer to hold fast to you as i hold to be determined to be of your partyisnt that political enough since youre the incarnation of politics  ah how you hate them she wailed again i saw that when i saw you this morning the whole place reeked of your aversion  my dear child the greatest statesmen have had their distractions what do you make of my hereditary talent thats a tremendous force  it wouldnt carry you far then she terribly added you must be a great artist he tossed his head at the involuntary contempt of this but she went on its beautiful of you to want to give up anything and i like you for it i shall always like you we shall be friends and i shall always take an interest  but he stopped her there made a movement which interrupted her phrase and she suffered him to hold her hand as if she were not afraid of him now it isnt only for you he argued gently youre a great deal but youre not everything innumerable vows and pledges repose upon my head im inextricably committed and dedicated i was brought up in the temple like an infant samuel my father was a highpriest and im a child of the lord and then the life itselfwhen you speak of it i feel stirred to my depths its like a heralds trumpet fight with me julianot against me be on my side and we shall do everything it is uplifting to be a great man before the peopleto be loved by them to be followed by them an artist isntnever never why should he be dont forget how clever i am  oh if it wasnt for that she panted pale with the effort to resist his tone then she put it to him do you pretend that if i were to die tomorrow youd stay in the house  if you were to die god knows but you do singularly little justice to my incentives he pursued my political careers everything to my mother  this but made her say after a moment are you afraid of your mother  yes immensely for she represents ever so many possibilities of disappointment and distress she represents all my fathers as well as all her own and in them my father tragically lives again on the other hand i see him in bliss as i see my mother over our marriage and our life of common aspirationsthough of course thats not a consideration that i can expect to have power with you  she shook her head slowly even smiling with her recovered calmness and lucidity youll never hold high office  but why not take me as i am  because im abominably keen about that sort of thingi must recognise my keenness i must face the ugly truth ive been through the worst its all settled  the worst i suppose was when you found me this morning  oh that was all rightfor you  youre magnanimous julia but evidently whats good enough for me isnt good enough for you nick spoke with bitterness  i dont like you enoughthats the obstacle she held herself in hand to say  you did a year ago you confessed to it  well a year ago was a year ago things are changed today  youre very fortunateto be able to throw away a real devotion nick returned  she had her pockethandkerchief in her hand and at this she quickly pressed it to her lips as to check an exclamation then for an instant she appeared to be listening to some sound from outside he interpreted her movement as an honourable impulse to repress the do you mean the devotion i was witness of this morning but immediately afterwards she said something very different i thought i heard a ring ive telegraphed for mrs gresham  he wondered why did you do that  oh i want her  he walked to the window where the curtains had not been drawn and saw in the dusk a cab at the door when he turned back he went on why wont you trust me to make you like me as you call it better if i make you like me as well as i like you it will be about enough i think  oh i like you enough for your happiness and i dont throw away a devotion mrs dallow continued i shall be constantly kind to you i shall be beautiful to you  youll make me lose a fortune nick after a moment said  it brought a slight convulsion instantly repressed into her face ah you may have all the money you want  i dont mean yours he answered with plenty of expression of his own he had determined on the instant since it might serve to tell her what he had never breathed to her before mr carteret last year promised me a pot of money on the day we should be man and wife he has thoroughly set his heart on it  im sorry to disappoint mr carteret said julia ill go and see him ill make it all right she went on then your work you know will bring you an income the great men get a thousand just for a head  im only joking nick returned with sombre eyes that contradicted this profession but what things you deserve i should do  do you mean striking likenesses  he watched her a moment you do hate it pushed to that point its curious he audibly mused  do you mean youre joking about mr carterets promise  nothe promise is real but i dont seriously offer it as a reason  i shall go to beauclere julia said youre an hour late she added in a different tone for at that moment the door of the room was thrown open and mrs gresham the butler pronouncing her name ushered in  ah dont impugn my punctualityits my character the useful lady protested putting a sixpence from the cabman into her purse nick went off at this with a simplified farewellwent off foreseeing exactly what he found the next day that the useful lady would have received orders not to budge from her hostesss side he called on the morrow late in the afternoon and julia saw him liberally in the spirit of her assurance that she would be beautiful to him that she had not thrown away his devotion but mrs gresham remained with whatever delicacies of deprecation a spectator of her liberality julia looked at him kindly but her companion was more benignant still so that what nick did with his own eyes was not to appeal to her to see him a moment alone but to solicit in the name of this luxury the second occupant of the drawingroom mrs gresham seemed to say while julia said so little i understand my poor friend i know everythingshe has told me only her side but im so competent that i know yours tooand i enter into the whole thing deeply but it would be as much as my place is worth to accommodate you still she didnt go so far as to give him an inkling of what he learned on the third day and what he had not gone so far as to suspectthat the two ladies had made rapid arrangements for a scheme of foreign travel these arrangements had already been carried out when at the door of the house in great stanhope street the announcement was made him that the subtle creatures had started that morning for paris     xxviii   they spent on their way to florence several days in paris where peter sherringham had as much free talk with his sister as it often befell one member of their family to have with another he enjoyed that is on two different occasions half an hours gossip with her in her sittingroom at the hotel on one of these he took the liberty of asking her whether or no decidedly she meant to marry nick dormer julia expressed to him that she appreciated his curiosity but that nick and she were nothing more than relations and good friends he tremendously wants it peter none the less observed to which she simply made answer well then he may want  after this for a while they sat as silent as if the subject had been quite threshed out between them peter felt no impulse to penetrate further for it was not a habit of the sherringhams to talk with each other of their loveaffairs and he was conscious of the particular deterrent that he and julia entertained in general such different sentiments that they could never go far together in discussion he liked her and was sorry for her thought her life lonely and wondered she didnt make a great marriage moreover he pitied her for being without the interests and consolations he himself had found substantial those of the intellectual the studious order he considered these to be not knowing how much she supposed she reflected and studied and what an education she had found in her political aspirations viewed by him as scarce more a personal part of her than the livery of her servants or the jewels george dallows money had bought her relations with nick struck him as queer but were fortunately none of his business no business of julias was sufficiently his to justify him in an attempt to understand it that there should have been a question of her marrying nick was the funny thing rather than that the question should have been dropped he liked his clever cousin very well as he wasenough for a vague sense that he might be spoiled by alteration to a brotherinlaw moreover though not perhaps distinctly conscious of this peter pressed lightly on julias doings from a tacit understanding that in this case she would let him off as easily he couldnt have said exactly what it was he judged it pertinent to be let off from perhaps from irritating inquiry as to whether he had given any more teaparties for gross young women connected with the theatre  peters forbearance however brought him not quite all the security he prefigured after an interval he indeed went so far as to ask julia if nick had been wanting in respect to her but this was an appeal intended for sympathy not for other intervention she answered dear nothough hes very provoking thus peter guessed that they had had a quarrel in which it didnt concern him to meddle he added her epithet and her flight from england together and they made up to his perception one of the little magnified embroilments which do duty for the real in superficial lives it was worse to provoke julia than not and peter thought nicks doing so not particularly characteristic of his versatility for good he might wonder why she didnt marry the member for harsh if the subject had pressingly come up between them but he wondered still more why nick didnt marry that gentlemans great backer julia said nothing again as if to give him a chance to address her some challenge that would save her from gushing but as his impulse appeared to be to change the subject and as he changed it only by silence she was reduced to resuming presently  i should have thought youd have come over to see your friend the actress  which of my friends i know so many actresses peter pleaded  the woman you inflicted on us in this place a year agothe one whos in london now  oh miriam rooth i should have liked to come over but ive been tied fast have you seen her there  yes ive seen her  do you like her  not at all  she has a lovely voice peter hazarded after a moment  i dont know anything about her voicei havent heard it  but she doesnt act in pantomime does she  i dont know anything about her acting i saw her in privateat nick dormers studio  at nicks he was interested now  what was she doing there  she was sprawling over the room andrather insolentlystaring at me  if mrs dallow had wished to draw her brother she must at this point have suspected she succeeded in spite of his care to divest his tone of all emotion why does he know her so well i didnt know  shes sitting to him for her portraitat least she was then  oh yes i rememberi put him up to that im greatly interested is the portrait good  i havent the least ideai didnt look at it i daresay its like julia threw off  but how in the worldand peters interest grew frankerdoes nick find time to paint  i dont know that horrid man brought her  which horrid manhe spoke as if they had their choice  the one nick thinks so cleverthe vulgar little man who was at your place that day and tried to talk to me i remember he abused theatrical people to meas if i cared anything about them but he has apparently something to do with your girl  oh i recollect himi had a discussion with him peter patiently said  how could you i must go and dress his sister went on more importantly  he was clever remarkably miss rooth and her mother were old friends of his and he was the first person to speak of them to me  what a distinction i thought him disgusting cried julia who was pressed for time and who had now got up  oh youre severe said peter still bland but when they separated she had given him something to think of  that nick was painting a beautiful actress was no doubt in part at least the reason why he was provoking and why his most intimate female friend had come abroad the fact didnt render him provoking to his kinsman peter had on the contrary been quite sincere when he qualified it as interesting it became indeed on reflexion so interesting that it had perhaps almost as much to do with sherringhams now prompt rush over to london as it had to do with julias coming away reflexion taught him further that the matter was altogether a delicate one and suggested that it was odd he should be mixed up with it in fact when as julias own affair he had but wished to keep out of it it might after all be his affair a little as wellthere was somehow a still more pointed implication of that in his sisters saying to him the next day that she wished immensely he would take a fancy to biddy dormer she said more she said there had been a time when she believed he had done sobelieved too that the poor child herself had believed the same biddy was far away the nicest girl she knewthe dearest sweetest cleverest best and one of the prettiest creatures in england which never spoiled anything she would make as charming a wife as ever a man had suited to any position however high andjulia didnt mind mentioning it since her brother would believe it whether she mentioned it or nowas so predisposed in his favour that he would have no trouble at all in short she herself would see him throughshed answer for it that hed have but to speak biddys life at home was horrid she was very sorry for herthe child was worthy of a better fate peter wondered what constituted the horridness of biddys life and gathered that it mainly arose from the fact of julias disliking lady agnes and grace and of her profiting comfortably by that freedom to do so which was a fruit of her having given them a house she had perhaps not felt the want of till they were in possession of it he knew she had always liked biddy but he asked himselfthis was the rest of his wonderwhy she had taken to liking her so extraordinarily just now he liked her himselfhe even liked to be talked to about her and could believe everything julia said the only thing that had mystified him was her motive for suddenly saying it he had assured her he was perfectly sensible of her goodness in so plotting out his future but was also sorry if he had put it into any ones headmost of all into the girls ownthat he had ever looked at biddy with a covetous eye he wasnt in the least sure she would make a good wife but liked her quite too much to wish to put any such mystery to the test she was certainly not offered them for cruel experiments as it happened really he wasnt thinking of marrying any onehe had ever so many grounds for neglecting that of course one was never safe against accidents but one could at least take precautions and he didnt mind telling her that there were several he had taken  i dont know what you mean but it seems to me quite the best precaution would be to care for a charming steady girl like biddy then youd be quite in shelter youd know the worst that can happen to you and it wouldnt be bad the objection he had made to this plea is not important especially as it was not quite candid it need only be mentioned that before the pair parted julia said to him still in reference to their young friend do go and see her and be nice to her shell save you disappointments  these last words reverberated for himthere was a shade of the portentous in them and they seemed to proceed from a larger knowledge of the subject than he himself as yet possessed they were not absent from his memory when in the beginning of may availing himself to save time of the nightservice he crossed from paris to london he arrived before the breakfasthour and went to his sisters house in great stanhope street where he always found quarters were she in town or not when at home she welcomed him and in her absence the relaxed servants hailed him for the chance he gave them to recover their form in either case his allowance of space was large and his independence complete he had obtained permission this year to take in scattered snatches rather than as a single draught the quantum of holiday to which he was entitled and there was moreover a question of his being transferred to another capitalin which event he believed he might count on a month or two in england before proceeding to his new post  he waited after breakfast but a very few minutes before jumping into a hansom and rattling away to the north a part of his waiting indeed consisted of a fidgety walk up bond street during which he looked at his watch three or four times while he paused at shop windows for fear of being a little early in the cab as he rolled along after having given an addressbalaklava place saint johns woodthe fear he might be too early took curiously at moments the form of a fear that he should be too late a symbol of the inconsistencies of which his spirit at present was full peter sherringham was nervously formed too nervously for a diplomatist and haunted with inclinations and indeed with designs which contradicted each other he wanted to be out of it and yet dreaded not to be in it and on this particular occasion the sense of exclusion was an ache at the same time he was not unconscious of the impulse to stop his cab and make it turn round and drive due south he saw himself launched in the breezy fact while morally speaking he was hauled up on the hot sand of the principle and he could easily note how little these two faces of the same idea had in common however as the consciousness of going helped him to reflect a principle was a poor affair if it merely became a fact yet from the hour it did turn to action the action had to be the particular one in which he was engaged so that he was in the absurd position of thinking his conduct wiser for the reason that it was directly opposed to his intentions  he had kept away from london ever since miriam rooth came over resisting curiosity sympathy importunate haunting passion and considering that his resistance founded to be salutary on a general scheme of life was the greatest success he had yet achieved he was deeply occupied with plucking up the feeling that attached him to her and he had already by various little ingenuities loosened some of its roots he had suffered her to make her first appearance on any stage without the comfort of his voice or the applause of his hand saying to himself that the man who could do the more could do the less and that such an act of fortitude was a proof he should keep straight it was not exactly keeping straight to run over to london three months later and the hour he arrived scramble off to balaklava place but after all he pretended only to be human and aimed in behaviour only at the heroic never at the monstrous the highest heroism was obviously three parts tact he had not written to his young friend that he was coming to england and would call upon her at eleven oclock in the morning because it was his secret pride that he had ceased to correspond with her sherringham took his prudence where he could find it and in doing so was rather like a drunkard who should flatter himself he had forsworn liquor since he didnt touch lemonade  it is a sign of how far he was drawn in different directions at once that when on reaching balaklava place and alighting at the door of a small detached villa of the type of the retreat he learned that miss rooth had but a quarter of an hour before quitted the spot with her motherthey had gone to the theatre to rehearsal said the maid who answered the bell he had set tinkling behind a stuccoed gardenwall when at the end of his pilgrimage he was greeted by a disappointment he suddenly found himself relieved and for the moment even saved providence was after all taking care of him and he submitted to providence he would still be watched over doubtless even should he follow the two ladies to the theatre send in his card and obtain admission to the scene of their experiments all his keen taste for these matters flamed up again and he wondered what the girl was studying was rehearsing what she was to do next he got back into his hansom and drove down the edgware road by the time he reached the marble arch he had changed his mind again had determined to let miriam alone for that day it would be over at eight in the eveninghe hardly played fairand then he should consider himself free instead of pursuing his friends he directed himself upon a shop in bond street to take a place for their performance on first coming out he had tried at one of those establishments strangely denominated libraries to get a stall but the people to whom he applied were unable to accommodate himthey hadnt a single seat left his actual attempt at another library was more successful there was no question of obtaining a stall but he might by a miracle still have a box there was a wantonness in paying for a box at a play on which he had already expended four hundred pounds but while he was mentally measuring this abyss an idea came into his head which flushed the extravagance with the hue of persuasion  peter came out of the shop with the voucher for the box in his pocket turned into piccadilly noted that the day was growing warm and fine felt glad that this time he had no other strict business than to leave a card or two on official people and asked himself where he should go if he didnt go after miriam then it was that he found himself attaching a lively desire and imputing a high importance to the possible view of nick dormers portrait of her he wondered which would be the natural place at that hour of the day to look for the artist the house of commons was perhaps the nearest one but nick inconsequent and incalculable though so many of his steps probably didnt keep the picture there and moreover it was not generally characteristic of him to be in the natural place the end of peters debate was that he again entered a hansom and drove to calcutta gardens the hour was early for calling but cousins with whom ones intercourse was mainly a conversational scuffle would accept it as a practical illustration of that method and if julia wanted him to be nice to biddywhich was exactly even if with a different view what he wanted himselfhow could he better testify than by a visit to lady agneshe would have in decency to go to see her some timeat a friendly fraternising hour when they would all be likely to be at home  unfortunately as it turned out they were none of them at home so that he had to fall back on neutrality and the butler who was however more luckily an old friend her ladyship and miss dormer were absent from town paying a visit and mr dormer was also away or was on the point of going away for the day miss bridget was in london but was out peters informant mentioned with earnest vagueness that he thought she had gone somewhere to take a lesson on peters asking what sort of lesson he meant he replied oh i thinkathe asculpture you know sir peter knew but biddys lesson in asculptureit sounded on the butlers lips like a fashionable new artstruck him a little as a mockery of the helpful spirit in which he had come to look her up the man had an air of participating respectfully in his disappointment and to make up for it added that he might perhaps find mr dormer at his other address he had gone out early and had directed his servant to come to rosedale road in an hour or two with a portmanteau he was going down to beauclere in the course of the day mr carteret being illperhaps mr sherringham didnt know it perhaps too mr sherringham would catch him in rosedale road before he took his trainhe was to have been busy there for an hour this was worth trying and peter immediately drove to rosedale road where in answer to his ring the door was opened to him by biddy dormer     xxix   when that young woman saw him her cheek exhibited the prettiest pleased surprised red he had ever observed there though far from unacquainted with its living tides and she stood smiling at him with the outer dazzle in her eyes still making him no motion to enter she only said oh peter and then im all alone  so much the better dear biddy is that any reason i shouldnt come in  dear nodo come in youve just missed nick he has gone to the countryhalf an hour ago she had on a large apron and in her hand carried a small stick besmeared as his quick eye saw with modellingclay she dropped the door and fled back before him into the studio where when he followed her she was in the act of flinging a damp cloth over a rough head in clay which in the middle of the room was supported on a high wooden stand the effort to hide what she had been doing before he caught a glimpse of it made her redder still and led to her smiling more to her laughing with a confusion of shyness and gladness that charmed him she rubbed her hands on her apron she pulled it off she looked delightfully awkward not meeting peters eye and she said im just scraping here a littleyou mustnt mind me what i do is awful you know please peter dont look ive been coming here lately to make my little mess because mamma doesnt particularly like it at home ive had a lesson or two from a lady who exhibits but you wouldnt suppose it to see what i do nicks so kind he lets me come here he uses the studio so little i do what i want or rather what i can what a pity hes gonehed have been so glad im really alonei hope you dont mind peter please dont look  peter was not bent on looking his eyes had occupation enough in biddys own agreeable aspect which was full of a rare element of domestication and responsibility though she had stretching her bravery taken possession of her brothers quarters she struck her visitor as more at home and more herself than he had ever seen her it was the first time she had been to his notice so separate from her mother and sister she seemed to know this herself and to be a little frightened by itjust enough to make him wish to be reassuring at the same time peter also on this occasion found himself touched with diffidence especially after he had gone back and closed the door and settled down to a regular call for he became acutely conscious of what julia had said to him in paris and was unable to rid himself of the suspicion that it had been said with biddys knowledge it wasnt that he supposed his sister had told the girl she meant to do what she could to make him propose to her that would have been cruel to herif she liked him enough to consentin julias perfect uncertainty but biddy participated by imagination by divination by a clever girls secret tremulous instincts in her good friends views about her and this probability constituted for sherringham a sort of embarrassing publicity he had impressions possibly gross and unjust in regard to the way women move constantly together amid such considerations and subtly intercommunicate when they dont still more subtly dissemble the hopes or fears of which persons of the opposite sex form the subject therefore poor biddy would know that if she failed to strike him in the right light it wouldnt be for want of an attention definitely called to her claims she would have been tacitly rejected virtually condemned he couldnt without an impulse of fatuity endeavour to make up for this to her by consoling kindness he was aware that if any one knew it a man would be ridiculous who should take so much as that for granted but no one would know it he oddly enough in this calculation of security left biddy herself out it didnt occur to him that she might have a secret small irony to spare for his ingenious and magnanimous effort to show her how much he liked her in reparation to her for not liking her more this high charity coloured at any rate the whole of his visit to rosedale road the whole of the pleasant prolonged chat that kept him there more than an hour he begged the girl to go on with her work not to let him interrupt it and she obliged him at last taking the cloth off the lump of clay and giving him a chance to be delightful by guessing that the shapeless mass was intended or would be intended after a while for nick he saw she was more comfortable when she began again to smooth it and scrape it with her little stick to manipulate it with an ineffectual air of knowing how for this gave her something to do relieved her nervousness and permitted her to turn away from him when she talked  he walked about the room and sat down got up and looked at nicks things watched her at moments in silencewhich made her always say in a minute that he was not to pass judgement or she could do nothing observed how her position before her high stand her lifted arms her turns of the head considering her work this way and that all helped her to be pretty she repeated again and again that it was an immense pity about nick till he was obliged to say he didnt care a straw for nick and was perfectly content with the company he found this was not the sort of tone he thought it right given the conditions to take but then even the circumstances didnt require him to pretend he liked her less than he did after all she was his cousin she would cease to be so if she should become his wife but one advantage of her not entering into that relation was precisely that she would remain his cousin it was very pleasant to find a young bright slim rosecoloured kinswoman all ready to recognise consanguinity when one came back from cousinless foreign lands peter talked about family matters he didnt know in his exile where no one took an interest in them what a fund of latent curiosity about them he treasured it drew him on to gossip accordingly and to feel how he had with biddy indefeasible properties in commonever so many things as to which theyd always understand each other à demimot he smoked a cigarette because she begged himpeople always smoked in studios and it made her feel so much more an artist she apologised for the badness of her work on the ground that nick was so busy he could scarcely ever give her a sitting so that she had to do the head from photographs and occasional glimpses they had hoped to be able to put in an hour that morning but news had suddenly come that mr carteret was worse and nick had hurried down to beauclere mr carteret was very ill poor old dear and nick and he were immense friends nick had always been charming to him peter and biddy took the concerns of the houses of dormer and sherringham in order and the young man felt after a little as if they were as wise as a french conseil de famille and settling what was best for every one he heard all about lady agnes he showed an interest in the detail of her existence that he had not supposed himself to possess though indeed biddy threw out intimations which excited his curiosity presenting her mother in a light that might call on his sympathy  i dont think she has been very happy or very pleased of late the girl said i think she has had some disappointments poor dear mamma and grace has made her go out of town for three or four days in the hope of a little change theyve gone down to see an old lady lady st dunstans who never comes to london now and who you knowshes tremendously oldwas papas godmother its not very lively for grace but grace is such a dear shell do anything for mamma mamma will go anywhere no matter at what risk of discomfort to see people she can talk with about papa  biddy added in reply to a further question that what her mother was disappointed about waswell themselves her children and all their affairs and she explained that lady agnes wanted all kinds of things for them that didnt come that they didnt get or seem likely to get so that their life appeared altogether a failure she wanted a great deal biddy admitted she really wanted everything for she had thought in her happier days that everything was to be hers she loved them all so much and was so proud too she couldnt get over the thought of their not being successful peter was unwilling to press at this point for he suspected one of the things lady agnes wanted but biddy relieved him a little by describing her as eager above all that grace should get married  thats too unselfish of her he pronounced not caring at all for grace cousin agnes ought to keep her near her always if grace is so obliging and devoted  oh mamma would give up anything of that sort for our good she wouldnt sacrifice us that way biddy protested besides im the one to stay with mamma not that i can manage and look after her and do everything so well as grace but you know i want to said biddy with a liquid note in her voiceand giving her lump of clay a little stab for mendacious emphasis  but doesnt your mother want the rest of you to get marriedpercival and nick and you peter asked  oh she has given up percy i dont suppose she thinks it would do dear nick of coursethats just what she does want  he had a pause and you biddy  oh i daresay but that doesnt signifyi never shall  peter got up at this the tone of it set him in motion and he took a turn round the room he threw off something cheap about her being too proud to which she replied that that was the only thing for a girl to be to get on  what do you mean by getting onand he stopped with his hands in his pockets on the other side of the studio  i mean crying ones eyes out biddy unexpectedly exclaimed but she drowned the effect of this pathetic paradox in a laugh of clear irrelevance and in the quick declaration of course its about nick that shes really brokenhearted  whats the matter with nick he went on with all his diplomacy  oh peter whats the matter with julia biddy quavered softly back to him her eyes suddenly frank and mournful i daresay you know what we all hoped what we all supposed from what they told us and now they wont said the girl  yes biddy i know i had the brightest prospect of becoming your brotherinlaw wouldnt that have been itor something like that but its indeed visibly clouded whats the matter with them may i have another cigarette peter came back to the wide cushioned bench where he had previously lounged this was the way they took up the subject he wanted most to look into dont they know how to love he speculated as he seated himself again  it seems a kind of fatality biddy sighed  he said nothing for some moments at the end of which he asked if his companion were to be quite alone during her mothers absence she replied that this parent was very droll about that would never leave her alone and always thought something dreadful would happen to her she had therefore arranged that florence tressilian should come and stay in calcutta gardens for the next few daysto look after her and see she did no wrong peter inquired with fulness into florence tressilians identity he greatly hoped that for the success of lady agness precautions she wasnt a flighty young genius like biddy she was described to him as tremendously nice and tremendously clever but also tremendously old and tremendously safe with the addition that biddy was tremendously fond of her and that while she remained in calcutta gardens they expected to enjoy themselves tremendously she was to come that afternoon before dinner  and are you to dine at home said peter  certainly where else  and just you two alone do you call that enjoying yourselves tremendously  it will do for me no doubt i oughtnt in modesty to speak for poor florence  it isnt fair to her you ought to invite some one to meet her  do you mean you peter the girl asked turning to him quickly and with a look that vanished the instant he caught it  try me ill come like a shot  thats kind said biddy dropping her hands and now resting her eyes on him gratefully she remained in this position as if under a charm then she jerked herself back to her work with the remark florence will like that immensely  im delighted to please florenceyour description of hers so attractive sherringham laughed and when his companion asked him if he minded there not being a great feast because when her mother went away she allowed her a fixed amount for that sort of thing and as he might imagine it wasnt millionswhen biddy with the frankness of their pleasant kinship touched anxiously on this economic point illustrating as peter saw the lucidity with which lady agnes had had in her old age to learn to recognise the occasions when she could be conveniently frugal he answered that the shortest dinners were the best especially when one was going to the theatre that was his case tonight and did biddy think he might look to miss tressilian to go with them theyd have to dine earlyhe wanted not to miss a moment  the theatremiss tressilian she stared interrupted and in suspense again  would it incommode you very much to dine say at 715 and accept a place in my box the finger of providence was in it when i took a box an hour ago i particularly like your being free to goif you are free  she began almost to rave with pleasure dear peter how good you are theyll have it at any hour florence will be so glad  and has florence seen miss rooth  miss rooth the girl repeated redder than before he felt on the spot that she had heard of the expenditure of his time and attention on that young lady it was as if she were conscious of how conscious he would himself be in speaking of her and there was a sweetness in her allowance for him on that score but biddy was more confused for him than he was for himself he guessed in a moment how much she had thought over what she had heard this was indicated by her saying vaguely no no ive not seen her then she knew she was answering a question he hadnt asked her and she went on we shall be too delighted i saw herperhaps you rememberin your rooms in paris i thought her so wonderful then every ones talking of her here but we dont go to the theatre much you know we dont have boxes offered us except when you come poor nicks too much taken up in the evening ive wanted awfully to see her they say shes magnificent  i dont know peter was glad to be able honestly to answer i havent seen her  you havent seen her  never biddy i mean on the stage in private oftenyes he conscientiously added  oh biddy exclaimed bending her face on nicks bust again she asked him no question about the new star and he offered her no further information there were things in his mind pulling him different ways so that for some minutes silence was the result of the conflict at last he said after an hesitation caused by the possibility that she was ignorant of the fact he had lately elicited from julia though it was more probable she might have learned it from the same source  am i perhaps indiscreet in alluding to the circumstance that nick has been painting miss rooths portrait  youre not indiscreet in alluding to it to me because i know it  then theres no secret nor mystery about it  biddy just considered i dont think mamma knows it  you mean youve been keeping it from her because she wouldnt like it  were afraid she may think papa wouldnt have liked it  this was said with an absence of humour at which peter could but show amusement though he quickly recovered himself repenting of any apparent failure of respect to the high memory of his late celebrated relative he threw off rather vaguely ah yes i remember that great mans ideas and then went on may i ask if you know it the fact were talking of through julia or through nick  i know it from both of them  then if youre in their confidence may i further ask if this undertaking of nicks is the reason why things seem to be at an end between them  oh i dont think she likes it biddy had to say  isnt it good  oh i dont mean the pictureshe hasnt seen it but his having done it  does she dislike it so much that thats why she wont marry him  biddy gave up her work moving away from it to look at it she came and sat down on the long bench on which sherringham had placed himself then she broke out oh peter its a great troubleits a very great trouble and i cant tell you for i dont understand it  if i ask you he said its not to pry into what doesnt concern me but julias my sister and i cant after all help taking some interest in her life she tells me herself so little she doesnt think me worthy  ah poor julia biddy wailed defensively her tone recalled to him that julia had at least thought him worthy to unite himself to bridget dormer and inevitably betrayed that the girl was thinking of that also while they both thought of it they sat looking into each others eyes  nick im sure doesnt treat you that way im sure he confides in you he talks to you about his occupations his ambitions peter continued and you understand him you enter into them youre nice to him you help him  oh nicks lifeits very dear to me biddy granted  that must be jolly for him  it makes me very happy  peter uttered a low ambiguous groan then he cried with irritation what the deuce is the matter with them then why cant they hit it off together and be quiet and rational and do what every one wants them to  oh peter its awfully complicated the girl sighed with sagacity  do you mean that nicks in love with her  in love with julia  no no with miriam rooth  she shook her head slowly then with a smile which struck him as one of the sweetest things he had ever seenit conveyed at the expense of her own prospects such a shy generous little mercy of reassurancehe isnt peter she brought out julia thinks it triflingall that sort of thing she added she wants him to go in for different honours  julias the oddest woman i mean i thought she loved him peter explained and when you love a person he continued to make it out leaving his sentence impatiently unfinished while biddy with lowered eyes sat waitingit so interested herto learn what you did when you loved a person i cant conceive her giving him up he has great ability besides being such a good fellow  its for his happiness peterthats the way she reasons biddy set forth she does it for an idea she has told me a great deal about it and i see the way she feels  you try to biddy because youre such a dear goodnatured girl but i dont believe you do in the least he took the liberty of replying its too little the way you yourself would feel julias idea as you call it must be curious  well it is peter biddy mournfully admitted she wont risk not coming out at the top  at the top of what  oh of everything her tone showed a trace of awe of such high views  surely ones at the top of everything when ones in love  i dont know said the girl  do you doubt it peter asked  ive never been in love and i never shall be  youre as perverse in your way as julia he returned to this but i confess i dont understand nicks attitude any better he seems to me if i may say so neither fish nor flesh  oh his attitudes very noble peter his state of minds wonderfully interesting biddy pleaded surely you must be in favour of art she beautifully said  it made him look at her a moment dear biddy your little digs are as soft as zephyrs  she coloured but she protested my little digs what do you mean arent you in favour of art  the questions delightfully simple i dont know what youre talking about everything has its place a parliamentary life he opined scarce seems to me the situation for portraitpainting  thats just what nick says  you talk of it together a great deal  yes nicks very good to me  clever nick and what do you advise him  oh to do something  thats valuable peter laughed not to give up his sweetheart for the sake of a paintpot i hope  never never peter its not a question of his giving up biddy pursued for julia has herself shaken free i think she never really felt safeshe loved him but was afraid of him now shes only afraidshe has lost the confidence she tried to have nick has tried to hold her but she has wrested herself away do you know what she said to me she said my confidence has gone for ever  i didnt know she was such a prig julias brother commented theyre queer people verily with water in their veins instead of blood you and i wouldnt be like that should wethough you have taken up such a discouraging position about caring for a fellow  i care for art poor biddy returned  you do to some purposeand peter glanced at the bust  to that of making you laugh at me  but this he didnt heed would you give a good man up for art  a good man what man  well say meif i wanted to marry you  she had the briefest of pauses of course i wouldin a moment at any rate id give up the house of commons she amended thats what nicks going to do nowonly you mustnt tell any one  peter wondered hes going to chuck up his seat  i think his mind is made up to it he has talked me overweve had some deep discussions yes im on the side of art she ardently said  do you mean in order to paintto paint that girl peter went on  to paint every onethats what he wants by keeping his seat he hasnt kept julia and she was the thing he cared for most in public life when he has got out of the whole thing his attitude as he says will be at least clear hes tremendously interesting about it peter biddy declared has talked to me wonderfullyhas won me over mammas heartbroken telling her will be the hardest part  if she doesnt know he asked why then is she heartbroken  oh at the hitch about their marriageshe knows that their marriage has been so what she wanted she thought it perfection she blames nick fearfully she thinks he held the whole thing in his hand and that he has thrown away a magnificent opportunity  and what does nick say to her  he says dear old mummy  thats good peter pronounced  i dont know what will become of her when this other blow arrives biddy went on poor nick wants to please herhe does he does but as he says you cant please every one and you must before you die please yourself a little  nicks kinsman whose brotherinlaw he was to have been sat looking at the floor the colour had risen to his face while he listened then he sprang up and took another turn about the room his companions artless but vivid recital had set his blood in motion he had taken nicks political prospects very much for granted thought of them as definite and almost dazzling to learn there was something for which he was ready to renounce such honours and to recognise the nature of that bribe affected our young man powerfully and strangely he felt as if he had heard the sudden blare of a trumpet yet felt at the same time as if he had received a sudden slap in the face nicks bribe was artthe strange temptress with whom he himself had been wrestling and over whom he had finally ventured to believe that wisdom and training had won a victory there was something in the conduct of his old friend and playfellow that made all his reasonings small so unexpected so courageous a choice moved him as a reproach and a challenge he felt ashamed of having placed himself so unromantically on his guard and rapidly said to himself that if nick could afford to allow so much for art he might surely exhibit some of the same confidence there had never been the least avowed competition between the cousinstheir lines lay too far apart for that but they nevertheless rode their course in sight of each other and peter had now the impression of suddenly seeing nick dormer give his horse the spur bound forward and fly over a wall he was put on his mettle and hadnt to look long to spy an obstacle he too might ride at high rose his curiosity to see what warrant his kinsman might have for such riskshow he was mounted for such exploits he really knew little about nicks talentso little as to feel no right to exclaim what an ass when biddy mentioned the fact which the existence of real talent alone could redeem from absurdity all his eagerness to see what nick had been able to make of such a subject as miriam rooth came back to him though it was what mainly had brought him to rosedale road he had forgotten it in the happy accident of his encounter with the girl he was conscious that if the surprise of a revelation of power were in store for him nick would be justified more than he himself would feel reinstated in selfrespect since the courage of renouncing the forum for the studio hovered before him as greater than the courage of marrying an actress whom one was in love with the reward was in the latter case so much more immediate peter at any rate asked biddy what nick had done with his portrait of miriam he hadnt seen it anywhere in rummaging about the room  i think its here somewhere but i dont know she replied getting up to look vaguely round her  havent you seen it hasnt he shown it to you  she rested her eyes on him strangely a moment then turned them away with a mechanical air of still searching i think its in the room put away with its face to the wall  one of those dozen canvases with their backs to us  one of those perhaps  havent you tried to see  i havent touched themand biddy had a colour  hasnt nick had it out to show you  he says its in too bad a stateit isnt finishedit wont do  and havent you had the curiosity to turn it round for yourself  the embarrassed look in her face deepened under his insistence and it seemed to him that her eyes pleaded with him a moment almost to tears ive had an idea he wouldnt like it  her visitors own desire however had become too sharp for easy forbearance he laid his hand on two or three canvases which proved as he extricated them to be either blank or covered with rudimentary forms dear biddy have you such intense delicacy he asked pulling out something else  the inquiry was meant in familiar kindness for peter was struck even to admiration with her having a sense of honour that all girls havent she must in this particular case have longed for a sight of nicks workthe work that had brought about such a crisis in his life but she had passed hours in his studio alone without permitting herself a stolen peep she was capable of that if she believed it would please him peter liked a charming girls being capable of thathe had known charming girls who wouldnt in the least have beenand his question was really a form of homage biddy however apparently discovered some light mockery in it and she broke out incongruously  i havent wanted so much to see it i dont care for her so much as that  so much as what he couldnt but wonder  i dont care for his actressfor that vulgar creature i dont like her said biddy almost startlingly  peter stared i thought you hadnt seen her  i saw her in paristwice she was wonderfully clever but she didnt charm me  he quickly considered saying then all kindly i wont inflict the thing on you in that casewell leave it alone for the present biddy made no reply to this at first but after a moment went straight over to the row of stacked canvases and exposed several of them to the light why did you say you wished to go to the theatre tonight her companion continued  still she was silent after which with her back turned to him and a little tremor in her voice while she drew forth successively her brothers studies she made answer for the sake of your company peter here it is i think she added moving a large canvas with some effort no no ill hold it for you is that the light  she wouldnt let him take it she bade him stand off and allow her to place it in the right position in this position she carefully presented it supporting it at the proper angle from behind and showing her head and shoulders above it from the moment his eyes rested on the picture peter accepted this service without protest unfinished simplified and in some portions merely suggested it was strong vivid and assured it had already the look of life and the promise of power peter felt all this and was startled was strangely affectedhe had no idea nick moved with that stride miriam seated was represented in threequarters almost to her feet she leaned forward with one of her legs crossed over the other her arms extended and foreshortened her hands locked together round her knee her beautiful head was bent a little broodingly and her splendid face seemed to look down at life she had a grand appearance of being raised aloft with a wide regard a survey from a height of intelligence for the great field of the artist all the figures and passions he may represent peter asked himself where his kinsman had learned to paint like that he almost gasped at the composition of the thing and at the drawing of the difficult arms biddy abstained from looking round the corner of the canvas as she held it she only watched in peters eyes for this gentlemans impression of it that she easily caught and he measured her impressionher impression of his impressionwhen he went after a few minutes to relieve her she let him lift the thing out of her grasp he moved it and rested it so that they could still see it against the high back of a chair its tremendously good he then handsomely pronounced  dear dear nick biddy murmured looking at it now  poor poor julia peter was prompted to exclaim in a different tone his companion made no rejoinder to this and they stood another minute or two side by side and in silence gazing at the portrait at last he took up his hathe had no more time he must go will you come tonight all the same he asked with a laugh that was somewhat awkward and an offer of a handshake  all the same biddy seemed to wonder  why you say shes a terrible creature peter completed with his eyes on the painted face  oh anything for art biddy smiled  well at seven oclock then and sherringham departed leaving the girl alone with the tragic muse and feeling with a quickened rush the beauty of that young woman as well as all freshly the peculiar possibilities of nick     xxx   it was not till after the noon of the next day that he was to see miriam rooth he wrote her a note that evening to be delivered to her at the theatre and during the performance she sent round to him a card with all right come to luncheon tomorrow scrawled on it in pencil  when he presented himself at balaklava place he learned that the two ladies had not come inthey had gone again early to rehearsal but they had left word that he was to be pleased to wait they would appear from one moment to the other it was further mentioned to him as he was ushered into the drawingroom that mr dashwood was in possession of that ground this circumstance however peter barely noted he had been soaring so high for the past twelve hours that he had almost lost consciousness of the minor differences of earthly things he had taken biddy dormer and her friend miss tressilian home from the play and after leaving them had walked about the streets had roamed back to his sisters house in a state of exaltation the intenser from his having for the previous time contained himself thinking it more decorous and considerate less invidious and less blatant not to rave sitting there in the shade of the box with his companions he had watched miriam in attentive but inexpressive silence glowing and vibrating inwardly yet for these fine deep reasons not committing himself to the spoken rapture delicacy it appeared to him should rule the hour and indeed he had never had a pleasure less alloyed than this little period of still observation and repressed ecstasy miriams art lost nothing by it and biddys mild nearness only gained this young lady was virtually mute as wellwonderingly dauntedly as if she too associated with the performer various other questions than that of her mastery of her art to this mastery biddys attitude was a candid and liberal tribute the poor girl sat quenched and pale as if in the blinding light of a comparison by which it would be presumptuous even to be annihilated her subjection however was a gratified a charmed subjection there was beneficence in such beautythe beauty of the figure that moved before the footlights and spoke in musiceven if it deprived one of hope peter didnt say to her in vulgar elation and in reference to her whimsical profession of dislike at the studio well do you find our friend so disagreeable now and she was grateful to him for his forbearance for the tacit kindness of which the idea seemed to be my poor child id prefer you if i could butjudge for yourselfhow can i expect of me only the possible expect that certainly but only that in the same degree peter liked biddys sweet hushed air of judging for herself of recognising his discretion and letting him off while she was lost in the illusion in the convincing picture of the stage miss tressilian did most of the criticism she broke out cheerfully and sonorously from time to time in reference to the actress most striking certainly or she is clever isnt she she uttered a series of propositions to which her companions found it impossible to respond miss tressilian was disappointed in nothing but their enjoyment they didnt seem to think the exhibition as amusing as she  walking away through the ordered void of lady agness quarter with the four acts of the play glowing again before him in the smokeless london night peter found the liveliest thing in his impression the certitude that if he had never seen miriam before and she had had for him none of the advantages of association he would still have recognised in her performance the richest interest the theatre had ever offered him he floated in the felicity of it in the general encouragement of a sense of the perfectly done in the almost aggressive bravery of still larger claims for an art which could so triumphantly so exquisitely render life render it he said to himself create it and reveal it rather give us something new and large and of the first order he had seen miriam now he had never seen her before he had never seen her till he saw her in her conditions oh her conditionsthere were many things to be said about them they were paltry enough as yet inferior inadequate obstructive as compared with the right full finished setting of such a talent but the essence of them was now irremovably in our young mans eyes the vision of how the uplifted stage and the listening house transformed her that idea of her having no character of her own came back to him with a force that made him laugh in the empty street this was a disadvantage she reduced so to nothing that obviously he hadnt known her till tonight her character was simply to hold you by the particular spell any otherthe good nature of home the relation to her mother her friends her lovers her debts the practice of virtues or industries or viceswas not worth speaking of these things were the fictions and shadows the representation was the deep substance  peter had as he went an intense visionhe had often had it beforeof the conditions still absent the great and complete ones those which would give the girls talent a superior a discussable stage more than ever he desired them mentally invoked them filled them out in imagination cheated himself with the idea that they were possible he saw them in a momentary illusion and confusion a great academic artistic theatre subsidised and unburdened with moneygetting rich in its repertory rich in the high quality and the wide array of its servants rich above all in the authority of an impossible administratora manager personally disinterested not an actor with an eye to the main chance pouring forth a continuity of tradition striving for perfection laying a splendid literature under contribution he saw the heroine of a hundred situations variously dramatic and vividly real he saw comedy and drama and passion and character and english life he saw all humanity and history and poetry and then perpetually in the midst of them shining out in the high relief of some great moment an image as fresh as an unveiled statue he was not unconscious that he was taking all sorts of impossibilities and miracles for granted but he was under the conviction for the time that the woman he had been watching three hours the incarnation of the serious drama would be a new and vivifying force the world was just then so bright to him that even basil dashwood struck him at first as a conceivable agent of his dream  it must be added that before miriam arrived the breeze that filled sherringhams sail began to sink a little he passed out of the eminently let drawingroom where twenty large photographs of the young actress bloomed in the desert he went into the garden by a glass door that stood open and found mr dashwood lolling on a bench and smoking cigarettes this young mans conversation was a different musicit took him down as he felt showed him very sensibly and intelligibly it must be confessed the actual theatre the one they were all concerned with the one they would have to make the miserable best of it was fortunate that he kept his intoxication mainly to himself the englishmans habit of not being effusive still prevailed with him after his years of exposure to the foreign infection nothing could have been less exclamatory than the meeting of the two men with its question or two its remark or two about the new visitors arrival in london its offhand i noticed you last night i was glad you turned up at last on one side and its attenuated oh yes it was the first time i was very much interested on the other basil dashwood played a part in yolande and peter had not failed to take with some comfort the measure of his aptitude he judged it to be of the small order as indeed the part which was neither that of the virtuous nor that of the villainous hero restricted him to two or three inconspicuous effects and three or four changes of dress he represented an ardent but respectful young lover whom the distracted heroine found time to pity a little and even to rail at but it was impressed upon his critic that he scarcely represented young love he looked very well but peter had heard him already in a hundred contemporary pieces he never got out of rehearsal he uttered sentiments and breathed vows with a nice voice with a shy boyish tremor but as if he were afraid of being chaffed for it afterwards giving the spectator in the stalls the sense of holding the promptbook and listening to a recitation he made one think of countryhouses and lawntennis and private theatricals than which there couldnt be to peters mind a range of association more disconnected from the actors art  dashwood knew all about the new thing the piece in rehearsal he knew all about everythingreceipts and salaries and expenses and newspaper articles and what old baskerville said and what mrs ruffler thought matters of superficial concern to his fellowguest who wondered before they had sight of miriam if she talked with her walkinggentleman about them by the hour deep in them and finding them not vulgar and boring but the natural air of her life and the essence of her profession of course she didshe naturally would it was all in the days work and he might feel sure she wouldnt turn up her nose at the shop he had to remind himself that he didnt care if she didnt that he would really think worse of her if she should she certainly was in deep with her bland playmate talking shop by the hour he could see this from the fellows ease of attitude the air of a man at home and doing the honours he divined a great intimacy between the two young artists but asked himself at the same time what he peter sherringham had to say about it he didnt pretend to control miriams intimacies it was to be supposed and if he had encouraged her to adopt a profession rich in opportunities for comradeship it was not for him to cry out because she had taken to it kindly he had already descried a fund of utility in mrs lovicks light brother but it irritated him all the same after a while to hear the youth represent himself as almost indispensable he was practicalthere was no doubt of that and this idea added to peters paradoxical sense that as regards the matters actually in question he himself had not this virtue dashwood had got mrs rooth the house it happened by a lucky chance that laura lumley to whom it belongedsherringham would know laura lumleywanted to get rid for a mere song of the remainder of the lease she was going to australia with a troupe of her own they just stepped into it it was good airthe best sort of london air to live in to sleep in for people of their trade peter came back to his wonder at what miriams personal relations with this deucedly knowing gentleman might be and was again able to assure himself that they might be anything in the world she liked for any stake he the familiar of the foreign office had in them dashwood told him of all the smart people who had tried to take up the new starthe way the london world had already held out its hand and perhaps it was sherringhams irritation the crushed sentiment i just mentioned that gave a little heave in the exclamation oh thatthats all rubbish the less of that the better at this mr dashwood sniffed a little rather resentful he had expected peter to be pleased with the names of the eager ladies who had calledwhich proved how low a view he took of his art our friend explainedit is to be hoped not pedanticallythat this art was serious work and that society was humbug and imbecility also that of old the great comedians wouldnt have known such people garrick had essentially his own circle  no i suppose they didnt call in the old narrowminded time said basil dashwood  your profession didnt call they had better companythat of the romantic gallant characters they represented they lived with them so it was better all round and peter asked himselffor that clearly struck the young man as a dreary periodif he only for miriam in her new life and among the futilities of those who tried to lionise her expressed the artistic idea this at least sherringham reflected was a situation that could be improved  he learned from his companion that the new play the thing they were rehearsing was an old play a romantic drama of thirty years before very frequently revived and threadbare with honourable service dashwood had a part in it but there was an act in which he didnt appear and this was the act they were doing that morning yolande had done all yolande could do the visitor was mistaken if he supposed yolande such a tremendous hit it had done very well it had run three months but they were by no means coining money with it it wouldnt take them to the end of the season they had seen for a month past that they would have to put on something else miss rooth moreover wanted a new part she was above all impatient to show her big range she had grand ideas she thought herself very goodnatured to repeat the same stuff for three months the young man lighted another cigarette and described to his listener some of miss rooths ideas he abounded in information about herabout her character her temper her peculiarities her little ways her manner of producing some of her effects he spoke with familiarity and confidence as if knowing more about her than any one elseas if he had invented or discovered her were in a sense her proprietor or guarantor it was the talk of the shop both with a native sharpness and a touching young candour the expansion of the commercial spirit when it relaxes and generalises is conscious of safety with another member of the guild  peter at any rate couldnt help protesting against the lame old warhorse it was proposed to bring into action who had been ridden to death and had saved a thousand desperate fields and he exclaimed on the strange passion of the good british public for sitting again and again through expected situations watching for speeches they had heard and surprises that struck the hour dashwood defended the taste of london praised it as loyal constant faithful to which his interlocutor retorted with some vivacity that it was faithful to sad trash he justified this sally by declaring the play in rehearsal sad trash clumsy mediocrity with all its convenience gone and that the fault was the want of life in the critical sense of the public which was ignobly docile opening its mouth for its dose like the pupils of dotheboys hall not insisting on something different on a fresh brew altogether dashwood asked him if he then wished their friend to go on playing for ever a part she had repeated more than eighty nights on end he thought the modern run was just what he had heard him denounce in paris as the disease the theatre was dying of this imputation peter quite denied wanting to know if she couldnt change to something less stale than the greatest staleness of all dashwood opined that miss rooth must have a strong part and that there happened to be one for her in the beforementioned venerable novelty she had to take what she could getshe wasnt a person to cry for the moon this was a stopgapshe would try other things later she would have to look round her you couldnt have a new piece one that would do left at your door every day with the milk on one point sherringhams mind might be at rest miss rooth was a woman who would do every blessed thing there was to do give her time and she would walk straight through the repertory she was a woman who would do thisshe was a woman who would do that her spokesman employed this phrase so often that peter nervous got up and threw an unsmoked cigarette away of course she was a woman there was no need of his saying it a hundred times  as for the repertory the young man went on the most beautiful girl in the world could give but what she had he explained after their visitor sat down again that the noise made by miss rooth was not exactly what this admirer appeared to suppose sherringham had seen the house the night before and would recognise that though good it was very far from great she had done very well it was all right but she had never gone above a point which dashwood expressed in pounds sterling to the edification of his companion who vaguely thought the figure high peter remembered that he had been unable to get a stall but dashwood insisted that miriam had not leaped into commanding fame that was a thing that never happened in factit happened only in grotesque works of fiction she had attracted notice unusual notice for a woman whose name the day before had never been heard of she was recognised as having for a novice extraordinary cleverness and confidencein addition to her looks of course which were the thing that had really fetched the crowd but she hadnt been the talk of london she had only been the talk of gabriel nash he wasnt london more was the pity he knew the esthetic peoplethe worldly semismart ones not the frumpy sickly lot who wore dirty drapery and the esthetic people had run after her mr dashwood sketchily instructed the pilgrim from paris as to the different sects in the great religion of beauty and was able to give him the particular note of the critical clique to which miriam had begun so quickly to owe it that she had a vogue the information made our friend feel very ignorant of the world very uninitiated and buried in his little professional hole dashwood warned him that it would be a long time before the general public would wake up to miss rooth even after she had waked up to herself she would have to do some really big thing first they knew it was in her the big thingpeter and he and even poor nashbecause they had seen her as no one else had but london never took any one on trustit had to be cash down it would take their young lady two or three years to pay out her cash and get her equivalent but of course the equivalent would be simply a goldmine within its limits however certainly the mark she had made was already quite a fairytale there was magic in the way she had concealed from the first her want of experience she absolutely made you think she had a lot of it more than any one else mr dashwood repeated several times that she was a cool handa deucedly cool hand and that he watched her himself saw ideas come to her saw her have different notions and more or less put them to the test on different nights she was always aliveshe liked it herself she gave him ideas long as he had been on the stage naturally she had a great deal to learn no end even of quite basic things a cosmopolite like sherringham would understand that a girl of that age who had never had a friend but her motherher mother was greater fun than ever nownaturally would have sherringham winced at being dubbed a cosmopolite by his young entertainer just as he had winced a moment before at hearing himself lumped in esoteric knowledge with dashwood and gabriel nash but the former of these gentlemen took no account of his sensibility while he enumerated a few of the elements of the basic he was a mixture of acuteness and innocent fatuity and peter had to recognise in him a rudiment or two of criticism when he said that the wonderful thing in the girl was that she learned so fastlearned something every night learned from the same old piece a lot more than any one else would have learned from twenty thats what it is to be a genius peter concurred genius is only the art of getting your experience fast of stealing it as it were and in this sense miss rooths a regular brigand dashwood condoned the subtlety and added less analytically oh shell do it was exactly in these simple words addressed to her that her other admirer had phrased the same truth yet he didnt enjoy hearing them on his neighbours lips they had a profane patronising sound and suggested displeasing equalities  the two men sat in silence for some minutes watching a fat robin hop about on the little seedy lawn at the end of which they heard a vehicle stop on the other side of the gardenwall and the voices of occupants alighting here they come the dear creatures said basil dashwood without moving and from where they sat peter saw the small door in the wall pushed open the dear creatures were three in number for a gentleman had added himself to mrs rooth and her daughter as soon as miriams eyes took in her parisian friend she fell into a large droll theatrical attitude and seizing her mothers arm exclaimed passionately look where he sits the author of all my woescold cynical cruel she was evidently in the highest spirits of which mrs rooth partook as she cried indulgently giving her a slap oh get along you gypsy  shes always up to something dashwood laughed as miriam radiant and with a conscious stage tread glided toward sherringham as if she were coming to the footlights he rose slowly from his seat looking at her and struck with her beauty he had been impatient to see her yet in the act his impatience had had a disconcerting check  he had had time to note that the man who had come in with her was gabriel nash and this recognition brought a low sigh to his lips as he held out his hand to hera sigh expressive of the sudden sense that his interest in her now could only be a gross community of course that didnt matter since he had set it at the most such rigid limits but he none the less felt vividly reminded that it would be public and notorious that inferior people would be inveterately mixed up with it that she had crossed the line and sold herself to the vulgar making him indeed only one of an equalised multitude the way nash turned up there just when he didnt want to see him proved how complicated a thing it was to have a friendship with a young woman so clearly booked for renown he quite forgot that the intruder had had this object of interest long before his own first view of it and had been present at that passage which he had in a measure brought about had sherringham not been so cut out to make trouble of this particular joy he might have found some adequate assurance that their young hostess distinguished him in the way in which taking his hand in both of hers she looked up at him and murmured dear old master then as if this were not acknowledgment enough she raised her head still higher and whimsically gratefully charmingly almost nobly kissed him on the lips before the other men before the good mother whose oh you honest creature made everything regular     xxxi   if he was ruffled by some of her conditions there was thus comfort and consolation to be drawn from others beside the essential fascinationso small the doubt of that nowof the young ladys own society he spent the afternoon they all spent the afternoon and the occasion reminded him of pages in wilhelm meister he himself could pass for wilhelm and if mrs rooth had little resemblance to mignon miriam was remarkably like philina the movable feast awaiting themluncheon tea dinnerwas delayed two or three hours but the interval was a source of gaiety for they all smoked cigarettes in the garden and miriam gave striking illustrations of the parts she was studying peter was in the state of a man whose toothache has suddenly stoppedhe was exhilarated by the cessation of pain the pain had been the effort to remain in paris after the creature in the world in whom he was most interested had gone to london and the balm of seeing her now was the measure of the previous soreness  gabriel nash had as usual plenty to say and he talked of nicks picture so long that peter wondered if he did it on purpose to vex him they went in and out of the house they made excursions to see what form the vague meal was taking and sherringham got half an hour alone or virtually alone with the mistress of his unsanctioned passiondrawing her publicly away from the others and making her sit with him in the most sequestered part of the little gravelled grounds there was summer enough for the trees to shut out the adjacent villas and basil dashwood and gabriel nash lounged together at a convenient distance while nicks whimsical friend dropped polished pebbles sometimes audibly splashing into the deep well of the histrionic simplicity miriam confessed that like all comedians they ate at queer hours she sent dashwood in for biscuits and sherryshe proposed sending him round to the grocers in the circus road for superior wine peter judged him the factotum of the little household he knew where the biscuits were kept and the state of the grocers account when he himself congratulated her on having so useful an inmate she said genially but as if the words disposed of him oh hes awfully handy to this she added youre not you know resting the kindest most pitying eyes on him the sensation they gave him was as sweet as if she had stroked his cheek and her manner was responsive even to tenderness she called him dear master again and again and still often cher maître and appeared to express gratitude and reverence by every intonation  youre doing the humble dependent now he said you do it beautifully as you do everything she replied that she didnt make it humble enoughshe couldnt she was too proud too insolent in her triumph she liked that the triumph too much and she didnt mind telling him she was perfectly happy of course as yet the triumph was very limited but success was success whatever its quantity the dish was a small one but had the right taste her imagination had already bounded beyond the first phase unexpectedly great as this had been her position struck her as modest compared with the probably future now vivid to her peter had never seen her so soft and sympathetic she had insisted in paris that her personal character was that of the good girlshe used the term in a fine loose wayand it was impossible to be a better girl than she showed herself this pleasant afternoon she was full of gossip and anecdote and drollery she had exactly the air he would have wished her to havethat of thinking of no end of things to tell him it was as if she had just returned from a long journey and had had strange adventures and made wonderful discoveries she began to speak of this and that then broke off to speak of something else she talked of the theatre of the critics and above all of london of the people she had met and the extraordinary things they said to her of the parts she was going to take up of lots of new ideas that had come to her about the art of comedy she wanted to do comedy nowto do the comedy of london life she was delighted to find that seeing more of the world suggested things to her they came straight from the fact from nature if you could call it nature she was thus convinced more than ever that the artist ought to live so as to get on with his business gathering ideas and lights from experienceought to welcome any experience that would give him lights but work of course was experience and everything in ones life that was good was work that was the jolly thing in the actors tradeit made up for other elements that were odious if you only kept your eyes open nothing could happen to you that wouldnt be food for observation and grist to your mill showing you how people looked and moved and spoke cried and grimaced writhed and dissimulated in given situations she saw all round her things she wanted to dolondon bristled with them if you had eyes to see she was fierce to know why people didnt take them up put them into plays and parts give one a chance with them she expressed her sharp impatience of the general literary bétise she had never been chary of this particular displeasure and there were momentsit was an old story and a subject of frank raillery to sherringhamwhen to hear her you might have thought there was no cleverness anywhere but in her own splendid impatience she wanted tremendous things done that she might use them but she didnt pretend to say exactly what they were to be nor even approximately how they were to be handled her ground was rather that if she only had a penit was exasperating to have to explain she mainly contented herself with the view that nothing had really been touched she felt that more and more as she saw more of peoples goingson  peter went to her theatre again that evening and indeed made no scruple of going every night for a week rather perhaps i should say he made a scruple but a high part of the pleasure of his life during these arbitrary days was to overcome it the only way to prove he could overcome it was to go and he was satisfied after he had been seven times not only with the spectacle on the stage but with his perfect independence he knew no satiety however with the spectacle on the stage which induced for him but a further curiosity miriams performance was a thing alive with a power to change to grow to develop to beget new forms of the same life peter contributed to it in his amateurish way and watched with solicitude the effect of his care and the fortune of his hints he talked it over in balaklava place suggested modifications and variations worth trying she professed herself thankful for any refreshment that could be administered to her interest in yolande and with an energy that showed large resource touched up her part and drew several new airs from it peters liberties bore on her way of uttering certain speeches the intonations that would have more beauty or make the words mean more she had her ideas or rather she had her instincts which she defended and illustrated with a vividness superior to argument by a happy pictorial phrase or a snatch of mimicry but she was always for trying she liked experiments and caught at them and she was especially thankful when some one gave her a showy reason a plausible formula in a case where she only stood on an intuition she pretended to despise reasons and to like and dislike at her sovereign pleasure but she always honoured the exotic gift so that sherringham was amused with the liberal way she produced it as if she had been a naked islander rejoicing in a present of crimson cloth  day after day he spent most of his time in her society and miss laura lumleys recent habitation became the place in london to which his thoughts and his steps were most attached he was highly conscious of his not now carrying out that principle of abstention he had brought to such maturity before leaving paris but he contented himself with a much cruder justification of this lapse than he would have thought adequate in advance it consisted simply in the idea that to be identified with the first fresh exploits of a young genius was a delightful experience what was the harm of it when the genius was real his main security was thus that his relations with miriam had been placed under the protection of that idea of approved extravagance in this department they made a very creditable figure and required much less watching and pruning than when it had been his effort to adjust them to a worldly plan he had in fine a sense of real wisdom when he pronounced it surely enough that this momentary intellectual participation in the girls dawning fame was a charming thing charming things were not frequent enough in a busy mans life to be kicked out of the way balaklava place looked at in this philosophic way became almost idyllic it gave peter the pleasantest impression he had ever had of london  the season happened to be remarkably fine the temperature was high but not so high as to keep people from the theatre miriams business visibly increased so that the question of putting on the second play underwent some revision the girl persisted showing in her persistence a temper of which peter had already caught some sharp gleams it was plain that through her career she would expect to carry things with a high hand her managers and agents wouldnt find her an easy victim or a calculable force but the public would adore her surround her with the popularity that attaches to a goodnatured and freespoken princess and her comrades would have a kindness for her because she wouldnt be selfish they too would besides representing her bodyguard form in a manner a portion of her affectionate public this was the way her friend read the signs liking her whimsical tolerance of some of her vulgar playfellows almost well enough to forgive their presence in balaklava place where they were a sore trial to her mother who wanted her to multiply her points of contact only with the higher orders there were hours when peter seemed to make out that her principal relation to the proper world would be to have within two or three years a grand battle with it resulting in its taking her should she let it have her at all absolutely on her own terms a picture which led our young man to ask himself with a helplessness that was not exempt as he perfectly knew from absurdity what part he should find himself playing in such a contest and if it would be reserved to him to be the more ridiculous as a peacemaker or as a heavy backer  she might know any one she would and the only person she appears to take any pleasure in is that dreadful miss rover mrs rooth whimpered to him more than onceleading him thus to recognise in the young lady so designated the principal complication of balaklava place miss rover was a little actress who played at miriams theatre combining with an unusual aptitude for delicate comedy a less exceptional absence of rigour in private life she was pretty and quick and brave and had a fineness that miriam professed herself already in a position to estimate as rare she had no control of her inclinations yet sometimes they were wholly laudable like the devotion she had formed for her beautiful colleague whom she admired not only as an ornament of the profession but as a being altogether of a more fortunate essence she had had an idea that real ladies were nasty but miriam was not nasty and who could gainsay that miriam was a real lady the girl justified herself to her patron from paris who had found no fault with her she knew how much her mother feared the proper world wouldnt come in if they knew that the improper in the person of pretty miss rover was on the ground what did she care who came and who didnt and what was to be gained by receiving half the snobs in london people would have to take her exactly as they found herthat they would have to learn and they would be much mistaken if they thought her capable of turning snob too for the sake of their sweet company she didnt pretend to be anything but what she meant to be the best general actress of her time and what had that to do with her seeing or not seeing a poor ignorant girl who had lovedwell she neednt say what fanny had done they had met in the way of business she didnt say she would have run after her she had liked her because she wasnt a slick and when fanny rover had asked her quite wistfully if she mightnt come and see her and like her she hadnt bristled with scandalised virtue miss rover wasnt a bit more stupid or more illnatured than any one else it would be time enough to shut the door when she should become so  peter commended even to extravagance the liberality of such comradeship said that of course a woman didnt go into that profession to see how little she could swallow she was right to live with the others so long as they were at all possible and it was for her and only for her to judge how long that might be this was rather heroic on his part for his assumed detachment from the girls personal life still left him a margin for some forms of uneasiness it would have made in his spirit a great difference for the worse that the woman he loved and for whom he wished no baser lover than himself should have embraced the prospect of consorting only with the cheaper kind it was all very well but fanny rover was simply a rank cabotine and that sort of association was an odd training for a young woman who was to have been good enoughhe couldnt forget that but kept remembering it as if it might still have a future useto be his admired wife certainly he ought to have thought of such things before he permitted himself to become so interested in a theatrical nature his heroism did him service however for the hour it helped him by the end of the week to feel quite broken in to miriams little circle what helped him most indeed was to reflect that she would get tired of a good many of its members herself in time for if it was not that they were shockingvery few of them shone with that intense lightthey could yet be thoroughly trusted in the long run to bore you  there was a lovely sunday in particular spent by him almost all in balaklava placehe arrived so earlywhen in the afternoon every sort of odd person dropped in miriam held a reception in the little garden and insisted on all the companys staying to supper her mother shed tears to peter in the desecrated house because they had accepted miriam and she an invitationand in cromwell road toofor the evening miriam had now decreed they shouldnt gothey would have so much better fun with their good friends at home she was sending off a messageit was a terrible distanceby a cabman and peter had the privilege of paying the messenger basil dashwood in another vehicle proceeded to an hotel known to him a mile away for supplementary provisions and came back with a cold ham and a dozen of champagne it was all very bohemian and dishevelled and delightful very supposedly droll and enviable to outsiders and miriam told anecdotes and gave imitations of the people she would have met if she had gone out so that no one had a sense of lossthe two occasions were fantastically united mrs rooth drank champagne for consolation though the consolation was imperfect when she remembered she might have drunk it though not quite so much perhaps in cromwell road  taken in connection with the evening before the day formed for our friend the most complete exhibition of his young woman he had yet enjoyed he had been at the theatre to which the saturday night happened to have brought the very fullest house she had played to and he came early to balaklava place to tell her once againhe had told her halfadozen times the evening beforethat with the excitement of her biggest audience she had surpassed herself acted with remarkable intensity it pleased her to hear this and the spirit with which she interpreted the signs of the future and during an hour he spent alone with her mrs rooth being upstairs and basil dashwood luckily absent treated him to twenty specimens of feigned passion and character was beyond any natural abundance he had yet seen in a woman the impression could scarcely have been other if she had been playing wild snatches to him at the piano the bright updarting flame of her talk rose and fell like an improvisation on the keys later the rest of the day he could as little miss the good grace with which she fraternised with her visitors finding always the fair word for eachthe key to a common ease the right turn to keep vanity quiet and make humility brave it was a wonderful expenditure of generous nervous life but what he read in it above all was the sense of success in youth with the future loose and big and the action of that charm on the faculties miriams limited past had yet pinched her enough to make emancipation sweet and the emancipation had come at last in an hour she had stepped into her magic shoes divined and appropriated everything they could help her to become in a day a really original contemporary he was of course not less conscious of that than nick dormer had been when in the cold light of his studio this more detached observer saw too how she had altered  but the great thing to his mind and during these first days the irresistible seduction of the theatre was that she was a rare revelation of beauty beauty was the principle of everything she did and of the way she unerringly did itan exquisite harmony of line and motion and attitude and tone what was at once most general and most special in her performance accidents and instincts played together to this end and constituted something that was independent of her talent or of her merit in a given case and which as a value to peters imagination was far superior to any merit and any talent he could but call it a felicity and an importance incalculable and but know that it connected itself with universal values to see this force in operation to sit within its radius and feel it shift and revolve and change and never fail was a corrective to the depression the humiliation the bewilderment of life it transported our troubled friend from the vulgar hour and the ugly fact drew him to something that had no warrant but its sweetness no name nor place save as the pure the remote the antique it was what most made him say to himself oh hang it what does it matter when he reflected that an homme sérieux as they said in paris rather gave himself away as they said in america by going every night to the same sordid stall at which all the world might stare it was what kept him from doing anything but hover round miriamkept him from paying any other visits from attending to any business from going back to calcutta gardens it was a spell he shrank intensely from breaking and the cause of a hundred postponements confusions and absurdities it put him in a false position altogether but it made of the crooked little stucco villa in saint johns wood a place in the upper air commanding the prospect a nest of winged liberties and ironies far aloft above the huddled town one should live at altitudes when one couldthey braced and simplified and for a happy interval he never touched the earth  it was not that there were no influences tending at moments to drag him downan abasement from which he escaped only because he was up so high we have seen that basil dashwood could affect him at times as a chunk of wood tied to his anklethis through the circumstance that he made miriams famous conditions those of the public exhibition of her genius seem small and prosaic so that peter had to remind himself how much this smallness was perhaps involved in their being at all she carried his imagination off into infinite spaces whereas she carried dashwoods only into the boxoffice and the revival of plays that were barbarously bad the worst was its being so open to him to see that a sharp young man really in the business might know better than he another vessel of superior knowledgehe talked that is as if he knew better than any onewas gabriel nash who lacked no leisure for hatefully haunting balaklava place or in other words appeared to enjoy the same command of his time as peter sherringham the pilgrim from paris regarded him with mingled feelings for he had not forgotten the contentious character of their first meeting or the degree to which he had been moved to urge upon nick dormers consideration that his talkative friend was probably one of the most eminent of asses this personage turned up now as an admirer of the charming creature he had scoffed at and there was much to exasperate in the smooth gloss of his inconsistency at which he never cast an embarrassed glance he practised indeed such loose license of regard to every question that it was difficult in vulgar parlance to have him his sympathies hummed about like bees in a garden with no visible plan no economy in their flight he thought meanly of the modern theatre and yet had discovered a fund of satisfaction in the most promising of its exponents and peter could more than once but say to him that he should really to keep his opinions at all in hand attach more value to the stage or less to the interesting a tress miriam took her perfect ease at his expense and treated him as the most abject of her slaves all of which was worth seeing as an exhibition on nashs part of the beautifully imperturbable when peter all too grossly pronounced him damned impudent he always felt guilty later on of an injusticenash had so little the air of a man with something to gain he was aware nevertheless of a certain itching in his boottoe when his fellowvisitor brought out and for the most part to miriam herself in answer to any charge of tergiversation oh its all right its the voice you knowthe enchanting voice nash meant by this as indeed he more fully set forth that he came to the theatre or to the villa simply to treat his ear to the soundthe richest then to be heard on earth as he maintainedissuing from miriams lips its richness was quite independent of the words she might pronounce or the poor fable they might subserve and if the pleasure of hearing her in public was the greater by reason of the larger volume of her utterance it was still highly agreeable to see her at home for it was there the strictly mimetic gift he freely conceded to her came out most he spoke as if she had been formed by the bounty of nature to be his particular recreation and as if being an expert in innocent joys he took his pleasure wherever he found it  he was perpetually in the field sociable amiable communicative inveterately contradicted but never confounded ready to talk to any one about anything and making disagreementof which he left the responsibility wholly to othersa basis of harmony every one knew what he thought of the theatrical profession and yet who could say he didnt regard its members as embodiments of comedy when he touched with such a hand the spring of their foiblestouched it with an art that made even peter laugh notwithstanding his attitude of reserve where this interloper was concerned at any rate though he had committed himself as to their general fatuity he put up with their company for the sake of miriams vocal vibrations with a practical philosophy that was all his own and she frankly took him for her supreme her incorrigible adorer masquerading as a critic to save his vanity and tolerated for his secret constancy in spite of being a bore he was meanwhile really not a bore to peter who failed of the luxury of being able to regard him as one he had seen too many strange countries and curious things observed and explored too much to be void of illustration peter had a sense that if he himself was in the grandes espaces gabriel had probably as a finer critic a still wider range if among miriams associates mr dashwood dragged him down the other main sharer of his privilege challenged him rather to higher and more fantastic flights if he saw the girl in larger relations than the young actor who mainly saw her in illwritten parts nash went a step further and regarded her irresponsibly and sublimely as a priestess of harmony a figure with which the vulgar ideas of success and failure had nothing to do he laughed at her parts holding that without them she would still be great peter envied him his power to content himself with the pleasures he could get peter had a shrewd impression that contentment wouldnt be the final sweetener of his own repast  above all nash held his attention by a constant element of easy reference to nick dormer who as we know had suddenly become much more interesting to his kinsman peter found food for observation and in some measure for perplexity in the relations of all these clever people with each other he knew why his sister who had a personal impatience of unapplied ideas had not been agreeably affected by miriams prime patron and had not felt happy about the attribution of value to such people by the man she was to marry this was a side on which he had no desire to resemble julia for he needed no teaching to divine that nash must have found her accessible to no lightnone even about himself he peter would have been sorry to have to confess he couldnt more or less understand him he understood furthermore that miriam in nicks studio might very well have appeared to julia a formidable force she was younger and would have seen nothing but she had quite as much her own resources and was beautiful enough to have made nick compare her with the lady of harsh even if he had been in love with that benefactressa pretension as to which her brother as we know entertained doubts  peter at all events saw for many days nothing of his cousin though it might have been said that nick participated by implication at least in the life of balaklava place had he given julia tangible grounds and was his unexpectedly fine rendering of miriam an act of virtual infidelity in that case to what degree was the girl to be regarded as an accomplice in his defection and what was the real nature of miriams esteem for her new and as he might be called distinguished ally these questions would have given peter still more to think about had he not flattered himself he had made up his mind that they concerned nick and his sitter herself infinitely more than they concerned any one else that young lady meanwhile was personally before him so that he had no need to consult for his pleasure his fresh recollection of the portrait but he thought of this striking production each time he thought of his so goodlooking kinsmans variety of range and that happened often for in his hearing miriam often discussed the happy artist and his possibilities with gabriel nash and nash broke out about them to all who might hear her own tone on the subject was uniform she kept it on record to a degree slightly irritating that mr dormer had been unforgettablypeter particularly noted unforgettablykind to her she never mentioned julias irruption to julias brother she only referred to the portrait with inscrutable amenity as a direct consequence of this gentlemans fortunate suggestion that first day at madame carrés nash showed however such a disposition to dwell sociably and luminously on the peculiarly interesting character of what he called dormers predicament and on the fine suspense it was fitted to kindle in the breast of the truly discerning that peter wondered as i have already hinted if this insistence were not a subtle perversity a devilish little invention to torment a man whose jealousy was presumable yet his fellowpilgrim struck him as on the whole but scantly devilish and as still less occupied with the prefigurement of so plain a mans emotions indeed he threw a glamour of romance over nick tossed off toward him such illuminating yet mystifying references that they operated quite as a bait to curiosity invested with amusement the view of the possible any wish to follow out the chain of events he learned from gabriel that nick was still away and he then felt he could almost submit to instruction to initiation the loose charm of these days was troubled howeverit ceased to be idyllicwhen late on the evening of the second sunday he walked away with nash southward from saint johns wood for then something came out     book six     xxxii   it mattered not so much what the doctors thoughtand sir matthew hope the greatest of them all had been down twice in one weekas that mr chayter the omniscient butler declared with all the authority of his position and his experience that mr carteret was very bad indeed nick dormer had a long talk with himit lasted six minutesthe day he hurried to beauclere in response to a telegram it was mr chayter who had taken upon himself to telegraph in spite of the presence in the house of mr carterets nearest relation and only surviving sister mrs lendon this lady a large mild healthy woman with a heavy tread a person who preferred early breakfasts uncomfortable chairs and the advertisementsheet of the times had arrived the week before and was awaiting the turn of events she was a widow and occupied in cornwall a house nine miles from a station which had to make up for this inconvenience as she had once told nick a fine old herbaceous garden she was extremely fond of an herbaceous gardenher main consciousness was of herbaceous possibilities nick had often seen hershe had always come to beauclere once or twice a year her sojourn there made no great difference she was only an urania dear for mr carteret to look across the table at when on the close of dinner it was time for her to retire she went out of the room always as if it were after some one else and on the gentlemens joining her laterthe junction was not very closeshe received them with an air of gratified surprise  chayter honoured nick with a regard which approached though not improperly competing with it the affection his master had placed on the same young head and chayter knew a good many things among them he knew his place but it was wonderful how little that knowledge had rendered him inaccessible to other kinds he took upon himself to send for nick without speaking to mrs lendon whose influence was now a good deal like that of some large occasional piece of furniture introduced on a contingency she was one of the solid conveniences that a comfortable house would have but you couldnt talk with a mahogany sofa or a folding screen chayter knew how much she had had from her brother and how much her two daughters had each received on marriage and he was of the opinion that it was quite enough especially considering the society in which theyyou could scarcely call itmoved he knew beyond this that they would all have more and that was why he hesitated little about communicating with nick if mrs lendon should be ruffled at the intrusion of a young man who neither was the child of a cousin nor had been formally adopted chayter was parliamentary enough to see that the forms of debate were observed he had indeed a slightly compassionate sense that mrs lendon was not easily ruffled she was always down an extraordinary time before breakfastchayter refused to take it as in the least admonitorybut usually went straight into the garden as if to see that none of the plants had been stolen in the night and had in the end to be looked for by the footman in some outoftheway spot behind the shrubbery where plumped upon the ground she was mostly doing something rum to a flower  mr carteret himself had expressed no wishes he slept most of the timehis failure at the last had been sudden but he was rheumatic and seventysevenand the situation was in chayters hands sir matthew hope had opined even on a second visit that he would rally and go on in rudimentary comfort some time longer but chayter took a different and a still more intimate view nick was embarrassed he scarcely knew what he was there for from the moment he could give his good old friend no conscious satisfaction the doctors the nurses the servants mrs lendon and above all the settled equilibrium of the square thick house where an immutable order appeared to slant through the polished windows and tinkle in the quieter bells all these things represented best the kind of supreme solace to which the master was most accessible  it was judged best that for the first day nick should not be introduced into the darkened room this was the decision of the two decorous nurses of whom the visitor had had a glimpse and who with their black uniforms and fresh faces of business suggested the barmaid emulating the nun he was depressed and restless felt himself in a false position and thought it lucky mrs lendon had powers of placid acceptance they were old acquaintances she treated him formally anxiously but it was not the rigour of mistrust it was much more an expression of remote cornish respect for young abilities and distinguished connexions inasmuch as she asked him rather yearningly about lady agnes and about lady flora and lady elizabeth he knew she was kind and ungrudging and his main regret was for his meagre knowledge and poor responses in regard to his large blank aunts he sat in the garden with newspapers and looked at the lowered blinds in mr carterets windows he wandered round the abbey with cigarettes and lightened his tread and felt grave wishing everything might be over he would have liked much to see mr carteret again but had no desire that mr carteret should see him in the evening he dined with mrs lendon and she talked to him at his request and as much as she could about her brothers early years his beginnings of life she was so much younger that they appeared to have been rather a tradition of her own youth but her talk made nick feel how tremendously different mr carteret had been at that period from what he nick was today he had published at the age of thirty a little volume thought at the time wonderfully clever called the incidence of rates but nick had not yet collected the material for any such treatise after dinner mrs lendon who was in merciless full dress retired to the drawingroom where at the end of ten minutes she was followed by nick who had remained behind only because he thought chayter would expect it mrs lendon almost shook hands with him again and then chayter brought in coffee almost in no time afterwards he brought in tea and the occupants of the drawingroom sat for a slow halfhour during which the lady looked round at the apartment with a sigh and said dont you think poor charles had exquisite taste  fortunately the local man was at this moment ushered in he had been upstairs and he smiled himself in with the remark its quite wonderful quite wonderful what was wonderful was a marked improvement in the breathing a distinct indication of revival the doctor had some tea and chatted for a quarter of an hour in a way that showed what a good manner and how large an experience a local man could have when he retired nick walked out with him the doctors house was near by and he had come on foot he left the visitor with the assurance that in all probability mr carteret who was certainly picking up would be able to see him on the morrow our young man turned his steps again to the abbey and took a stroll about it in the starlight it never looked so huge as when it reared itself into the night and nick had never felt more fond of it than on this occasion more comforted and confirmed by its beauty when he came back he was readmitted by chayter who surveyed him in respectful deprecation of the frivolity which had led him to attempt to help himself through such an evening in such a way  he went to bed early and slept badly which was unusual with him but it was a pleasure to him to be told almost as soon as he appeared that mr carteret had asked for him he went in to see him and was struck with the change in his appearance he had however spent a day with him just after the new year and another at the beginning of march and had then noted in him the menace of the final weakness a week after julia dallows departure for the continent he had again devoted several hours to the place and to the intention of telling his old friend how the happy event had been brought to naughtthe advantage he had been so good as to desire for him and to make the condition of a splendid gift before this for a few days he had been keeping back to announce it personally the good news that julia had at last set their situation in order he wanted to enjoy the old mans pleasureso sore a trial had her arbitrary behaviour been for a year if she had offered mr carteret a conciliatory visit before christmas had come down from london one day to lunch with him this had but contributed to make him subsequently exhibit to poor nick as the victim of her elegant perversity a great deal of earnest commiseration in a jocose form upon his honour as he said she was as clever and specious a womanthis was his odd expressionas he had ever seen in his life the merit of her behaviour on that occasion as nick knew was that she had not been specious at her lovers expense she had breathed no doubt of his public purpose and had had the strange grace to say that in truth she was older than he so that it was only fair to give his affections time to mature but when nick saw their hopeful host after the rupture at which we have been present he found him in no state to deal with worries he was seriously ailing it was the beginning of worse things and not a time to put his attention to the stretch after this excursion nick had gone back to town saddened by his patients now unmistakably settled decline but rather relieved that he had had himself to make no confession it had even occurred to him that the need for making one at all might never come up certainly it wouldnt if the ebb of mr carterets strength should continue unchecked he might pass away in the persuasion that everything would happen as he wished it though indeed without enriching nick on his weddingday to the tune he had promised very likely he had made legal arrangements in virtue of which his bounty would take effect in case of the right event and in that case alone at present nick had a bigger an uglier truth to tellthe last three days had made the difference but oddly enough though his responsibility had increased his reluctance to speak had vanished he was positively eager to clear up a situation over which it was not consistent with his honour to leave a shade  the doctor had been right on coming in after dinner it was clear in the morning that they had not seen the last of mr carterets power of picking up chayter who had waited on him refused austerely to change his opinion with every change in his masters temperature but the nurses took the cheering view that it would do their charge good for mr dormer to sit with him a little one of them remained in the room in the deep windowseat and nick spent twenty minutes by the bedside it was not a case for much conversation but his helpless host seemed still to like to look at him there was life in his kind old eyes a stir of something that would express itself yet in some further wise provision he laid his liberal hand on nicks with a confidence that showed how little it was really disabled he said very little and the nurse had recommended that the visitor himself should not overflow in speech but from time to time he murmured with a faint smile tonights division you knowyou mustnt miss it there was probably to be no division that night as happened but even mr carterets aberrations were parliamentary before nick withdrew he had been able to assure him he was rapidly getting better and that such valuable hours the young mans own mustnt be wasted come back on friday if they come to the second reading these were the words with which nick was dismissed and at noon the doctor said the invalid was doing very well but that nick had better leave him quiet for that day our young man accordingly determined to go up to town for the night and even should he receive no summons for the next day he arranged with chayter that he should be telegraphed to if mr carteret were either better or worse  oh he cant very well be worse sir chayter replied inexorably but he relaxed so far as to remark that of course it wouldnt do for nick to neglect the house  oh the housenick was ambiguous and avoided the butlers eye it would be easy enough to tell mr carteret but nothing would have sustained him in the effort to make a clean breast to chayter  he might equivocate about the house but he had the sense of things to be done awaiting him in london he telegraphed to his servant and spent that night in rosedale road the things to be done were apparently to be done in his studio his servant met him there with a large bundle of letters he failed that evening to stray within two miles of westminster and the legislature of his country reassembled without his support the next morning he received a telegram from chayter to whom he had given rosedale road as an address this missive simply informed him that mr carteret wished to see him it seemed a sign that he was better though chayter wouldnt say so nick again accordingly took his place in the train to beauclere he had been there very often but it was present to him that now after a little he should go only once morefor a particular dismal occasion all that was over everything that belonged to it was over he learned on his arrivalhe saw mrs lendon immediatelythat his old friend had continued to pick up he had expressed a strong and a perfectly rational desire to talk with his expected visitor and the doctor had said that if it was about anything important they should forbear to oppose him he says its about something very important mrs lendon remarked resting shy eyes on him while she added that she herself was now sitting with her dear brother she had sent those wonderful young ladies out to see the abbey nick paused with her outside mr carterets door he wanted to say something rather intimate and all soothing to her in return for her homely charitygive her a hint for which she was far from looking that practically he had now no interest in her brothers estate this was of course impossible her lack of irony of play of mind gave him no pretext and such a reference would be an insult to her simple discretion she was either not thinking of his interest at all or was thinking of it with the tolerance of a nature trained to a hundred decent submissions nick looked a little into her mild uninvestigating eyes and it came over him supremely that the goodness of these people was singularly pure they were a part of what was cleanest and sanest and dullest in humanity there had been just a little mocking inflexion in mrs lendons pleasant voice but it was dedicated to the young ladies in the black uniformsshe could perhaps be humorous about themand not to the theory of the importance of nicks interview with her brother his arrested desire to let her know he was not greedy translated itself into a vague friendliness and into the abrupt rather bewildering words i cant tell you half the good i think of you as he passed into mr carterets room it occurred to him that she would perhaps interpret this speech as an acknowledgment of obligationof her good nature in not keeping him away from the rich old man     xxxiii   the rich old man was propped up on pillows and in this attitude beneath the high spare canopy of his bed presented himself to nicks pictureseeking vision as a figure in a clever composition or a story he had gathered strength though this strength was not much in his voice it was mainly in his brighter eyes and his air of being pleased with himself he put out his hand and said i daresay you know why i sent for you on which nick sank into the seat he had occupied the day before replying that he had been delighted to come whatever the reason mr carteret said nothing more about the division or the second reading he only murmured that they were keeping the newspapers for him im rather behindim rather behind he went on but two or three quiet mornings will make it all right you can go back tonight you knowyou can easily go back this was the only thing not quite straight that nick found in himhis making light of his young friends flying to and fro the young friend sat looking at him with a sense that was half compunction and half the idea of the rare beauty of his face to which strangely the waste of illness now seemed to have restored something of its youth mr carteret was evidently conscious that this morning he shouldnt be able to go on long so that he must be practical and concise i daresay you knowyouve only to remember he continued  i neednt tell you what a pleasure it is to me to see youthere can be no better reason than that was what nick could say  hasnt the year come roundthe year of that foolish arrangement  nick thought a little asking himself if it were really necessary to disturb his companions earnest faith then the consciousness of the falsity of his own position surged over him again and he replied do you mean the period for which mrs dallow insisted on keeping me dangling oh thats over he almost gaily brought out  and are you marriedhas it come off the old man asked eagerly how long have i been ill  were uncomfortable unreasonable people not deserving of your interest were not married nick said  then i havent been ill so long his host quavered with vague relief  not very longbut things are different he went on  the old mans eyes rested on hishe noted how much larger they appeared you mean the arrangements are madethe days at hand  there are no arrangements nick smiled but why should it trouble you  what then will you dowithout arrangements the inquiry was plaintive and childlike  we shall do nothingtheres nothing to be done were not to be marriedits all off said poor nick then he added mrs dallow has gone abroad  the old man motionless among his pillows gave a long groan ah i dont like that  no more do i sir  whats the matter it was so goodso good  it wasnt good enough for julia nick declared  for julia is julia so great as that she told me she had the greatest regard for you youre good enough for the best my dear boy mr carteret pursued  you dont know me i am disappointing she had i believe a great regard for me but ive forfeited her good opinion  the old man stared at this cynical announcement he searched his visitors face for some attenuation of the words but nick apparently struck him as unashamed and a faint colour coming into his withered cheek indicated his mystification and alarm have you been unfaithful to her he still considerately asked  she thinks soit comes to the same thing as i told you a year ago she doesnt believe in me  you ought to have made heryou ought to have made her said mr carteret nick was about to plead some reason when he continued do you remember what i told you id give you if you did do you remember what i told you id give you on your weddingday  you expressed the most generous intentions and i remember them as much as a man may do who has no wish to remind you of them  the moneys thereive put it aside  i havent earned iti havent earned a penny of it give it to those who deserve it more said nick  i dont understand i dont understand mr carteret whimpered the tears of weakness in his eyes his face flushed and he added im not good for much discussion im very much disappointed  i think i may say its not my faultive done what i can nick declared  but when people are in love they do more than that  oh its all over said our young man not caring much now for the moment how disconcerted his companion might be so long as he disabused him of the idea that they were partners to a bargain weve tormented each other and weve tormented youand thats all that has come of it  his companions eyes seemed to stare at strange things dont you care for what id have done for youshouldnt you have liked it  of course one likes kindnessone likes money but its all over nick repeated then he added i fatigue you i knock you up with telling you these troubles i only do so because it seems to me right you should know but dont be worriedeverythings for the best  he patted the pale hand reassuringly inclined himself affectionately but mr carteret was not easily soothed he had practised lucidity all his life had expected it of others and had never given his assent to an indistinct proposition he was weak yet not too weak to recognise that he had formed a calculation now vitiated by a wrong factorput his name to a contract of which the other side had not been carried out more than fifty years of conscious success pressed him to try to understand he had never muddled his affairs and he couldnt muddle them now at the same time he was aware of the necessity of economising his effort and he would gather that inward force patiently and almost cunningly for the right question and the right induction he was still able to make his agitation reflective and it could still consort with his high hopes of nick that he should find himself regarding mere vague verbal comfort words in the air as an inadequate guarantee so after he had attached his dim vision to his young friends face a moment he brought out have you done anything bad  nothing worse than usual nick laughed  ah everything should have been better than usual  well it hasnt been thatthat i must say  do you sometimes think of your father mr carteret continued  nick had a decent pause you make me think of himyouve always that pleasant effect  his name would have livedit mustnt be lost  yes but the competition today is terrible nick returned  his host considered this as if he found a serious flaw in it after which he began again i never supposed you a trifler  im determined not to be  i thought her charming dont you love mrs dallow mr carteret profoundly asked  dont put it to me so today for i feel sore and injured i dont think she has treated me well  you should have held heryou shouldnt have let her go the old man returned with unexpected fire  his visitor flushed at this so strange was it to receive a lesson in energy from a dying octogenarian yet after an instant nick answered with due modesty i havent been clever enough no doubt  dont say that dont say that mr carteret shrunk from the thought dont think i can allow you any easingoff of that sort i know how well youve done youre taking your place several gentlemen have told me hasnt she felt a scruple knowing my settlement on you to depend he pursued  oh she hasnt knownhasnt known anything about it  i dont understand though i think you explained somewhat a year agothe poor gentleman gave it up i think she wanted to speak to meof any intentions i might have in regard to youthe day she was here very nicely very properly shed have done it im sure i think her idea was that i ought to make any settlement quite independent of your marrying her or not marrying her but i tried to convey to heri dont know whether she understood methat i liked her too much for that i wanted too much to make sure of her  to make sure of me you mean said nick and now after all you see you havent  well perhaps it was that sighed the old man confusedly  all this is very bad for youwell talk again nick urged  no nolet us finish it now i like to know what im doing i shall rest better when i do know there are great things to be done the future will be fullthe future will be fine mr carteret wandered  let me be distinct about this for julia that if we hadnt been sundered her generosity to me would have been completeshed have put her great fortune absolutely at my disposal nick said after a moment her consciousness of all that naturally carries her over any particular distress in regard to what wont come to me now from another source  ah dont lose it the old man painfully pleaded  its in your hands sir nick returned  i mean mrs dallows fortune it will be of the highest utility that was what your father missed  i shall miss more than my father did said nick  shell come back to youi cant look at you and doubt that  nick smiled with a slow headshake never never never you look at me my grand old friend but you dont see me im not what you think  what is itwhat is it have you been bad mr carteret panted  no no im not bad but im different  different  different from my father different from mrs dallow different from you  ah why do you perplex me the old man moaned youve done something  i dont want to perplex you but i have done something said nick getting up  he had heard the door open softly behind him and mrs lendon come forward with precautions what has he donewhat has he done quavered mr carteret to his sister she however after a glance at the patient motioned their young friend away and bending over the bed replied in a voice expressive at that moment of an ample provision of vital comfort  he has only excited you im afraid a little more than is good for you isnt your dear old head a little too high nick regarded himself as justly banished and he quitted the room with a ready acquiescence in any power to carry on the scene of which mrs lendon might find herself possessed he felt distinctly brutal as he heard his host emit a weak exhalation of assent to some change of position but he would have reproached himself more if he had wished less to guard against the acceptance of an equivalent for duties unperformed mr carteret had had in his mind characteristically the idea of a fine high contract and there was something more to be said about that  nick went out of the house and stayed away for two or three hours quite ready to regard the place as quieter and safer without him he haunted the abbey as usual and sat a long time in its simplifying stillness turning over many things he came back again at the luncheonhour through the garden and heard somewhat to his surprise and greatly to his relief that his host had composed himself promptly enough after their agitating interview mrs lendon talked at luncheon much as if she expected her brother to be as she said really quite fit again she asked nick no awkward question which was uncommonly good of her he thought considering that she might have said what in the world were you trying to get out of him she only reported to our young man that the invalid had every hope of a short interview about halfpast seven a very short one this gentle emphasis was mrs lendons single tribute to the critical spirit nick divined that mr carterets desire for further explanations was really strong and had been capable of sustaining him through a bad morning capable even of helping himit would have been a secret and wonderful momentary conquest of weaknessto pass it off for a good one he wished he might make a sketch of him from the life as he had seen him after breakfast he had a conviction he could make a strong one which would be a precious memento but he shrank from proposing thisthe dear man might think it unparliamentary the doctor had called while nick was out and he came again at five oclock without that inmates seeing him the latter was busy in his room at that hour he wrote a short letter which took him a long time but apparently there had been no veto on a resumption of talk for at halfpast seven his friend sent for him the nurse at the door said only a moment i hope sir but took him in and then withdrew  the prolonged daylight was in the room and its occupant again established on his pile of pillows but with his head a little lower nick sat down by him and expressed the hope of not having upset him in the morning but the old man with fixed enlarged eyes took up their conversation exactly where they had left it what have you donewhat have you done have you associated yourself with some other woman  no no i dont think she can accuse me of that  well then shell come back to you if you take the right way with her  it might have been droll to hear the poor gentleman in his situation give his views on the right way with women but nick was not moved to enjoy that diversion ive taken the wrong way ive done something that must spoil my prospects in that direction for ever ive written a letter the visitor went on but his companion had already interrupted him  youve written a letter  to my constituents informing them of my determination to resign my seat  to resign your seat  ive made up my mind after no end of reflexion dear mr carteret to work on quite other lines ive a plan of becoming a painter so ive given up the idea of a political life  a painter mr carteret seemed to turn whiter im going in for the portrait in oils it sounds absurd i know and im thus specific only to show you i dont in the least expect you to count on me the invalid had continued to stare at first then his eyes slowly closed and he lay motionless and blank dont let it trouble you now its a long story and rather a poor one when you get better ill tell you all about it well talk it over amicably and ill bring you to my view nick went on hypocritically he had laid his hand again on the hand beside him it felt cold and as the old man remained silent he had a moment of exaggerated fear  this is dreadful newsand mr carteret opened his eyes  certainly it must seem so to you for ive always kept from youi was ashamed and my present confusion is a just chastisementthe great interest i have always taken in the but nick broke down with a gasp to add presently with an intention of the pleasant and a sense of the foolish in the pencil and the brush he spoke of his current confusion though his manner might have been thought to show it but little he was himself surprised at his brazen assurance and had to recognise that at the point things had come to now he was profoundly obstinate and quiet  the pencilthe brush theyre not the weapons of a gentleman mr carteret pronounced  i was sure that would be your feeling i repeat that i mention them only because you once said you intended to do something for me as the phrase is and i thought you oughtnt to do it in ignorance  my ignorance was better such knowledge isnt good for me  forgive me my dear old friend nick kept it bravely up when youre better youll see it differently  i shall never be better now  ah no nick insisted it will really do you good after a little think it over quietly and youll be glad ive stopped humbugging  i loved youi loved you as my son the old man wailed  he sank on his knee beside the bed and leaned over him tenderly get better get better and ill be your son for the rest of your life  poor dormerpoor dormer mr carteret continued to lament  i admit that if he had lived i probably shouldnt have done it said nick i daresay i should have deferred to his prejudices even though thinking them narrow  do you turn against your father his host asked making to disengage his arm from the young mans touch an effort betraying the irritation of conscious weakness nick got up at this and stood a moment looking down at him while he went on do you give up your name do you give up your country  if i do something good my country may like it nick spoke as if he had thought that out  do you regard them as equal the two glories  here comes your nurse to blow me up and turn me out said nick  the nurse had come in but mr carteret directed to her an audible dry courteous be so good as to wait till i send for you which arrested her in the large room at some distance from the bed and then had the effect of making her turn on her heel with a professional laugh she clearly judged that an old gentleman with the fine manner of his prime might still be trusted to take care of himself when she had gone that personage addressed to his visitor the question for which his deep displeasure lent him strength do you pretend theres a nobler life than a high political career  i think the noble lifes doing ones work well one can do it very ill and be very base and mean in what you call a high political career i havent been in the house so many months without finding that out it contains some very small souls  you should stand against themyou should expose them stammered mr carteret  stand against them against ones own party  the old man contended a moment with this and then broke out god forgive you are you a tory are you a tory  how little you understand me laughed nick with a ring of bitterness  little enoughlittle enough my boy have you sent your electors your dreadful letter  not yet but its all ready and i shant change my mind  you willyou will youll think better of it youll see your duty said the invalid almost coaxingly  that seems very improbable for my determination crudely and abruptly as to my great regret it comes to you here is the fruit of a long and painful struggle the difficulty is that i see my duty just in this other effort  an effort do you call it an effort to fall away to sink far down to give up every effort what does your mother say heaven help her mr carteret went on before nick could answer the other question  i havent told her yet  youre ashamed youre ashamed nick only looked out of the west window nowhe felt his ears turn hot tell her it would have been sixty thousand i had the money all ready  i shant tell her that said nick redder still  poor womanpoor dear woman mr carteret woefully cried  yes indeedshe wont like it  think it all over again dont throw away a splendid future these words were uttered with a final flicker of passionnick had never heard such an accent on his old friends lips but he next began to murmur im tiredim very tired and sank back with a groan and with closed lips his guest gently assured him that he had but too much cause to be exhausted and that the worst was over now he smoothed his pillows for him and said he must leave him would send in the nurse come back come back mr carteret pleaded against that come back and tell me its a horrible dream  nick did go back very late that evening his host had sent a message to his room but one of the nurses was on the ground this time and made good her opposition watch in hand the sickroom was shrouded and darkened the shaded candle left the bed in gloom nicks interview with his venerable friend was the affair of but a moment the nurse interposed impatient and not understanding she heard nick say that he had posted his letter now and their companion flash out with an acerbity still savouring of the sordid associations of a world he had not done with then of course my settlement doesnt take effect  oh thats all right nick answered kindly and he went off next morning by the early trainhis injured host was still sleeping mrs lendons habits made it easy for her to be present in matutinal bloom at the young mans hasty breakfast and she sent a particular remembrance to lady agnes and when he should see them to the ladies flora and elizabeth nick had a prevision of the spirit in which his mother at least would now receive hollow compliments from beauclere  the night before as soon as he had quitted mr carteret the old man said to the nurse that he wished mr chayter instructed to go and fetch mr mitton the first thing in the morning mr mitton was the leading solicitor at beauclere     xxxiv   the really formidable thing for nick had been to tell his mother a truth of which he was so conscious that he had the matter out with her the very morning he returned from beauclere she and grace had come back the afternoon before from their own enjoyment of rural hospitality and knowing thisshe had written him her intention from the countryhe drove straight from the station to calcutta gardens there was a little room on the right of the housedoor known as his own room but in which of a morning when he was not at home lady agnes sometimes wrote her letters these were always numerous and when she heard our young mans cab she happened to be engaged with them at the big brassmounted bureau that had belonged to his father where amid a margin of works of political reference she seemed to herself to make public affairs feel the point of her elbow  she came into the hall to meet her son and to hear about their benefactor and nick went straight back into the room with her and closed the door it would be in the evening paper and she would see it and he had no right to allow her to wait for that it proved indeed a terrible hour and when ten minutes later grace who had learned upstairs her brothers return went down for further news of him she heard from the hall a sound of voices that made her first pause and then retrace her steps on tiptoe she mounted to the drawingroom and crept about there palpitating looking at moments into the dull street and wondering what on earth had taken place she had no one to express her wonder to for florence tressilian had departed and biddy after breakfast betaken herself in accordance with a custom now inveterate to rosedale road her mother was unmistakably and passionately cryinga fact tremendous in its significance for lady agnes had not often been brought so low nick had seen her cry but this almost awful spectacle had seldom been offered to grace and it now convinced her that some dreadful thing had happened  that was of course in order after nicks mysterious quarrel with julia which had made his mother so ill and was at present followed up with new horrors the row as grace mentally phrased it had had something to do with the rupture of the loverssome deeper depth of disappointment had begun to yawn grace asked herself if they were talking about broadwood if nick had demanded that in the conditions so unpleasantly altered lady agnes should restore that awfully nice house to its owner this was very possible but why should he so suddenly have broken out about it and moreover their mother though sore to bleeding about the whole businessfor broadwood in its fresh comfort was too delightfulwouldnt have met this pretension with tears hadnt she already so perversely declared that they couldnt decently continue to make use of the place julia had said that of course they must go on but lady agnes was prepared with an effective rejoinder to that it didnt consist of wordsit was to be austerely practical was to consist of letting julia see at the moment she should least expect it that they quite wouldnt go on lady agnes was ostensibly waiting for this momentthe moment when her renunciation would be most impressive  grace was conscious of how she had for many days been moving with her mother in darkness deeply stricken by nicks culpableoh he was culpableloss of his prize but feeling an obscure element in the matter they didnt grasp an undiscovered explanation that would perhaps make it still worse though it might make them poor things a little better he had explained nothing he had simply said dear mother we dont hit it off after all its an awful bore but we dontas if that were in the dire conditions an adequate balm for two aching hearts from julia naturally no flood of light was to be looked forjulia never humoured curiosityand though she very often did the thing you wouldnt suppose she was not unexpectedly apologetic in this case grace recognised that in such a position it would savour of apology for her to disclose to lady agnes her grounds for having let nick off and she wouldnt have liked to be the person to suggest to julia that any one looked for anything from her neither of the disunited pair blamed the other or cast an aspersion and it was all very magnanimous and superior and impenetrable and exasperating with all this grace had a suspicion that biddy knew something more that for biddy the tormenting curtain had been lifted  biddy had come and gone in these days with a perceptible air of detachment from the tribulations of home it had made her fortunately very prettystill prettier than usual it sometimes happened that at moments when grace was most angry she had a faint sweet smile which might have been drawn from some source of occult consolation it was perhaps in some degree connected with peter sherringhams visit as to which the girl had not been superstitiously silent when grace asked her if she had secret information and if it pointed to the idea that everything would be all right in the end she pretended to know nothingwhat should she know she asked with the loveliest arch of eyebrows over an unblinking candourand begged her sister not to let lady agnes believe her better off than themselves she contributed nothing to their gropings save a much better patience but she went with noticeable regularity on the pretext of her foolish modelling to rosedale road she was frankly on nicks side not going so far as to say he had been right but saying distinctly how sure she was that whatever had happened he couldnt have helped it not a mite this was striking because as grace knew the younger of the sisters had been much favoured by julia and wouldnt have sacrificed her easily it associated itself in the irritated mind of the elder with biddys frequent visits to the studio and made miss dormer ask herself if the crisis in nicks and julias business had not somehow been linked to that unnatural spot  she had gone there two or three times while biddy was working gone to pick up any clue to the mystery that might peep out but she had put her hand on nothing moreit wouldnt have occurred to her to say nothing lessthan the so dreadfully pointed presence of gabriel nash she once found that odd satellite to her surprise paying a visit to her sisterhe had come for nick who was absent she remembered how they had met in paris and how little he had succeeded with them when she had asked biddy afterwards how she could receive him that way biddy had replied that even she grace would have some charity for him if she could hear how fond he was of poor nick he had talked to her only of nickof nothing else grace had observed how she spoke of nick as injured and had noted the implication that some one else ceasing to be fond of him was thereby condemned in biddys eyes it seemed to grace that some one else had at least a right not to like some of his friends the studio struck her as mean and horrid and so far from suggesting to her that it could have played a part in making nick and julia fall out she only felt how little its dusty want of consequence could count one way or the other for julia grace who had no opinions on art saw no merit whatever in those impressions on canvas from nicks hand with which the place was bestrewn she didnt at all wish her brother to have talent in that direction yet it was secretly humiliating to her that he hadnt more  nick meanwhile felt a pang of almost horrified penitence in the little room on the right of the hall the moment after he had made his mother really understand he had thrown up his scat and that it would probably be in the evening papers that she would take this very ill was an idea that had pressed upon him hard enough but she took it even worse than he had feared he measured in the look she gave him when the full truth loomed upon her the mortal cruelty of her distress her face was like that of a passenger on a ship who sees the huge bows of another vessel towering close out of the fog there are visions of dismay before which the best conscience recoils and though nick had made his choice on all the grounds there were a few minutes in which he would gladly have admitted that his wisdom was a dark mistake his heart was in his throat he had gone too far he had been ready to disappoint his motherhe had not been ready to destroy her  lady agnes i hasten to add was not destroyed she made after her first drowning gasp a tremendous scene of opposition in the face of which her son could only fall back on his intrenchments she must know the worst he had thought so he told her everything including the little story of the forfeiture of his expectations from mr carteret he showed her this time not only the face of the matter but what lay below it narrated briefly the incident in his studio which had led to julia dallows deciding she couldnt after all put up with him this was wholly new to lady agnes she had had no clue to it and he could instantly see how it made the event worse for her adding a hideous positive to an abominable negative he noted now that distressed and distracted as she had been by his rupture with julia she had still held to the faith that their engagement would come on again believing evidently that he had a personal empire over the mistress of harsh which would bring her back lady agnes was forced to recognise this empire as precarious to forswear the hope of a blessed renewal from the moment the question was of base infatuations on his own part nick confessed to an infatuation but did his best to show her it wasnt base that it wasntsince julia had had faith in his loyaltyfor the person of the young lady who had been discovered posturing to him and whom he had seen but halfadozen times in his life he endeavoured to recall to his mother the identity of this young lady he adverted to the occasion in paris when they all had seen her together but lady agness mind and memory were a blank on the subject of miss miriam rooth and she wanted to hear nothing whatever about her it was enough that she was the cause of their ruin and a part of his pitiless folly she needed to know nothing of her to allude to her as if it were superfluous to give a definite name to the class to which she belonged  but she gave a name to the group in which nick had now taken his place and it made him feel after the lapse of years like a small scolded sorry boy again for it was so far away he could scarcely remember itbesides there having been but a moment or two of that sort in his happy childhoodthe time when this parent had slapped him and called him a little fool he was a big fool nowhugely immeasurable she repeated the term over and over with highpitched passion the most painful thing in this painful hour was perhaps his glimpse of the strange feminine cynicism that lurked in her fine sense of injury where there was such a complexity of revolt it would have been difficult to pick out particular wrongs but nick could see that to his mothers imagination he was most a fool for not having kept his relations with the actress whatever they were better from julias knowledge he remained indeed freshly surprised at the ardour with which she had rested her hopes on julia julia was certainly a combinationshe was accomplished she was a sort of leading woman and she was rich but after allputting aside what she might be to a man in love with hershe was not the keystone of the universe yet the form in which the consequences of his apostasy appeared most to come home to lady agnes was the loss for the dormer family of the advantages attached to the possession of mrs dallow the larger mortification would round itself later for the hour the damning thing was that nick had made that lady the gift of an unforgivable grievance he had clinched their separation by his letter to his electorsand that above all was the wickedness of the letter julia would have got over the other woman but she would never get over his becoming a nobody  lady agnes challenged him upon this low prospect exactly as if he had embraced it with the malignant purpose of making the return of his late intended impossible she contradicted her premises and lost her way in her wrath what had made him suddenly turn round if he had been in good faith before he had never been in good faithnever never he had had from his earliest childhood the nastiest hankerings after a vulgar little daubing trashtalking life they were not in him the grander nobler aspirationsthey never had beenand he had been anything but honest to lead her on to lead them all on to think he would do something the fall and the shame would have been less for them if they had come earlier moreover what need under heaven had he to tell charles carteret of the cruel folly on his very deathbedas if he mightnt have let it all alone and accepted the benefit the old man was so delighted to confer no wonder mr carteret would keep his money for his heirs if that was the way nick proposed to repay him but where was the common sense where was the common charity where was the common decency of tormenting him with such vile news in his last hours was he trying what he could invent that would break her heart that would send her in sorrow down to her grave werent they all miserable enough and hadnt he a ray of pity for his wretched sisters  the relation of effect and cause in regard to his sisters wretchedness was but dimly discernible to nick who however perceived his mother genuinely to consider that his action had disconnected them all still more than she held they were already disconnected from the good things of life julia was money mr carteret was moneyeverything else was the absence of it if these precious people had been primarily money for nick it after all flattered the distributive impulse in him to have taken for granted that for the rest of the family too the difference would have been so great for days for weeks and months to come the little room on the right of the hall was to vibrate for our young man as if the very walls and windowpanes still suffered with the odious trial of his true temper     xxxv   that eveningthe evening of his return from beauclerehe was conscious of a keen desire to get away to go abroad to leave behind him the little chatter his resignation would be sure to produce in an age of publicity which never discriminated as to the quality of events then he felt it decidedly better to stay to see the business through on the spot besides he would have to meet his constituentswould a parcel of cheeseeating burgesses ever have been met on so queer an occasionand when that was over the incident would practically be closed nick had an idea he knew in advance how it would affect him to be pointed at as a person who had given up a considerable chance of eventual office to take likenesses at so much a head he wouldnt attempt down at harsh to touch on the question of motive for given the nature of the public mind of harsh that would be a strain on his faculty of exposition but as regards the chaff of the political world and of society he had a hope he should find chaff enough for retorts it was true that when his mother twitted him in her own effective way he had felt rather flattened out but then ones mother might have a heavier hand than any one else he had not thrown up the house of commons to amuse himself he had thrown it up to work to sit quietly down and bend over his task if he should go abroad his parent might think he had some weakminded view of joining julia and trying with however little hope to win her backan illusion it would be singularly pernicious to encourage his desire for julias society had succumbed for the present at any rate to a dire interruptionhe had become more and more aware of their speaking a different language nick felt like a young man who has gone to the rhineland to get up his german for an examinationcommitted to talk to read to dream only in the new idiom now that he had taken his jump everything was simplified at the same time that everything was pitched in a higher and intenser key and he wondered how in the absence of a common dialect he had conversed on the whole so happily with mrs dallow then he had aftertastes of understandings tolerably independent of words he was excited because every fresh responsibility is exciting and there was no manner of doubt he had accepted one no one knew what it was but himselfgabriel nash scarcely counted his whole attitude on the question of responsibility being so fantasticand he would have to ask his dearest friends to take him on trust rather indeed he would ask nothing of any one but would cultivate independence mulishness and gaiety and fix his thoughts on a bright if distant morrow it was disagreeable to have to remember that his task would not be sweetened by a sense of heroism for if it might be heroic to give up the muses for the strife of great affairs no romantic glamour worth speaking of would ever gather round an englishman who in the prime of his strength had given up great or even small affairs for the muses such an original might himself privately and perversely regard certain phases of this inferior commerce as a great affair but who would give him the benefit of that sort of confidenceexcept indeed a faithful clever exalted little sister biddy if he should have the good luck to have one biddy was in fact all ready for heroic flights and eager to think she might fight the battle of the beautiful by her brothers side so that he had really to moderate her and remind her how little his actual job was a crusade with bugles and banners and how much a grey sedentary grind the charm of which was all at the core you might have an emotion about it and an emotion that would be a help but this was not the sort of thing you could showthe end in view would seem so disproportionately small nick put it to her that one really couldnt talk to people about the responsibility of what she would see him pottering at in his studio  he therefore didnt run as he would have said to winged words any more than he was forced to having moreover a sense that apologetic work if apology it should be called to carry the war straight into the enemys country might be freely left to gabriel nash he laid the weight of explanation on his commentators meeting them all on the firm ground of his own amusement he saw he should live for months in a thick cloud of irony not the finest air of the season and he adopted the weapon to which a person whose use of tobacco is only occasional resorts when every one else produces a cigarhe puffed the spasmodic defensive cigarette he accepted as to what he had done the postulate of the obscurely tortuous abounding so in that sense that his critics were themselves bewildered some of them felt that they got as the phrase is little out of himhe rose in his good humour so much higher than the rise they had looked foron his very first encounter with the world after his scrimmage with his mother he went to a dinnerpartyhe had accepted the invitation many days beforehaving seen his resignation in the form of a telegram from harsh announced in the evening papers the people he found there had seen it as well and the wittiest wanted to know what he was now going to do even the most embarrassed asked if it were true he had changed his politics he gave different answers to different persons but left most of them under the impression that he had strange scruples of conscience this however was not a formidable occasion for there had happened to be no one present he would have desired on the old basis especially to gratify there were real good friends it would be less easy to meetnick was almost sorry for an hour that he had so many real good friends if he had had more enemies the case would have been simpler and he was fully aware that the hardest thing of all would be to be let off too easily then he would appear to himself to have been put all round on his generosity and his deviation would thus wear its ugliest face  when he left the place at which he had been dining he betook himself to rosedale road he saw no reason why he should go down to the house though he knew he had not done with that yet he had a dread of behaving as if he supposed he should be expected to make a farewell speech and was thankful his eminence was not of a nature to create on such an occasion a demand for his oratory he had in fact nothing whatever to say in publicnot a vain word not a sorry syllable though the hour was late he found gabriel nash established in his studio drawn thither by the fine exhilaration of having seen an evening paper trying it late on the chance he had been told by nicks servant that nick would sleep there that night and he had come in to wait he was so eager to congratulate him nick submitted with a good grace to his societyhe was tired enough to go to bed but was restless tooin spite of noting now oddly enough that nashs congratulations could add little to his fortitude he had felt a good deal before as if he were in this philosophers hands but since making his final choice he had begun to strike himself as all in his own gabriel might have been the angel of that name but no angel could assist him much henceforth  nash indeed was as true as ever to his genius while he lolled on a divan and emitted a series of reflexions that were even more ingenious than opportune nick walked up and down the room and it might have been supposed from his manner that he was impatient for his friend to withdraw this idea would have been contradicted however by the fact that subsequently after the latter had quitted him he continued to perambulate he had grown used to gabriel and must now have been possessed of all he had to say that was ones penalty with persons whose main gift was for talk however inspiring talk engendered a sense of sameness much sooner than action the things a man did were necessarily more different from each other than the things he said even if he went in for surprising you nick felt nash could never surprise him any more save by mere plain perpetration  he talked of his hosts future talked of miriam rooth and of peter sherringham whom he had seen at that young womans and whom he described as in a predicament delightful to behold nick put a question about peters predicament and learned rather to his disappointment that it consisted only of the fact that he was in love with miriam he appealed to his visitor to do better than this and nash then added the touch that sherringham wouldnt be able to have her oh theyve ideas he said when nick asked him why  what ideas so has he i suppose  yes but theyre not the same  well theyll nevertheless arrange something nick opined  youll have to help them a bit shes in love with another man nash went on  do you mean with you  oh im never another manim always more the wrong one than the man himself its you shes after and on his friends asking him what he meant by this nash added while you were engaged in transferring her image to the tablet of your genius you stamped your own on that of her heart  nick stopped in his walk staring ah what a bore  a bore dont you think her formed to please  nick wondered but didnt conclude i wanted to go on with hernow i cant  nash himself however jumped straight to what really mattered my dear fellow it only makes her handsomer i wondered what happy turn she had taken  oh thats twaddle said nick turning away besides has she told you  no but her mother has  has she told her mother  mrs rooth says not but ive known mrs rooth to say that which isnt  apply that rule then to the information you speak of  well since you press me i know more gabriel said miriam knows youre engaged to a wonderful rich lady she told me as much told me she had seen her here that was enough to set her offshe likes forbidden fruit  im not engaged to any lady whatever i was nick handsomely conceded but weve altered our minds  ah what a pity his friend wailed  mephistophelesand he stopped again with the point of this  pray then whom do you call margaret may i ask if your failure of interest in the political situation is the cause of this change in your personal one nash went on nick signified that he mightnt whereupon he added im not in the least devilishi only mean its a pity youve altered your minds since miriam may in consequence alter hers she goes from one thing to another however i wont tell her  i will then nick declared between jest and earnest  would that really be prudent his companion asked more completely in the frolic key  at any rate he resumed nothing would induce me to interfere with peter sherringham that sounds fatuous but to you i dont mind appearing an ass  the thing would be to get sherringham out of spite nash threw off to entangle himself with another woman  what good would that do  ah miriam would then begin to think of him  spite surely isnt a conceivable motivefor a healthy man  the plea however found gabriel ready sherringhams just precisely not a healthy man hes too much in love  then he wont care for another woman  he would try to and that would produce its effectits effect on miriam  you talk like an american novel let him try and god keep us all straight nick adverted in extreme silence to his poor little biddy and greatly hopedhe would have to see to it a littlethat peter wouldnt try on her he changed the subject and before nash withdrew took occasion to remarkthe occasion was offered by some new allusion of the visitors to the sport he hoped to extract from seeing nick carry out everything to which he stood committedthat the comedy of the matter would fall flat and the incident pass unnoticed  but nash lost no heart oh if youll simply do your part ill take care of the rest  if you mean by doing my part minding my business and working like a beaver i shall easily satisfy you nick replied  ah you reprobate youll become another sir joshua a mere pra his companion railed getting up to go  when he had gone nick threw himself back on the cushions of the divan and with his hands locked above his head sat a long time lost in thought he had sent his servant to bed he was unmolested he gazed before him into the gloom produced by the unheeded burningout of the last candle the vague outer light came in through the tall studio window and the painted images ranged about looked confused in the dusk if his mother had seen him she might have thought he was staring at his fathers ghost     xxxvi   the night peter sherringham walked away from balaklava place with gabriel nash the talk of the two men directed itself as was natural at the time to the question of miriams future fame and the pace as nash called it at which she would go critical spirits as they both were and one of them as dissimulative in passion as the other was paradoxical in the absence of it they yet took her career for granted as completely as the simpleminded a pair of hot spectators in the pit might have done and exchanged observations on the assumption that the only uncertain element would be the pace this was a proof of general subjugation peter wished not to show yet wished to know and in the restlessness of his anxiety was ready even to risk exposure great as the sacrifice might be of the imperturbable urbane scepticism most appropriate to a secretary of embassy he couldnt rid himself of the sense that nash had got up earlier than he had had opportunities of contact in days already distant the days of mrs rooths hungry foreign rambles something of authority and privilege stuck to him from this and it made sherringham still more uncomfortable when he was most conscious that at the best even the trained diplomatic mind would never get a grasp of miriam as a whole she was constructed to revolve like the terraqueous globe some part or other of her was always out of sight or in shadow  peter talked to conceal his feelings and like many a man practising that indirectness rather lost himself in the wood they agreed that putting strange accidents aside the girl would go further than any one had gone in england within the memory of man and that it was a pity as regards marking the comparison that for so long no one had gone any distance worth speaking of they further agreed that it would naturally seem absurd to any one who didnt know their prophesying such big things on such small evidence and they agreed lastly that the absurdity quite vanished as soon as the prophets knew as they knew their knowledgethey quite recognised thiswas simply confidence raised to a high point the communication of their young friends own confidence the conditions were enormously to make but it was of the very essence of miriams confidence that she would make them the parts the plays the theatres the support the audiences the critics the money were all to be found but she cast a spell that prevented this from seeming a serious hitch one mightnt see from one day to the other what she would do or how she would do it but this wouldnt stay her stepsshe would none the less go on she would have to construct her own road as it were but at the worst there would only be delays in making it these delays would depend on the hardness of the stones she had to break  as peter had noted you never knew where to have gabriel nash a truth exemplified in his unexpected delight at the prospect of miriams drawing forth the modernness of the age you might have thought he would loathe that modernness but he had a joyous amused amusing vision of itsaw it as something huge and fantastically vulgar its vulgarity would rise to the grand style like that of a london railway station and the publicity achieved by their charming charge be as big as the globe itself all the machinery was ready the platform laid the facilities the wires and bells and trumpets the roaring deafening newspaperism of the periodits most distinctive signwere waiting for her their predestined mistress to press her foot on the spring and set them all in motion gabriel brushed in a large bright picture of her progress through the time and round the world round it and round it again from continent to continent and clime to clime with populations and deputations reporters and photographers placards and interviews and banquets steamers railways dollars diamonds speeches and artistic ruin all jumbled into her train regardless of expense the spectacle would be and thrilling though somewhat monotonous the dramaa drama more bustling than any she would put on the stage and a spectacle that would beat everything for scenery in the end her divine voice would crack screaming to foreign ears and antipodal barbarians and her clever manner would lose all quality simplified to a few unmistakable knockdown dodges then she would be at the fine climax of life and glory still young and insatiate but already coarse hard and raddled with nothing left to do and nothing left to do it with the remaining years all before her and the raison dêtre all behind it would be splendid dreadful grotesque  oh shell have some good yearstheyll be worth having peter insisted as they went besides you see her too much as a humbug and too little as a real producer she has ideasgreat ones she loves the thing for itself that may keep a woman serious  her greatest idea must always be to show herself and fortunately she has a great quantity of that treasure to show i think of her absolutely as a real producer but as a producer whose production is her own person no person even as fine a one as hers will stand that for more than an hour so that humbuggery has very soon to lend a hand however nash continued if shes a fine humbug it will do as well it will perfectly suit the time we can all be saved by vulgarity thats the solvent of all difficulties and the blessing of this delightful age one doesnt die of itsave in soul and sense one dies only of minding it therefore let no man despaira new hope has dawned  shell do her work like any other worker with the advantage over many that her talents rare peter obliquely answered compared with the life of many women thats security and sanity of the highest order then she cant help her beauty you cant vulgarise that  oh cant you gabriel cried  it will abide with her till the day of her death it isnt a mere superficial freshness shes very noble  yes thats the pity of it said nash shes a big more or less directed force and i quite admit that shell do for a while a lot of good shell have brightened up the world for a great many peoplehave brought the ideal nearer to them and held it fast for an hour with its feet on earth and its great wings trembling thats always something for blest is he who has dropped even the smallest coin into the little iron box that contains the precious savings of mankind miriam will doubtless have dropped a big goldpiece it will be found in the general scramble on the day the race goes bankrupt and then for herself shell have had a great go at life  oh yes shell have got out of her holeshe wont have vegetated peter concurred that makes her touching to meit adds to the many good reasons for which one may want to help her shes tackling a big job and tackling it by herself throwing herself upon the world in good faith and dealing with it as she can meeting alone in her youth her beauty her generosity all the embarrassments of notoriety and all the difficulties of a profession of which if one halfs whats called brilliant the others frankly odious  she has great courage but you speak of her as solitary with such a lot of us all round her nash candidly inquired  shes a great thing for you and me but were a small thing for her  well a good many small things if they but stick together may make up a mass gabriel said there must always be the man you see hes the indispensable element in such a life and hell be the last thing shell ever lack  what man are you talking about peter asked with imperfect ease  the man of the hour whoever he is shell inspire innumerable devotions  of course she will and theyll be precisely a part of the insufferable side of her life  insufferable to whom nash demanded dont forget that the insufferable side of her life will be just the side shell thrive on you cant eat your cake and have it and you cant make omelettes without breaking eggs you cant at once sit by the fire and parade about the world and you cant take all chances without having some adventures you cant be a great actress without the luxury of nerves without a plentiful supplyor without the right onesyoull only be second fiddle if youve all the tense strings you may take life for your fiddlestick your nerves and your adventures your eggs and your cake are part of the cost of the most expensive of professions you play with human passions with exaltations and ecstasies and terrors and if you trade on the fury of the elements you must know how to ride the storm  well peter thought it over those are the fine old commonplaces about the artistic temperament but i usually find the artist a very meek decent little person  you never find the artistyou only find his work and thats all you need find when the artists a woman and the womans an actress meekness and decency will doubtless be there in the right proportions nash went on miriam will represent them for you if you give her her cue with the utmost charm  of course shell inspire devotionsthats all right said peter with a wild cheerfulness  and of course theyll inspire responses and with that consequencedont you seetheyll mitigate her solitude theyll even enliven it nash set forth  shell probably box a good many ears thatll be lively peter returned with some grimness  oh magnificentit will be a merry life yet with its tragic passages its distracted or its pathetic hours gabriel insisted in short a little of everything  they walked on without further speech till at last peter resumed the best thing for a woman in her situation is to marry some decent caretaking man  oh i daresay shell do that too nash laughed a remark as a result of which his companion lapsed afresh into silence gabriel left him a little to enjoy this after which he added theres somebody shed marry tomorrow  peter wondered do you mean her friend dashwood  no no i mean nick dormer  shed marry him peter gasped  i mean her heads full of him but shell hardly get the chance  peter watched himself does she like him as much as that  i dont quite know how much you mean but enough for all practical ends  marrying a fashionable actress is hardly a practical end  certainly not but im not speaking from his point of view nash was perfectly lucid moreover i thought you just now said it would be such a good thing for her  to marry nick dormer  you said a good decent man and hes one of the very decentest  i wasnt thinking of the individual but of the protection it would fence her about settle certain questions or appear to it would make things safe and comfortable for her and keep a lot of cads and blackguards away  she ought to marry the prompter or the boxkeeper said nash then it would be all right i think indeed they generally do dont they  peter felt for a moment a strong disposition to drop his friend on the spot to cross to the other side of the street and walk away without him but there was a different impulse which struggled with this one and after a minute overcame it the impulse that led to his saying presently has she told you shesashes in love with nick  no nothats not the way i know it  has nick told you then  on the contrary ive told him  youve rendered him a questionable service if youve no proof peter pronounced  my proofs only that ive seen her with him shes charming poor dear thing  but surely she isnt in love with every man shes charming to  i mean shes charming to me nash returned i see her that way i see her interestedand what it does to her with her for her but judge for yourselfthe first time you get a chance  when shall i get a chance nick doesnt come near her  oh hell come hell come his picture isnt finished  you mean hell be the boxkeeper then  my dear fellow i shall never allow it said gabriel nash it would be idiotic and quite unnecessary hes beautifully arrangedin quite a different line fancy his taking that sort of job on his hands besides shed never expect it shes not such a goose theyre very good friendsit will go on that way shes an excellent person for him to know shell give him lots of ideas of the plastic kind he would have been up there before this but it has taken him time to play his delightful trick on his constituents that of course is pure amusement but when once his effect has been well produced hell get back to business and his business will be a very different matter from miriams imagine him writing her advertisements living on her money adding up her profits having rows and recriminations with her agent carrying her shawl spending his days in her rougepot the right man for that if she must have one will turn up pour le mariage non she isnt wholly an idiot she really for a woman quite sees things as they are  as peter had not crossed the street and left gabriel planted he now suffered the extremity of irritation but descrying in the dim vista of the edgware road a vague and vigilant hansom he waved his stick with eagerness and with the abrupt declaration that feeling tired he must drive the rest of his way he offered nash as he entered the vehicle no seat but this coldness was not reflected in the lucidity with which that master of every subject went on to affirm that there was of course a dangerthe danger that in given circumstances miriam would leave the stage  leave it you mean for some man  for the man were talking about  for nick dormer peter asked from his place in the cab his paleness lighted by its lamps  if he should make it a condition but why should he why should he make any conditions hes not an ass either you see it would be a borenash kept it up while the hansom waitedbecause if she were to do anything of that sort shed make him pay for the sacrifice  oh yes shed make him pay for the sacrifice peter blindly concurred  and then when he had paid shed go back to her footlights gabriel developed from the curbstone as his companion closed the apron of the cab  i seeshed go backgoodnight peter returned please go on he cried to the driver through the hole in the roof and while the vehicle rolled away he growled to himself of course she wouldand quite right     xxxvii   judge for yourself when you get a chance nash had said to him and as it turned out he was able to judge two days later for he found his cousin in balaklava place on the tuesday following his walk with their insufferable friend he had not only stayed away from the theatre on the monday eveninghe regarded this as an achievement of some importancebut had not been near miriam during the day he had meant to absent himself from her company on tuesday as well a determination confirmed by the fact that the afternoon turned to rain but when at ten minutes to five oclock he jumped into a hansom and directed his course to saint johns wood it was precisely upon the weather that he shifted the responsibility of his behaviour  miriam had dined when he reached the villa but she was lying down unduly fatigued before going to the theatre mrs rooth was however in the drawingroom with three gentlemen in two of whom the fourth visitor was not startled to recognise basil dashwood and gabriel nash dashwood appeared to have become miriams brotherinarms and a second childa fonder oneto mrs rooth it had reached peter on some late visit that the young actor had finally moved his lodgings into the quarter making himself a near neighbour for all sorts of convenience hang his convenience peter thought perceiving that mrs lovicks arty was now altogether one of the family oh the familyit was a queer one to be connected with that consciousness was acute in sherringhams breast today as he entered mrs rooths little circle the place was filled with cigarettesmoke and there was a messy coffeeservice on the piano whose keys basil dashwood lightly touched for his own diversion nash addressing the room of course was at one end of a little sofa with his nose in the air and nick dormer was at the other end seated much at his ease and with a certain privileged appearance of having been there often before though sherringham knew he had not he looked uncritical and very young as rosy as a schoolboy on a halfholiday it was past five oclock in the day but mrs rooth was not dressed there was however no want of finish in her elegant attitudethe same relaxed grandeur she seemed to let you understand for which she used to be distinguished at castle nugent when the house was full she toyed incongruously in her unbuttoned wrapper with a large tinsel fan which resembled a theatrical property  it was one of the discomforts of peters position that many of those minor matters which are superficially at least most characteristic of the histrionic life had power to displease him so that he was obliged constantly to overlook and condone and pretend he disliked besmoked drawingrooms and irregular meals and untidy arrangements he could suffer from the vulgarity of mrs rooths apartments the importunate photographs which gave on his nerves the barbarous absence of signs of an orderly domestic life the odd volumes from the circulating library you could see what they werethe very covers told youat a glance tumbled about under smeary cups and glasses he hadnt waited till now to feel it rum that fate should have let him in for such contacts but as he stood before his hostess and her companions he wondered perhaps more than ever why he should her companions somehow who were not responsible didnt keep down his wonder which was particularly odd since they were not superficially in the least of bohemian type almost the first thing that struck him as happened in coming into the room was the fresh fact of the high good looks of his cousin a gentleman to ones taste and for ones faith in a different enough degree from the stiffcollared conversible dashwood peter didnt hate nick for being of so fine an english grain he knew rather the brush of a new wave of annoyance at julias stupid failure to get on with him under that good omen  it was his first encounter with the late member for harsh since his arrival in london they had been on one side and the other so much taken up with their affairs since their last meeting nick had as we know to his kinsmans perception really put on a new character he had done the finest stroke of business in the quietest way this had made him a presence to be counted with and in just the sense in which poor peter desired least to count poor peter after his somersault in the blue had just lately been much troubled he was ravaged by contending passions he paid every hour in a torment of unrest for what was false in his position the impossibility of keeping the presentable parts of his character together the opposition of interest and desire nick his junior and a lighter weight had settled his problem and showed no wounds there was something impertinent and mystifying in it yet he looked into the bargain too innocently young and happy and too careless and modest and amateurish to figure as a rival or even as the genius he was apparently going to try to bethe genius that the other day in the studio there with biddy peter had got a startled glimpse of his power to become julias brother would have liked to be aware of grounds of resentment to be able to hold she had been badly treated or that nick was basely fatuous for in that case he might have had the resource of taking offence but where was the outrage of his merely being liked by a woman in respect to whom one had definitely denied ones self the luxury of pretensions especially if as the wrongdoer he had taken no action in the matter it could scarcely be called wrongdoing to call casually on an afternoon when the lady didnt seem to be there peter could at any rate rejoice that miriam didnt and he proposed to himself suggesting to nick after a little that they should adjourn togetherthey had such interesting things to talk about meanwhile nick greeted him with a friendly freedom in which he could read neither confusion nor defiance peter was reassured against a danger he believed he didnt recognise and puzzled by a mystery he flattered himself he hadnt heeded and he was still more ashamed of being reassured than of being puzzled  it must be recorded that miriams absence from the scene was not prolonged nick as sherringham gathered had been about a quarter of an hour in the house which would have given her gratified by his presence due time to array herself to come down to him at all events she was in the room prepared apparently to go to the theatre very shortly after one of her guests had become sensible of how glad he was she was out of it familiarity had never yet cured him of a certain tremor of expectation and even of suspense in regard to her entrances a flutter caused by the simple circumstance of her infinite variety to say she was always acting would too much convey that she was often fatiguing since her changing face affected this particular admirer at least not as a series of masks but as a response to perceived differences an intensity of that perception or still more as something richly constructional like the shifting of the scene in a play or like a room with many windows the image she was to project was always incalculable but if her present denied her past and declined responsibility for her future it made a good thing of the hour and kept the actual peculiarly fresh this time the actual was a bright gentle graceful smiling young woman in a new dress eager to go out drawing on fresh gloves who looked as if she were about to step into a carriage andit was gabriel nash who thus formulated her physiognomydo a lot of london things  the young woman had time to spare however and she sat down and talked and laughed and presently gave as seemed to peter a deeper glow to the tawdry little room which could do for others if it had to do for her she described herself as in a state of nervous muddle exhausted blinded abrutie with the rehearsals of the forthcoming piecethe first night was close at hand and it was going to be of a vileness they would all seebut there was no correspondence between this account of the matter and her present bravery of mood she sent her mother awayto put on some clothes or somethingand left alone with the visitors went to a long glass between the windows talking always to nick dormer and revised and rearranged a little her own attire she talked to nick over her shoulder and to nick only as if he were the guest to recognise and the others didnt count she broke out at once on his having thrown up his seat wished to know if the strange story told her by mr nash were truethat he had knocked all the hopes of his party into pie  nick took it any way she liked and gave a pleasant picture of his partys ruin the critical condition of public affairs he was as yet clearly closed to contrition or shame the pilgrim from paris before miriams entrance had not in shaking hands with him made even a roundabout allusion to his odd game he felt he must somehow show good tasteso english people often feelat the cost of good manners but he winced on seeing how his scruples had been wasted and was struck with the fine jocose direct turn of his kinsmans conversation with the young actress it was a part of her unexpectedness that she took the heavy literal view of nicks behaviour declared frankly though without ill nature that she had no patience with his mistake she was horribly disappointedshe had set her heart on his being a great statesman one of the rulers of the people and the glories of england what was so useful what was so noblehow it belittled everything else she had expected him to wear a cordon and a star some dayacquiring them with the greatest promptitudeand then to come and see her in her loge it would look so particularly well she talked after the manner of a lovely philistine except perhaps when she expressed surprise at hearinghearing from gabriel nashthat in england gentlemen accoutred with those emblems of their sovereigns esteem didnt so far forget themselves as to stray into the dressingrooms of actresses she admitted after a moment that they were quite right and the dressingrooms of actresses nasty places but she was sorry for that was the sort of thing she had always figured in a cornera distinguished man slightly bald in evening dress with orders admiring the smallness of a satin shoe and saying witty things nash was convulsed with hilarity at thissuch a vision of the british political hero coming back from the glass and making that critic give her his place on the sofa she seated herself near nick and continued to express her regret at his perversity  they all say thatall the charming women but i shouldnt have looked for it from you nick replied ive given you such an example of what i can do in another line  do you mean my portrait oh ive got it with your name and mp in the corner and thats precisely why im content mp in the corner of a picture is delightful but i want to break the mould i dont in the least insist on your giving specimens to others and the artistic life when you can lead anotherif youve any alternative however modestis a very poor business it comes last in dignityafter everything else aint i up to my eyes in it and dont i truly know  you talk like my brokenhearted mother said nick  does she hate it so intensely  she has the darkest ideas about itthe wildest theories i cant imagine where she gets them partly i think from a general conviction that the esthetica horrible insidious foreign diseaseis eating the healthy core out of english life dear old english life and partly from the charming pictures in punch and the clever satirical articles pointing at mysterious depths of contamination in the other weekly papers she believes theres a dreadful coterie of uncannily artful and desperately refined people who wear a kind of loose faded uniform and worship only beautywhich is a fearful thing that gabriel has introduced me to it that i now spend all my time in it and that for its sweet sake ive broken the most sacred vows poor gabriel who so far as i can make out isnt in any sort of society however bad  but im uncannily artful nash objected and though i cant afford the uniformi believe you get it best somewhere in south audley streeti do worship beauty i really think its me the weekly papers mean  oh ive read the articlesi know the sort said basil dashwood  miriam looked at him go and see if the broughams therei ordered it early  dashwood without moving consulted his watch it isnt time yeti know more about the brougham than you ive made a ripping good arrangement for her stableit really costs her nothing the young actor continued confidentially to peter near whom he had placed himself  your mothers quite right to be brokenhearted miriam declared and i can imagine exactly what she has been through i should like to talk with heri should like to see her nick showed on this easy amusement reminding her she had talked to him while she sat for her portrait in quite the opposite sense most helpfully and inspiringly and nash explained that she was studying the part of a political duchess and wished to take observations for it to work herself into the character the girl might in fact have been a political duchess as she sat her head erect and her gloved hands folded smiling with aristocratic dimness at nick she shook her head with stately sadness she might have been trying some effect for mary stuart in schillers play ive changed since that i want you to be the grandest thing there isthe counsellor of kings  peter wondered if it possibly werent since she had met his sister in nicks studio that she had changed if perhaps she hadnt seen how it might give julia the sense of being more effectually routed to know that the woman who had thrown the bomb was one who also tried to keep nick in the straight path this indeed would involve an assumption that julia might know whereas it was perfectly possible she mightnt and more than possible that if she should she wouldnt care miriams essential fondness for trying different ways was always there as an adequate reason for any particular way a truth which however sometimes only halfprevented the particular way from being vexatious to a particular observer  yet after all whos more esthetic than you and who goes in more for the beautiful nick asked youre never so beautiful as when you pitch into it  oh im an inferior creature of an inferior sex and ive to earn my bread as i can id give it all up in a moment my odious tradefor an inducement  and pray what do you mean by an inducement nick demanded  my dear fellow she means youif youll give her a permanent engagement to sit for you gabriel volunteered what singularly crude questions you ask  i like the way she talks mr dashwood derisively said when i gave up the most brilliant prospects of very much the same kind as mr dormers expressly to go on the stage  youre an inferior creature too miriam promptly pronounced  miss rooths very hard to satisfy peter observed at this a man of distinction slightly bald in evening dress with orders in the corner of her logeshe has such a personage ready made to her hand and she doesnt so much as look at him am i not an inducement havent i offered you a permanent engagement  your orderswhere are your orders she returned with a sweet smile getting up  i shall be a minister next year and an ambassador before you know it then i shall stick on everything that can be had  and they call us mountebanks cried the girl ive been so glad to see you againdo you want another sitting she went on to nick as if to take leave of him  as many as youll give mei shall be grateful for all he made answer i should like to do you as you are at present youre totally different from the woman i paintedyoure wonderful  the comic muse she laughed well you must wait till our first nights are overim sur les dents till then theres everything to do and ive to do it all that fellows good for nothing for nothing but domestic lifeand she glanced at basil dashwood he hasnt an ideanot one youd willingly tell of him though hes rather useful for the stables weve got stables nowor we try to look as if we had dashwoods ideas are de cette force in ten days i shall have more time  the comic muse never never peter protested youre not to go smirking through the age and down to posterityid rather see you as medusa crowned with serpents thats what you look like when you look best  thats consolingwhen ive just bought a lovely new bonnet all red roses and bows i forgot to tell you just now that when youre an ambassador you may propose anything you like miriam went on but forgive me if i make that condition seriously speaking come to me glittering with orders and i shall probably succumb i cant resist stars and garters only you must as you say have them all i dont like to hear mr dormer talk the slang of the studiolike that phrase just now it is a fall to a lower state however when ones low one must crawl and im crawling down to the strand dashwood see if mammas ready if she isnt i decline to wait you must bring her in a hansom ill take mr dormer in the brougham i want to talk with mr dormer he must drive with me to the theatre his situations full of interest miriam led the way out of the room as she continued to chatter and when she reached the housedoor with the four men in her train the carriage had just drawn up at the gardengate it appeared that mrs rooth was not ready and the girl in spite of a remonstrance from nick who had a sense of usurping the old ladys place repeated her injunction that she should be brought on in a cab miriams gentlemen hung about her at the gate and she insisted on nicks taking his seat in the brougham and taking it first before she entered she put her hand out to peter and looking up at him held his own kindly dear old master arent you coming tonight i miss you when youre not there  dont godont goits too much nash freely declared  she is wonderful said mr dashwood all expert admiration she has gone into the rehearsals tooth and nail but nothing takes it out of her  nothing puts it into you my dear miriam returned then she pursued to peter youre the faithful oneyoure the one i count on he was not looking at her his eyes travelled into the carriage where they rested on nick dormer established on the farther seat with his face turned toward the farther window he was the one faithful or no counted on or no whom a charming woman had preferred to carry off and there was clear triumph for him in that fact yet it pleased it somewhat relieved his kinsman to see his passivity as not a little foolish miriam noted something of this in peters eyes for she exclaimed abruptly dont kill himhe doesnt care for me with which she passed into the carriage and let it roll away  peter stood watching it till he heard dashwood again beside him you wouldnt believe what i make him do the whole thing fora little rascal i know  goodbye take good care of mrs rooth said gabriel nash waving a bland farewell to the young actor he gave a smiling survey of the heavens and remarked to sherringham that the rain had stopped was he walking was he driving should they be going in the same direction peter cared little about his direction and had little account of it to give he simply moved away in silence and with gabriel at his side this converser was partly an affliction to him indeed the fact that he couldnt only make light of him added to the oppression it was just to him nevertheless to note that he could hold his peace occasionally he had for instance this afternoon taken little part in the talk at balaklava place peter greatly disliked to speak to him of miriam but he liked nash himself to make free with her and even liked him to say such things as might be a little viciously and unguardedly contradicted he was not however moved to gainsay something dropped by his companion disconnectedly at the end of a few minutes a word to the effect that she was after all the bestnatured soul alive all the same nash added it wouldnt do for her to take possession of a nice life like nicks and he repeated that for his part he would never allow it it would be on his conscience to interfere to which peter returned disingenuously that they might all do as they likedit didnt matter a button to him and with an effort to carry off that comedy he changed the subject     xxxviii   he wouldnt for a moment have admitted that he was jealous of his old comrade but would almost have liked to be accused of it for this would have given him a chance he rather lacked and missed the right occasion to declare with plausibility that motives he couldnt avow had no application to his case how could a man be jealous when he was not a suitor how could he pretend to guard a property which was neither his own nor destined to become his own there could be no question of loss when one had nothing at stake and no question of envy when the responsibility of possession was exactly what one prayed to be delivered from the measure of ones susceptibility was ones pretensions and peter was not only ready to declare over and over again that thank god he had none his spiritual detachment was still more completehe literally suffered from the fact that nobody appeared to care to hear him say it he connected an idea of virtue and honour with his attitude since surely it was a high case of conduct to have quenched a personal passion for the good of the public service he had gone over the whole question at odd irrepressible hours he had returned spiritually speaking the buffet administered to him all at once that day in rosedale road by the spectacle of the crânerie with which nick could let worldly glories slide resolution for resolution he preferred after all another sort and his own crânerie would be shown in the way he should stick to his profession and stand up for british interests if nick had leaped over a wall he would leap over a river the course of his river was already traced and his loins were already girded thus he was justified in holding that the measure of a mans susceptibility was a mans attitude that was the only thing he was bound to give an account of  he was perpetually giving an account of it to his own soul in default of other listeners he was quite angry at having tasted a sweetness in miriams assurance at the carriagedoor bestowed indeed with very little solemnity that nick didnt care for her wherein did it concern him that nick cared for her or that nick didnt wherein did it signify to him that gabriel nash should have taken upon himself to disapprove of a union between the young actress and the young painter and to frustrate an accident that might perhaps prove fortunate for those had also been cooling words at the hour though peter blushed on the morrow to think that he felt in them anything but nashs personal sublimity he was ashamed of having been refreshed and refreshed by so sickly a draughtit being all his theory that he was not in a fever as for keeping an eye on nick it would soon become clear to that young man and that young mans charming friend that he had quite other uses for his eyes the pair with nash to help might straighten out their complications according to their light he would never speak to nick of miriam he felt indeed just now as if he should never speak to nick of anything he had traced the course of his river as i say and the real proof would be in the way he should clearing the air land on the opposite bank it was a case for actionfor vigorous unmistakable action he had done very little since his arrival in london but moon round a fille de théâtre who was taken up partly though she bluffed it off with another man and partly with arranging new petticoats for a beastly old poetic drama but this little waste of time should instantly be made up he had given himself a definite rope and he had danced to the end of his rope and now he would dance back that was all rightso right that peter could only express to himself how right it was by whistling with extravagance  he whistled as he went to dine with a great personage the day after his meeting with nick in balaklava place a great personage to whom he had originally paid his respectsit was high timethe day before that meeting the previous monday the sense of omissions to repair of a superior line to take perhaps made him study with more zeal to please the personage who gave him ten minutes and asked him five questions a great many doors were successively opened before any palpitating pilgrim who was about to enter the presence of this distinguished man but they were discreetly closed again behind sherringham and i must ask the reader to pause with me at the nearer end of the momentary vista this particular pilgrim fortunately felt he could count on recognition not only as a faithful if obscure official in the great hierarchy but as a clever young man who happened to be connected by blood with people his lordship had intimately known no doubt it was simply as the clever young man that peter received the next morning from the dispenser of his lordships hospitality a note asking him to dine on the morrow such cards had come to him before and he had always obeyed their call he did so at present however with a sense of unusual intention in due course his intention was translated into words before the gentlemen left the diningroom he respectfully asked his noble host for some further brief and benevolent hearing  what is it you want tell me now the master of his fate replied motioning to the rest of the company to pass out and detaining him where they stood  peters excellent training covered every contingency he could always be as concise or as diffuse as the occasion required even he himself however was surprised at the quick felicity of the terms in which he was conscious of conveying that were it compatible with higher conveniences he should extremely like to be transferred to duties in a more distant quarter of the globe indeed fond as he was of thinking himself a man of emotions controlled by civility it is not impossible that a greater candour than he knew glimmered through peters expression and trembled through his tone as he presented this petition he had aimed at a good manner in presenting it but perhaps the best of the effect produced for his interlocutor was just where it failed where it confessed a secret that the highest diplomacy would have guarded sherringham remarked to the minister that he didnt care in the least where the place might be nor how little coveted a post the further away the better and the climate didnt matter he would only prefer of course that there should be really something to do though he would make the best of it even if there were not he stopped in time or at least thought he did not to betray his covertly seeking relief from minding his having been jilted in a flight to latitudes unfavourable to human life his august patron gave him a sharp look which for a moment seemed the precursor of a sharper question but the moment elapsed and the question failed to come this considerate omission characteristic of a true man of the world and representing quick guesses and still quicker indifferences made our gentleman from that moment his lordships ardent partisan what did come was a goodnatured laugh and the exclamation you know there are plenty of swamps and jungles if you want that sort of thing peter replied that it was very much that sort of thing he did want whereupon his chief continued ill seeill see if anything turns up you shall hear  something turned up the very next day our young man taken at his word found himself indebted to the postman for a note of concise intimation that the high position of minister to the smallest of central american republics would be apportioned him the republic though small was big enough to be shaky and the position though high not so exalted that there were not much greater altitudes above it to which it was a steppingstone peter quite ready to take one thing with another rejoiced at his easy triumph reflected that he must have been even more noticed at headquarters than he had hoped and on the spot consulting nobody and waiting for nothing signified his unqualified acceptance of the place nobody with a grain of sense would have advised him to do anything else it made him happier than he had supposed he should ever be again it made him feel professionally in the train as they said in paris it was serious it was interesting it was exciting and his imagination letting itself loose into the future began once more to scale the crowning eminence it was very simple to hold ones course if one really tried and he blessed the variety of peoples further communications passed the last enjoining on him to return to paris for a short interval a week later after which he would be advised of the date for his proceeding to his remoter duties     xxxix   the next thing he meanwhile did was to call with his news on lady agnes dormer it is not unworthy of note that he took on the other hand no step to make his promotion known to miriam rooth to render it probable he should find his aunt he went at the luncheonhour and she was indeed on the point of sitting down to that repast with grace biddy was not at homebiddy was never at home now her mother said she was always at nicks place she spent her life there she ate and drank there she almost slept there what she contrived to do there for so many hours and what was the irresistible spell lady agnes couldnt pretend she had succeeded in discovering she spoke of this baleful resort only as nicks place and spoke of it at first as little as possible she judged highly probable however that biddy would come in early that afternoon there was something or other some common social duty she had condescended to promise she would perform with grace poor lady agnes whom peter found somehow at once grim and very prostrateshe assured her nephew her nerves were all gonealmost abused her younger daughter for two minutes having evidently a deepseated need of abusing some one i must yet add that she didnt wait to meet graces eye before recovering by a rapid gyration her view of the possibilities of thingsthose possibilities from which she still might squeeze as a parent almost in despair the drop that would sweeten her cup dear child she had the presence of mind to subjoin her only fault is after all that she adores her brother she has a capacity for adoration and must always take her gospel from some one  grace declared to peter that her sister would have stayed at home if she had dreamed he was coming and lady agnes let him know that she had heard all about the hour he had spent with the poor child at nicks place and about his extraordinary good nature in taking the two girls to the play peter lunched in calcutta gardens spending an hour there which proved at first unexpectedly and as seemed to him unfairly dismal he knew from his own general perceptions from what biddy had told him and from what he had heard nick say in balaklava place that his aunt would have been wounded by her sons apostasy but it was not till he saw her that he appreciated the dark difference this young mans behaviour had made in the outlook of his family evidently that behaviour had sprung a dreadful leak in the great vessel of their hopes these were things no outsider could measure and they were none of an outsiders business it was enough that lady agnes struck him really as a woman who had received her deathblow she looked ten years older she was white and haggard and tragic her eyes burned with a strange fitful fire that prompted one to conclude her children had better look out for her when not filled with this unnatural flame they were suffused with comfortless tears and altogether the afflicted lady was as he viewed her very bad a case for anxiety it was because he had known she would be very bad that he had in his kindness called on her exactly in this manner but he recognised that to undertake to be kind to her in proportion to her need might carry one very far he was glad he had not himself a wronged mad mother and he wondered how nick could bear the burden of the home he had ruined apparently he didnt bear it very far but had taken final convenient refuge in rosedale road  peters judgement of his perverse cousin was considerably confused and not the less so for the consciousness that he was perhaps just now not in the best state of mind for judging him at all at the same time though he held in general that a man of sense has always warrant enough in his sense for doing the particular thing he prefers he could scarcely help asking himself whether in the exercise of a virile freedom it had been absolutely indispensable nick should work such domestic woe he admitted indeed that that was an anomalous figure for nick the worker of domestic woe then he saw that his aunts grievancethere came a moment later when she asserted as muchwas not quite what her recreant child in balaklava place had represented itwith questionable taste perhapsto a mocking actress was not a mere shocked quarrel with his adoption of a low career or a horror the oldfashioned horror of the louches licences taken by artists under pretext of being conscientious the day for this was past and english society thought the brush and the fiddle as good as anything elsewith two or three exceptions it was not what he had taken up but what he had put down that made the sorry difference and the tragedy would have been equally great if he had become a winemerchant or a horsedealer peter had gathered at first that lady agnes wouldnt trust herself to speak directly of her trouble and he had obeyed what he supposed the best discretion in making no allusion to it but a few minutes before they rose from table she broke out and when he attempted to utter a word of mitigation there was something that went to his heart in the way she returned oh you dont knowyou dont know he felt graces eyes fixed on him at this instant in a mystery of supplication and was uncertain as to what she wantedthat he should say something more to console her mother or should hurry away from the subject grace looked old and plain andhe had thought on coming inrather cross but she evidently wanted something you dont know lady agnes repeated with a trembling voice you dont know she had pushed her chair a little away from her place she held her pockethandkerchief pressed hard to her mouth almost stuffed into it and her eyes were fixed on the floor she made him aware he did virtually knowknow what towering piles of confidence and hope had been dashed to the earth then she finished her sentence unexpectedlyyou dont know what my life with my great husband was here on the other hand peter was slightly at faulthe didnt exactly see what her life with her great husband had to do with it what was clear to him however was that they literally had looked for things all in the very key of that greatness from nick it was not quite easy to see why this had been the caseit had not been precisely peters own prefigurement nick appeared to have had the faculty of planting that sort of flattering faith in women he had originally given julia a tremendous dose of it though she had since shaken off the effects  do you really think he would have done such great things politically speaking peter risked do you consider that the root of the matter was so essentially in him  his hostess had a pause looking at him rather hard i only think what all his friendsall his fathers friendshave thought he was his fathers son after all no young man ever had a finer training and he gave from the first repeated proof of the highest ability the highest ambition see how he got in everywhere look at his first seatlook at his second lady agnes continued look at what every one says at this moment  look at all the papers said grace did you ever hear him speak she asked and when peter reminded her how he had spent his life in foreign lands shut out from such pleasures she went on well you lost something  it was very charming said lady agnes quietly and poignantly  of course hes charming whatever he does peter returned hell be a charming artist  oh god help us the poor lady groaned rising quickly  he wontthats the worst grace amended it isnt as if hed do things people would like ive been to his place and i never saw such a horrid lot of thingsnot at all clever or pretty  yet her mother at this turned upon her with sudden asperity you know nothing whatever about the matter then she added for peter that as it happened her children did have a good deal of artistic taste grace was the only one who was totally deficient in it biddy was very cleverbiddy really might learn to do pretty things and anything the poor child could learn was now no more than her dutythere was so little knowing what the future had in store for them all  you think too much of the futureyou take terribly gloomy views said peter looking for his hat  what other views can one take when ones son has deliberately thrown away a fortune  thrown one away do you mean through not marrying  i mean through killing by his perversity the best friend he ever had  peter stared a moment then with laughter ah but julia isnt dead of it  im not talking of julia said his aunt with a good deal of majesty nick isnt mercenary and im not complaining of that  she means mr carteret grace explained with all her competence hed have done anything if nick had stayed in the house  but hes not dead  charles carterets dying said lady agneshis ends dreadfully near he has been a sort of providence to ushe was sir nicholass second self but he wont put up with such insanity such wickedness and that chapters closed  you mean he has dropped nick out of his will  cut him off utterly he has given him notice  the old scoundrelpeter couldnt keep this back but nick will work the better for thathell depend on himself  yes and whom shall we depend on grace spoke up  dont be vulgar for gods sake her mother ejaculated with a certain inconsequence  oh leave nick alonehell make a lot of money peter declared cheerfully following his two companions into the hall  i dont in the least care if he does or not said lady agnes you must come upstairs againive lots to say to you yet she went on seeing him make for his hat you must arrange to come and dine with us immediately its only because ive been so steeped in misery that i didnt write to you the other daydirectly after you had called we dont give parties as you may imagine but if youll come just as we are for old acquaintance sake  just with nickif nick will comeand dear biddy grace interposed  nick must certainly come as well as dear biddy whom i hoped so much to find peter pronounced because im going awayi dont know when i shall see them again  wait with mamma biddy will come in now at any moment grace urged  youre going away said lady agnes pausing at the foot of the stairs and turning her white face upon him something in her voice showed she had been struck by his own tone  ive had promotion and you must congratulate me theyre sending me out as minister to a little hot hole in central americasix thousand miles away i shall have to go rather soon  oh im so glad lady agnes breathed still she paused at the foot of the stair and still she gazed  how very delightfulit will lead straight off to all sorts of other good things grace a little coarsely commented  oh im crawling upim an excellency peter laughed  then if you dine with us your excellency must have great people to meet you  nick and biddytheyre great enough  come upstairscome upstairs said lady agnes turning quickly and beginning to ascend  wait for biddyim going out grace continued extending her hand to her kinsman i shall see you againnot that you care but goodbye now wait for biddy the girl repeated in a lower tone fastening her eyes on his with the same urgent mystifying gleam he thought he had noted at luncheon  oh ill go and see her in rosedale road he threw off  do you mean todaynow  i dont know about today but before i leave england  well shell be in immediately said grace goodbye to your excellency  come up peterplease come up called lady agnes from the top of the stairs  he mounted and when he found himself in the drawingroom with her and the door closed she expressed her great interest in his fine prospects and position which she wished to hear all about she rang for coffee and indicated the seat he would find most comfortable it shone before him for a moment that she would tell him he might if he wished light a cigar for peter had suddenly become restlesstoo restless to occupy a comfortable chair he seated himself in it only to jump up again and he went to the window while he imparted to his hostess the very little he knew about his post on hearing a vehicle drive up to the door a strong light had just been thrown into his mind and it grew stronger when looking out he saw grace dormer issue from the house in a hat and a jacket which had all the air of having been assumed with extraordinary speed her jacket was unbuttoned and her gloves still dangling from the hands with which she was settling her hat the vehicle into which she hastily sprang was a hansomcab which had been summoned by the butler from the doorstep and which rolled away with her after she had given an address  wheres grace going in such a hurry he asked of lady agnes to which she replied that she hadnt the least ideaher children at the pass they had all come to knocked about as they liked  well he sat down again he stayed a quarter of an hour and then he stayed longer and during this time his appreciation of what she had in her mind gathered force she showed him that precious quantity clearly enough though she showed it by no clumsy no voluntary arts it looked out of her sombre conscious eyes and quavered in her preoccupied perfunctory tones she took an extravagant interest in his future proceedings the probable succession of events in his career the different honours he would be likely to come in for the salary attached to his actual appointment the salary attached to the appointments that would followthey would be sure to wouldnt theyand what he might reasonably expect to save oh he must savelady agnes was an advocate of saving and he must take tremendous pains and get on and be clever and fiercely ambitious he must make himself indispensable and rise to the top she was urgent and suggestive and sympathetic she threw herself into the vision of his achievements and emoluments as if to appease a little the sore hunger with which nicks treachery had left her this was touching to her nephew who didnt remain unmoved even at those more importunate moments when as she fell into silence fidgeting feverishly with a morsel of fancywork she had plucked from a table her whole presence became an intense repressed appeal to him what that appeal would have been had it been uttered was oh peter take little biddy oh my dear young friend understand your interests at the same time that you understand mine be kind and reasonable and clever save me all further anxiety and tribulation and accept my lovely faultless child from my hands  that was what lady agnes had always meant more or less that was what grace had meant and they meant it with singular lucidity on the present occasion lady agnes meant it so much that from one moment to another he scarce knew what she might do and grace meant it so much that she had rushed away in a hansom to fetch her sister from the studio grace however was a fool for biddy certainly wouldnt come the news of his promotion had started them off adding point to their idea of his being an excellent match bringing home to them sharply the sense that if he were going away to strange countries he must take biddy with himthat something at all events must be settled about biddy before he went they had suddenly begun to throb poor things with alarm at the ebbing hours  strangely enough the perception of all this hadnt the effect of throwing him on the defensive and still less that of making him wish to bolt when once he had made sure what was in the air he recognised a propriety a real felicity in it couldnt deny that he was in certain ways a good match since it was quite probable he would go far and was even generous enoughas he had no fear of being materially dragged to the altarto enter into the conception that he might offer some balm to a mother who had had a horrid disappointment the feasibility of marrying biddy was not exactly augmented by the idea that his doing so would be a great offset to what nick had made lady agnes suffer but at least peter didnt dislike his strenuous aunt so much as to wish to punish her for her nature he was not afraid of her whatever she might do and though unable to grasp the practical relevancy of biddys being produced on the instant was willing to linger half an hour on the chance of successful production  there was meanwhile moreover a certain contagion in lady agness appealit made him appeal sensibly to himself since indeed as it is time to say the glass of our young mans spirit had been polished for that reflexion it was only at this moment really that he became inwardly candid while making up his mind that his only safety was in flight and taking the strong measure of a request for help toward it he was yet very conscious that another and probably still more effectual safeguardespecially if the two should be conjoinedlay in the hollow of his hand his sisters words in paris had come back to him and had seemed still wiser than when uttered shell save you disappointments youd know the worst that can happen to you and it wouldnt be bad julia had put it into a nutshellbiddy would probably save him disappointments and then she waswell she was biddy peter knew better what that was since the hour he had spent with her in rosedale road but he had brushed away the sense of it though aware that in doing so he took only halfmeasures and was even guilty of a sort of fraud upon himself if he was sincere in wishing to put a gulf between his future and that sad expanse of his past and present over which miriam had cast her shadow there was a very simple way to do so he had dodged this way dishonestly fixing on another which taken alone was far from being so good but lady agnes brought him back to it she held him in wellnigh confused contemplation of it during which the safety as julia had called it of the remedy wrought upon him as he wouldnt have believed beforehand and not least to the effect of sweetening of prettily colouring the pill it would be simple and it would deal with all his problems it would put an end to all alternatives which as alternatives were otherwise putting an end to him would be an excellent thing it would settle the whole question of his future and it was high time this should be settled  peter took two cups of coffee while he made out his future with lady agnes but though he drank them slowly he had finished them before biddy turned up he stayed threequarters of an hour saying to himself she wouldnt comewhy should she come lady agnes stooped to no avowal she really stooped so far as bald words went to no part of the business but she made him fix the next day save one for coming to dinner and her repeated declaration that there would be no one else not another creature but themselves had almost the force of the supplied form for a promise to pay in giving his word that he would come without fail and not write the next day to throw them over for some function he should choose to dub obligatory he felt quite as if he were putting his name to such a document he went away at halfpast three biddy of course hadnt come and he had been sure she wouldnt he couldnt imagine what graces idea had been nor what pretext she had put forward to her sister whatever these things biddy had seen through them and hated them peter could but like her the more for that     xl   lady agnes would doubtless have done better in her own interest or in that of her child to have secured his company for the very next evening this she had indeed attempted but her application of her thought had miscarried peter bethinking himself that he was importantly engaged her ladyship moreover couldnt presume to answer for nick since after all they must of course have nick though to tell the truth the hideous truth she and her son were scarcely on terms peter insisted on nick wished particularly to see him and gave his hostess notice that he would make each of them forgive everything to the other she returned that all her son had to forgive was her loving him more than her life and she would have challenged peter had he allowed it on the general ground of the comparative dignity of the two arts of painting portraits and governing nations our friend declined the challenge the most he did was to intimate that he perhaps saw nick more vividly as a painter than as a governor later he remembered vaguely something his aunt had said about their being a governing family  he was going by what he could ascertain to a very queer climate and had many preparations to make he gave his best attention to these and for a couple of hours after leaving lady agnes rummaged london for books from which he might extract information about his new habitat it made apparently no great figure in literature and peter could reflect that he was perhaps destined to find a salutary distraction in himself filling the void with a volume of impressions after he had resigned himself to necessary ignorance he went into the park he treated himself to an afternoon or two there when he happened to drop upon london in summerit refreshed his sense of the british interests he would have to stand up for moreover he had been hiding more or less and now all that was changed and this was the simplest way not to hide he met a host of friends made his situation as public as possible and accepted on the spot a great many invitations all subject however to the mental reservation that he should allow none of them to interfere with his being present the first night of miriams new venture he was going to the equator to get away from her but to repudiate the past with some decency of form he must show an affected interest if he could muster none other in an occasion that meant so much for her the least intimate of her associates would do that and peter remembered how at the expense of good manners he had stayed away from her first appearance on any stage at all he would have been shocked had he found himself obliged to go back to paris without giving her at the imminent crisis the personal countenance she had so good a right to expect  it was nearly eight oclock when he went to great stanhope street to dress for dinner and learn that a note awaiting him on the halltable and which bore the marks of hasty despatch had come three or four hours before it exhibited the signature of miriam rooth and let him know that she positively expected him at the theatre by eleven oclock the next morning for which hour a dressrehearsal of the revived play had been hurriedly projected the first night being now definitely fixed for the impending saturday she counted on his attendance at both ceremonies but with particular reasons for wishing to see him in the morning i want you to see and judge and tell me she said for my minds like a flogged horseit wont give another kick it was for the saturday he had made lady agnes his promise he had thought of the possibility of the play in doing so but had rested in the faith that from valid symptoms this complication would not occur till the following week he decided nothing on the spot as to the conflict of occupationsit was enough to send miriam three words to the effect that he would sooner perish than fail her on the morrow  he went to the theatre in the morning and the episode proved curious and instructive though there were twenty people in the stalls it bore little resemblance to those répétitions générales to which in paris his love of the drama had often attracted him and which taking place at night in the theatre closed to the public are virtually first performances with invited spectators they were to his sense always settled and stately rehearsals of the première even more than rehearsals of the play the present occasion was less august it was not so much a concert as a confusion of sounds and it took audible and at times disputatious counsel with itself it was rough and frank and spasmodic but was lively and vivid and in spite of the serious character of the piece often exceedingly droll while it gave sherringham oddly enough a more present sense than ever of bending over the hissing smoking sputtering caldron in which a palatable performance is stewed he looked into the gross darkness that may result from excess of light that is he understood how knocked up on the eve of production every one concerned in the preparation of a piece might be with nerves overstretched and glasses blurred awaiting the test and the response the echo to be given back by the big receptive artless stupid delightful public peters interest had been great in advance and as miriam since his arrival had taken him much into her confidence he knew what she intended to do and had discussed a hundred points with her they had differed about some of them and she had always said ah but wait till you see how i shall do it at the time that was usually her principal reason and her most convincing argument she had made some changes at the last hourshe was going to do several things in another way but she wanted a touchstone wanted a fresh ear and as she told sherringham when he went behind after the first act that was why she had insisted on this private trial to which a few fresh ears were to be admitted they didnt want to allow it her the theatre people they were such a parcel of donkeys but as to what she meant in general to insist on she had given them a hint she flattered herself they wouldnt soon forget  she spoke as if she had had a great battle with her fellowworkers and had routed them utterly it was not the first time he had heard her talk as if such a life as hers could only be a fighting life and of her frank measure of the fine uses of a faculty for making a row she rejoiced she possessed this faculty for she knew what to do with it and though there might be a certain swagger in taking such a stand in advance when one had done the infinitely little she had yet done she nevertheless trusted to the future to show how right she should have been in believing a pack of idiots would never hold out against her and would know they couldnt afford to her assumption of course was that she fought for the light and the right for the good way and the thorough for doing a thing properly if one did it at all what she had really wanted was the theatre closed for a night and the dressrehearsal put on for a few people given instead of yolande that she had not got but she would have it the next time she spoke as if her triumphs behind the scenes as well as before would go by leaps and bounds and he could perfectly see for the time that she would drive her coadjutors in front of her like sheep her tone was the sort of thing that would have struck one as preposterous if one hadnt believed in her but if one did so believe it only seemed thrown in with the other gifts how was she going to act that night and what could be said for such a hateful way of doing things she thrust on poor peter questions he was all unable to answer she abounded in superlatives and tremendously strong objections he had a sharper vision than usual of the queer fate for a peaceable man of being involved in a life of so violent a rhythm one might as well be hooked to a catharinewheel and whiz round in flame and smoke  it had only been for five minutes in the wing amid jostling and shuffling and shoving that they held this conference miriam splendid in a brocaded anachronism a false dress of the beginning of the century and excited and appealing imperious reckless and goodhumoured full of exaggerated propositions supreme determinations and comic irrelevancies showed as radiant a young head as the stage had ever seen other people quickly surrounded her and peter saw that though she wanted as she said a fresh ear and a fresh eye she was liable to rap out to those who possessed these advantages that they didnt know what they were talking about it was rather hard for her victimsbasil dashwood let him into this wonderfully painted and in a dress even more beautiful than miriams that of a young dandy under charles the second if you were not in the business you were one kind of donkey and if you were in the business you were another kind peter noted with a certain chagrin that gabriel nash had failed he preferred to base his annoyance on that ground when the girl after the remark just quoted from dashwood laughing and saying that at any rate the thing would do because it would just have to do thrust vindictively but familiarly into the young actors face a magnificent feather fan isnt he too lovely she asked and doesnt he know how to do it dashwood had the sense of costume even more than peter had inferred or supposed he minded inasmuch as it now appeared he had gone profoundly into the question of what the leading lady was to wear he had drawn patterns and hunted up stuffs had helped her to try on her clothes had bristled with ideas and pins it would not have been quite clear peters ground for resenting nashs cynical absence it may even be thought singular he should have missed him at any rate he flushed a little when their young woman of whom he inquired whether she hadnt invited her oldest and dearest friend made answer oh he says he doesnt like the kitchenfirehe only wants the pudding it would have taken the kitchenfire to account at that point for the red of sherringhams cheek and he was indeed uncomfortably heated by helping to handle as he phrased it the saucepans  this he felt so much after he had returned to his seat which he forbore to quit again till the curtain had fallen on the last act that in spite of the high beauty of that part of the performance of which miriam carried the weight there were moments when his relief overflowed into gasps as if he had been scrambling up the bank of a torrent after an immersion the girl herself out in the open of her field to win was of the incorruptible faith she had been saturated to good purpose with the great spirit of madame carré that was conspicuous while the play went on and she guarded the whole march with fagged piety and passion sherringham had never liked the piece itself he held that as barbarous in form and false in feeling it did little honour to the british theatre he despised many of the speeches pitied miriam for having to utter them and considered that lighted by that sort of candle the path of fame might very well lead nowhere  when the ordeal was over he went behind again where in the rosecoloured satin of the silly issue the heroine of the occasion said to him fancy my having to drag through that other stuff tonightthe brutes he was vague about the persons designated in this allusion but he let it pass he had at the moment a kind of detached foreboding of the way any gentleman familiarly connected with her in the future would probably form the habit of letting objurgations and some other things pass this had become indeed now a frequent state of mind with him the instant he was before her near her next her he found himself a helpless subject of the spell which so far at least as he was concerned she put forth by contact and of which the potency was punctual and absolute the fit came on as he said exactly as some esteemed expresstrain on a great line bangs at a given moment into the station at a distance he partly recovered himselfthat was the encouragement for going to the shaky republic but as soon as he entered her presence his life struck him as a thing disconnected from his will it was as if he himself had been one thing and his behaviour another he had shining views of this difference drawn as they might be from the coming yearslittle illustrative scenes in which he saw himself in strange attitudes of resignation always rather sad and still and with a slightly bent head such images should not have been inspiring but it is a fact that they were something to go upon the gentleman with the bent head had evidently given up something that was dear to him but it was exactly because he had got his price that he was there come and see me three or four hours hence miriam saidcome that is about six i shall rest till then but i want particularly to talk with you there will be no one elsenot the tip of any tiresome nose youll do me good so of course he drove up at six     xli   i dont know i havent the least idea i dont care dont ask meit was so he met some immediate appeal of her artistic egotism some challenge of his impression of her at this and that moment hadnt she frankly better give up such and such a point and return to their first idea the one they had talked over so much peter replied to this that he disowned all ideas that at any rate he should never have another as long as he lived and that so help him heaven they had worried that hard bone more than enough  youre tired of meyes already she said sadly and kindly they were alone her mother had not peeped out and she had prepared herself to return to the strand however it doesnt matter and of course your heads full of other things you must think me ravenously selfishperpetually chattering about my vulgar shop what will you have when ones a vulgar shopgirl you used to like it but then you werent an ambassador  what do you know about my being a minister he asked leaning back in his chair and showing sombre eyes sometimes he held her handsomer on the stage than off and sometimes he reversed that judgement the former of these convictions had held his mind in the morning and it was now punctually followed by the other as soon as she stepped on the boards a great and special alteration usually took place in hershe was in focus and in her frame yet there were hours too in which she wore her worlds face before the audience just as there were hours when she wore her stage face in the world she took up either mask as it suited her humour today he was seeing each in its order and feeling each the best i should know very little if i waited for you to tell methats very certain miriam returned its in the papers that youve got a high appointment but i dont read the papers unless theres something in them about myself next week i shall devour them and think them no doubt inane it was basil told me this afternoon of your promotionhe had seen it announced somewhere im delighted if it gives you more money and more advantages but dont expect me to be glad that youre going away to some distant disgusting country  the matter has only just been settled and weve each been busy with our own affairs but even if you hadnt given me these opportunities peter went on i should have tried to see you today to tell you my news and take leave of you  take leave arent you coming tomorrow  oh yes i shall see you through that but i shall rush away the very moment its over  i shall be much better thenreally i shall the girl said  the better you are the worse you are  she returned his frown with a beautiful charity if it would do you any good id be bad  the worse you are the better you are peter laughed youre a devouring demon  not a bit its you  its i i like that  its you who make trouble who are sore and suspicious and supersubtle not taking things as they come and for what they are but twisting them into misery and falsity oh ive watched you enough my dear friend and ive been sorry for youand sorry as well for myself for im not so taken up with myself in the low greedy sense as you think im not such a base creature im capable of gratitude im capable of affection one may live in paint and tinsel but one isnt absolutely without a soul yes ive got one the girl went on though i do smear my face and grin at myself in the glass and practise my intonations if what youre going to do is good for you im very glad if it leads to good things to honour and fortune and greatness im enchanted if it means your being away always for ever and ever of course thats serious you know iti neednt tell youi regard you as i really dont regard any one else ive a confidence in youah its a luxury youre a gentleman mon bonah youre a gentleman its just that and then you see you understand and thats a luxury too youre a luxury altogether dear clever mr sherringham your being where i shall never see you isnt a thing i shall enjoy i know that from the separation of these last monthsafter our beautiful life in paris the best thing that ever happened to me or that ever will but if its your career if its your happinesswell i can miss you and hold my tongue i can be disinterestedi can  what did you want me to come for he asked all attentive and motionless the same impression the old impression was with him again the sense that if she was sincere it was sincerity of execution if she was genuine it was the genuineness of doing it well she did it so well now that this very fact was charming and touching in claiming from him at the theatre this hour of the afternoon she had wanted honestly the more as she had not seen him at home for several days to go over with him once again on the eve of the great nightit would be for her second creation the critics would lie so in wait the first success might have been a flukesome of her recurrent doubts knowing from experience of what good counsel he often was how he could give a worrying question its settler at the last then she had heard from dashwood of the change in his situation and that had really from one moment to the other made her think sympathetically of his preoccupationsled her openhandedly to drop her own she was sorry to lose him and eager to let him know how good a friend she was conscious he had been to her but the expression of this was already at the end of a minute a strange bedevilment she began to listen to herself to speak dramatically to represent she uttered the things she felt as if they were snatches of old playbooks and really felt them the more because they sounded so well this however didnt prevent their really being as good feelings as those of anybody else and at the moment her friend to still a rising emotionwhich he knew he shouldnt stillarticulated the challenge i have just recorded she had for his sensibility at any rate the truth of gentleness and generosity  theres something the matter with you my dearyoure jealous miriam said youre jealous of poor mr dormer thats an example of the way you tangle everything up lord he wont hurt you nor me either  he cant hurt me certainly peter returned and neither can you for ive a nice little heart of stone and a smart new breastplate of iron the interest i take in you is something quite extraordinary but the most extraordinary thing in it is that its perfectly prepared to tolerate the interest of others  the interest of others neednt trouble it much miriam declared if mr dormer has broken off his marriage to such an awfully fine womanfor shes that your swell of a sisterit isnt for a ranting wretch like me hes kind to me because thats his nature and he notices me because thats his business but hes away up in the cloudsa thousand miles over my head he has got something on as they say hes in love with an idea i think its a shocking bad one but thats his own affair hes quite exalté living on nectar and ambrosiawhat he has to spare for us poor crawling things on earth is only a few dry crumbs i didnt even ask him to come to rehearsal besides he thinks youre in love with me and that it wouldnt be honourable to cut in hes capable of thatisnt it charming  if he were to relent and give up his scruples would you marry him peter asked  mercy how you chatter about marrying the girl laughed cest la maladie anglaiseyouve all got it on the brain  why i put it that way to please you he explained you complained to me last year precisely that this was not what seemed generally wanted  oh last yearshe made nothing of that then differently yes its very tiresome she conceded  you told me moreover in paris more than once that you wouldnt listen to anything but that  well she declared i wont but i shall wait till i find a husband whos charming enough and bad enough one wholl beat me and swindle me and spend my money on other womenthats the sort of man for me mr dormer delightful as he is doesnt come up to that  youll marry basil dashwood he spoke it with conviction  oh marrycall it marry if you like thats what poor mother threatens me withshe lives in dread of it  to this hour he mentioned i havent managed to make out what your mother wants she has so many ideas as madame carré said  she wants me to be some sort of tremendous creatureall her ideas are reducible to that what makes the muddle is that she isnt clear about the creature she wants most a great actress or a great ladysometimes she inclines for one and sometimes for the other but on the whole persuading herself that a great actress if shell cultivate the right people may be a great lady when i tell her that wont do and that a great actress can never be anything but a great vagabond then the dear old thing has tantrums and we have scenesthe most grotesque theyd make the fortune for a subject of some playwriting rascal if he had the wit to guess them which luckily for us perhaps he never will she usually winds up by protestingdevinez un peu quoi miriam added and as her companion professed his complete inability to divine by declaring that rather than take it that way i must marry you  shes shrewder than i thought peter returned its the last of vanities to talk about but i may state in passing that if youd marry me you should be the greatest of all possible ladies  she had a beautiful comical gape lord o mercy my dear fellow what natural capacity have i for that  youre artist enough for anything i shall be a great diplomatist my resolutions firmly taken im infinitely cleverer than you have the least idea of and you shall be he went on a great diplomatists wife  and the demon the devil the devourer and destroyer that you are so fond of talking about what in such a position do you do with that element of my nature où le fourrezvous she cried as with a real anxiety  ill look after it ill keep it under rather perhaps i should say ill bribe it and amuse it ill gorge it with earthly grandeurs  thats better said miriam for a demon thats kept under is a shabby little demon dont lets be shabby then she added do you really go away the beginning of next week  monday night if possible  ah thats but to paris before you go to your new post they must give you an interval here  i shant take itim so tremendously keen for my duties i shall insist on going sooner oh he went on i shall be concentrated now  ill come and act there she met it allshe was amused and amusing ive already forgotten what it was i wanted to discuss with you she saidit was some trumpery stuff what i want to say now is only one thing that its not in the least true that because my life pitches me in every direction and mixes me up with all sorts of peopleor rather with one sort mainly poor dearsi havent a decent character i havent common honesty your sympathy your generosity your patience your precious suggestions our dear sweet days last summer in paris i shall never forget youre the bestyoure different from all the others think of me as you please and make profane jokes about my mating with a disguised artyi shall think of you only in one way ive a great respect for you with all my heart i hope youll be a great diplomatist god bless you dear clever man  she got up as she spoke and in so doing glanced at the clocka movement that somehow only added to the noble gravity of her discourse she was considering his time so much more than her own sherringham at this rising too took out his watch and stood a moment with his eyes bent upon it though without in the least seeing what the needles marked youll have to go to reach the theatre at your usual hour wont you let me not keep you that is let me keep you only long enough just to say this once for all as i shall never speak of it again im going away to save myself he frankly said planted before her and seeking her eyes with his own i ought to go no doubt in silence in decorum in virtuous submission to hard necessitywithout asking for credit or sympathy without provoking any sort of scene or calling attention to my fortitude but i cantupon my soul i cant i can go i can see it through but i cant hold my tongue i want you to know all about it so that over there when im bored to death i shall at least have the exasperatingly vain consolation of feeling that you do knowand that it does neither you nor me any good  he paused a moment on which as quite vague she appealed that i do know what  that ive a consuming passion for you and that its impossible  oh impossible my friend she sighed but with a quickness in her assent  very good it interferes the gratification of it would interfere fatally with the ambition of each of us our ambitions are inferior and odious but were tied fast to them  ah why aint we simple she quavered as if all touched by it why aint we of the peoplecomme tout le mondejust a man and a girl liking each other  he waited a littleshe was so tenderly mocking so sweetly ambiguous because were precious asses however im simple enough after all to care for you as ive never cared for any human creature you have as it happens a personal charm for me that no one has ever approached and from the top of your splendid head to the sole of your theatrical shoe i could go down on my facethere abjectlyand kiss it every inch of you is dear and delightful to me therefore goodbye  she took this in with wider eyes he had put the matter in a way that struck her for a moment all the same he was afraid she would reply as on the confessed experience of so many such tributes handsome as this one was but she was too much movedthe pure colour that had risen to her face showed itto have recourse to this particular facility she was moved even to the glimmer of tears though she gave him her hand with a smile im so glad youve said all that for from you i know what it means certainly its better for you to go away of course its all wrong isnt itbut thats the only thing it can be therefore its all right isnt it some day when were both great people well talk these things over then we shall be quiet we shall be rich we shall be at peacelet us hope so at leastand better friends than others about us will know she paused smiling still and then said while he held her hand dont dont come tomorrow night  with this she attempted to draw her hand away as if everything were settled and over but the effect of her movement was that as he held her tight he was simply drawn toward her and close to her the effect of this in turn was that releasing her only to possess her the more completely he seized her in his arms and breathing deeply i love you you know clasped her in a long embrace his demonstration and her conscious sufferance almost equally liberal so sustained themselves that the door of the room had time to open slowly before either had taken notice mrs rooth who had not peeped in before peeped in now becoming in this manner witness of an incident she could scarce have counted on the unexpected indeed had for mrs rooth never been an insuperable element in things it was her position in general to be too acquainted with all the passions for any crude surprise as the others turned round they saw her stand there and smile and heard her ejaculate with wise indulgence oh you extravagant children  miriam brushed off her tears quickly but unconfusedly hes going away the wretch hes bidding us farewell  peterit was perhaps a result of his acute agitationlaughed out at the us he had already laughed at the charge of puerility and mrs rooth went on going away ah then i must have one too she held out both her hands and sherringham stepping forward to take them kissed her respectfully on each cheek in the foreign manner while she continued our dear old friendour kind gallant gentleman  the gallant gentleman has been promoted to a great postthe proper reward of his gallantry miriam said hes going out as minister to some impossible placewhere is it  as ministerhow very charming we are getting on and their companion languished up at him with a world of approval  oh well enough one must take what one can get he answered  youll get everything now im sure shant you mrs rooth asked with an inflexion that called back to him comicallythe source of the sound was so differentthe very vibrations he had heard the day before from lady agnes  hes going to glory and hell forget all about usforget he has ever known such low people so we shall never see him again and its better so goodbye goodbye miriam repeated the brougham must be there but i wont take you i want to talk to mother about you and we shall say things not fit for you to hear oh ill let you know what we losedont be afraid she added to mrs rooth hes the rising star of diplomacy  i knew it from the firsti know how things turn out for such people as you cried the old woman gazing fondly at sherringham but you dont mean to say youre not coming tomorrow night  dontdont its great folly miriam interposed and its quite needless since you saw me today  peter turned from the mother to the daughter the former of whom broke out to the latter oh you dear rogue to say one has seen you yet you know how youll come up to ityoull be beyond everything  yes i shall be therecertainly peter said at the door to mrs rooth  oh you dreadful goose miriam called after him but he went out without looking round at her     book seventh     xlii   nick dormer had for the hour quite taken up his abode at his studio where biddy usually arrived after breakfast to give him news of the state of affairs in calcutta gardens and where many letters and telegrams were now addressed him among such missives on the morning of the saturday on which peter sherringham had promised to dine at the other house was a note from miriam rooth informing nick that if he shouldnt telegraph to put her off she would turn up about halfpast eleven probably with her mother for just one more sitting she added that it was a nervous day for her and that she couldnt keep still so that it would really be very kind to let her come to him as a refuge she wished to stay away from the theatre where everything was now settledor so much the worse for the others if it wasnttill the evening in spite of which she should if left to herself be sure to go there it would keep her quiet and soothe her to sithe could keep her quiet he was such a blessing that way at any time therefore she would give him two or three hoursor rather she would herself ask for themif he didnt positively turn her from the door  it had not been definite to nick that he wanted another sitting at all for the slight work as he held it to be that miriam had already helped him to achieve he regarded this work as a mere light windfall of the shaken tree he had made what he could of it and would have been embarrassed to make more if it was not finished this was because it was not finishable at any rate he had said all he had to say in that particular phrase the young man in truth was not just now in the highest spirits his imagination had within two or three days become conscious of a check that he tried to explain by the idea of a natural reaction any decision or violent turn any need of a new sharp choice in ones career was upsetting and exaggerate that importance and ones own as little as one would a deal of flurry couldnt help attending especially in the face of so much scandal the horrid act odious to ones modesty at the best of changing ones clothes in the marketplace that made life not at all positively pleasant yet decidedly thrilling for the hour and it was well enough till the thrill abated when this occurred as it inevitably would the romance and the glow of the adventure were exchanged for the chill and the prose it was to these latter elements he had waked up pretty wide on this particular morning and the prospect was not appreciably fresher from the fact that he had warned himself in advance it would be dull he had in fact known how dull it would be but now he would have time to learn even better a reaction was a reaction but it was not after all a catastrophe it would be a feature of his very freedom that he should ask himself if he hadnt made a great mistake this privilege would doubtless even remain within the limits of its nature in exposing him to hours of intimate conviction of his madness but he would live to retract his retractationsthis was the first thing to bear in mind  he was absorbed even while he dressed in the effort to achieve intelligibly to himself some such revolution when by the first post miriams note arrived at first it did little to help his agilityit made him seeing her esthetic faith as so much stronger and simpler than his own wonder how he should keep with her at her high level ambition in her was always on the rush and she was not a person to conceive that others might in bad moments listen for the trumpet in vain it would never have occurred to her that only the day before he had spent a part of the afternoon quite at the bottom of the hill he had in fact turned into the national gallery and had wandered about there for more than an hour and it was just while he did so that the immitigable recoil had begun perversely to make itself felt the perversity was all the greater from the fact that if the experience was depressing this was not because he had been discouraged beyond measure by the sight of the grand things that had been donethings so much grander than any that would ever bear his signature that variation he was duly acquainted with and should know in abundance again what had happened to him as he passed on this occasion from titian to rubens and from gainsborough to rembrandt was that he found himself calling the whole exhibited art into question what was it after all at the best and why had people given it so high a place its weakness its limits broke upon him tacitly blaspheming he looked with a lustreless eye at the palpable polished toned objects designed for suspension on hooks that is he blasphemed if it were blasphemy to feel that as bearing on the energies of man they were a poor and secondary show the human force producing them was so far from one of the greatest their place was a small place and their connexion with the heroic life casual and slight they represented so little great ideas and it was great ideas that kept the world from chaos he had incontestably been in much closer relation with them a few months before than he was today it made up a great deal for what was false and hollow what was merely personal in politics that were the idea greater or smaller they could at their best so directly deal with it the love of it had really been much of the time at the bottom of his impulse to follow them up though this was not what he had most talked of with his political friends or even with julia no political as julia was he had not conferred with her much about the idea however this might have been his own fault quite as much as hers and she in fact took such things such enthusiasms for grantedthere was an immense deal in every way that she took for granted on the other hand he had often put forward this brighter side of the care for the public weal in his discussions with gabriel nash to the end it is true of making that worthy scoff aloud at what he was pleased to term his hypocrisy gabriel maintained precisely that there were more ideas more of those that man lived by in a single room of the national gallery than in all the statutes of parliament nick had replied to this more than once that the determination of what man did live by was required to which nash had retorted and it was very rarely that he quoted scripture that it was at any rate not by bread and beans alone the statutes of parliament gave him bread and beans tout au plus  nick had at present no pretension of trying this question over again he reminded himself that his ambiguity was subjective as the philosophers said the result of a mood which in due course would be at the mercy of another mood it made him curse and cursing as a finality lacked firmnessone had to drive in posts somewhere under the greatest time to do ones work was when it didnt seem worth doing for then one gave it a brilliant chance that of resisting the stiffest test of allthe test of striking one as too bad to do the most when there would be the least to be got by it was to be most in the spirit of high production one thing at any rate was certain nick reflected nothing on earth would induce him to change back againnot even if this twilight of the soul should last for the rest of his days he hardened himself in his posture with a good conscience which had they had a glimpse of it would have made him still more diverting to those who already thought him so and now by a happy chance miriam suddenly supplied the bridge correcting the gap in his continuity if he had made his sketch it was a proof he had done her and that he had done her flashed upon him as a sign that she would be still more feasible art was doingit came back to thatwhich politics in most cases werent he thus to pursue our image planted his supports in the dimness beneath all cursing and on the platform so improvised was able in his relief to dance he sent out a telegram to balaklava place requesting his beautiful sitter by no manner of means to fail him when his servant came back it was to usher into the studio peter sherringham whom the man had apparently found at the door  the hour was so early for general commerce that nick immediately guessed his visitor had come on some rare errand but this inference yielded to the reflexion that peter might after all only wish to make up by present zeal for not having been near him before he forgot that as he had subsequently learned from biddy their foreign or all but foreign cousin had spent an hour in rosedale road missing him there but pulling out miriams portrait the day of his own last visit to beauclere these young men were not on a ceremonious footing and it was not in nicks nature to keep a record of civilities rendered or omitted nevertheless he had been vaguely conscious that during a stay in london elastic enough on peters part he and his kinsman had foregathered less than of yore it was indeed an absorbing moment in the career of each but even while recognising such a truth nick judged it not impossible that julias brother might have taken upon himself to resent some suppositions failure of consideration for that lady though this indeed would have been stupid and the newly appointed minister to he had forgotten where didnt often make mistakes nick held that as he had treated julia with studious generosity she had nothing whatever to visit on himwherefore peter had still less it was at any rate none of that gentlemans business there were only two abatements to disposing in a few frank words of all this one of them nicks general hatred of talking of his private affairs a reluctance in which he and peter were well matched and the other a truth involving more of a confessionthe subtle truth that the most definite and even most soothing result of the collapse of his engagement was as happened an unprecedented consciousness of freedom nicks observation was of a different sort from his cousins he noted much less the signs of the hour and kept throughout a looser register of life nevertheless just as one of our young men had during these days in london found the air peopled with personal influences the concussion of human atoms so the other though only asking to live without too many questions and work without too many rubs to be glad and sorry in short on easy terms had become aware of a certain social tightness of the fact that life is crowded and passion restless accident and community inevitable everybody with whom one had relations had other relations too and even indifference was a mixture and detachment a compromise the only wisdom was to consent to the loss if necessary of everything but ones temper and to the ruin if necessary of everything but ones work it must be added that peters relative took precautions against irritation perhaps in excess of the danger as departing travellers about to whiz through foreign countries mouth in phrasebooks combinations of words they will never use he was at home in clear air and disliked to struggle either for breath or for light he had a dim sense that peter felt some discomfort from him and might have come now to tell him so in which case he should be sorry for the sufferer in various ways but as soon as that aspirant began to speak suspicion reverted to mere ancient kindness and this in spite of the fact that his speech had a slightly exaggerated promptitude like the promptitude of business which might have denoted selfconsciousness to nick it quickly appeared better to be glad than to be sorry this simple argument was more than sufficient to make him glad peter was there  my dear fellow its an unpardonable hour isnt it i wasnt even sure youd be up yet had to risk it because my hours are numbered im going away tomorrow peter went on ive a thousand things to do ive had no talk with you this time such as we used to have of old its an irreparable loss but its your fault you know and as ive got to rush about all day i thought id just catch you before any one else does  some one has already caught me but theres plenty of time nick returned  peter all but asked a questionit fell short i see i see im sorry to say ive only a few minutes at best  man of crushing responsibilities youve come to humiliate me his companion cried i know all about it  its more than i do then thats not what ive come for but i shall be delighted if i humiliate you a little by the way ive two things in mind and ill mention the most difficult first i came here the other daythe day after my arrival in town  ah yes so you did it was very good of younick remembered i ought to have returned your visit or left a card or written my nameto have done something in great stanhope street oughtnt i you hadnt got this new thing then or id have called  peter eyed him a moment i say whats the matter with you am i really unforgivable for having taken that liberty  what liberty nick looked now quite innocent of care and indeed his visitors allusion was not promptly clear he was thinking for the instant all of biddy of whom and whose secret inclinations grace had insisted on talking to him they were none of his business and if he wouldnt for the world have let the girl herself suspect he had violent lights on what was most screened and curtained in her much less would he have made peter a clumsy present of this knowledge grace had a queer theory that peter treated biddy badlytreated them all somehow badly but graces zeal she had plenty of it though she affected all sorts of fine indifference almost always took the form of her being unusually wrong nick wanted to do only what biddy would thank him for and he knew very well what she wouldnt she wished him and peter to be great friends and the only obstacle to this was that peter was too much of a diplomatist peter made him for an instant think of her and of the hour they had lately spent together in the studio in his absencean hour of which biddy had given him a history full of items and omissions and this in turn brought nicks imagination back to his visitors own side of the matter that general human complexity of which the sense had lately increased with him and to which it was owing that any thread one might take hold of would probably be the extremely wrong end of something was illustrated by the fact that while poor biddy was thinking of peter it was ten to one poor peter was thinking of miriam rooth all of which danced before nicks intellectual vision for a space briefer than my too numerous words  i pitched into your treasuresi rummaged among your canvases peter said biddy had nothing whatever to do with itshe maintained an attitude of irreproachable reserve it has been on my conscience all these days and i ought to have done penance before ive been putting it off partly because im so ashamed of my indiscretion que voulezvous my dear chap my provocation was great i heard you had been painting miss rooth so that i couldnt restrain my curiosity i simply went into that corner and struck out therea trifle wildly no doubt i dragged the young lady to the lightyour sister turned pale as she saw me it was a good deal like breaking open one of your letters wasnt it however i assure you its all right for i congratulate you both on your style and on your correspondent  youre as clever as witty as humorous as ever old boy nick pronounced going himself into the corner designated by his companion and laying his hands on the same canvas your curiositys the highest possible tribute to my little attempt and your sympathy sets me right with myself there she is again nick went on thrusting the picture into an empty frame you shall see her whether you wish to or not  right with yourself you dont mean to say youve been wrong peter returned standing opposite the portrait  oh i dont know ive been kicking up such a row anythings better than a row  shes awfully goodshes awfully true said peter youve done more to her since the other day youve put in several things  yes but ive worked distractedly ive not altogether conformed to the good rule about being off with the old love  with the old loveand the visitor looked hard at the picture  before youre on with the new nick had no sooner uttered these words than he coloured it occurred to him his friend would probably infer an allusion to julia he therefore added quickly it isnt so easy to cease to represent an affectionate constituency really most of my time for a fortnight has been given to letterwriting theyve all been unexpectedly charming i should have thought theyd have loathed and despised me but not a bit of it they cling to me fondlythey struggle with me tenderly ive been down to talk with them about it and weve passed the most sociable delightful hours ive designated my successor ive felt a good deal like the emperor charles the fifth when about to retire to the monastery of yuste the more ive seen of them in this way the more ive liked them and they declare it has been the same with themselves about me we spend our time assuring each other we hadnt begun to know each other till now in short its all wonderfully jolly but it isnt business cest magnifique mais ce nest pas la guerre  theyre not so charming as they might be if they dont offer to keep you and let you paint  they do almostits fantastic said nick remember they havent yet seen a daub of my brush  well im sorry for you we live in too enlightened an age peter returned you cant suffer for artthat grand romance is over your experience is interesting it seems to show that at the tremendous pitch of civilisation weve reached you cant suffer from anything but hunger  i shall doubtless nick allowed do that enough to make up for the rest  never never when you paint so well as this  oh come youre too good to be true nick said but where did you learn that ones larders full in proportion as ones works fine  peter waived this curious pointhe only continued to look at the picture after which he roundly brought out ill give you your price for it on the spot  ah youre so magnanimous that you shall have it for nothing and nick touched to gratitude passed his arm into his visitors  peter had a pause why do you call me magnanimous  oh bless my soul its hersi forgot laughed nick failing in his turn to answer the others inquiry but you shall have another  another are you going to do another  this very morning that is i shall begin it ive heard from her shes coming to sita short time hence  peter turned away a little at this releasing himself and as if the movement had been an effect of his hosts words looked at his watch earnestly to dissipate that appearance he fell back to consider the work from further off the more you do her the bettershe has all the qualities of a great model from that point of view its a pity she has another trade she might make so good a thing of this one but how shall you do her again he asked ingenuously  oh i can scarcely say well arrange something well talk it over its extraordinary how well she enters into what one wants she knows more than one does ones self she isnt as you frenchmen say the first comer however you know all about that since you invented her didnt you thats what she says shes awfully sweet on you nick kindly pursued what i ought to do is to try something as different as possible from that thing not the sibyl the muse the tremendous creature but the charming woman the person one knows differently arranged as she appears en ville she calls it ill do something really serious and send it to you out there with my respects it will remind you of home and perhaps a little even of me if she knows its for you shell throw herself into it in the right spirit leave it to us my dear fellow well turn out something splendid  its jolly to hear you but i shall send you a cheque said peter very stoutly  i suppose its all right in your position but youre too proud his kinsman answered  what do you mean by my position  your exaltation your high connexion with the country your treating with sovereign powers as the representative of a sovereign power isnt that what they call em  peter who had turned round again listened to this with his eyes fixed on nicks face while he once more drew forth his watch brute he exclaimed familiarly at the same time dropping his eyes on the watch when did you say you expect your sitter  oh weve plenty of time dont be afraid of letting me see you agitated by her presence  brute peter again ejaculated  this friendly personal note cleared the air made their communication closer stay with me and talk to me said nick i daresay its good for me it may be the last time i shall see you without having before anything else to kootoo  beast his kinsman once more and a little helplessly threw off though next going on havent you something more to show me thensome other fruit of your genius  must i bribe you by setting my signboards in a row you know what ive done by which i mean of course you know what i havent my genius as youre so good as to call it has hitherto been dreadfully sterile ive had no time no opportunity no continuity i must go and sit down in a corner and learn my alphabet that thing isnt good what i shall do for you wont be good dont protest my dear fellow nothing will be fit to look at for a long time after which poor nick wound up and think of my ridiculous age as the good people say or dont they say it its a rum go it wont be amusing  ah youre so clever youll get on fast peter returned trying to think how he could most richly defy the injunction not to protest  i mean it wont be amusing for others said nick unperturbed by this levity they want results and small blame to them  well whatever you do dont talk like mr gabriel nash peter went on sometimes i think youre just going to  nick stared a moment ah he never would have said that they want results the damned assesthat would have been more in his key  its the difference of a nuance and are you extraordinarily happy peter added as his host now obliged him by arranging halfadozen canvases so that he could look at them  not so much so doubtless as the artistic life ought to make one because all ones people are not so infatuated as ones electors but little by little im learning the charm of pigheadedness  your mothers very bad peter allowedi lunched with her day before yesterday  yes i know i knownick had such reason to know but its too late too late i must just peg away here and not mind ive after all a great advantage in my life  his companion waited impartially to hear and that would be  well knowing what i want to do thats everything you know  its an advantage however that youve only just come in for isnt it  yes but the delay and the probation only make me prize it the more ive got it now and it makes up for the absence of some other things  again peter had a pause that sounds a little flat he remarked at last  it depends on what you compare it with it has more point than i sometimes found in the house of commons  oh i never thought i should like that  there was another drop during which nick moved about the room turning up old sketches to see if he had anything more to show while his visitor continued to look at the unfinished and in some cases as seemed unpromising productions already exposed they were far less interesting than the portrait of miriam rooth and it would have appeared less significant of ability for that particular effort nicks talent had taken an inspired flight so much peter thought as he had thought it intensely before but the words he presently uttered had no visible connexion with it they only consisted of the abrupt inquiry have you heard anything from julia  not a syllable have you  dear no she never writes to me  but wont she on the occasion of your promotion  i daresay not said peter and this was the only reference to mrs dallow that passed between her brother and her late intended it left a slight stir of the air which peter proceeded to allay by an allusion comparatively speaking more relevant he expressed disappointment that biddy shouldnt have come in having had an idea she was always in rosedale road of a morning that was the other branch of his present errandthe wish to see her and give her a message for lady agnes upon whom at so early an hour he had not presumed to intrude in calcutta gardens nick replied that biddy did in point of fact almost always turn up and for the most part early she came to wish him goodmorning and start him for the day she was a devoted electra laying a cool healing hand on a distracted perspiring orestes he reminded peter however that he would have a chance of seeing her that evening and of seeing lady agnes for wasnt he to do them the honour of dining in calcutta gardens biddy the day before had arrived full of that excitement peter explained that this was exactly the sad subject of his actual démarche the project of the dinner in calcutta gardens had to his exceeding regret fallen to pieces the fact was didnt nick know it the night had been suddenly and perversely fixed for miriams première and he was under a definite engagement with her not to stay away from it to add to the bore of the thing he was obliged to return to paris the very next morning he was quite awfully sorry for he had promised lady agnes he didnt understand then about miriams affair in regard to which he had given a previous pledge he was more grieved than he could say but he could never fail miss rooth he had professed from the first an interest in her which he must live up to a little more this was his last chancehe hadnt been near her at the trying time of her first braving of the public and the second night of the play wouldnt doit must be the first or nothing besides he couldnt wait over till monday  while peter recited all his hindrance nick was occupied in rubbing with a cloth a palette he had just scraped i see what you meanim very sorry too im sorry you cant give my mother this joyi give her so little  my dear fellow you might give her a little more it came to peter to say its rather too much to expect me to make up for your omissions  nick looked at him with a moments fixedness while he polished the palette and for that moment he felt the temptation to reply theres a way you could do that to a considerable extenti think you guess itwhich wouldnt be intrinsically disagreeable but the impulse passed without expressing itself in speech and he simply brought out you can make this all clear to biddy when she comes and shell make it clear to my mother  poor little biddy peter mentally sighed thinking of the girl with that job before her but what he articulated was that this was exactly why he had come to the studio he had inflicted his company on lady agnes the previous thursday and had partaken of a meal with her but had not seen biddy though he had waited for her had hoped immensely shed come in now hed wait againdear bid was thoroughly worth it  patience patience thenyouve always me said nick to which he subjoined if its a question of going to the play i scarcely see why you shouldnt dine at my mothers all the same people go to the play after dinner  yes but it wouldnt be fair it wouldnt be decent its a case when i must be in my seat from the rise of the curtain peter about this was thoroughly lucid i should force your mother to dine an hour earlier than usual and then in return for her courtesy should go off to my entertainment at eight oclock leaving her and grace and biddy languishing there i wish i had proposed in time that they should go with me he continued not very ingenuously  you might do that still nick suggested  oh at this time of day it would be impossible to get a box  ill speak to miss rooth about it if you like when she comes smiled nick  no it wouldnt do said peter turning away and looking once more at his watch he made tacitly the addition that still less than asking lady agnes for his convenience to dine early would this be decent would it be thinkable his taking biddy the night he dined with her and with miss tressilian had been something very like a violation of those proprieties he couldnt say that however to the girls brother who remarked in a moment that it was all right since peters action left him his own freedom  your own freedomand peters question made him turn  why you see now i can go to the theatre myself  certainly i hadnt thought of that youd naturally have been going  i gave it up for the prospect of your company at home  upon my word youre too goodi dont deserve such sacrifices said peter who read in his kinsmans face that this was not a figure of speech but the absolute truth didnt it however occur to you that as it would turn out i mighti even naturally wouldmyself be going he put forth  nick broke into a laugh it would have occurred to me if i understood a little better but he paused as still too amused  if you understood a little better what  your situation simply  peter looked at him a moment dine with me tonight by ourselves and at a club well go to the theatre together and then youll understand it  with pleasure with pleasure well have a jolly evening said nick  call it jolly if you like when did you say she was coming peter asked  biddy oh probably as i tell you at any moment  i mean the great miriam peter amended  the great miriam if shes punctual will be here in about forty minutes  and will she be likely to find your sister  that will depend my dear fellow on whether my sister remains to see her  exactly but the points whether youll allow her to remain isnt it  nick looked slightly mystified why shouldnt she do as she likes  in that case shell probably go  yes unless she stays  dont let her peter dropped send her away and to explain this he added it doesnt seem exactly the right sort of thing fresh young creatures like bid meeting des femmes de théâtre his explanation in turn struck him as requiring another clause so he went on at least it isnt thought the right sort of thing abroad and even in england my foreign ideas stick to me  even with this amplification however his plea evidently still had for his companion a flaw which after he had considered it a moment nick exposed in the simple words why you originally introduced them in paris biddy and miss rooth didnt they meet at your rooms and fraternise and wasnt that much more abroad than this  so they did but my hand had been forced and she didnt like it peter answered suspecting that for a diplomatist he looked foolish  miss rooth didnt like it nick persisted  that i confess ive forgotten besides she wasnt an actress then what i mean is that biddy wasnt particularly pleased with her  why she thought her wonderfulpraised her to the sides i remember that  she didnt like her as a woman she praised her as an actress  i thought you said she wasnt an actress then nick returned  peter had a pause oh biddy thought so she has seen her since moreover i took her the other night and her curiositys satisfied  its not of any consequence and if theres a reason for it ill bundle her off directly nick made haste to say but the great miriam seems such a kind good person  so she is charming charmingand his visitor looked hard at him  here comes biddy now nick went on i hear her at the door you can warn her yourself  it isnt a question of warningthats not in the least my idea but ill take biddy away said peter  that will be still more energetic  no it will be simply more selfishi like her company peter had turned as if to go to the door and meet the girl but he quickly checked himself lingering in the middle of the room and the next instant biddy had come in when she saw him there she also stopped     xliii   come on boldly my dear said nick peters bored to death waiting for you  ah hes come to say he wont dine with us tonight biddy stood with her hand on the latch  i leave town tomorrow ive everything to do im brokenhearted its impossiblepeter made of it again such a case as he could please make my peace with your motherim ashamed of not having written to her last night  she closed the door and came in while her brother said to her how in the world did you guess it  i saw it in the morning post and she kept her eyes on their kinsman  in the morning post he vaguely echoed  i saw theres to be a first night at that theatre the one you took us to so i said oh hell go there  yes ive got to do that too peter admitted  shes going to sit to me again this morning his wonderful actressshe has made an appointment so you see im getting on nick pursued to his sister  oh im so gladshes so splendid the girl looked away from her cousin now but not though it seemed to fill the place at the triumphant portrait of miriam rooth  im delighted youve come in i have waited for you peter hastened to declare to her though conscious that this was in the conditions meagre  arent you coming to see us again  im in despair but i shall really not have time therefore its a blessing not to have missed you here  im very glad said biddy then she added and youre going to americato stay a long time  till im sent to some better place  and will that better place be as far away  oh biddy it wouldnt be better then said peter  do you mean theyll give you something to do at home  hardly that but ive a tremendous lot to do at home today for the twentieth time peter referred to his watch  she turned to her brother who had admonished her that she might bid him goodmorning she kissed him and he asked what the news would be in calcutta gardens to which she made answer the only news is of course the great preparations theyre making poor dears for peter mamma thinks you must have had such a nasty dinner the other day the girl continued to the guest of that romantic occasion  faithless peter said nick beginning to whistle and to arrange a canvas in anticipation of miriams arrival  dear biddy thank your stars youre not in my horrid profession protested the personage so designated ones bowled about like a cricketball unable to answer for ones freedom or ones comfort from one moment to another  oh ours is the true professionbiddys and mine nick broke out setting up his canvas the career of liberty and peace of charming long mornings spent in a still north light and in the contemplation i may even say in the company of the amiable and the beautiful  that certaintys the case when biddy comes to see you peter returned  biddy smiled at him i come every day anchio son pittore i encourage nick awfully  its a pity im not a martyrshed bravely perish with me nick said  you areyoure a martyrwhen people say such odious things the girl cried they do say them ive heard many more than ive repeated to you  its you yourself then indignant and loyal who are the martyr observed peter who wanted greatly to be kind to her  oh i dont carebut she threw herself flushed and charming into a straight appeal to him dont you think one can do as much good by painting great works of art as byas by what papa used to do dont you think arts necessary to the happiness to the greatness of a people dont you think its manly and honourable do you think a passion for its a thing to be ashamed of dont you think the artistthe conscientious the serious oneis as distinguished a member of society as any one else  peter and nick looked at each other and laughed at the way she had got up her subject and nick asked their kinsman if she didnt express it all in perfection i delight in general in artists but i delight still more in their defenders peter made reply perhaps a little meagrely to biddy  ah dont attack me if youre wise nick said  ones tempted to when it makes biddy so fine  well thats the way she encourages me its meat and drink to me nick went on at the same time im bound to say theres a little whistling in the dark in it  in the dark his sister demanded  the obscurity my dear child of your own aspirations your mysterious ambitions and esthetic views arent there some heavyish shadows there  why i never cared for politics  no but you cared for life you cared for society and youve chosen the path of solitude and concentration  you horrid boy said biddy  give it up that arduous steepgive it up and come out with me peter interposed  come out with you  let us walk a little or even drive a little let us at any rate talk a little  i thought you had so much to do biddy candidly objected  so i have but why shouldnt you do a part of it with me would there be any harm im going to some tiresome shopsyoull cheer the frugal hour  the girl hesitated then turned to nick would there be any harm  oh its none of his business peter protested  he had better take you home to your mother  im going homei shant stay here today biddy went on then to peter i came in a hansom but i shall walk back come that way with me  with pleasure but i shall not be able to go in peter added  oh thats no matter said the girl goodbye nick  you understand then that we dine togetherat seven sharp wouldnt a club as i say be best peter before going inquired of nick he suggested further which club it should be and his words led biddy who had directed her steps toward the door to turn a moment as with a reproachful questionwhether it was for this peter had given up calcutta gardens but her impulse if impulse it was had no sequel save so far as it was a sequel that peter freely explained to her after nick had assented to his conditions that her brother too had a desire to go to miss rooths first night and had already promised to accompany him  oh thats perfect it will be so good for himwont itif hes going to paint her again biddy responded  i think theres nothing so good for him as that he happens to have such a sister as you peter declared as they went out he heard at the same time the sound of a carriage stopping and before biddy who was in front of him opened the door of the house had been able to say to himself what a boretheres miriam the opened door showed him that truththis young lady in the act of alighting from the brougham provided by basil dashwoods thrifty zeal her mother followed her and both the new visitors exclaimed and rejoiced in their demonstrative way as their eyes fell on their valued friend the door had closed behind peter but he instantly and violently rang so that they should be admitted with as little delay as possible while he stood disconcerted and fearing he showed it by the prompt occurrence of an encounter he had particularly sought to avert it ministered moreover a little to this sensibility that miriam appeared to have come somewhat before her time the incident promised however to pass off in a fine florid way before he knew it both the ladies had taken possession of biddy who looked at them with comparative coldness tempered indeed by a faint glow of apprehension and miriam had broken out  we know you we know you we saw you in paris and you came to my theatre a short time ago with mr sherringham  we know your mother lady agnes dormer i hope her ladyships very well said mrs rooth who had never struck peter as a more objectionable old woman  you offered to do a head of me or something or other didnt you tell me you work in clay i daresay youve forgotten all about it but i should be delighted miriam pursued with the richest urbanity peter was not concerned with her mothers pervasiveness though he didnt like biddy to see even that but he hoped his companion would take the overcharged benevolence of the young actress in the spirit in which rather to his surprise it evidently was offered ive sat to your clever brother many times said miriam im going to sit again i daresay youve seen what weve donehes too delightful si vous saviez comme cela me repose she added turning for a moment to peter then she continued smiling at biddy only he oughtnt to have thrown up such prospects you know ive an idea i wasnt nice to you that day in parisi was nervous and scared and perverse i remember perfectly i was odious but im better nowyoud see if you were to know me im not a bad sortreally im not but you must have your own friends happy theyyou look so charming immensely like mr dormer especially about the eyes isnt she mamma  she comes of a beautiful norman racethe finest purest strain the old woman simpered mr dormers sometimes so good as to come and see uswere always at home on sunday and if some day you found courage to come with him you might perhaps find it pleasant though very different of course from the circle in which you habitually move  biddy murmured a vague recognition of these wonderful civilities and miriam commented different yes but were all right you know do come she added then turning to sherringham remember what i told youi dont expect you tonight  oh i understand i shall comeand peter knew he grew red  it will be idiotic keep him keep him awaydont let him miriam insisted to biddy with which as nicks portals now were gaping she drew her mother away  peter at this walked off briskly with biddy dropping as he did so shes too fantastic  yes but so tremendously goodlooking i shall ask nick to take me there the girl said after a moment  well shell do you no harm theyre all right as she says its the world of artyou were standing up so for art just now  oh i wasnt thinking so much of that kind she demurred  theres only one kindits all the same thing if one sorts good the other is  biddy walked along a moment is she serious is she conscientious  she has the makings of a great artist peter opined  im glad to hear you think a woman can be one  in that line there has never been any doubt about it  and only in that line  i mean on the stage in general dramatic or lyric its as the actress that the woman produces the most complete and satisfactory artistic results  and only as the actress  he weighed it yes theres another art in which shes not bad  which one do you mean asked biddy  that of being charming and good that of being indispensable to man  oh that isnt an art  then you leave her only the stage take it if you like in the widest sense  biddy appeared to reflect a moment as to judge what sense this might be but she found none that was wide enough for she cried the next minute do you mean to say theres nothing for a woman but to be an actress  never in my life i only say that thats the best thing for a woman to be who finds herself irresistibly carried into the practice of the arts for there her capacity for them has most application and her incapacity for them least but at the same time i strongly recommend her not to be an artist if she can possibly help it its a devil of a life  oh i know men want women not to be anything  its a poor little refuge they try to take from the overwhelming consciousness that youre in very fact everything  everything and the girl gave a toss thats the kind of thing you say to keep us quiet  dear biddy you see how well we succeed laughed peter  to which she replied by asking irrelevantly why is it so necessary for you to go to the theatre tonight if miss rooth doesnt want you to  my dear child she does want me to but that has nothing to do with it  why then did she say that she doesnt  oh because she meant just the contrary  is she so false thenis she so vulgar  she speaks a special language practically it isnt false because it renders her thought and those who know her understand it  but she doesnt use it only to those who know her biddy returned since she asked me who have so little the honour of her acquaintance to keep you away tonight how am i to know that she meant by that that im to urge you on to go  he was on the point of replying because youve my word for it but he shrank in fact from giving his wordhe had some fine scruplesand sought to relieve his embarrassment by a general tribute dear biddy youre delightfully acute youre quite as clever as miss rooth he felt however that this was scarcely adequate and he continued the truth is that its being important for me to go is a matter quite independent of that young ladys wishing it or not wishing it there happens to be a definite intrinsic propriety in it which determines the thing and which it would take me long to explain  i see but fancy your explaining to me you make me feel so indiscreet the girl cried quicklyan exclamation which touched him because he was not aware that quick as it had been she had still had time to be struck firstthough she wouldnt for the world have expressed itwith the oddity of such a duty at such a season in fact that oddity during a silence of some minutes came back to peter himself the note had been forcedit sounded almost ignobly frivolous from a man on the eve of proceeding to a high diplomatic post the effect of this none the less was not to make him break out with hang it i will keep my engagement to your mother but to fill him with the wish to shorten his present strain by taking biddy the rest of the way in a cab he was uncomfortable and there were hansoms about that he looked at wistfully while he was so occupied his companion took up the talk by an abrupt appeal  why did she say that nick oughtnt to have resigned his seat  oh i dont know it struck her so it doesnt matter much  but biddy kept it up if shes an artist herself why doesnt she like people to go in for art especially when nick has given his time to painting her so beautifully why does she come there so often if she disapproves of what he has done  oh miriams disapprovalit doesnt count its a manner of speaking  of speaking untruths do you mean does she think just the reverseis that the way she talks about everything  we always admire most what we can do least peter brought forth and miriam of course isnt political she ranks painters more or less with her own profession about which already new as she is to it she has no illusions theyre all artists its the same general sort of thing she prefers men of the worldmen of action  is that the reason she likes you biddy mildly mocked  ah she doesnt like mecouldnt you see it  the girl at first said nothing then she asked is that why she lets you call her miriam  oh i dont to her face  ah only to mine laughed biddy  one says that as one says rachel of her great predecessor  except that she isnt so great quite yet is she  far from it shes the freshest of novicesshe has scarcely been four months on the stage but no novice has ever been such an adept shell go very fast peter pursued and i daresay that before long shell be magnificent  what a pity youll not see that biddy sighed after a pause  not see it  if youre thousands of miles away  it is a pity peter said and since you mention it i dont mind frankly telling youthrowing myself on your mercy as it werethat thats why i make such a point of a rare occasion like tonight ive a weakness for the drama that as you perhaps know ive never concealed and this impression will probably have to last me in some barren spot for many many years  i understandi understand i hope therefore it will be charming and the girl walked faster  just as some other charming impressions will have to last peter added conscious of keeping up with her by some effort she seemed almost to be running away from him an impression that led him to suggest after they had proceeded a little further without more words that if she were in a hurry they had perhaps better take a cab her face was strange and touching to him as she turned it to make answer  oh im not in the least in a hurry and i really think i had better walk  well walk then by all means peter said with slightly exaggerated gaiety in pursuance of which they went on a hundred yards biddy kept the same pace yet it was scarcely a surprise to him that she should suddenly stop with the exclamation  after all though im not in a hurry im tired i had better have a cab please call that one she added looking about her  they were in a straight blank ugly street where the small cheap greyfaced houses had no expression save that of a rueful unconsoled acknowledgment of the universal want of identity they would have constituted a terrace if they could but they had dolefully given it up even a hansom that loitered across the end of the vista turned a sceptical back upon it so that sherringham had to lift his voice in a loud appeal he stood with biddy watching the cab approach them this is one of the charming things youll remember she said turning her eyes to the general dreariness from the particular figure of the vehicle which was antiquated and clumsy before he could reply she had lightly stepped into the cab but as he answered most assuredly it is and prepared to follow her she quickly closed the apron  i must go alone youve lots of things to doits all right and through the aperture in the roof she gave the driver her address she had spoken with decision and peter fully felt now that she wished to get away from him her eyes betrayed it as well as her voice in a look a strange wandering ray that as he stood there with his hand on the cab he had time to take from her goodbye peter she smiled and as the thing began to rumble away he uttered the same tepid ridiculous farewell     xliv   at the entrance of miriam and her mother nick in the studio had stopped whistling but he was still gay enough to receive them with every appearance of warmth he thought it a poor place ungarnished untapestried a bare almost grim workshop with all its revelations and honours still to come but his visitors smiled on it a good deal in the same way in which they had smiled on bridget dormer when they met her at the door mrs rooth because vague prudent approbation was the habit of her foolish faceit was ever the least danger and miriam because as seemed she was genuinely glad to find herself within the walls of which she spoke now as her asylum she broke out in this strain to her host almost as soon as she had crossed the threshold commending his circumstances his conditions of work as infinitely happier than her own he was quiet independent absolute free to do what he liked as he liked it shut up in his little temple with his altar and his divinity not hustled about in a mob of people having to posture and grin to pit and gallery to square himself at every step with insufferable conventions and with the ignorance and vanity of others he was blissfully alone  mercy how you do abuse your fine profession im sure i never urged you to adopt it mrs rooth cried in real bewilderment to her daughter  she was abusing mine still more the other day joked nicktelling me i ought to be ashamed of it and of myself  oh i never know from one moment to the otheri live with my heart in my mouth sighed the old woman  arent you quiet about the great thingabout my personal behaviour miriam smiled my improprieties are all of the mind  i dont know what you call your personal behaviour her mother objected  you would very soon if it were not what it is  and i dont know why you should wish to have it thought youve a wicked mind mrs rooth agreeably grumbled  yes but i dont see very well how i can make you understand that at any rate miriam pursued with her grand eyes on nick i retract what i said the other day about mr dormer ive no wish to quarrel with him on the way he has determined to dispose of his life because after all it does suit me very well it rests me this little devoted corner oh it rests me its out of the row and the dust its deliciously still and they cant get at me ah when arts like this à la bonne heure and she looked round on such a presentment of art in a splendid way that produced amusement on the young mans part at its contrast with the humble fact miriam shone upon him as if she liked to be the cause of his mirth and went on appealing to him youll always let me come here for an hour wont you to take breathto let the whirlwind pass you neednt trouble yourself about me i dont mean to impose on you in the least the necessity of painting me though if thats a manner of helping you to get on you may be sure it will always be open to you do what you like with me in that respect only let me sit here on a high stool keeping well out of your way and see what you happen to be doing ill tell you my own adventures when you want to hear them  the fewer adventures you have to tell the better my dear said mrs rooth and if mr dormer keeps you quiet hell add ten years to my life  it all makes an interesting comment on mr dormers own quietness on his independence and sweet solitude nick observed miss rooth has to work with others which is after all only what mr dormer has to do when he works with miss rooth what do you make of the inevitable sitter  oh answered miriam you can say to the inevitable sitter hold your tongue you brute  isnt it a good deal in that manner that ive heard you address your comrades at the theatre mrs rooth inquired thats why my hearts in my mouth  yes but they hit me back they reply to mecomme de raisonas i should never think of replying to mr dormer its a great advantage to him that when hes peremptory with his model it only makes her better adds to her expression of gloomy grandeur  we did the gloomy grandeur in the other picture suppose therefore we try something different in this nick threw off  it is serious it is grand murmured mrs rooth who had taken up a rapt attitude before the portrait of her daughter it makes one wonder what shes thinking of beautiful commendable thingsthats what it seems to say  what can i be thinking of but the tremendous wisdom of my mother miriam returned i brought her this morning to see that thingshe had only seen it in its earliest stageand not to presume to advise you about anything else you may be so good as to embark on she wanted or professed she wanted terribly to know what you had finally arrived at she was too impatient to wait till you should send it home  ah send it homesend it home let us have it always with us mrs rooth engagingly said it will keep us up up and up on the heights near the starsbe always for us a symbol and a reminder  you see i was right miriam went on for she appreciates thoroughly in her own way and almost understands but if she worries or distracts you ill send her directly homeive kept the carriage there on purpose i must add that i dont feel quite safe today in letting her out of my sight shes liable to make dashes at the theatre and play unconscionable tricks there i shall never again accuse mamma of a want of interest in my profession her interest today exceeds even my own shes all over the place and she has ideasah but ideas shes capable of turning up at the theatre at five oclock this afternoon to demand the repainting of the set in the third act for myself ive not a word more to say on the subjective accepted every danger ive swallowed my fate everythings no doubt wrong but nothing can possibly be right let us eat and drink for tonight we die if you say so mamma shall go and sit in the carriage and as theres no means of fastening the doors is there your servant shall keep guard over her  just as you are nowbe so good as to remain so sitting just that wayleaning back with a smile in your eyes and one hand on the sofa beside you and supporting you a little i shall stick a flower into the other handlet it lie in your lap just as it is keep that thing on your headits admirably uncovered do you call such an unconsidered trifle a bonnetand let your head fall back a little there it isits found this time i shall really do something and it will be as different as you like from that other crazy job here we go it was in these irrelevant but earnest words that nick responded to his sitters uttered vagaries of which her charming tone and countenance diminished the superficial acerbity he held up his hands a moment to fix her in her limits and in a few minutes had a happy sense of having begun to work  the smile in her eyesdont forget the smile in her eyes mrs rooth softly chanted turning away and creeping about the room that will make it so different from the other picture and show the two sides of her genius the wonderful range between them theyll be splendid mates and though i daresay i shall strike you as greedy you must let me hope youll send this one home too  she explored the place discreetly and on tiptoe talking twaddle as she went and bending her head and her eyeglass over various objects with an air of imperfect comprehension that didnt prevent nicks private recall of the story of her underhand commercial habits told by gabriel nash at the exhibition in paris the first time her name had fallen on his ear a queer old woman from whom if you approached her in the right way you could buy old potsit was in this character that she had originally been introduced to him he had lost sight of it afterwards but it revived again as his observant eyes at the same time that they followed his active hand became aware of her instinctive appraising gestures there was a moment when he frankly laughed outthere was so little in his poor studio to appraise mrs rooths wandering eyeglass and vague polite disappointed bent back and head made a subject for a sketch on the instant they gave such a sudden pictorial glimpse of the element of race he found himself seeing the immemorial jewess in her hold up a candle in a crammed back shop there was no candle indeed and his studio was not crammed and it had never occurred to him before that she was a granddaughter of israel save on the general theory so stoutly held by several clever people that few of us are not under suspicion the late rudolf roth had at least been and his daughter was visibly her fathers child so that flanked by such a pair good semitic presumptions sufficiently crowned the mother receiving miriams sharp satiric shower without shaking her shoulders she might at any rate have been the descendant of a tribe long persecuted her blandness was beyond all baiting she professed she could be as still as a mouse miriam on the other side of the room in the tranquil beauty of her attitudefound indeed as nick had saidwatched her a little and then declared she had best have been locked up at home putting aside her free account of the dangers to which her mother exposed her it wasnt whimsical to imagine that within the limits of that repose from which the nevillenugents never wholly departed the elder lady might indeed be a trifle fidgety and have something on her mind nick presently mentioned that it wouldnt be possible for him to send home his second performance and he added in the exuberance of having already got a little into relation with his work that perhaps this didnt matter inasmuch asif miriam would give him his time to say nothing of her owna third and a fourth masterpiece might also some day very well struggle into the light his model rose to this without conditions assuring him he might count upon her till she grew too old and too ugly and that nothing would make her so happy as that he should paint her as often as romney had painted the celebrated lady hamilton ah lady hamilton deprecated mrs rooth while miriam who had on occasion the candour of a fine acquisitiveness wished to know what particular reason there might be for his not letting them have the picture he was now beginning  why ive promised it to peter sherringhamhe has offered me money for it nick replied however hes welcome to it for nothing poor chap and i shall be delighted to do the best i can for him  mrs rooth still prowling stopped in the middle of the room at this while her daughter echoed he offered you moneyjust as we came in  you met him then at the door with my sister i supposed you hadhes taking her home nick explained  your sisters a lovely girlsuch an aristocratic type breathed mrs rooth then she added ive a tremendous confession to make to you  mammas confessions have to be tremendous to correspond with her crimes said miriam she asked miss dormer to come and see us suggested even that you might bring her some sunday i dont like the way mamma does such thingstoo much humility too many simagrées after all but i also said what i could to be nice to her your sister is charmingawfully pretty and modest if you were to press me i should tell you frankly that it seems to me rather a social muddle this rubbing shoulders of nice girls and filles de théâtre i shouldnt think it would do your poor young things much good however its their own affair and no doubt theres no more need of their thinking were worse than we are than of their thinking were better the people they live with dont seem to know the differencei sometimes make my reflexions about the public one works for  ah if you go in for the publics knowing differences youre far too particular nick laughed doù tombezvous as you affected french people say if youve anything at stake on that you had simply better not play  dear mr dormer dont encourage her to be so dreadful for it is dreadful the way she talks mrs rooth broke in one would think we werent respectableone would think i had never known what ive known and been what ive been  what one would think beloved mother is that youre a still greater humbug than you are its you on the contrary who go down on your knees who pour forth apologies about our being vagabonds  vagabondslisten to herafter the education ive given her and our magnificent prospects wailed mrs rooth sinking with clasped hands upon the nearest ottoman  not after our prospects if prospects they be a good deal before them yes youve taught me tongues and im greatly obliged to youthey no doubt give variety as well as incoherency to my conversation and that of people in our line is for the most part notoriously monotonous and shoppy the gift of tongues is in general the sign of your true adventurer dear mamma ive no low standardthats the last thing miriam went on my weakness is my exalted conception of respectability ah parlezmoi de ça and of the way i understand it if i were to go in for being respectable youd see something fine im awfully conservative and i know what respectability is even when i meet people of society on the accidental middle ground of either glowering or smirking i know also what it isntit isnt the sweet union of wellbred little girls carefullynurtured dont they call them and painted shemummers i should carry it much further than any of these people i should never look at the likes of us every hour i live i see that the wisdom of the ages was in the experience of dear old madame carréwas in a hundred things she told me shes founded on a rock after that miriam went on to her host i can assure you that if you were so good as to bring miss dormer to see us we should be angelically careful of her and surround her with every attention and precaution  the likes of usthe likes of us mrs rooth repeated plaintively and with a resentment as vain as a failure to sneeze i dont know what youre talking about and i decline to be turned upside down ive my ideas as well as you and i repudiate the charge of false humility ive been through too many troubles to be proud and a pleasant polite manner was the rule of my life even in the days when god knows i had everything ive never changed and if with gods help i had a civil tongue then ive a civil tongue now its more than you always have my poor perverse passionate child once a lady always a ladyall the footlights in the world turn them up as high as you will make no difference there and i think people know it people who know anythingif i may use such an expressionand its because they know it that im not afraid to address them in a pleasant way so i must sayand i call mr dormer to witness for if he could reason with you a bit about it he might render several people a serviceyour conduct to mr sherringham simply breaks my heart mrs rooth concluded taking a jump of several steps in the fine modern avenue of her argument  nick was appealed to but he hung back drawing with a free hand and while he forbore miriam took it up mothers goodmothers very good but its only little by little that you discover how good she is this seemed to leave him at ease to ask their companion with the preliminary intimation that what she had just said was very striking what she meant by her daughters conduct to old peter before mrs rooth could answer this question however miriam broke across with one of her own do you mind telling me if you made your sister go off with mr sherringham because you knew it was about time for me to turn up poor mr dormer i get you into trouble dont i she added quite with tenderness  into trouble echoed nick looking at her head but not at her eyes  well we wont talk about that she returned with a rich laugh  he now hastened to say that he had nothing to do with his sisters leaving the studioshe had only come as it happened for a moment she had walked away with peter sherringham because they were cousins and old friends he was to leave england immediately for a long time and he had offered her his company going home mrs rooth shook her head very knowingly over the long time mr sherringham would be absentshe plainly had her ideas about that and she conscientiously related that in the course of the short conversation they had all had at the door of the house her daughter had reminded miss dormer of something that had passed between them in paris on the question of the charming young ladys modelling her head  i did it to make the idea of our meeting less absurdto put it on the footing of our both being artists i dont ask you if she has talent said miriam  then i neednt tell you laughed nick  im sure she has talent and a very refined inspiration i see something in that corner covered with a mysterious veil mrs rooth insinuated which led miriam to go on immediately  has she been trying her hand at mr sherringham  when should she try her hand poor dear young lady hes always sitting with us said mrs rooth  dear mamma you exaggerate he has his momentswhen he seems to say his prayers to me but weve had some success in cutting them down il sest bien détaché ces joursci and im very happy for him of course its an impertinent allusion for me to make but i should be so delighted if i could think of him as a little in love with miss dormer the girl pursued addressing nick  he is i think just a littlejust a tiny bit her artist allowed working away while mrs rooth ejaculated to her daughter simultaneously  how can you ask such fantastic questions when you know hes dying for you  oh dyinghes dying very hard cried miriam mr sherringhams a man of whom i cant speak with too much esteem and affection and who may be destined to perish by some horrid fever which god forbid in the unpleasant country hes going to but he wont have caught his fever from your humble servant  you may kill him even while you remain in perfect health yourself said nick and since were talking of the matter i dont see the harm of my confessing that he strikes me as far goneoh as very bad indeed  and yet hes in love with your sisterje ny suis plus  he tries to be for he sees that as regards you there are difficulties hed like to put his hand on some nice girl whod be an antidote to his poison  difficulties are a mild name for them poison even is a mild name for the ill he suffers from the principal difficulty is that he doesnt know what the devil he wants the next is that i dont eitheror what the devil i want myself i only know what i dont want miriam kept on brightly and as if uttering some happy beneficent truth i dont want a person who takes things even less simply than i do myself mr sherringham poor man must be very uncomfortable for one side of hims in a perpetual row with the other side hes trying to serve god and mammon and i dont know how god will come off what i like in you is that youve definitely let mammon goits the only decent way thats my earnest conviction and yet they call us people light dear mr sherringham has tremendous ambitionstremendous riguardi as we used to say in italy he wants to enjoy every comfort and to save every appearance and all without making a scrap of a sacrifice he expects othersme for instanceto make all the sacrifices merci much as i esteem him and much as i owe him i dont know how he ever came to stray at all into our bold bad downright bohemia it was a cruel trick for fortune to play him he cant keep out of it hes perpetually making dashes across the border and yet as soon as he gets here hes on pins and needles theres another in whose positionif i were in iti wouldnt look at the likes of us  i dont know much about the matter nick brought out after some intent smudging but ive an idea peter thinks he has made or at least is making sacrifices  so much the betteryou must encourage him you must help him  i dont know what my daughters talking about mrs rooth contributedshes much too paradoxical for my plain mind but theres one way to encourage mr sherringhamtheres one way to help him and perhaps it wont be a worse way for a gentleman of your good nature that it will help me at the same time cant i look to you dear mr dormer to see that he does come to the theatre tonightthat he doesnt feel himself obliged to stay away  what danger is there of his staying away nick asked  if hes bent on sacrifices thats a very good one to begin with miriam observed  thats the mad bad way she talks to himshe has forbidden the dear unhappy gentleman the house her mother cried she brought it up to him just now at the doorbefore miss dormer such very odd form she pretends to impose her commands upon him  oh hell be therewere going to dine together said nick and when miriam asked him what that had to do with it he went on why weve arranged it im going and he wont let me go alone  youre going i sent you no places his sitter objected  yes but ive got one why didnt you after all ive done for you  she beautifully thought of it because im so good no matter she added if mr sherringham comes i wont act  wont you act for me  shell act like an angel mrs rooth protested she might do she might be anything in all the world but she wont take common pains  of one thing theres no doubt said miriam that compared with the rest of uspoor passionless creaturesmamma does know what she wants  and whats that nick inquired chalking on  she wants everything  never neverim much more humble retorted the old woman upon which her daughter requested her to give then to mr dormer who was a reasonable man and an excellent judge a general idea of the scope of her desires  as however mrs rooth sighing and deprecating was not quick to acquit herself the girl tried a short cut to the truth with the abrupt demand do you believe for a single moment hed marry me  why he has proposed to youyouve told me yourselfa dozen times  proposed what to me miriam rang out ive told you that neither a dozen times nor once because ive never understood he has made wonderful speeches but has never been serious  you told me he had been in the seventh heaven of devotion especially that night we went to the foyer of the français mrs rooth insisted  do you call the seventh heaven of devotion serious hes in love with me je le veux bien hes so poisonedmr dormer vividly puts itas to require a strong antidote but he has never spoken to me as if he really expected me to listen to him and hes the more of a gentleman from that fact he knows we havent a square foot of common groundthat a grasshopper cant set up a house with a fish so he has taken care to say to me only more than he can possibly mean that makes it stand just for nothing  did he say more than he can possibly mean when he took formal leave of you yesterdayfor ever and ever the old woman cried  on which nick reenforced her and dont you call thathis taking formal leavea sacrifice  oh he took it all back his sacrifice before he left the house  then has that no meaning demanded mrs rooth  none that i can make out said her daughter  ah ive no patience with you you can be stupid when you willyou can be even that too the poor lady groaned  what mamma wishes me to understand and to practise is the particular way to be artful with mr sherringham said miriam there are doubtless depths of wisdom and virtue in it but i see only one artthat of being perfectly honest  i like to hear you talkit makes you live brings you out nick contentedly dropped and you sit beautifully still all i want to say is please continue to do so remain exactly as you areits rather importantfor the next ten minutes  were washing our dirty linen before you but its all right the girl returned because it shows you what sort of people we are and thats what you need to know dont make me vague and arranged and fine in this new view she continued make me characteristic and real make life with all its horrid facts and truths stick out of me i wish you could put mother in too make us live there side by side and tell our little story the wonderful actress and her still more wonderful mammadont you think thats an awfully good subject  mrs rooth at this cried shame on her daughters wanton humour professing that she herself would never accept so much from nicks good nature and miriam settled it that at any rate he was some day and in some way to do her mother really do her and so make her as one of the funniest persons that ever was live on through the ages  she doesnt believe mr sherringham wants to marry me any more than you do the girl taking up her dispute again after a moment represented to nick but she believeshow indeed can i tell you what she believesthat i can work it so well if you understand that in the fulness of time i shall hold him in a vice im to keep him along for the present but not to listen to him for if i listen to him i shall lose him its ingenious its complicated but i daresay you follow me  dont movedont move said nick pardon a poor clumsy beginner  no i shall explain quietly somehowhere its very complicated and you mustnt lose the threadi shall be an actress and make a tremendous lot of money and somehow too i suppose a little later i shall become an ambassadress and be the favourite of courts so you see it will all be delightful only i shall have to go very straight mamma reminds me of a story i once heard about the mother of a young lady who was in receipt of much civility from the pretender to a crown which indeed he and the young lady too afterwards more or less wore the old countess watched the course of events and gave her daughter the cleverest advice tiens bon ma fille and you shall sit upon a throne mamma wishes me to tenir bonshe apparently thinks theres a danger i mayntso that if i dont sit upon a throne i shall at least parade at the foot of one and if before that for ten years i pile up the money theyll forgive me the way ive made it i should hope so if ive tenu bon only ten years is a good while to hold out isnt it if it isnt mr sherringham it will be some one else mr sherringham has the great merit of being a bird in the hand im to keep him along im to be still more diplomatic than even he can be  mrs rooth listened to her daughter with an air of assumed reprobation which melted before the girl had done into a diverted complacent smilethe gratification of finding herself the proprietress of so much wit and irony and grace miriams account of her mothers views was a scene of comedy and there was instinctive art in the way she added touch to touch and made point upon point she was so quiet to oblige her painter that only her fine lips movedall her expression was in their charming utterance mrs rooth after the first flutter of a less cynical spirit consented to be sacrificed to an effect of the really high order she had now been educated to recognise so that she scarce hesitated when miriam had ceased speaking before she tittered out with the fondest indulgence comédienne and she seemed to appeal to their companion aint she fascinating thats the way she does for you  its rather cruel isnt it said miriam to deprive people of the luxury of calling one an actress as theyd call one a liar i represent but i represent truly  mr sherringham would marry you tomorrowtheres no question of ten years cried mrs rooth with a comicality of plainness  miriam smiled at nick deprecating his horror of such talk isnt it droll the way she cant get it out of her head then turning almost coaxingly to the old woman voyons look about you they dont marry us like that  but they docela se voit tous les jours ask mr dormer  oh never it would be as if i asked him to give us a practical proof  i shall never prove anything by marrying any one nick said for me that questions over  miriam rested kind eyes on him dear me how you must hate me and before he had time to reply she went on to her mother people marry them to make them leave the stage which proves exactly what i say  ah they offer them the finest positions reasoned mrs rooth  do you want me to leave it then  oh you can manage if you will  the only managing i know anything about is to do my work if i manage that decently i shall pull through  but dearest may our work not be of many sorts  i only know one said miriam  at this her mother got up with a sigh i see you do wish to drive me into the street  mammas bewilderedthere are so many paths she wants to follow there are so many bundles of hay as i told you she wishes to gobble them all the girl pursued then she added yes go and take the carriage take a turn round the parkyou always delight in thatand come back for me in an hour  im too vexed with you the air will do me good said mrs rooth but before she went she addressed nick ive your assurance that youll bring him then tonight  bring peter i dont think i shall have to drag him nick returned but you must do me the justice to remember that if i should resort to force i should do something thats not particularly in my interesti should be magnanimous  we must always be that mustnt we moralised mrs rooth  how could it affect your interest miriam asked less abstractedly  yes as you say her mother mused at their host the question of marriage has ceased to exist for you  mamma goes straight at it laughed the girl getting up while nick rubbed his canvas before answering miriam went to mamma and settled her bonnet and mantle in preparation for her drive then stood a moment with a filial arm about her and as if waiting for their friends explanation this however when it came halted visibly  why you said a while ago that if peter was there you wouldnt act  ill act for him smiled miriam inconsequently caressing her mother  it doesnt matter whom its for mrs rooth declared sagaciously  take your drive and relax your mind said the girl kissing her come for me in an hour not laterbut not sooner she went with her to the door bundled her out closed it behind her and came back to the position she had quitted this is the peace i want she gratefully cried as she settled into it     xlv   peter sherringham said so little during the performance that his companion was struck by his dumbness especially as miriams acting seemed to nick magnificent he held his breath while she was on the stageshe gave the whole thing including the spectators emotion such a lift she had not carried out her fantastic menace of not exerting herself and as mrs rooth had said it little mattered for whom she acted nick was conscious in watching her that she went through it all for herself for the idea that possessed her and that she rendered with extraordinary breadth she couldnt open the door a part of the way to it and let it simply peep in if it entered at all it must enter in full procession and occupy the premises in state  this was what had happened on an occasion which as the less tormented of our young men felt in his stall grew larger with each throb of the responsive house till by the time the play was half over it appeared to stretch out wide arms to the future nick had often heard more applause but had never heard more attention since they were all charmed and hushed together and success seemed to be sitting down with them there had been of course plenty of announcementthe newspapers had abounded and the arts of the manager had taken the freest license but it was easy to feel a fine universal consensus and to recognise everywhere the light spring of hope people snatched their eyes from the stage an instant to look at each other all eager to hand on the torch passed to them by the actress over the footlights it was a part of the impression that she was now only showing to the full for this time she had verse to deal with and she made it unexpectedly exquisite she was beauty melody truth she was passion and persuasion and tenderness she caught up the obstreperous play in soothing entwining arms and seeming to tread the air in the flutter of her robe carried it into the high places of poetry of art of style and she had such tones of nature such concealments of art such effusions of life that the whole scene glowed with the colour she communicated and the house pervaded with rosy fire glowed back at the scene nick looked round in the intervals he felt excited and flushedthe night had turned to a feast of fraternity and he expected to see people embrace each other the crowd the agitation the triumph the surprise the signals and rumours the heated air his associates near him pointing out other figures who presumably were celebrated but whom he had never heard of all amused him and banished every impulse to question or to compare miriam was as happy as some right sensationshe would have fed the memory with deep draughts  one of the things that amused him or at least helped to fill his attention was peters attitude which apparently didnt exclude criticismrather indeed mainly implied it this admirer never took his eyes off the actress but he made no remark about her and never stirred out of his chair nick had had from the first a plan of going round to speak to her but as his companion evidently meant not to move he scrupled at being more forward during their brief dinner togetherthey were determined not to be latepeter had been silent quite recklessly grave but also his kinsman judged full of the wish to make it clear he was calm in his seat he was calmer than ever and had an air even of trying to suggest that his attendance preoccupied as he was with deeper solemnities was more or less mechanical the result of a conception of duty a habit of courtesy when during a scene in the second acta scene from which miriam was absentnick observed to him that one might judge from his reserve that he wasnt pleased he replied after a moment ive been looking for her mistakes and when nick made answer to this that he certainly wouldnt find them he said again in an odd tone no i shant find themi shant find them it might have seemed that since the girls performance was a dazzling success he regarded his evening as rather a failure  after the third act nick said candidly my dear fellow how can you sit here arent you going to speak to her  to which peter replied inscrutably lord no never again i bade her goodbye yesterday she knows what i think of her form its very good but she carries it a little too far besides she didnt want me to come and its therefore more discreet to keep away from her  surely it isnt an hour for discretion nick cried excuse me at any rate for five minutes  he went behind and reappeared only as the curtain was rising on the fourth act and in the interval between the fourth and the fifth he went again for a shorter time peter was personally detached but he consented to listen to his companions vivid account of the state of things on the stage where the elation of victory had lighted up the place the strain was over the ship in portthey were all wiping their faces and grinning miriamyes positivelywas grinning too and she hadnt asked a question about peter nor sent him a message they were kissing all round and dancing for joy they were on the eve worse luck of a tremendous run peter groaned irrepressibly for this it was save for a slight sign a moment later the only vibration caused in him by his cousins report there was but one voice of regret that they hadnt put on the piece earlier as the end of the season would interrupt the run there was but one voice too about the fourth actit was believed all london would rush to see the fourth act the crowd about her was a dozen deep and miriam in the midst of it all charming she was receiving in the ugly place after the fashion of royalty almost as hedged with the famous divinity yet with a smile and a word for each she was really like a young queen on her accession when she saw him nick she had kissed her hand to him over the heads of the courtiers nicks artless comment on this was that she had such pretty manners it made peter laughapparently at his friends conception of the manners of a young queen mrs rooth with a dozen shawls on her arm was as red as the kitchenfire but you couldnt tell if miriam were red or pale she was so cleverly finely made upperhaps a little too much dashwood of course was greatly to the fore but you hadnt to mention his own performance to him he took it all handsomely and wouldnt hear of anything but that her fortune was made he didnt say much indeed but evidently had ideas about her fortune he nodded significant things and whistled inimitable soundsheuh heuh he was perfectly satisfied moreover he looked further ahead than any one  it was on coming back to his place after the fourth act that nick put in for his companions benefit most of these touches in his sketch of the situation if peter had continued to look for miriams mistakes he hadnt yet found them the fourth act bristling with dangers putting a premium on every sort of cheap effect had rounded itself without a flaw sitting there alone while nick was away he had leisure to meditate on the wonder of thison the art with which the girl had separated passion from violence filling the whole place and never screaming for it had often seemed to him in london of old that the yell of theatrical emotion rang through the shrinking night like the voice of the sunday newsboy miriam had never been more present to him than at this hour but she was inextricably transmutedpresent essentially as the romantic heroine she represented his state of mind was of the strangest and he was conscious of its strangeness just as he was conscious in his very person of a lapse of resistance which likened itself absurdly to liberation he felt weak at the same time that he felt inspired and he felt inspired at the same time that he knew or believed he knew that his face was a blank he saw things as a shining confusion and yet somehow something monstrously definite kept surging out of them miriam was a beautiful actual fictive impossible young woman of a past age an undiscoverable country who spoke in blank verse and overflowed with metaphor who was exalted and heroic beyond all human convenience and who yet was irresistibly real and related to ones own affairs but that reality was a part of her spectators joy and she was not changed back to the common by his perception of the magnificent trick of art with which it was connected before his kinsman rejoined him peter taking a visitingcard from his pocket had written on it in pencil a few words in a foreign tongue but as at that moment he saw nick coming in he immediately put it out of view  the last thing before the curtain rose on the fifth act that young man mentioned his having brought a message from basil dashwood who hoped they both on leaving the theatre would come to supper with him in company with miriam and her mother and several others he had prepared a little informal banquet in honour of so famous a night at this while the curtain was about to rise peter immediately took out his card again and added somethinghe wrote the finest small hand you could see nick asked him what he was doing and he waited but an instant its a word to say i cant come  to dashwood oh i shall go said nick  well i hope youll enjoy it his companion replied in a tone which came back to him afterwards  when the curtain fell on the last act the people stayed standing up in their places for acclamation the applause shook the housethe recall became a clamour the relief from a long tension this was in any performance a moment peter detested but he stood for an instant beside nick who clapped to his cousins diplomatic sense after the fashion of a schoolboy at the pantomime there was a veritable roar while the curtain drew back at the side most removed from our pair peter could see basil dashwood holding it making a passage for the male juvenile lead who had miriam in tow nick redoubled his efforts heard the plaudits swell saw the bows of the leading gentleman who was hot and fat saw miriam personally conducted and closer to the footlights grow brighter and bigger and more swaying and then became aware that his own comrade had with extreme agility slipped out of the stalls nick had already lost sight of himhe had apparently taken but a minute to escape from the house and wondered at his quitting him without a farewell if he was to leave england on the morrow and they were not to meet at the hospitable dashwoods he wondered even what peter was up to since as he had assured him there was no question of his going round to miriam he waited to see this young lady reappear three times dragging dashwood behind her at the second with a friendly arm to whom in turn was hooked miss fanny rover the actress entrusted in the piece with the inevitable comic relief he went out slowly with the crowd and at the door looked again for peter who struck him as deficient for once in finish he couldnt know that in another direction and while he was helping the house to rise at its heroine his kinsman had been particularly explicit  on reaching the lobby peter had pounced on a small boy in buttons who seemed superfluously connected with a desolate refreshmentroom and from the tips of his toes was peeping at the stage through the glazed hole in the door of a box into one of the childs hands he thrust the card he had drawn again from his waistcoat and into the other the largest silver coin he could find in the same receptacle while he bent over him with words of adjurationwords the little page tried to help himself to apprehend by instantly attempting to peruse the other words written on the card  thats no useits italian said peter only carry it round to miss rooth without a minutes delay place it in her hand and shell give you some objecta bracelet a glove or a flowerto bring me back as a sign that she has received it i shall be outside bring me there what she gives you and you shall have another shillingonly fly  his small messenger sounded him a moment with the sharp face of london wageearning and still more of london tipearning infancy and vanished as swiftly as a slave of the arabian nights while he waited in the lobby the audience began to pour out and before the urchin had come back to him he was clapped on the shoulder by nick  im glad i havent lost you but why didnt you stay to give her a hand  give her a hand i hated it  my dear man i dont follow you nick said if you wont come to dashwoods supper i fear our ways dont lie together  thank him very much say ive to get up at an unnatural hour to this peter added i think i ought to tell you she may not be there  miss rooth why its all for her  im waiting for a word from hershe may change her mind  nick showed his interest for you what then have you proposed  ive proposed marriage said peter in a strange voice  i say nick broke out and at the same moment peters messenger squeezed through the press and stood before him  she has given me nothing sir the boy announced but she says im to say all right  nicks stare widened youve proposed through him  aye and she accepts goodnighton which turning away peter bounded into a hansom he said something to the driver through the roof and nicks eyes followed the cab as it started off this young man was mystified was even amused especially when the youth in buttons planted there and wondering too brought forth  please sir he told me hed give me a shilling and heve forgot it  oh i cant pay you for that nick laughed but he fished out a dole though he was vexed at the injury to the supper     xlvi   peter meanwhile rolled away through the summer night to saint johns wood he had put the pressure of strong words on his young friend entreating her to drive home immediately return there without any one without even her mother he wished to see her alone and for a purpose he would fully and satisfactorily explaincouldnt she trust him he besought her to remember his own situation and throw over her supper throw over everything he would wait for her with unspeakable impatience in balaklava place  he did so when he got there but it had taken half an hour interminable seemed his lonely vigil in miss lumleys drawingroom where the character of the original proprietress came out to him more than ever before in a kind of afterglow of old sociabilities a vulgar ghostly reference the numerous candles had been lighted for him and mrs rooths familiar fictions lay about but his nerves forbade him the solace of a chair and a book he walked up and down thinking and listening and as the long window the balmy air permitting stood open to the garden he passed several times in and out a carriage appeared to stop at the gatethen there was nothing he heard the rare rattle of wheels and the faroff hum of london his impatience was overwrought and though he knew this it persisted it would have been no easy matter for miriam to break away from the flock of her felicitators still less simple was it doubtless for her to leave poor dashwood with his supper on his hands perhaps she would bring dashwood with her bring him to time her she was capable of playing himthat is of playing her majestys new representative to the small faroff state or even of playing them boththat trick perhaps the little wretch in buttonspeter remembered now the neglected shillingonly pretending to go round with his card had come back with an invented answer but how could he know since presumably he couldnt read italian that his answer would fit the message peter was sorry now that he himself had not gone round not snatched miriam bodily away made sure of her and of what he wanted of her  when forty minutes had elapsed he regarded it as proved that she wouldnt come and asking himself what he should do determined to drive off again and seize her at her comrades feast then he remembered how nick had mentioned that this entertainment was not to be held at the young actors lodgings but at some tavern or restaurant the name of which he had not heeded suddenly however peter became aware with joy that this name didnt matter for there was something at the garden door at last he rushed out before she had had time to ring and saw as she stepped from the carriage that she was alone now that she was there that he had this evidence she had listened to him and trusted him all his impatience and bitterness gave way and a flood of pleading tenderness took their place in the first words he spoke to her it was far dearer of her than he had any right to dream but she was the best and kindest creaturethis showed itas well as the most wonderful he was really not off his head with his contradictory ways no before heaven he wasnt and he would explain he would make everything clear everything was changed  she stopped short in the little dusky garden looking at him in the light of the open window then she called back to the coachmanthey had left the garden door openwait for me mind i shall want you again  whats the matterwont you stay peter asked are you going out again at this absurd hour i wont hurt you he gently urged and he went back and closed the garden door he wanted to say to the coachman its no matterplease drive away at the same time he wouldnt for the world have done anything offensive to her  ive come because i thought it better tonight as things have turned out to do the thing you ask me whatever it may be she had already begun thats probably what you calculated i would think eh what this evening has been youve seen and i must allow that your hands in it that you know for yourselfthat you doubtless felt as you sat there but i confess i dont imagine what you want of me here now she added she had remained standing in the path  peter felt the irony of her now and how it made a fool of him but he had been prepared for this and for much worse he had begged her not to think him a fool but in truth at present he cared little if she did very likely he wasin spite of his plea that everything was changed he cared little even himself however he spoke in the tone of intense reason and of the fullest disposition to satisfy her this lucidity only took still more from the dignity of his change of front his separation from her the day before had had such pretensions to being lucid but the explanation and the justification were in the very fact the fact that had complete possession of him he named it when he replied to her ive simply overrated my strength  oh i knewi knew thats why i entreated you not to come miriam groaned she turned away lamenting and for a moment he thought she would retreat to her carriage but he passed his hand into her arm to draw her forward and after an instant felt her yield  the fact is we must have this thing out he said then he added as he made her go into the house bending over her the failure of my strengththat was just the reason of my coming  she broke into her laugh at these words as she entered the drawingroom and it made them sound pompous in their false wisdom she flung off as a goodnatured tribute to the image of their having the thing out a white shawl that had been wrapped round her she was still painted and bedizened in the splendid dress of her climax so that she seemed protected and alienated by the character she had been acting whatever it is you wantwhen i understandyoull be very brief wont you do you know ive given up a charming supper for you mamma has gone there ive promised to go back to them  youre an angel not to have let her come with you im sure she wanted to peter made reply  oh shes all right but shes nervous then the girl added couldnt she keep you away after all  whom are you talking about biddy dormer was as absent from his mind as if she had never existed  the charming thing you were with this morning is she so afraid of obliging me oh shed be so good for you  dont speak of that peter gravely said i was in perfect good faith yesterday when i took leave of you i wasi was but i canti cant youre too unutterably dear to me  oh dontplease dont miriam wailed at this she stood before the fireless chimneypiece with one of her hands on it if its only to say that dont you know whats the use  it isnt only to say that ive a plan a perfect plan the whole thing lies clear before me  and whats the whole thing  he had to make an effort you say your mothers nervous ah if you knew how nervous i am  well im not go on  give it upgive it up peter stammered  give it up she fixed him like a mild medusa  ill marry you tomorrow if youll renounce and in return for the sacrifice you make for me ill do more for you than ever was done for a woman before  renounce after tonight do you call that a plan she asked those are old words and very foolish onesyou wanted something of that sort a year ago  oh i fluttered round the idea at that time we were talking in the air i didnt really believe i could make you see it then and certainly you didnt see it my own future moreover wasnt definite to me i didnt know what i could offer you but these last months have made a differencei do know now now what i say is deliberateits deeply meditated i simply cant live without you and i hold that together we may do great things  she seemed to wonder what sort of things  the things of my profession of my life the things one does for ones country the responsibility and the honour of great affairs deeply fascinating when ones immersed in them and more exciting reallyput them even at thatthan the excitements of the theatre care for me only a little and youll see what they are theyll take hold of you believe me believe me peter pleaded every fibre of my being trembles in what i say to you  you admitted yesterday it wouldnt do she made answer where were the fibres of your being then  they throbbed in me even more than now and i was trying like an ass not to feel them where was this evening yesterdaywhere were the maddening hours ive just spent ah youre the perfection of perfections and as i sat there tonight you taught me what i really want  the perfection of perfections the girl echoed with the strangest smile  i neednt try to tell you you must have felt tonight with such rapture what you are what you can do how can i give that up he piteously went on  how can i my poor friend i like your plans and your responsibilities and your great affairs as you call them voyons theyre infantile ive just shown that im a perfection of perfections therefore its just the moment to renounce as you gracefully say oh i was sure i was sure and miriam paused resting eyes at once lighted and troubled on him as in the effort to think of some arrangement that would help him out of his absurdity i was sure i mean that if you did come your poor dear doting brain would be quite confused she presently pursued i cant be a muff in public just for you pourtant dear me why do you like us so much  like you i loathe you  je le vois parbleu bien she lightly returned i mean why do you feel us judge us understand us so well i please you because you see because you know and then for that very reason of my pleasing you must adapt me to your convenience you must take me over as they say you admire me as an artist and therefore want to put me into a box in which the artist will breathe her last ah be reasonable you must let her live  let her live as if i could prevent her living peter cried with unmistakable conviction even if i did wish how could i prevent a spirit like yours from expressing itself dont talk about my putting you in a box for dearest child im taking you out of one he all persuasively explained the artist is irrepressible eternal shell be in everything you are and in everything you do and youll go about with her triumphantly exerting your powers charming the world carrying everything before you  miriams colour rose through all her artificial surfaces at this all but convincing appeal and she asked whimsically shall you like that  like my wife to be the most brilliant woman in europe i think i can do with it  arent you afraid of me  not a bit  bravely said how little you know me after all sighed the girl  i tell the truth peter ardently went on and you must do me the justice to admit that ive taken the time to dig deep into my feelings im not an infatuated boy ive lived ive had experience ive observed in short i know what i mean and what i want it isnt a thing to reason about its simply a need that consumes me ive put it on starvation diet but thats no usereally its no use miriam the young man declared with a ring that spoke enough of his sincerity it is no question of my trusting you its simply a question of your trusting me youre all right as ive heard you say yourself youre frank spontaneous generous youre a magnificent creature just quietly marry me and ill manage you  manage me the girls inflexion was droll it made him change colour  i mean ill give you a larger life than the largest you can get in any other way the stage is great no doubt but the worlds greater its a bigger theatre than any of those places in the strand well go in for realities instead of fables and youll do them far better than you do the fables  miriam had listened attentively but her face that could so show things showed her despair at his perverted ingenuity pardon my saying it after your delightful tributes to my worth she returned in a moment but ive never listened to anything quite so grandly unreal you think so well of me that humility itself ought to keep me silent nevertheless i must utter a few shabby words of sense im a magnificent creature on the stagewell and good its what i want to be and its charming to see such evidence that i succeed but off the stage woe betide us both i should lose all my advantages the facts so patent that it seems to me im very goodnatured even to discuss it with you  are you on the stage now pray ah miriam if it werent for the respect i owe you her companion wailed  if it werent for that i shouldnt have come here to meet you my gift is the thing that takes you could there be a better proof than that its tonights display of it that has brought you to this unreason its indeed a misfortune that youre so sensitive to our poor arts since they play such tricks with your power to see things as they are without my share of them i should be a dull empty thirdrate woman and yet thats the fate you ask me to face and insanely pretend youre ready to face yourself  without itwithout it sherringham cried your own sophistrys infinitely worse than mine i should like to see you without it for the fiftieth part of a second what i ask you to give up is the dusty boards of the playhouse and the flaring footlights but not the very essence of your being your gift your genius is yourself and its because its yourself that i yearn for you if it had been a thing you could leave behind by the easy dodge of stepping off the stage i would never have looked at you a second time dont talk to me as if i were a simpletonwith your own false simplifications you were made to charm and console to represent beauty and harmony and variety to miserable human beings and the daily life of man is the theatre for thatnot a vulgar shop with a turnstile thats open only once in the twentyfour hours without it verily peter proceeded with a still deep heat that kept down in a manner his rising scorn and exasperated passion please let me know the first time youre without your face without your voice your step your exquisite spirit the turn of your head and the wonder of your look  miriam at this moved away from him with a port that resembled what she sometimes showed on the stage when she turned her young back upon the footlights and then after a few steps grandly swept round again this evolution she performedit was over in an instanton the present occasion even to stopping short with her eyes upon him and her head admirably erect surely its strange she said the way the other solution never occurs to you  the other solution  that you should stay on the stage  i dont understand you her friend gloomed  stay on my stage come off your own  for a little he said nothing then you mean that if ill do that youll have me  i mean that if it were to occur to you to offer me a little sacrifice on your own side it might place the matter in a slightly more attractive light  continue to let you actas my wife he appealed is it a real condition am i to understand that those are your terms  i may say so without fear because youll never accept them  would you accept them from me he demanded accept the manly the professional sacrifice see me throw up my work my prospectsof course i should have to do thatand simply become your appendage  she raised her arms for a prodigious fall my dear fellow you invite me with the best conscience in the world to become yours  the cases are not equal youd make of me the husband of an actress i should make of you the wife of an ambassador  the husband of an actress cest bientôt dit in that tone of scorn if youre consistent said miriam all lucid and hard it ought to be a proud position for you  what do you mean if im consistent  havent you always insisted on the beauty and interest of our art and the greatness of our mission havent you almost come to blows with poor gabriel nash about it what did all that mean if you wont face the first consequences of your theory either it was an enlightened conviction or it was an empty pretence if you were only talking against time im glad to know it she rolled out with a darkening eye the better the cause it seems to me the better the deed and if the theatre is important to the human spirit as you used to say so charmingly and if into the bargain youve the pull of being so fond of me i dont see why it should be monstrous of you to give us your services in an intelligent indirect way of course if youre not serious we neednt talk at all but if you are with your conception of what the actor can do why is it so base to come to the actors aid taking one devotion with another if im so fine im worth looking after a bit and the place where im finest is the place to look after me  he had a long pause again taking her in as it seemed to him he had never done you were never finer than at this minute in the deepest domesticity of private life ive no conception whatever of what the actor can do and no theory whatever about the importance of the theatre any infatuation of that sort has completely dropped from me and for all i care the theatre may go to the dogswhich i judge it altogether probably will  youre dishonest youre ungrateful youre false miriam flashed it was the theatre brought you hereif it hadnt been for the theatre i never would have looked at you it was in the name of the theatre you first made love to me its to the theatre you owe every advantage that so far as im concerned you possess  i seem to possess a great many poor peter derisively groaned  you might avail yourself better of those you have you make me angry but i want to be fair said the shining creature and i cant be unless you are youre not fair nor candid nor honourable when you swallow your words and abjure your faith when you throw over old friends and old memories for a selfish purpose  selfish purpose is in your own convenient idiom bientôt dit peter promptly answered i suppose you consider that if i truly esteemed you i should be ashamed to deprive the world of the light of your genius perhaps my esteem isnt of the right qualitythere are different kinds arent there at any rate ive explained to you that i propose to deprive the world of nothing at all you shall be celebrated allez  vain words vain words my dear and she turned off again in her impatience i know of course she added quickly that to befool yourself with such twaddle you must be pretty bad  yes im pretty bad he admitted looking at her dismally what do you do with the declaration you made me the other daythe day i found my cousin herethat youd take me if i should come to you as one who had risen high  miriam thought of it i rememberthe chaff about the honours the orders the stars and garters my poor foolish friend dont be so painfully literal dont you know a joke when you see it it was to worry your cousin wasnt it but it didnt in the least succeed  why should you wish to worry my cousin  because hes so provoking she instantly answered after which she laughed as if for her falling too simply into the trap he had laid surely at all events i had my freedom no less than i have it now pray what explanations should i have owed you and in what fear of you should i have gone however that has nothing to do with it say i did tell you that we might arrange it on the day you should come to me covered with glory in the shape of little tinkling medals why should you anticipate that transaction by so many years and knock me down such a long time in advance wheres the glory please and where are the medals  dearest girl am i not going to strange partsa capital promotionnext month he insistently demanded and cant you trust me enough to believe i speak with a real appreciation of the facts that im not lying to you in short when i tell you ive my foot in the stirrup the glorys dawning im all right too  what you propose to me then is to accompany you tout bonnement to your new post what you propose to me is to pack up and start  you put it in a nutshell but peters smile was strained  youre touchingit has its charm but you cant get anything in any of the americas you know im assured there are no medals to be picked up in those partswhich are therefore strange indeed thats why the diplomatic body hate them all  theyre on the way theyre on the wayhe could only feverishly hammer the people here dont keep us long in disagreeable places unless we want to stay theres one thing you can get anywhere if youve ability and nowhere if youve not and in the disagreeable places generally more than in the others and thatsince its the element of the question were discussingis simply success its odious to be put on ones swagger but i protest against being treated as if i had nothing to offerto offer a person who has such glories of her own im not a little presumptuous ass im a man accomplished and determined and the omens are on my side peter faltered a moment and then with a queer expression went on remember after all that strictly speaking your glories are also still in the future an exclamation at these words burst from miriams lips but her companion resumed quickly ask my official superiors ask any of my colleagues if they consider ive nothing to offer  he had an idea as he ceased speaking that she was on the point of breaking out with some strong word of resentment at his allusion to the contingent nature of her prospects but it only deepened his wound to hear her say with extraordinary mildness its perfectly true that my glories are still to come that i may fizzle out and that my little success of today is perhaps a mere flash in the pan stranger things have beensomething of that sort happens every day but dont we talk too much of that part of it she asked with a weary patience that was noble in its effect surely its vulgar to think only of the noise ones going to makeespecially when one remembers how utterly bêtes most of the people will be among whom one makes it it isnt to my possible glories i cling its simply to my idea even if its destined to betray me and sink me i like it better than anything elsea thousand times better im sorry to have to put it in such a way than tossing up my head as the fine lady of a little coterie  a little coterie i dont know what youre talking aboutfor this at least peter could fight  a big coterie then its only that at the best a nasty prim official woman whos perched on her little local pedestal and thinks shes a queen for ever because shes ridiculous for an hour oh you neednt tell me ive seen them abroadthe dreariest femalesand could imitate them here i could do one for you on the spot if i werent so tired its scarcely worth mentioning perhaps all this whilebut im ready to drop she picked up the white mantle she had tossed off flinging it round her with her usual amplitude of gesture theyre waiting for me and i confess im hungry if i dont hurry theyll eat up all the nice things dont say i havent been obliging and come back when youre better goodnight  i quite agree with you that weve talked too much about the vulgar side of our question peter returned walking round to get between her and the french window by which she apparently had a view of leaving the room thats because ive wanted to bribe you briberys almost always vulgar  yes you should do better merci theres a cab some of them have come for me i must go she added listening for a sound that reached her from the road  peter listened too making out no cab believe me it isnt wise to turn your back on such an affection as mine and on such a confidence he broke out again speaking almost in a warning tonethere was a touch of superior sternness in it as of a rebuke for real folly but it was meant to be tenderand stopping her within a few feet of the window such things are the most precious that life has to give us he added all but didactically  she had listened once more for a little then she appeared to give up the idea of the cab the reader need hardly be told that at this stage of her youthful history the right way for her lover to take her wouldnt have been to picture himself as acting for her highest good i like your calling the feeling with which i inspire you confidence she presently said and the deep note of the few words had something of the distant mutter of thunder  what is it then when i offer you everything i have everything i am everything i shall ever be  she seemed to measure him as for the possible success of an attempt to pass him but she remained where she was im sorry for you yes but im also rather ashamed  ashamed of me  a brave offer to see me throughthats what i should call confidence you say today that you hate the theatreand do you know what has made you do it the fact that it has too large a place in your mind to let you disown it and throw it over with a good conscience it has a deep fascination for you and yet youre not strong enough to do so enlightened and public a thing as take up with it in my person youre ashamed of yourself for that as all your constant high claims for it are on record so you blaspheme against it to try and cover your retreat and your treachery and straighten out your personal situation but it wont do dear mr sherringhamit wont do at all miriam proceeded with a triumphant almost judicial lucidity which made her companion stare you havent the smallest excuse of stupidity and your perversity is no excuse whatever leave her alone altogethera poor girl whos making her wayor else come frankly to help her to give her the benefit of your wisdom dont lock her up for life under the pretence of doing her good what does one most good is to see a little honesty youre the best judge the best critic the best observer the best believer that ive ever come across youre committed to it by everything youve said to me for a twelvemonth by the whole turn of your mind by the way youve followed us up all of us from far back if an arts noble and beneficent one shouldnt be afraid to offer it ones arm your cousin isnt he can make sacrifices  my cousin peter amazedly echoed why wasnt it only the other day you were throwing his sacrifices in his teeth  under this imputation on her straightness miriam flinched but for an instant i did that to worry you she smiled  why should you wish to worry me if you care so little about me  care little about you havent i told you often didnt i tell you yesterday how much i care aint i showing it now by spending half the night here with yougiving myself away to all those cynicstaking all this trouble to persuade you to hold up your head and have the courage of your opinions  you invent my opinions for your convenience said peter all undaunted as long ago as the night i introduced you in paris to mademoiselle voisin you accused me of looking down on those who practise your art i remember how you came down on me because i didnt take your friend dashwood seriously enough perhaps i didnt but if already at that time i was so wide of the mark you can scarcely accuse me of treachery now  i dont remember but i daresay youre right miriam coldly meditated what i accused you of then was probably simply what i reproach you with nowthe germ at least of your deplorable weakness you consider that we do awfully valuable work and yet you wouldnt for the world let people suppose you really take our side if your position was even at that time so false so much the worse for you thats all oh its refreshing his formidable friend exclaimed after a pause during which peter seemed to himself to taste the full bitterness of despair so baffled and cheapened he intimately feltoh its refreshing to see a man burn his ships in a cause that appeals to him give up something precious for it and break with horrid timidities and snobberies its the most beautiful sight in the world  poor peter sore as he was and with the cold breath of failure in his face nevertheless burst out laughing at this fine irony youre magnificent you give me at this moment the finest possible illustration of what you mean by burning ones ships verily verily theres no one like you talk of timidity talk of refreshment if i had any talent for it id go on the stage tomorrow so as to spend my life with you the better  if youll do that ill be your wife the day after your first appearance that would be really respectable miriam said  unfortunately ive no talent  that would only make it the more respectable  youre just like poor nick peter returnedyouve taken to imitating gabriel nash dont you see that its only if it were a question of my going on the stage myself that there would be a certain fitness in your contrasting me invidiously with nick and in my giving up one career for another but simply to stand in the wing and hold your shawl and your smellingbottle he concluded mournfully as if he had ceased to debate  holding my shawl and my smellingbottle is a mere detail representing a very small part of the whole precious service the protection and encouragement for which a woman in my position might be indebted to a man interested in her work and as accomplished and determined as you very justly describe yourself  and would it be your idea that such a man should live on the money earned by an exhibition of the person of his still more accomplished and still more determined wife  why not if they work togetherif theres something of his spirit and his support in everything she does miriam demanded je vous attendais with the famous person of course thats the great stick they beat us with yes we show it for money those of us who have anything decent to show and some no doubt who havent which is the real scandal what will you have its only the envelope of the idea its only our machinery which ought to be conceded to us and in proportion as the idea takes hold of us do we become unconscious of the clumsy body poor old personif you knew what we think of it if you dont forget it thats your own affair it shows youre dense before the idea  that im denseand peter appealed to their lamplit solitude the favouring intimate night that only witnessed his defeat as if this outrage had been all that was wanting  i mean the public isthe public who pays us after all they expect us to look at them too who are not half so well worth it if you should see some of the creatures who have the face to plant themselves there in the stalls before one for three mortal hours i daresay it would be simpler to have no bodies but were all in the same box and it would be a great injustice to the idea and were all showing ourselves all the while only some of us are not worth paying  youre extraordinarily droll but somehow i cant laugh at you he said his handsome face drawn by his pain to a contraction sufficiently attesting the fact do you remember the second time i ever saw youthe day you recited at my place he abruptly asked a good deal as if he were taking from his quiver an arrow which if it was the last was also one of the sharpest  perfectly and what an idiot i was though it was only yesterday  you expressed to me then a deep detestation of the sort of selfexposure to which the profession you were taking up would commit you if you compared yourself to a contortionist at a country fair im only taking my cue from you  i dont know what i may have said then replied miriam whose steady flight was not arrested by this ineffectual bolt i was no doubt already wonderful for talking of things i know nothing about i was only on the brink of the stream and i perhaps thought the water colder than it is one warms it a bit ones self when once ones in of course im a contortionist and of course theres a hateful side but dont you see how that very fact puts a price on every compensation on the help of those who are ready to insist on the other side the grand one and especially on the sympathy of the person whos ready to insist most and to keep before us the great thing the element that makes up for everything  the element peter questioned with a vagueness that was pardonably exaggerated do you mean your success  i mean what youve so often been eloquent about she returned with an indulgent shrugthe way we simply stir peoples souls ah theres where life can help us she broke out with a change of tone theres where human relations and affections can help us love and faith and joy and suffering and experiencei dont know what to call em they suggest things they light them up and sanctify them as you may say they make them appear worth doing she became radiant a while as if with a splendid vision then melting into still another accent which seemed all nature and harmony and charity she proceeded i must tell you that in the matter of what we can do for each other i have a tremendously high ideal i go in for closeness of union for identity of interest a true marriage as they call it must do one a lot of good  he stood there looking at her for a time during which her eyes sustained his penetration without a relenting gleam some lapse of cruelty or of paradox but with a passionate inarticulate sound he turned away to remain on the edge of the window his hands in his pockets gazing defeatedly doggedly into the featureless night into the little black garden which had nothing to give him but a familiar smell of damp the warm darkness had no relief for him and miriams histrionic hardness flung him back against a fifthrate world against a bedimmed starpunctured nature which had no consolationthe bleared irresponsive eyes of the london firmament for the brief space of his glaring at these things he dumbly and helplessly raged what he wanted was something that was not in that thick prospect what was the meaning of this sudden offensive importunity of art this senseless mocking catch like some irritating chorus of conspirators in a bad opera in which her voice was so incongruously conjoined with nicks and in which biddys sweet little pipe had not scrupled still more bewilderingly to mingle art might yield to damnation what commission after all had he ever given it to better him or bother him if the pointless groan in which peter exhaled a part of his humiliation had been translated into words these words would have been as heavily charged with a genuine british mistrust of the uncanny principle as if the poor fellow speaking them had never quitted his island several acquired perceptions had struck a deep root in him but an immemorial compact formation lay deeper still he tried at the present hour to rest on it spiritually but found it inelastic and at the very moment when most conscious of this absence of the rebound or of any tolerable ease he felt his vision solicited by an object which as he immediately guessed could only add to the complication of things  an undefined shape hovered before him in the garden halfway between the gate and the house it remained outside of the broad shaft of lamplight projected from the window it wavered for a moment after it had become aware of his observation and then whisked round the corner of the lodge this characteristic movement so effectually dispelled the mysteryit could only be mrs rooth who resorted to such conspicuous secreciesthat to feel the game up and his interview over he had no need to see the figure reappear on second thoughts and dodge about in the dusk with a sportive vexatious vagueness evidently miriams warning of a few minutes before had been founded a cab had deposited her anxious mother at the garden door mrs rooth had entered with precautions she had approached the house and retreated she had effaced herselfhad peered and waited and listened maternal solicitude and muddled calculations had drawn her from a feast as yet too imperfectly commemorative the heroine of the occasion of course had been intolerably missed so that the old woman had both obliged the company and quieted her own nerves by jumping insistently into a hansom and rattling up to saint johns wood to reclaim the absentee but if she had wished to be in time she had also desired not to be impertinent and would have been still more embarrassed to say what she aspired to promote than to phrase what she had proposed to hinder she wanted to abstain tastefully to interfere felicitously and more generally and justifiablythe small hours having cometo see what her young charges were up to she would probably have gathered that they were quarrelling and she appeared now to be motioning to peter to know if it were over he took no notice of her signals if signals they were he only felt that before he made way for the poor odious lady there was one small spark he might strike from miriams flint  without letting her guess that her mother was on the premises he turned again to his companion halfexpecting she would have taken her chance to regard their discussion as more than terminated and by the other egress flit away from him in silence but she was still there she was in the act of approaching him with a manifest intention of kindness and she looked indeed to his surprise like an angel of mercy  dont let us part so harshly she saidwith your trying to make me feel as if i were merely disobliging its no use talkingwe only hurt each other let us hold our tongues like decent people and go about our business it isnt as if you hadnt any curewhen youve such a capital one try it try it my dear friendyoull see i wish you the highest promotion and the quickestevery success and every reward when youve got them all some day and ive become a great swell too well meet on that solid basis and youll be glad ive been dreadful now  surely before i leave you ive a right to ask you this he answered holding fast in both his own the cool hand of farewell she had chosen finally to torment him with are you ready to follow up by a definite promise your implied assurance that ive a remedy  a definite promise miriam benignly gazedit was the perfection of indirectness i dont imply that youve a remedy i declare it on the housetops that delightful girl  im not talking of any delightful girl but you he broke in with a voice that as he afterwards learned struck mrs rooths ears in the garden with affright i simply hold you under pain of being convicted of the grossest prevarication to the strict sense of what you said ten minutes ago  ah ive said so many things one has to do that to get rid of you you rather hurt my hand she addedand jerked it away in a manner showing that if she was an angel of mercy her mercy was partly for herself  as i understand you then i may have some hope if i do renounce my profession peter pursued if i break with everything my prospects my studies my training my emoluments my past and my future the service of my country and the ambition of my life and engage to take up instead the business of watching your interests so far as i may learn how and ministering to your triumphs so far as may in me lieif after further reflexion i decide to go through these preliminaries have i your word that i may definitely look to you to reward me with your precious hand  i dont think youve any right to put the question to me now she returned with a promptitude partly produced perhaps by the clearcut form his solemn speech had giventhere was a charm in the sound of itto each item of his enumeration the case is so very contingent so dependent on what you ingeniously call your further reflexion while you really reserve everything you ask me to commit myself if its a question of further reflexion why did you drag me up here and then she added im so far from wishing you to take any such monstrous step  monstrous you call it just now you said it would be sublime  sublime if its done with spontaneity with passion ridiculous if its done after further reflexion as you said perfectly a while ago it isnt a thing to reason about  ah what a help youd be to me in diplomacy peter yearningly cried will you give me a year to consider  would you trust me for a year  why not if im ready to trust you for life  oh i shouldnt be free then worse luck and how much you seem to take for granted one must like you  remember he could immediately say that youve made a great point of your liking me wouldnt you do so still more if i were heroic  she showed him for all her high impatience now the interest of a long look i think i should pity you in such a cause give it all to her dont throw away a real happiness  ah you cant back out of your position with a few vague and even rather impertinent words peter protested you accuse me of swallowing my opinions but you swallow your pledges youve painted in heavenly colours the sacrifice im talking of and now you must take the consequences  the consequences  why my coming back in a year to square you  ah youre a boreshe let him have it at last come back when you like i dont wonder youve grown desperate but fancy me then she added as she looked past him at a new interlocutor  yes but if hell square you peter heard mrs rooths voice respond all persuasively behind him she had stolen up to the window now had passed the threshold was in the room but her daughter had not been startled what is it he wants to do dear she continued to miriam  to induce me to marry him if hell go upon the stage hell practise over therewhere hes goingand then come back and appear isnt it too dreadful talk him out of it stay with him soothe him the girl hurried on youll find some drinks and some biscuits in the cupboardkeep him with you pacify him give him his little supper meanwhile ill go to mine ill take the brougham dont follow  with which words miriam bounded into the garden her white drapery shining for an instant in the darkness before she disappeared peter looked about him to pick up his hat but while he did so heard the bang of the gate and the quick carriage get into motion mrs rooth appeared to sway violently and in opposed directions that of the impulse to rush after miriam and that of the extraordinary possibility to which the young lady had alluded she was in doubt yet at a venture detaining him with a maternal touch she twinkled up at their visitor like an insinuating glowworm im so glad you came  im not ive got nothing by it peter said as he found his hat  oh it was so beautiful she declared  the playyes wonderful im afraid its too late for me to avail myself of the privilege your daughter offers me goodnight  ah its a pity wont you take anything asked mrs rooth when i heard your voice so high i was scared and hung back but before he could reply she added are you really thinking of the stage  it comes to the same thing  do you mean youve proposed  oh unmistakably  and what does she say  why you heard she says im an ass  ah the little wretch laughed mrs rooth leave her to me ill help you but you are mad give up nothingleast of all your advantages  i wont give up your daughter said peter reflecting that if this was cheap it was at any rate good enough for mrs rooth he mended it a little indeed by adding darkly but you cant make her take me  i can prevent her taking any one else  oh can you peter cried with more scepticism than ceremony  youll seeyoull see he passed into the garden but after she had blown out the candles and drawn the window to mrs rooth went with him all youve got to do is to be yourselfto be true to your fine position she explained as they proceeded trust me with the resttrust me and be quiet  how can one be quiet after this magnificent evening  yes but its just that panted the eager old woman it has launched her so on this sea of dangers that to make up for the loss of the old security dont you know we must take a still firmer hold  aye of what peter asked as mrs rooths comfort became vague while she stopped with him at the garden door  ah you know of the real life of the true anchor her hansom was waiting for her and she added i kept it you see but a little extravagance on the night ones fortune has come  peter stared yes there were people whose fortune had come but he managed to stammer are you following her again  for youfor you and she clambered into the vehicle from the seat enticingly she offered him the place beside her wont you come too i know he invited you peter declined with a quick gesture and as he turned away he heard her call after him to cheer him on his lonely walk i shall keep this up i shall never lose sight of her     book eighth     xlvii   when mrs dallow returned to london just before london broke up the fact was immediately known in calcutta gardens and was promptly communicated to nick dormer by his sister bridget he had learnt it in no other wayhe had had no correspondence with julia during her absence he gathered that his mother and sisters were not ignorant of her whereaboutshe never mentioned her name to thembut as to this he was not sure if the source of their information had been the morning post or a casual letter received by the inscrutable biddy he knew biddy had some epistolary commerce with julia he had an impression grace occasionally exchanged letters with mrs gresham biddy however who as he was also well aware was always studying what he would like forbore to talk to him about the absent mistress of harsh beyond once dropping the remark that she had gone from florence to venice and was enjoying gondolas and sunsets too much to leave them nicks comment on this was that she was a happy woman to have such a go at titian and tintoret as he spoke and for some time afterwards the sense of how he himself should enjoy a like go made him ache with ineffectual longing  he had forbidden himself at the present to think of absence not only because it would be inconvenient and expensive but because it would be a kind of retreat from the enemy a concession to difficulty the enemy was no particular person and no particular body of persons not his mother not mr carteret who as he heard from the doctor at beauclere lingered on sinking and sinking till his vitality appeared to have the vertical depth of a goldmine not his pacified constituents who had found a healthy diversion in returning another liberal wholly without mrs dallows aid she had not participated even to the extent of a responsive telegram in the election not his late colleagues in the house nor the biting satirists of the newspapers nor the brilliant women he took down at dinnerpartiesthere was only one sense in which he ever took them down not in short his friends his foes his private thoughts the periodical phantom of his shocked father the enemy was simply the general awkwardness of his situation this awkwardness was connected with the sense of responsibility so greatly deprecated by gabriel nash gabriel who had ceased to roam of late on purpose to miss as few scenes as possible of the drama rapidly growing dull alas of his friends destiny but that compromising relation scarcely drew the soreness from it the public flurry produced by his collapse had only been large enough to mark the flatness of our young mans position when it was over to have had a few jokes cracked audibly at your expense wasnt an ordeal worth talking of the hardest thing about it was merely that there had not been enough of them to yield a proportion of good ones nick had felt in fine the benefit of living in an age and in a society where number and pressure have for the individual figure especially when its a zero compensations almost equal to their cruelties  no the pinch for his conscience after a few weeks had passed was simply an acute mistrust of the superficiality of performance into which the desire to justify himself might hurry him that desire was passionate as regards julia dallow it was ardent also as regards his mother and to make it absolutely uncomfortable it was complicated with the conviction that neither of them would know his justification even when she should see it they probably couldnt know it if they would and very certainly wouldnt if they could he assured himself however that this limitation wouldnt matter it was their affairhis own was simply to have the right sort of thing to show the work he was now attempting wasnt the right sort of thing though doubtless julia for instance would dislike it almost as much as if it were the two portraits of miriam after the first exhilaration of his finding himself at large filled him with no private glee they were not in the direction in which he wished for the present really to move there were moments when he felt almost angry though of course he held his tongue when by the few persons who saw them they were pronounced wonderfully clever that they were wonderfully clever was just the detestable thing in them so active had that cleverness been in making them seem better than they were there were people to whom he would have been ashamed to show them and these were the people whom it would give him most pleasure some day to please not only had he many an hour of disgust at his actual work but he thought he saw as in an ugly revelation that nature had cursed him with an odious facility and that the lesson of his life the sternest and wholesomest would be to keep out of the trap it had laid for him he had fallen into this trap on the threshold and had only scrambled out with his honour he had a talent for appearance and that was the fatal thing he had a damnable suppleness and a gift of immediate response a readiness to oblige that made him seem to take up causes which he really left lying enabled him to learn enough about them in an hour to have all the air of having converted them to his use many people used themthat was the only thing to be saidwho had taken them in much less he was at all events too clever by half since this pernicious overflow had wrecked most of his attempts he had assumed a virtue and enjoyed assuming it and the assumption had cheated his father and his mother and his affianced wife and his rich benefactor and the candid burgesses of harsh and the cynical reporters of the newspapers his enthusiasms had been but young curiosity his speeches had been young agility his professions and adhesions had been like postagestamps without glue the head was all right but they wouldnt stick he stood ready now to wring the neck of the irrepressible vice that certainly would tend to nothing so much as to get him into further trouble his only real justification would be to turn patiencehis own of courseinside out yet if there should be a way to misread that recipe his humbugging genius could be trusted infallibly to discover it cheap and easy results would dangle before him little amateurish conspicuities at exhibitions helped by his history putting it in his power to triumph with a quick what do you say to that over those he had wounded the fear of this danger was corrosive it poisoned even lawful joys if he should have a striking picture at the academy next year it wouldnt be a crime yet he couldnt help suspecting any conditions that would enable him to be striking so soon in this way he felt quite enough how gabriel nash had had him whenever railing at his fever for proof and how inferior as a productive force the desire to win over the illdisposed might be to the principle of quiet growth nash had a foreign manner of lifting up his finger and waving it before him as if to put an end to everything whenever it became in conversation or discussion to any extent a question whether any one would like anything  it was presumably in some degree at least a due respect for the principle of quiet growth that kept nick on the spot at present made him stick fast to rosedale road and calcutta gardens and deny himself the simplifications of absence do what he would he couldnt despoil himself of the impression that the disagreeable was somehow connected with the salutary and the quiet with the disagreeable when stubbornly borne so he resisted a hundred impulses to run away to paris or to florence coarse forms of the temptation to persuade himself by material motion that he was launched he stayed in london because it seemed to him he was there more conscious of what he had undertaken and he had a horror of shirking the consciousness one element in it indeed was his noting how little convenience he could have found in a foreign journey even had his judgement approved such a subterfuge the stoppage of his supplies from beauclere had now become an historic fact with something of the majesty of its class about it he had had time to see what a difference this would make in his life his means were small and he had several old debts the number of which as he believed loomed large to his mothers imagination he could never tell her she exaggerated because he told her nothing of that sort in these days they had no intimate talk for an impenetrable partition a tall bristling hedge of untrimmed misconceptions had sprung up between them poor biddy had made a hole in it through which she squeezed from side to side to keep up communications at the cost of many rents and scratches but lady agnes walked straight and stiff never turning her head never stopping to pluck the least little daisy of consolation it was in this manner she wished to signify that she had accepted her wrongs she draped herself in them as in a roman mantle and had never looked so proud and wasted and handsome as now that her eyes rested only on ruins  nick was extremely sorry for her though he marked as a dreadful want of grace her never setting a foot in rosedale roadshe mentioned his studio no more than if it had been a private gamblinghouse or something worse sorry because he was well aware that for the hour everything must appear to her to have crumbled the luxury of broadwood would have to crumble his mind was very clear about that biddys prospects had withered to the finest dreariest dust and biddy indeed taking a lesson from her brothers perversities seemed little disposed to better a bad business she professed the most peacemaking sentiments but when it came really to doing something to brighten up the scene she showed herself portentously corrupt after peter sherringhams heartless flight she had wantonly slighted an excellent opportunity to repair her misfortune lady agnes had reason to infer about the end of june that young mr grindon the only sonthe other children being girlsof an immensely rich industrial and political baronet in the north was literally waiting for the faintest sign this reason she promptly imparted to her younger daughter whose intelligence had to take it in but who had shown it no other consideration biddy had set her charming face as a stone she would have nothing to do with signs and she practically speaking wilfully wickedly refused a magnificent offer so that the young man carried his high expectations elsewhere how much in earnest he had been was proved by the fact that before goodwood had come and gone he was captured by lady muriel macpherson it was superfluous to insist on the frantic determination to get married written on such an accident as that nick knew of this episode only through grace and he deplored its having occurred in the midst of other disasters  he knew or he suspected something more as wellsomething about his brother percival which should it come to light no phase of their common history would be genial enough to gloss over it had usually been supposed that percys store of comfort against the ills of life was confined to the infallibility of his rifle he was not sensitive and his use of that weapon represented a resource against which common visitations might have spent themselves it had suddenly come to nicks ears however that he cultivated a concurrent support in the person of a robust countrywoman housed in an ivied corner of warwickshire in whom he had long been interested and whom without any flourish of magnanimity he had ended by making his wife the situation of the latest born of the pledges of this affection a blooming boythere had been two or three previouslywas therefore perfectly regular and of a nature to make a difference in the worldly position as the phrase ran of his moneyless uncle if there be degrees in the absolute and percy had an heirothers moreover supposedly followingnick would have to regard himself as still more moneyless than before his brothers last step was doubtless given the case to be commended but such discoveries were enlivening only when made in other families and lady agnes would scarcely enjoy learning to what tune she had become a grandmother  nick forbore from delicacy to intimate to biddy that he thought it a pity she couldnt care for mr grindon but he had a private sense that if she had been capable of such a feat it would have lightened a little the weight he himself had to carry he bore her a slight grudge which lasted till julia dallow came back when the circumstance of the girls being summoned immediately down to harsh created a diversion that was perhaps after all only fanciful biddy as we know entertained a theory which nick had found occasion to combat that mrs dallow had not treated him perfectly well therefore in going to harsh the very first time that relative held out a hand to her so jealous a little sister must have recognised a special inducement the inducement might have been that the relative had comfort for her that she was acting by her cousins direct advice that they were still in close communion on the question of the offers biddy was not to accept that in short peters sister had taken upon herself to see that their young friend should remain free for the day of the fugitives inevitable return once or twice indeed nick wondered if julia had herself been visited in a larger sense by the thought of retracing her stepsif she wished to draw out her young friends opinion as to how she might do that gracefully during the few days she was in town nick had seen her twice in great stanhope street but neither time alone she had said to him on one of these occasions in her odd explosive way i should have thought youd have gone away somewhereit must be such a bore of course she firmly believed he was staying for miriam which he really was not and probably she had written this false impression off to peter who still more probably would prefer to regard it as just nick was staying for miriam only in the sense that he should very glad of the money he might receive for the portrait he was engaged in painting that money would be a great convenience to him in spite of the obstructive ground miriam had taken in pretendingshe had blown half a gale about itthat he had had no right to dispose of such a production without her consent his answer to this was simply that the purchaser was so little of a stranger that it didnt go so to speak out of the family out of hers it didnt matter miriams retort that if mr sherringham had formerly been no stranger he was utterly one now so that nothing would ever less delight him than to see her hated image on his wall he would back out of the bargain and nick be left with the picture on his hands nick jeered at this shallow theory and when she came to sit the question served as well as another to sprinkle their familiar silences with chaff he already knew something as we have seen of the conditions in which his distracted kinsman had left england and this connected itself in casual meditation with some of the calculations imputable to julia and to biddy there had naturally been a sequel to the queer behaviour perceptible in peter at the theatre on the eve of his departurea sequel lighted by a word of miriams in the course of her first sitting to nick after her great night fancyso this observation ranfancy the dear man finding time in the press of all his last duties to ask me to marry him  he told me you had found time in the press of all yours to say you would nick replied and this was pretty much all that had passed on the subject between themsave of course her immediately making clear that peter had grossly misinformed him what had happened was that she had said she would do nothing of the sort she professed a desire not to be confronted again with this obnoxious theme and nick easily fell in with itquite from his own settled inclination not to handle that kind of subject with her if julia had false ideas about him and if peter had them too his part of the business was to take the simplest course to establish the falsity there were difficulties indeed attached even to the simplest course but there would be a difficulty the less if one should forbear to meddle in promiscuous talk with the general suggestive topic of intimate unions it is certain that in these days nick cultivated the practice of forbearances for which he didnt receive for which perhaps he never would receive due credit  he had been convinced for some time that one of the next things he should hear would be that julia dallow had arranged to marry either mr macgeorge or some other master of multitudes he could think of that now he foundthink of it with resignation even when julia before his eyes looked so handsomely forgetful that her appearance had to be taken as referring still more to their original intimacy than to his comparatively superficial offence what made this accomplishment of his own remarkable was that there was something else he thought of quite as muchthe fact that he had only to see her again to feel by how great a charm she had in the old days taken possession of him this charm operated apparently in a very direct primitive way her presence diffused it and fully established it but her absence left comparatively little of it behind it dwelt in the very facts of her personit was something she happened physically to be yetconsidering that the question was of something very like lovelinessits envelope of associations of memories and recurrences had no great destiny she packed it up and took it away with her quite as if she had been a woman who had come to sell a set of laces the laces were as wonderful as ever when taken out of the box but to admire again their rarity you had to send for the woman what was above all remarkable for our young man was that miriam rooth fetched a fellow vulgarly speaking very much less than julia at the times when being on the spot julia did fetch he could paint miriam day after day without any agitating blur of vision in fact the more he saw of her the clearer grew the atmosphere through which she blazed the more her richness became one with that of the flowering work there are reciprocities and special sympathies in such a relation mysterious affinities they used to be called divinations of private congruity nick had an unexpressed conviction that if according to his defeated desire he had embarked with mrs dallow in this particular quest of a great prize disaster would have overtaken them on the deep waters even with the limited risk indeed disaster had come but it was of a different kind and it had the advantage for him that now she couldnt reproach and denounce him as the cause of itcouldnt do so at least on any ground he was obliged to recognise she would never know how much he had cared for her how much he cared for her still inasmuch as the conclusive proof for himself was his conscious reluctance to care for another womanevidence she positively misread some day he would doubtless try to do that but such a day seemed as yet far off and he had meanwhile no spite no vindictive impulse to help him the soreness that mingled with his liberation the sense of indignity even as of a full cup suddenly dashed by a blundering hand from his lips demanded certainly a balm but it found the balm for the time in another passion not in a rancorous exercise of the samea passion strong enough to make him forget what a pity it was he was not so formed as to care for two women at once  as soon as julia returned to england he broke ground to his mother on the subject of her making the mistress of broadwood understand that she and the girls now regarded their occupancy of that estate as absolutely over he had already several weeks before picked a little at the arid tract of that indicated surrender but in the interval the soil appeared to have formed again to a considerable thickness it was disagreeable to him to call his parents attention to the becoming course and especially disagreeable to have to emphasise it and discuss it and perhaps clamour for it he would have liked the whole business to be tacita little triumph of silent delicacy but he found reasons to suspect that what in fact would be most tacit was julias certain endurance of any chance failure of that charm lady agnes had a theory that they had virtuallypractically as she saidgiven up the place so that there was no need of making a splash about it but nick discovered in the course of an exploration of biddys view more rigorous perhaps than any to which he had ever subjected her that none of their property had been removed from the delightful housenone of the things there were ever so many things heavily planted there when their mother took possession lady agnes was the proprietor of innumerable articles of furniture relics and survivals of her former greatness and moved about the world with a train of heterogeneous baggage so that her quiet overflow into the spaciousness of broadwood had had all the luxury of a final subsidence what nick had to propose to her now was a dreadful combination a relapse into the conditions she most hatedseaside lodgings bald storehouses in the marylebone road little london rooms crammed with objects that caught the dirt and made them stuffy he was afraid he should really finish her and he himself was surprised in a degree at his insistence he wouldnt have supposed he should have cared so much but he found he did care intensely he cared enoughit says everythingto explain to his mother that her retention of broadwood would show practically since that was her great word for the violation of an agreement julia had given them the place on the understanding that he was to marry her and once he was definitely not to marry her they had no right to keep the place yes you make the mess and we pay the penalty the poor lady flashed out but this was the only overt protest she madeexcept indeed to contend that their withdrawal would be an act ungracious and offensive to julia she looked as she had looked during the months that succeeded his fathers death but she gave a general a final grim assent to the proposition that let their kinswoman take it as she would their own duty was unmistakably clear  it was grace who was principal representative of the idea that julia would be outraged by such a step she never ceased to repeat that she had never heard of anything so nasty nick would have expected this of grace but he felt rather bereft and betrayed when biddy murmured to him that she knewthat there was really no need of their sacrificing their mothers comfort to an extravagant scruple she intimated that if nick would only consent to their going on with broadwood as if nothing had happenedor rather as if everything had happenedshe would answer for the feelings of the owner for almost the first time in his life nick disliked what biddy said to him and he gave her a sharp rejoinder a taste of the general opinion that they all had enough to do to answer for themselves he remembered afterwards the way she looked at himstartled even frightened and with rising tearsbefore turning away he held that they should judge better how julia would take it after they had thrown up the place and he made it his duty to arrange that his mother should formally advise her by letter of their intending to depart at once julia could then protest to her hearts content nick was aware that for the most part he didnt pass for practical he could imagine why from his early years people should have joked him about it but this time he was determined to rest on a rigid view of things as they were he didnt sec his mothers letter but he knew that it went he felt she would have been more loyal if she had shown it to him though of course there could be but little question of loyalty now that it had really been written however very much on the lines he dictated was clear to him from the subsequent surprise which lady agness blankness didnt prevent his divining  julia acknowledged the offered news but in unexpected terms she had apparently neither resisted nor protested she had simply been very glad to get her house back again and had not accused any of them of nastiness nick saw no more of her letter than he had seen of his mothers but he was able to say to graceto their parent he was studiously mutemy poor child you see after all that we havent kicked up such a row grace shook her head and looked gloomy and deeply wise replying that he had no cause to triumphthey were so far from having seen the end of it yet thus he guessed that his mother had complied with his wish on the calculation that it would be a mere form that julia would entreat them not to be so fantastic and that he himself would then in the presence of her wounded surprise consent to a quiet continuance so much in the interestthe air of broadwood had a purityof the health of all of them but since julia jumped at their sacrifice he had no chance to be mollified he had all grossly to persist in having been right  at bottom probably he was a little surprised at julias so prompt assent literally speaking it was not perfectly graceful he was sorry his mother had been so deceived but was sorrier still for biddys mistakeit showed she might be mistaken about other things nothing was left now but for lady agnes to say as she did substantially whenever she saw him were to prepare to spend the autumn at worthing then or some other horrible place i dont know their names its the only thing we can afford there was an implication in this that if he expected her to drag her girls about to countryhouses in a continuance of the fidgety effort to work them off he must understand at once that she was now too weary and too sad and too sick she had done her best for them and it had all been vain and cruelnow therefore the poor creatures must look out for themselves to the grossness of biddys misconduct she neednt refer nor to the golden opportunity that young woman had forfeited by her odious treatment of mr grindon it was clear that this time lady agnes was incurably discouraged so much so as to fail to glean the dimmest light from the fact that the girl was really making a long stay at harsh biddy went to and fro two or three times and then in august fairly settled there and what her mother mainly saw in her absence was the desire to keep out of the way of household reminders of her depravity in fact as turned out lady agnes and grace gathered themselves together in the first days of that month for another visit to the very old lady who had been sir nicholass godmother after which they went somewhere elseso that the question of worthing had not immediately to be faced  nick stayed on in london with the obsession of work humming in his ears he was joyfully conscious that for three or four months in the empty babylon he would have ample stores of time but toward the end of august he got a letter from grace in which she spoke of her situation and of her mothers in a manner that seemed to impose on him the doing of something tactful they were paying a third visithe knew that in calcutta gardens ladysmaids had been to and fro with boxes replenishments of wardrobesand yet somehow the outlook for the autumn was dark grace didnt say it in so many words but what he read between the lines was that they had no more invitations what therefore in pitys name was to become of them people liked them well enough when biddy was with them but they didnt care for her mother and her that prospect tout pur and biddy was cooped up indefinitely with julia this was not the manner in which grace had anciently alluded to her sisters happy visits at harsh and the change of tone made nick wince with a sense of all that had collapsed biddy was a little fish worth landing in short scantly as she seemed disposed to bite and graces rude probity could admit that she herself was not  nick had an inspiration by way of doing something tactful he went down to brighton and took lodgings for several weeks in the general interest the very quietest and sunniest he could find this he intended as a kindly surprise a reminder of how he had his mothers and sisters comfort at heart how he could exert himself and save them trouble but he had no sooner concluded his bargainit was a more costly one than he had at first calculatedthan he was bewildered and befogged to learn that the persons on whose behalf he had so exerted himself were to pass the autumn at broadwood with julia that daughter of privilege had taken the place into familiar use again and was now correcting their former surprise at her crude indifferencethis was infinitely characteristic of juliaby inviting them to share it with her nick wondered vaguely what she was up to but when his mother treated herself to the line irony of addressing him an elaborately humble request for his consent to their accepting the merciful refugeshe repeated this expression three timeshe replied that she might do exactly as she liked he would only mention that he shouldnt feel himself at liberty to come and see her there this condition proved apparently to lady agness mind no hindrance and she and her daughters were presently reinstated in the very apartments they had learned so to love this time in fact it was even better than beforethey had still fewer expenses the expenses were nicks he had to pay a forfeit to the landlady at brighton for backing out of his contract he said nothing to his mother about that bungled businesshe was literally afraid but a sad event just then reminded him afresh how little it was the moment for squandering money mr carteret drew his last breath quite painlessly it seemed as the closing scene was described at beauclere when the young man went down to the funeral two or three weeks later the contents of his will were made public in the illustrated london news where it definitely appeared that he left a very large fortune not a penny of which was to go to nick the provision for mr chayters declining years was remarkably handsome     xlviii   miriam had mounted at a bound in her new part several steps in the ladder of fame and at the climax of the london season this fact was brought home to her from hour to hour it produced a thousand solicitations and entanglements and she rapidly learned that to be celebrated takes up almost as much of ones own time as of other peoples even though as she boasted she had reduced to a science the practice of working her mothershe made use of the good lady socially to the utmost pushing her perpetually into the breachthere was many a juncture at which it was clear that she couldnt too much disoblige without hurting her cause she made almost an income out of the photographerstheir appreciation of her as a subject knew no boundsand she supplied the newspapers with columns of characteristic copy to the gentlemen who sought speech of her on behalf of these organs she poured forth vindictively floods of unscrupulous romance she told them all different tales and as her mother told them others more marvellous yet publicity was cleverly caught by rival versions which surpassed each other in authenticity the whole case was remarkable was unique for if the girl was advertised by the bewilderment of her readers she seemed to every sceptic on his going to see her as fine as if he had discovered her for himself she was still accommodating enough however from time to time to find an hour to come and sit to nick dormer and he helped himself further by going to her theatre whenever he could he was conscious julia dallow would probably hear of this and triumph with a fresh sense of how right she had been but the reflexion only made him sigh resignedly so true it struck him as being that there are some things explanation can never better can never touch  miriam brought basil dashwood once to see her portrait and basil who commended it in general directed his criticism mainly to two pointsits not yet being finished and its not having gone into that years academy the young actor audibly panted he felt the short breath of miriams rapidity the quick beat of her success and looking at everything now from the standpoint of that speculation could scarcely contain his impatience at the painters clumsy slowness he thought the latters second attempt much better than his first but somehow it ought by that time to be shining in the eye of the public he put it to their friend with an air of acutenesshe had those felicitiesthat in every great crisis there is nothing like striking while the iron is hot he even betrayed the conviction that by putting on a spurt nick might wind up the job and still get the academy people to take him in basil knew some of them he all but offered to speak to themthe case was so exceptional he had no doubt he could get something done against the appropriation of the work by peter sherringham he explicitly and loudly protested in spite of the homeliest recommendations of silence from miriam and it was indeed easy to guess how such an arrangement would interfere with his own conception of the eventual right place for the two portraitsthe vestibule of the theatre where every one going in and out would see them suspended face to face and surrounded by photographs artistically disposed of the young actress in a variety of characters dashwood showed superiority in his jump to the contention that so exhibited the pictures would really help to draw considering the virtue he attributed to miriam the idea was exempt from narrow prejudice  moreover though a trifle feverish he was really genial he repeated more than once yes my dear sir youve done it this time this was a favourite formula with him when some allusion was made to the girls success he greeted it also with a comfortable this time she has done it there was ever a hint of fine judgement and far calculation in his tone it appeared before he went that this time even he himself had done ithe had taken up something that would really answer he told nick more about miriam more certainly about her outlook at that moment than she herself had communicated contributing strongly to our young mans impression that one by one every gage of a great career was being dropped into her cup nick himself tasted of success vicariously for the hour miriam let her comrade talk only to contradict him and contradicted him only to show how indifferently she could do it she treated him as if she had nothing more to learn about his folly but as if it had taken intimate friendship to reveal to her the full extent of it nick didnt mind her intimate friendships but he ended by disliking dashwood who gave on his nervesa circumstance poor julia had it come to her knowledge would doubtless have found deplorably significant miriam was more pleased with herself than ever she now made no scruple of admitting that she enjoyed all her advantages she had a fuller vision of how successful success could be she took everything as it camedined out every sunday and even went into the country till the monday morning kept a hundred distinguished names on her lips and abounded in strange tales of the people who were making up to her she struck nick as less strenuous than she had been hitherto as making even an aggressive show of inevitable laxities but he was conscious of no obligation to rebuke her for itthe less as he had a dim vision that some effect of that sort some irritation of his curiosity was what she desired to produce she would perhaps have liked for reasons best known to herself to look as if she were throwing herself away not being able to do anything else he couldnt talk to her as if he took a deep interest in her career because in fact he didnt she remained to him primarily and essentially a pictorial object with the nature of whose vicissitudes he was concernedputting common charity and his personal good nature of course asideonly so far as they had something to say in her face how could he know in advance what turn of her experience twist of her life would say mostso possible was it even that complete failure or some incalculable perversion innumerable were the queer traps that might be set for her would only make her for his particular purpose more precious  when she had left him at any rate the day she came with basil dashwood and still more on a later occasion that of his turning back to his work after putting her into her carriage and otherwise bareheadedly manifesting the last time for that year apparently that he was to see herwhen she had left him it occurred to him in the light of her quick distinction that there were deep differences in the famous artistic life miriam was already in a glow of glorywhich moreover was probably but a faint spark in relation to the blaze to come and as he closed the door on her and took up his palette to rub it with a dirty cloth the little room in which his own battle was practically to be fought looked woefully cold and grey and mean it was lonely and yet at the same time was peopled with unfriendly shadowsso thick he foresaw them gather in winter twilights to comethe duller conditions the longer patiences the less immediate and less personal joys his late beginning was there and his wasted youth the mistakes that would still bring forth children after their image the sedentary solitude the grey mediocrity the poor explanations the effect of foolishness he dreaded even from afar of in having to ask people to wait and wait longer and wait again for a fruition which to their sense at least might well prove a grotesque anticlimax he yearned enough over it however it should figure to feel that this possible pertinacity might enter into comparison even with such a productive force as miriams that was after all in his bare studio the most collective dim presence the one that kept him company best as he sat there and that made it the right place however wrongthe sense that it was to the thing in itself he was attached this was miriams case too but the sharp contrast which she showed him she also felt was in the number of other things she got with the thing in itself  i hasten to add that our young man had hours when this last mystic value struck him as requiring for its full operation no adjunct whateveras being in its own splendour a summary of all adjuncts and apologies i have related that the great collections the national gallery and the museum were sometimes rather a series of dead surfaces to him but the sketch i have attempted of him will have been inadequate if it fails to suggest that there were other days when as he strolled through them he plucked right and left perfect nosegays of reassurance bent as he was on working in the modern which spoke to him with a thousand voices he judged it better for long periods not to haunt the earlier masters whose conditions had been so differentlater he came to see that it didnt matter much especially if one kept away but he was liable to accidental deflexions from this theory liable in particular to feel the sanctity of the great portraits of the past these were the things the most inspiring in the sense that while generations while worlds had come and gone they seemed far most to prevail and survive and testify as he stood before them the perfection of their survival often struck him as the supreme eloquence the virtue that included all others thanks to the language of art the richest and most universal empires and systems and conquests had rolled over the globe and every kind of greatness had risen and passed away but the beauty of the great pictures had known nothing of death or change and the tragic centuries had only sweetened their freshness the same faces the same figures looked out at different worlds knowing so many secrets the particular world didnt and when they joined hands they made the indestructible thread on which the pearls of history were strung  miriam notified her artist that her theatre was to close on the tenth of august immediately after which she was to start with the company on a tremendous tour of the provinces they were to make a lot of money but they were to have no holiday and she didnt want one she only wanted to keep at it and make the most of her limited opportunities for practice inasmuch as at that rate playing but two parts a yearand such parts she despised themshe shouldnt have mastered the rudiments of her trade before decrepitude would compel her to lay it by the first time she came to the studio after her visit with dashwood she sprang up abruptly at the end of half an hour saying she could sit no moreshe had had enough and to spare of it she was visibly restless and preoccupied and though nick had not waited till now to note that she had more moods in her list than he had tints on his palette he had never yet seen her sensibility at this particular pitch it struck him rather as a waste of passion but he was ready to let her go she looked round the place as if suddenly tired of it and then said mechanically in a heartless london way while she smoothed down her gloves so youre just going to stay on after he had confessed that this was his dark purpose she continued in the same casual talkmaking manner i daresay its the best thing for you youre just going to grind eh  i see before me an eternity of grinding  all alone by yourself in this dull little hole you will be conscientious you will be virtuous  oh my solitude will be mitigatedi shall have models and people  what peoplewhat models miriam asked as she arranged her hat before the glass  well no one so good as you  thats a prospect the girl laughedfor all the good youve got out of me  youre no judge of that quantity said nick and even i cant measure it just yet have i been rather a bore and a brute i can easily believe it i havent talked to youi havent amused you as i might the truth is that taking peoples likenesses is a very absorbing inhuman occupation you cant do much to them besides  yes its a cruel honour to pay them  cruelthats too much he objected  i mean its one you shouldnt confer on those you like for when its over its over it kills your interest in them after youve finished them you dont like them any more at all  surely i like you nick returned sitting tilted back before his picture with his hands in his pockets  weve done very well its something not to have quarrelledand she smiled at him now seeming more in it i wouldnt have had you slight your worki wouldnt have had you do it badly but theres no fear of that for you she went on youre the real thing and the rare bird i havent lived with you this way without seeing that youre the sincere artist so much more than i no no dont protest she added with one of her sudden fine transitions to a deeper tone youll do things that will hand on your name when my screeching is happily over only you do seem to me i confess rather high and dry herei speak from the point of view of your comfort and of my personal interest in you you strike me as kind of lonely as the americans sayrather cut off and isolated in your grandeur havent you any confrèresfellowartists and people of that sort dont they come near you  i dont know them much nick humbly confessed ive always been afraid of them and how can they take me seriously  well ive got confrères and sometimes i wish i hadnt but does your sister never come near you any more she asked or is it only the fear of meeting me  he was aware of his mothers theory that biddy was constantly bundled home from rosedale road at the approach of improper persons she was as angry at this as if she wouldnt have been more so had her child suffered exposure but the explanation he gave his present visitor was nearer the truth he reminded her that he had already told herhe had been careful to do this so as not to let it appear she was avoidedthat his sister was now most of the time in the country staying with an hospitable relation  oh yes the girl rejoined to this with mr sherringhams sister mrswhats her name i always forget and when he had pronounced the word with a reluctance he doubtless failed sufficiently to concealhe hated to talk of julia by any name and didnt know what business miriam had with hershe went on thats the onethe beauty the wonderful beauty i shall never forget how handsome she looked the day she found me here i dont in the least resemble her but i should like to have a try at that type some day in a comedy of manners but who the devil will write me a comedy of manners there it is the danger would be no doubt that i should push her à la charge  nick listened to these remarks in silence saying to himself that if she should have the bad tastewhich she seemed trembling on the brink ofto make an allusion to what had passed between the lady in question and himself he should dislike her beyond remedy it would show him she was a coarse creature after all her good genius interposed however as against this hard penalty and she quickly for the moment at least whisked away from the topic demanding since they spoke of comrades and visitors what had become of gabriel nash whom she hadnt heard of for so many days  i think hes tired of me said nick he hasnt been near me either but after all its naturalhe has seen me through  seen you through do you mean she laughed seen through you why youve only just begun  precisely and at bottom he doesnt like to see me begin hes afraid i shall do something  she wonderedas with the interest of that do you mean hes jealous  not in the least for from the moment one does anything one ceases to compete with him it leaves him the field more clear but thats just the discomfort for himhe feels as you said just now kind of lonely he feels rather abandoned and even i think a little betrayed so far from being jealous he yearns for me and regrets me the only thing he really takes seriously is to speculate and understand to talk about the reasons and the essence of things the people who do that are the highest the applications the consequences the vulgar little effects belong to a lower plane for which one must doubtless be tolerant and indulgent but which is after all an affair of comparative accidents and trifles indeed hell probably tell me frankly the next time i see him that he cant but feel that to come down to small questions of actionto the small prudences and compromises and simplifications of practiceis for the superior person really a fatal descent one may be inoffensive and even commendable after it but one can scarcely pretend to be interesting il en faut comme ça but one doesnt haunt them hell do his best for me hell come back again but hell come back sad and finally hell fade away altogether hell go off to granada or somewhere  the simplifications of practice cried miriam why theyre just precisely the most blessed things on earth what should we do without them  what indeed nick echoed but if we need them its because were not superior persons were awful philistines  ill be one with you the girl smiled poor nash isnt worth talking about what was it but a small question of action when he preached to you as i know he did to give up your seat  yes he has a weakness for giving uphell go with you as far as that but im not giving up any more you see im pegging away and thats gross  hes an idiotnen parlons plus she dropped gathering up her parasol but lingering  ah i stick to him nick said he helped me at a difficult time  you ought to be ashamed to confess it  oh you are a philistine nick returned  certainly i am she declared going toward the doorif it makes me one to be sorry awfully sorry and even rather angry that i havent before me a period of the same sort of unsociable pegging away that you have for want of it i shall never really be good however if you dont tell people ive said so theyll never know your conditions are far better than mine and far more respectable you can do as many things as you like in patient obscurity while im pitchforked into the mêlée and into the most improbable fameall on the back of a solitary cheval de bataille a poor brokenwinded screw i read it clear that i shall be condemned for the greater part of the rest of my daysdo you see thatto play the stuff im acting now im studying juliet and i want awfully to do her but really im mortally afraid lest making a success of her i should find myself in such a box perhaps the brutes would want juliet for ever instead of my present part you see amid what delightful alternatives one moves what i long for most i never shall have hadfive quiet years of hard allround work in a perfect company with a manager more perfect still playing five hundred things and never being heard of at all i may be too particular but thats what i should have liked i think im disgusting with my successful crudities its discouraging it makes one not care much what happens whats the use in such an age of being good  good your haughty claim nick laughed is that youre bad  i mean good you knowthere are other ways dont be stupid and miriam tapped himhe was near her at the doorwith her parasol  i scarcely know what to say to you he logically pleaded for certainly its your fault if you get on so fast  im too cleverim a humbug  thats the way i used to be said nick  she rested her brave eyes on him then turned them over the room slowly after which she attached them again kindly musinglyrather as if he had been a fine view or an interesting objectto his face ah the pride of thatthe sense of purification he used to be forsooth poor me of course youll say look at the sort of thing ive undertaken to produce compared with the rot you have so its all right become great in the proper way and dont expose me she glanced back once more at the studio as if to leave it for ever and gave another last look at the unfinished canvas on the easel she shook her head sadly poor mr sherringhamwith that she wailed  oh ill finish itit will be very decent nick said  finish it by yourself  not necessarily youll come back and sit when you return to london  never never never again  he wondered why youve made me the most profuse offers and promises  yes but they were made in ignorance and ive backed out of them im capricious toofaites la part de ça i see it wouldnt doi didnt know it then were too far aparti am as you say a philistine and as he protested with vehemence against this unscrupulous bad faith she added youll find other models paint gabriel nash  gabriel nashas a substitute for you  it will be a good way to get rid of him paint mrs dallow too miriam went on as she passed out of the door he had opened for herpaint mrs dallow if you wish to eradicate the last possibility of a throb  it was strange that since only a moment before he had been in a state of mind to which the superfluity of this reference would have been the clearest thing about it he should now have been moved to receive it quickly naturally irreflectively receive it with the question the last possibility do you mean in her or in me  oh in you i dont know anything about her  but that wouldnt be the effect he argued with the same supervening candour i believe that if she were to sit to me the usual law would be reversed  the usual law  which you cited a while since and of which i recognised the general truth in the case you speak of he said i should probably make a shocking picture  and fall in love with her again then for gods sake risk the daub miriam laughed out as she floated away to her victoria     xlix   she had guessed happily in saying to him that to offer to paint gabriel nash would be the way to get rid of that visitant it was with no such invidious purpose indeed that our young man proposed to his intermittent friend to sit rather as august was dusty in the london streets he had too little hope that nash would remain in town at such a time to oblige him nick had no wish to get rid of his private philosopher he liked his philosophy and though of course premeditated paradox was the light to read him by he yet had frequently and incidentally an inspired unexpectedness he remained in rosedale road the man who most produced by his presence the effect of company all the other men of nicks acquaintance all his political friends represented often very communicatively their own affairs their own affairs alone which when they did it well was the most their host could ask of them but nash had the rare distinction that he seemed somehow to figure his affairs the said hosts and to show an interest in them unaffected by the ordinary social limitations of capacity this relegated him to the class of high luxuries and nick was well aware that we hold our luxuries by a fitful and precarious tenure if a friend without personal eagerness was one of the greatest of these it would be evident to the simplest mind that by the law of distribution of earthly boons such a convenience should be expected to forfeit in duration what it displayed in intensity he had never been without a suspicion that nash was too good to last though for that matter nothing had yet confirmed a vague apprehension that his particular manner of breaking up or breaking down would be by his wishing to put so fresh a recruit in relation with other disciples  that would practically amount to a catastrophe nick felt for it was odd that one could both have a great kindness for him and not in the least when it came to the point yearn for a view of his personal extensions his originality had always been that he appeared to have none and if in the first instance he had introduced his bright young political prodigy to miriam and her mother that was an exception for which peter sherringhams interference had been mainly responsible all the same however it was some time before nick ceased to view it as perhaps on the awkward books that to complete his education as it were gabriel would wish him to converse a little with spirits formed by a like tonic discipline nick had an instinct in which there was no consciousness of detriment to nash that the pupils possibly even the imitators of such a genius would be as he mentally phrased it something awful he could be sure even gabriel himself could be sure of his own reservations but how could either of them be sure of those of others imitation is a fortunate homage only in proportion as it rests on measurements and there was an indefinable something in nashs doctrine that would have been discredited by exaggeration or by zeal providence happily appeared to have spared it this ordeal so that nick had after months still to remind himself how his friend had never pressed on his attention the least little group of fellowmystics never offered to produce them for his edification it scarcely mattered now that he was just the man to whom the superficial would attribute that sort of tail it would probably have been hard for example to persuade lady agnes or julia dallow or peter sherringham that he was not most at home in some dusky untidy dimlyimagined suburb of culture a region peopled by unpleasant phrasemongers who thought him a gentleman and who had no human use but to be held up in the comic presswhich was moreover probably restrained by decorum from touching upon the worst of their aberrations  nick at any rate never ran his academy to earth nor so much as skirted the suburb in question never caught from the impenetrable background of his life the least reverberation of flitting or of flirting the fainting esthetic ululation there had been moments when he was even moved to anxiety by the silence that poor gabriels own faculty of sound made all about himwhen at least it reduced to plainer elements the mere bald terms of lonely singleness and thrift of the lean philosophic life the mystery he could never wholly dissociate from him the air as of the transient and occasional the likeness to curling vapour or murmuring wind or shifting light it was for instance a symbol of this unclassified state the lack of all position as a name in cited lists that nick in point of fact had no idea where he lived would not have known how to go and see him or send him a doctor if he had heard he was ill he had never walked with him to any door of gabriels own even to pause at the threshold though indeed nash had a club the anonymous in some improbable square of which he might be suspected of being the only memberone had never heard of anotherwhere it was vaguely understood letters would some day or other find him fortunately he pressed with no sharpness the spring of pityhis whole form was so easy a grasp of the helm of consciousness which he would never let go he would never consent to any deformity but would steer his course straight through the eventual narrow pass and simply go down over the horizon  he in any case turned up rosedale road one day after miriam had left london he had just come back from a fortnight in brittany where he had drawn refreshment from the tragic sweetness ofwell of everything he was on his way somewhere elsewas going abroad for the autumn but was not particular what he did professing that he had come back just to get nick utterly off his mind its very nice its very nice yes yes i see he remarked giving a little general assenting sigh as his eyes wandered over the simple scenea sigh which for a suspicious ear would have testified to an insidious reaction  nicks ear as we know was already suspicious a fact accounting for the expectant smileit indicated the pleasant apprehension of a theory confirmedwith which he returned do you mean my pictures are nice  yes yes your pictures and the whole thing  the whole thing  your existence in this little remote independent corner of the great city the disinterestedness of your attitude the persistence of your effort the piety the beauty in short the edification of the whole spectacle  nick laughed a little ruefully how near to having had enough of me you must be when you speak of me as edifying nash changed colour slightly at this it was the first time in his friends remembrance that he had given a sign of embarrassment vous allez me lâcher i see it coming and who can blame youfor ive ceased to be in the least spectacular i had my little hour it was a great deal for some people dont even have that ive given you your curious case and ive been generous i made the drama last for you as long as i could youll slope my dear fellowyoull quietly slope and it will be all right and inevitable though i shall miss you greatly at first who knows whether without you i shouldnt still have been representing harsh heaven help me you rescued me you converted me from a representative into an examplethats a shade better but dont i know where you must be when youre reduced to praising my piety  dont turn me away said nash plaintively give me a cigarette  i shall never dream of turning you away i shall cherish you till the latest possible hour im only trying to keep myself in tune with the logic of things the proof of how i cling is that precisely i want you to sit to me  to sit to you with which nick could fancy his visitor a little blank  certainly for after all it isnt much to ask here we are and the hours peculiarly propitiouslong light days with no one coming near me so that ive plenty of time i had a hope i should have some orders my younger sister whom you know and whos a great optimist plied me with that vision in fact we invented together a charming little sordid theory that there might be rather a run on me from the chatter such as it was produced by my taking up this line my sister struck out the idea that a good many of the pretty ladies would think me interesting and would want to be done perhaps they do but theyve controlled themselves for i cant say the run has commenced they havent even come to look but i daresay they dont yet quite take it in of course its a bad timewith every one out of town though you know they might send for me to come and do them at home perhaps they will when they settle down a portraittour of a dozen countryhouses for the autumn and winterwhat do you say to that for the ardent life i know i excruciate you nick added but dont you see how its in my interest to try how much youll still stand  gabriel puffed his cigarette with a serenity so perfect that it might have been assumed to falsify these words mrs dallow will send for youvous allez voir ça he said in a moment brushing aside all vagueness  shell send for me  to paint her portrait shell recapture you on that basis shell get you down to one of the countryhouses and it will all go off as charminglywith sketching in the morning on days you cant hunt and anything you like in the afternoon and fifteen courses in the evening therell be bishops and ambassadors stayingas if you were a wellknown awfully clever amateur take care take care for fickle as you may think me i can read the future dont imagine youve come to the end of me yet mrs dallow and your sister of both of whom i speak with the greatest respect are capable of hatching together the most conscientious delightful plan for you your differences with the beautiful lady will be patched up and youll each come round a little and meet the other halfway the beautiful lady will swallow your profession if youll swallow hers shell put up with the palette if youll put up with the countryhouse it will be a very unusual one in which you wont find a good north room where you can paint youll go about with her and do all her friends all the bishops and ambassadors and youll eat your cake and have it and every one beginning with your wife will forget theres anything queer about you and everything will be for the best in the best of worlds so that togetheryou and sheyoull become a great social institution and every one will think she has a delightful husband to say nothing of course of your having a delightful wife ah my dear fellow you turn pale and with reason nash went lucidly on thats to pay you for having tried to make me let you have it you have it then there i may be a borethe emphasis of this though a mere shade testified to the first personal resentment nick had ever heard his visitor expressi may be a bore but once in a while i strike a light i make things out then i venture to repeat take care take care if as i say i respect ces dames infinitely its because they will be acting according to the highest wisdom of their sex thats the sort of thing women do for a manthe sort of thing they invent when theyre exceptionally good and clever when theyre not they dont do so well but its not for want of trying theres only one thing in the world better than their incomparable charm its their abysmal conscience deep calleth unto deepthe ones indeed a part of the other and when they club together when they earnestly consider as in the case were supposing nash continued then the whole thing takes a lift for its no longer the virtue of the individual its that of the wondrous sex  youre so remarkable that more than ever i must paint you nick returned though im so agitated by your prophetic words that my hand trembles and i shall doubtless scarcely be able to hold my brush look how i rattle my easel trying to put it into position i see it all there just as you show it yes it will be a droll day and more modern than anything yet when the conscience of women makes out good reasons for mens not being in love with them you talk of their goodness and cleverness and its certainly much to the point i dont know what else they themselves might do with those graces but i dont see what man can do with them but be fond of them where he finds them  oh youll do ityoull do it cried nash brightly jubilant  what is it i shall do  exactly what i just said if not next year then the year after or the year after that youll go halfway to meet her and shell drag you about and pass you off youll paint the bishops and become a social institution that is youll do it if you dont take great care  i shall no doubt and thats why i cling to you you must still look after me nick went on dont melt away into a mere improbable reminiscence a delightful symbolic fabledont if you can possibly help it the trouble is you see that you cant really keep hold very tight because at bottom it will amuse you much more to see me in another pickle than to find me simply jogging down the vista of the years on the straight course let me at any rate have some sort of sketch of you as a kind of feather from the angels wing or a photograph of the ghostto prove to me in the future that you were once a solid sociable fact that i didnt invent you didnt launch you as a deadly hoax of course i shall be able to say to myself that you cant have been a fableotherwise youd have a moral but that wont be enough because im not sure you wont have had one some day youll peep in here languidly and find me in such an attitude of pietypresenting my bent back to you as i niggle over some interminable botchthat i shall give cruelly on your nerves and youll just draw away closing the door softly youll be gentle and considerate about it and spare me you wont even make me look round youll steal off on tiptoe never never to return  gabriel consented to sit he professed he should enjoy it and be glad to give up for it his immediate foreign commerce so vague to nick so definite apparently to himself and he came back three times for the purpose nick promised himself a deal of interest from this experiment for with the first hour of it he began to feel that really as yet given the conditions under which he now studied him he had never at all thoroughly explored his friend his impression had been that nash had a head quite fine enough to be a challenge and that as he sat there day by day all sorts of pleasant and paintable things would come out in his face this impression was not gainsaid but the whole tangle grew denser it struck our young man that he had never seen his subject before and yet somehow this revelation was not produced by the sense of actually seeing it what was revealed was the difficultywhat he saw was not the measurable mask but the ambiguous meaning he had taken things for granted which literally were not there and he found things thereexcept that he couldnt catch themwhich he had not hitherto counted in or presumed to handle this baffling effect eminently in the line of the mystifying so familiar to nash might have been the result of his whimsical volition had it not appeared to our artist after a few hours of the job that his sitter was not the one who enjoyed it most he was uncomfortable at first vaguely and then definitely sosilent restless gloomy dim as if on the test the homage of a directer attention than he had ever had gave him less pleasure than he would have supposed he had been willing to judge of this in good faith but frankly he rather suffered he wasnt cross but was clearly unhappy and nick had never before felt him contract instead of expanding  it was all accordingly as if a trap had been laid for him and our young man asked himself if it were really fair at the same time there was something richly rare in such a relation between the subject and the artist and nick was disposed to go on till he should have to stop for pity or for shame he caught eventually a glimmer of the truth underlying the strangeness guessed that what upset his friend was simply the reversal in such a combination of his usual terms of intercourse he was so accustomed to living upon irony and the interpretation of things that it was new to him to be himself interpreted andas a gentleman who sits for his portrait is always liable to beinterpreted all ironically from being outside of the universe he was suddenly brought into it and from the position of a free commentator and critic an easy amateurish editor of the whole affair reduced to that of humble ingredient and contributor it occurred afterwards to nick that he had perhaps brought on a catastrophe by having happened to throw off as they gossiped or languished and not alone without a cruel intention but with an impulse of genuine solicitude but my dear fellow what will you do when youre old  old what do you call old nash had replied bravely enough but with another perceptible tinge of irritation must i really remind you at this time of day that that term has no application to such a condition as mine it only belongs to you wretched people who have the incurable superstition of doing its the ignoble collapse you prepare for yourselves when you cease to be able to do for me therell be no collapse no transition no clumsy readjustment of attitude for i shall only be more and more with all the accumulations of experience the longer i live  oh im not particular about the term said nick if you dont call it old the ultimate state call it wearycall it final the accumulations of experience are practically accumulations of fatigue  i dont know anything about weariness i live freshlyit doesnt fatigue me  then you need never die nick declared  certainly i daresay im indestructible immortal  nick laughed out at thisit would be such fine news to some people but it was uttered with perfect gravity and it might very well have been in the spirit of that gravity that nash failed to observe his agreement to sit again the next day the next and the next and the next passed but he never came back  true enough punctuality was not important for a man who felt that he had the command of all time nevertheless his disappearance without a trace that of a personage in a fairytale or a melodrama made a considerable impression on his friend as the months went on so that though he had never before had the least difficulty about entering into the play of gabriels humour nick now recalled with a certain fanciful awe the special accent with which he had ranked himself among imperishable things he wondered a little if he hadnt at last balancing always on the stretched tightrope of his wit fallen over on the wrong side he had never before of a truth been so nearly witless and would have to have gone mad in short to become so singularly simple perhaps indeed he was acting only more than usual in his customary spiritthoughtfully contributing for nicks enlivenment a purple rim of mystery to an horizon now so dreadfully let down the mystery at any rate remained another shade of purple in fact was virtually added to it nick had the prospect for the future of waiting to see all curiously when nash would turn up if ever and the further diversionit almost consoled him for the annoyance of being left with a second unfinished thing on his handsof imagining in the portrait he had begun an odd tendency to fade gradually from the canvas he couldnt catch it in the act but he could have ever a suspicion on glancing at it that the hand of time was rubbing it away little by littlefor all the world as in some delicate hawthorne taleand making the surface indistinct and bare of all resemblance to the model of course the moral of the hawthorne tale would be that his personage would come back in quaint confidence on the day his last projected shadow should have vanished     l   one day toward the end of march of the following year in other words more than six months after mr nashs disappearance bridget dormer came into her brothers studio and greeted him with the effusion that accompanies a return from an absence she had been staying at broadwoodshe had been staying at harsh she had various things to tell him about these episodes about his mother about grace about her small subterraneous self and about percys having come just before over to broadwood for two days the longest visit with which almost since they could remember the head of the family had honoured their common parent nick noted indeed that this demonstration had apparently been taken as a great favour and biddy loyally testified to the fact that her elder brother was awfully jolly and that his presence had been a pretext for tremendous fun nick accordingly asked her what had passed about his marriagewhat their mother had said to him  oh nothing she replied and percy had said nothing to lady agnes and not a word to herself this partly explained for his junior the consequent beatitudenone but cheerful topics had been produced but he questioned the girl furtherto a point which led her to say oh i daresay that before long shell write to her  wholl write to whom  mammall write to percys wife im sure hed like it of course we shall end by going to see her he was awfully disappointed at what he found in spainhe didnt find anything  biddy spoke of his disappointment almost with commiseration for she was evidently inclined this morning to a fresh and kindly view of things nick could share her feeling but so far as was permitted by a recognition merely general of what his brother must have looked for it might have been snipe and it might have been bristling boars biddy was indeed brief at first about everything in spite of all the weeks that had gone since their last meeting for he quickly enough saw she had something behindsomething that made her gay and that she wanted to come to quickly he was vaguely vexed at her being fresh from broadwood so gay as that forit was impossible to shut ones eyes to the factwhat had practically come to pass in regard to that rural retreat was exactly what he had desired to avert all winter while it had been taken for granted his mother and sisters were doing what he wished they had been doing precisely what he hated he held biddy perhaps least responsible and there was no one he could exclusively blame he washed his hands of the matter and succeeded fairly well for the most part in forgetting he was not pleased julia herself in truth appeared to have been the most active member of the little group united to make light of his decencies there had been a formal restitution of broadwood but the three ladies were there more than ever with the slight difference that they were mainly there with its mistress mahomet had declined to go any more to the mountain so the mountain had virtually come to mahomet  after their long visit in the autumn lady agnes and her girls had come back to town but they had gone down again for christmas and julia had taken this occasion to write to nick that she hoped very much he wouldnt refuse them all his own company for just a little scrap of the supremely sociable time nick after reflexion judged it best not to refuse so that he passed in the event four days under his cousins roof the all proved a great many people for she had taken care to fill the house she took the largest view of hospitality and nick had never seen her so splendid so freehanded so gracefully active she was a perfect mistress of the revels she had arranged some ancient bravery for every day and for every night the dormers were so much in it as the phrase was that after all their discomfiture their fortune seemed in an hour to have come back there had been a moment when in extemporised charades lady agnes an elderly figure being required appeared on the point of undertaking the part of the housekeeper at a castle who dropping her hs showed sheeplike tourists about but she waived the opportunity in favour of her daughter grace even grace had a great success grace dropped her hs as with the crash of empires nick of course was in the charades and in everything but julia was not she only invented directed led the applause when nothing else was forward nick sketched the whole company they followed him about they waylaid him on staircases clamouring to be allowed to sit he obliged them so far as he could all save julia who didnt clamour and growing rather red he thought of gabriel nash while he bent over the paper early in the new year he went abroad for six weeks but only as far as paris it was a new paris for him then a paris of the rue bonaparte and three or four professional friendshe had more of these there than in london a paris of studios and studies and models of researches and revelations comparisons and contrasts of strong impressions and long discussions and rather uncomfortable economies small cafés bad fires and the general sense of being twenty again  while he was away his mother and sisterslady agnes now sometimes wrote to himreturned to london for a month and before he was again established in rosedale road they went back for a third course of broadwood after they had been there five daysand this was the salt of the whole feastjulia took herself off to harsh leaving them in undisturbed possession they had remained sothey wouldnt come up to town till after easter the trick was played and biddy as i have mentioned was now very content her brother presently learned however that the reason of this was not wholly the success of the trick unless indeed her further ground were only a continuation of it she was not in london as a forerunner of her mother she was not even as yet in calcutta gardens she had come to spend a week with florry tressilian who had lately taken the dearest little flat in a charming new place just put up on the other side of the park with all kinds of lifts and tubes and electricities florry had been awfully nice to herhad been with them ever so long at broadwood while the flat was being painted and preparedand mamma had then let her let biddy promise to come to her when everything was ready so that they might have a happy old maids for they were old maids now housewarming together if florry could by this time do without a chaperonshe had two latchkeys and went alone on the top of omnibuses and her name was in the red bookshe was enough of a duenna for another girl biddy referred with sweet cynical eyes to the fine happy stride she had thus taken in the direction of enlightened spinsterhood and nick hung his head immensely abashed and humiliated for modern as he had fatuously supposed himself there were evidently currents more modern yet  it so happened that on this particular morning he had drawn out of a corner his interrupted study of gabriel nash on no further curiosityhe had only been looking round the room in a rummaging spiritthan to see how much or how little of it remained it had become to his view so dim an adumbrationhe was sure of this and it pressed some spring of melancholy mirththat it didnt seem worth putting away and he left it leaning against a table as if it had been a blank canvas or a preparation to be painted over in this posture it attracted biddys attention for on a second glance it showed distinguishable features she had not seen it before and now asked whom it might represent remarking also that she could almost guess yet not quite she had known the original but couldnt name him  six months ago for a few days it represented gabriel nash nick replied but it isnt anybody or anything now  six months ago whats the matter with it and why dont you go on  whats the matter with it is more than i can tell you but i cant go on because ive lost my model  she had an almost hopeful stare is he beautifully dead  her brother laughed out at the candid cheerfulness hopefulness almost with which this inquiry broke from her hes only dead to me he has gone away  where has he gone  i havent the least idea  why have you quarrelledbiddy shone again  quarrelled for what do you take us docs the nightingale quarrel with the moon  i neednt ask which of you is the moon she said  of course im the nightingale but more literally nick continued nash has melted back into the elementshes part of the great air of the world and then as even with this lucidity he saw the girl still mystified ive a notion he has gone to india and at the present moment is reclining on a bank of flowers in the vale of cashmere  biddy had a pause after which she dropped julia will be gladshe dislikes him so  if she dislikes him why should she be glad hes so enviably placed  i mean about his going away shell be glad of that  my poor incorrigible child nick cried what has julia to do with it  she has more to do with things than you think biddy returned with all her bravery yet she had no sooner uttered the words than she perceptibly blushed hereupon to attenuate the foolishness of her blushonly it had the opposite effectshe added she thinks he has been a bad element in your life  nick emitted a long strange sound she thinks perhaps but she doesnt think enough otherwise shed arrive at this better thoughtthat she knows nothing whatever about my life  ah brother the girl pleaded with solemn eyes you dont imagine what an interest she takes in it she has told me many timesshe has talked lots to me about it biddy paused and then went on an anxious little smile shining through her gravity as if from a cautious wonder as to how much he would take she has a conviction it was mr nash who made trouble between you  best of little sisters nick pronounced those are thoroughly secondrate ideas the result of a perfectly superficial view excuse my possibly priggish tone but they really attribute to my dear detached friend a part hes quite incapable of playing he can neither make trouble nor take trouble no trouble could ever either have come out of him or have got into him moreover our young man continued if julia has talked to you so much about the matter theres no harm in my talking to you a little when she threw me over in an hour it was on a perfectly definite occasion that occasion was the presence in my studio of a dishevelled an abandoned actress  oh nick she has not thrown you over biddy protested she has notive proof  he felt at this direct denial a certain stir of indignation and looked at the girl with momentary sternness has she sent you here to tell me this what do you mean by proof  biddys eyes at these questions met her brothers with a strange expression and for a few seconds while she looked entreatingly into them she wavered there with parted lips and vaguely stretched out her hands the next minute she had burst into tearsshe was sobbing on his breast he said hallo and soothed her but it was very quickly over then she told him what she meant by her proof and what she had had on her mind ever since her present arrival it was a message from julia but not to saynot to say what he had questioned her about just before though indeed more familiar now that he had his arm round her she boldly expressed the hope it might in the end come to the same thing julia simply wanted to know she had instructed her to sound him discreetlyif nick would undertake her portrait and she wound up this experiment in sounding by the statement that their beautiful kinswoman was dying to sit  dying to sit echoed nick whose turn it was this time to feel his colour rise  at any moment you like after easter when she comes up she wants a fulllength and your very best your most splendid work  nick stared not caring that he had blushed is she serious  ah nickserious biddy reasoned tenderly she came nearer again and he thought her again about to weep he took her by the shoulders looking into her eyes  its all right if she knows i am but why doesnt she come like any one else i dont refuse people  nick dearest nick she went on her eyes conscious and pleading he looked into them intentlyas well as she could he play at soundingand for a moment between these young persons the air was lighted by the glimmer of mutual searchings and suppressed confessions nick read deep and then suddenly releasing his sister turned away she didnt see his face in that movement but an observer to whom it had been presented might have fancied it denoted a foreboding that was not exactly a dread yet was not exclusively a joy  the first thing he made out in the room when he could distinguish was gabriel nashs portrait which suddenly filled him with an unreasoning rancour he seized it and turned it about jammed it back into its corner with its face against the wall this small diversion might have served to carry off the embarrassment with which he had finally averted himself from biddy the embarrassment however was all his own none of it was reflected in the way she resumed after a silence in which she had followed his disposal of the picture  if shes so eager to come herefor its here she wants to sit not in great stanhope street neverhow can she prove better that she doesnt care a bit if she meets miss rooth  she wont meet miss rooth nick replied rather dryly  oh im sorry said biddy she was as frank as if she had achieved a virtual victory and seemed to regret the loss of a chance for julia to show an equal mildness her tone made her brother laugh but she went on with confidence she thought it was mr nash who made miss rooth come  so he did by the way said nick  well then wasnt that making trouble  i thought you admitted there was no harm in her being here  yes but he hoped thered be  poor nashs hopes nick laughed my dear child it would take a cleverer head than you or me or even julia who must have invented that wise theory to say what they were however let us agree that even if they were perfectly fiendish my good sense has been a match for them  oh nick thats delightful chanted biddy then she added do you mean she doesnt come any more  the dishevelled actress she hasnt been near me for months  but shes in londonshes always acting ive been away so much ive scarcely observed biddy explained with a slight change of note  the same silly part poor creature for nearly a year it appears that thats successin her profession i saw her in the character several times last summer but havent set foot in her theatre since  biddy took this in then she suggested peter wouldnt have liked that  oh peters likes nick at his easel beginning to work conveniently sighed  i mean her acting the same part for a year  im sure i dont know he has never written me a word  nor me either biddy returned  there was another short silence during which nick brushed at a panel it ended in his presently saying theres one thing certainly peter would likethat is simply to be here tonight its a great nightanother great nightfor the abandoned one shes to act juliet for the first time  ah how i should like to see her the girl cried  nick glanced at her she sat watching him she has sent me a stall i wish she had sent me two i should have been delighted to take you  dont you think you could get another biddy quavered  they must be in tremendous demand but who knows after all nick added at the same moment looking round heres a chanceheres quite an extraordinary chance  his servant had opened the door and was ushering in a lady whose identity was indeed justly reflected in those words miss rooth the man announced but he was caught up by a gentleman who came next and who exclaimed laughing and with a gesture gracefully corrective no nono longer miss rooth  miriam entered the place with her charming familiar grandeurentered very much as she might have appeared as she appeared every night early in her first act at the back of the stage by the immemorial middle door she might exactly now have been presenting herself to the house taking easy possession repeating old movements looking from one to the other of the actors before the footlights the rich goodmorning she threw into the air holding out her right hand to biddy and then giving her left to nickas she might have given it to her own brotherhad nothing to tell of intervals or alienations she struck biddy as still more terrible in her splendid practice than when she had seen her beforethe practice and the splendour had now something almost royal the girl had had occasion to make her curtsey to majesties and highnesses but the flutter those effigies produced was nothing to the way in which at the approach of this young lady the agitated air seemed to recognise something supreme so the deep mild eyes she bent on biddy were not soothing though for that matter evidently intended to soothe biddy wondered nick could have got so used to herhe joked at her as she loomedand later in the day still under the great impression of this incident she even wondered that peter could have full an impunity it was true that peter apparently didnt quite feel one  you never cameyou never came miriam said to her kindly and sadly and biddy recognising the allusion the invitation to visit the actress at home had to explain how much she had been absent from london and then even that her brother hadnt proposed to take her  very truehe hasnt come himself whats he doing now asked miss rooth standing near her young friend but looking at nick who had immediately engaged in conversation with his other visitor a gentleman whose face came back to the girl she had seen this gentleman on the stage with the great performerthat was it the night peter took her to the theatre with florry tressilian oh that nick would only do something of that sort now this desire quickened by the presence of the strange expressive woman by the way she scattered sweet syllables as if she were touching the pianokeys combined with other things to make our young ladys head swimother things too mingled to name admiration and fear and dim divination and purposeless pride and curiosity and resistance the impulse to go away and the determination to as she would have liked fondly to fancy it hold her ground the actress courted her with a wondrous voicewhat was the matter with the actress and what did she wantand biddy tried in return to give an idea of what nick was doing not succeeding very well she was about to appeal to her brother but miriam stopped her with the remark that it didnt signify besides dashwood was telling nick somethingsomething they wanted him to know were in a great excitementhe has taken a theatre miriam added  taken a theatre biddy was vague  were going to set up for ourselves hes going to do for me altogether it has all been arranged only within a day or two it remains to be seen how it will answer miriam smiled biddy murmured some friendly hope and the shining presence went on do you know why ive broken in here today after a long absenceinterrupting your poor brother so basely taking up his precious time its because im so nervous  about your first night biddy risked  do you know about thatare you coming miriam had caught at it  no im not comingi havent a place  will you come if i send you one  oh but really its too beautiful of you breathed the girl  you shall have a box your brother shall bring you they cant squeeze in a pin im told but ive kept a box ill manage it only if i do you know mind you positively come she sounded it as the highest of favours resting her hand on biddys  dont be afraid and may i bring a friendthe friend with whom im staying  miriam now just gloomed do you mean mrs dallow  no nomiss tressilian she puts me up she has got a flat did you ever see a flat asked biddy expansively my cousins not in london miriam replied that she might bring whom she liked and biddy broke out to her brother fancy what kindness nick were to have a box tonight and youre to take me  nick turned to her a face of levity which struck her even at the time as too cynically free but which she understood when the finer sense of it subsequently recurred to her mr dashwood interposed with the remark that it was all very well to talk about boxes but that he didnt see how at that time of day the miracle was to be worked  you havent kept one as i told you miriam demanded  as you told me my dear tell the lamb to keep its tenderest mutton from the wolves  you shall have one well arrange it miriam went on to biddy  let me qualify that statement a little miss dormer said basil dashwood well arrange it if its humanly possible  well arrange it even if its inhumanly impossiblethats just the point miriam declared to the girl dont talk about troublewhats he meant for but to take it cela sannonce bien you see she continued to nick doesnt it look as if we should pull beautifully together and as he answered that he heartily congratulated herhe was immensely interested in what he had been toldshe exclaimed after resting her eyes on him a moment what will you have it seemed simpler it was clear there had to be some one she explained further to nick what had led her to come in at that moment while dashwood approached biddy with a civil assurance that they would see they would leave no stone unturned though he would not have taken upon himself to promise  miriam reminded nick of the blessing he had been to her nearly a year before on her other first night when she was all impatient and on edge how he had let her come and sit there for hourshelped her to possess her soul till the evening and to keep out of harms way the case was the same at present with the aggravation indeed that he would understanddashwoods nerves as well as her own dashwoods were a great deal worse than hers everything was ready for juliet they had been rehearsing for five monthsit had kept her from going mad from the treadmill of the other pieceand he nick had occurred to her again in the last intolerable hours as the friend in need the salutary stopgap no matter how much she worried him she shouldnt be turned out biddy broke away from basil dashwood she must go she must hurry off to miss tressilian with her news florry might make some other stupid engagement for the evening she must be warned in time the girl took a flushed excited leave after having received a renewal of miriams pledge and even heard her say to nick that he must now give back the seat already sent himthey should be sure to have another use for it     li   that night at the theatre and in the boxthe miracle had been wrought the treasure foundnick dormer pointed out to his two companions the stall he had relinquished which was close in front noting how oddly it remained during the whole of the first act vacant the house was beyond everything the actress beyond any one though to describe again so famous an occasionit has been described repeatedly by other reportersis not in the compass of the closing words of a history already too sustained it is enough to say that these great hours marked an era in contemporary art and that for those who had a spectators share in them the words revelation incarnation acclamation demonstration ovationto name only a few and all accompanied by the word extraordinaryacquired a new force miriams juliet was an exquisite image of young passion and young despair expressed in the truest divinest music that had ever poured from tragic lips the great childish audience gaping at her points expanded there before her like a lap to catch flowers  during the first interval our three friends in the box had plenty to talk about and they were so occupied with it that for some time they failed to observe a gentleman who had at last come into the empty stall near the front this discovery was presently formulated by miss tressilian in the cheerful exclamation only fancytheres mr sherringham this of course immediately became a high wondera wonder for nick and biddy who had not heard of his return and the prodigy was quickened by the fact that he gave no sign of looking for them or even at them having taken possession of his place he sat very still in it staring straight before him at the curtain his abrupt reappearance held the seeds of anxiety both for biddy and for nick so that it was mainly miss tressilian who had freedom of mind to throw off the theory that he had come back that very hourhad arrived from a long journey couldnt they see how strange he was and how brown how burnt and how red how tired and how worn they all inspected him though biddy declined miss tressilians glass but he was evidently indifferent to notice and finally biddy leaning back in her chair dropped the fantastic words  he has come home to marry juliet  nick glanced at her and then replied what a disasterto make such a journey as that and to be late for the fair  late for the fair  why shes marriedthese three days they did it very quietly miriam says because her mother hated it and hopes it wont be much known all the same shes basil dashwoods wedded wifehe has come in just in time to take the receipts for juliet its a good thing no doubt for there are at least two fortunes to be made out of her and hell give up the stage nick explained to miss tressilian who had inquired that the gentleman in question was the actor who was playing mercutio and he asked biddy if she hadnt known that this was what they were telling him in rosedale road that morning she replied that she had understood nothing but that she was to be where she was and she sank considerably behind the drapery of the box from this cover she was able to launch creditably enough the exclamation  poor poor peter  nick got up and stood looking at poor poor peter he ought to come round and speak to us but if he doesnt see us i suppose he doesnt he quitted the box as to go to the restored exile and i may add that as soon as he had done so florence tressilian bounded over to the dusk in which biddy had nestled what passed immediately between these young ladies neednt concern us it is sufficient to mention that two minutes later miss tressilian broke out  look at him dearest hes turning his head this way  thank you i dont care to watch his turns said biddy and she doubtless demeaned herself in the high spirit of these words it nevertheless happened that directly afterwards she had certain knowledge of his having glanced at his watch as if to judge how soon the curtain would rise again as well as of his having then jumped up and passed quickly out of his place the curtain had risen again without his reappearing and without nicks returning indeed by the time nick slipped in a good deal of the third act was over and even then even when the curtain descended peter had not come back nick sat down in silence to watch the stage to which the breathless attention of his companions seemed attached though biddy after a moment threw round at him a single quick look at the end of the act they were all occupied with the recalls the applause and the responsive loveliness of juliet as she was led outmercutio had to give her up to romeoand even for a few minutes after the deafening roar had subsided nothing was said among the three at last nick began  its quite true he has just arrived hes in great stanhope street theyve given him several weeks to make up for the uncomfortable way they bundled him offto get there in time for some special business that had suddenly to be gone intowhen he first went out he tells me they even then promised that he got into southampton only a few hours ago rushed up by the first train he could catch and came off here without any dinner  fancy said miss tressilian while biddy more generally asked if peter might be in good health and appeared to have been happy nick replied that he described his post as beastly but didnt seem to have suffered from it he was to be in england probably a month he was awfully brown he sent his love to biddy miss tressilian looked at his empty stall and was of the opinion that it would be more to the point if he were to come in to see her  oh hell turn up we had a goodish talk in the lobby where he met me i think he went out somewhere  how odd to come so many thousand miles for this and then not to stay biddy fluted  did he come on purpose for this miss tressilian asked  perhaps hes gone out to get his dinner joked biddy  her friend suggested that he might be behind the scenes but nick cast doubts whereupon biddy asked if he himself were not going round at this moment the curtain rose nick said he would go in the next interval as soon as it came he quitted the box remaining absent while it lasted  all this time in the house there was no sign of peter nick reappeared only as the fourth act was beginning and uttered no word to his companions till it was over then after a further delay produced by renewed vociferous proofs of the personal victory won he depicted his visit to the stage and the wonderful sight of miriam on the field of battle miss tressilian inquired if he had found mr sherringham with her to which he replied that save across the footlights she had not been in touch with him at this a soft exclamation broke from biddy poor peter where is he then  nick seemed to falter hes walking the streets  walking the streets  i dont knowi give it up our young man replied and his tone for some minutes reduced his companions to silence but a little later biddy said  was it for him this morning she wanted that placewhen she asked you to give yours back  for him exactly its very odd she had just managed to keep itfor all the good use he makes of it she told me just now that she heard from him at his post a short time ago to the effect that he had seen in a newspaper a statement she was going to do juliet and that he firmly intended though the ways and means were not clear to himhis leave of absence hadnt yet come out and he couldnt be sure when it would cometo be present on her first night whereby she must do him the service to provide him a place she thought this a speech rather in the air so that in the midst of all her cares she took no particular pains about the matter she had an idea she had really done with him for a long time but this afternoon what does he do but telegraph to her from southampton that he keeps his appointment and counts on her for a stall unless she had got back mine she wouldnt have been able to help him when she was in rosedale road this morning she hadnt received his telegram but his promise his threat whatever it was came back to her she had a vague foreboding and thought that on the chance she had better hold something ready when she got home she found his telegram and she told me he was the first person she saw in the house through her fright when she came on in the second act it appears she was terrified this time and it lasted half through the play  she must be rather annoyed at his having gone away miss tressilian observed  annoyed im not so sure laughed nick  ah here he comes back cried biddy behind her fan while the absentee edged into his seat in time for the fifth act he stood there a moment first looking round the theatre then he turned his eyes to the box occupied by his relatives smiling and waving his hand  after that hell surely come and see you said miss tressilian  we shall see him as we go out biddy returned he must lose no more time  nick looked at him with a glass then exclaiming well im glad he has pulled himself together  why whats the matter with himif he wasnt disappointed of his seat miss tressilian demanded  the matter with him is that a couple of hours ago he had a great shock  a great shock  i may as well mention it at last nick went on i had to say something to him in the lobby there when we metsomething i was pretty sure he couldnt like i let him have it full in the faceit seemed to me better and wiser i let him know that juliets married  didnt he know it asked biddy who with her face raised had listened in deep stillness to every word that fell from her brother  how should he have known it it has only just taken place and theyve been so clever for reasons of their ownthose people move among a lot of considerations that are absolutely foreign to usabout keeping it out of the papers they put in a lot of lies and they leave out the real things  you dont mean to say mr sherringham wanted to marry her miss tressilian gasped  dont ask me what he wantedi daresay we shall never know one things very certainthat he didnt like my news dear old peter and that i shant soon forget the look in his face as he turned away from me and slipped out into the street he was too much upsethe couldnt trust himself to come back he had to walk abouthe tried to walk it off  let us hope then he has walked it off  ah poor fellowhe couldnt hold out to the end he has had to come back and look at her once more he knows shell be sublime in these last scenes  is he so much in love with her as that what difference does it make for an actress if she is mar but in this rash inquiry miss tressilian suddenly checked herself  we shall probably never know how much he has been in love with her nor what difference it makes we shall never know exactly what he came back for nor why he couldnt stand it out there any longer without relief nor why he scrambled down here all but straight from the station nor why after all for the last two hours he has been roaming the streets and it doesnt matter for its none of our business but im sorry for himshe is going to be sublime nick added the curtain was rising on the tragic climax of the play  miriam rooth was sublime yet it may be confided to the reader that during these supreme scenes bridget dormer directed her eyes less to the inspired actress than to a figure in the stalls who sat with his own gaze fastened to the stage it may further be intimated that peter sherringham though he saw but a fragment of the performance read clear at the last in the intense light of genius with which this fragment was charged that even so after all he had been rewarded for his formidable journey the great trouble of his infatuation subsided leaving behind it something appreciably deep and pure this pacification was far from taking place at once but it was helped on unexpectedly to himit began to work at leastthe very next night he saw the play through the whole of which he then sat he felt somehow recalled to the real by the very felicity of this experience the supreme exhibition itself he began to come back as from a faroff province of his history where miserable madness had reigned he had been baffled he had got his answer it must last himthat was plain he didnt fully accept it the first week or the second but he accepted it sooner than he could have supposed had he known what it was to be when he paced at night under the southern stars the deck of the ship bearing him to england  it had been as we know miss tressilians view and even biddys that evening that peter sherringham would join them as they left the theatre this view however was not confirmed by the event for our troubled gentleman vanished utterlydisappointingly crude behaviour on the part of a young diplomatist who had distinguished himselfbefore any one could put a hand on him and he failed to make up for his crudity by coming to see any one the next day or even the next indeed many days elapsed and very little would have been known about him had it not been that in the country mrs dallow knew what mrs dallow knew was eventually known to biddy dormer and in this way it could be established in his favour that he had remained some extraordinarily small number of days in london had almost directly gone over to paris to see his old chief he came back from parisbiddy learnt this not from julia but in a much more immediate way she knew it by his pressing the little electric button at the door of florence tressilians flat one day when the good florence was out and she herself was at home he made on this occasion a very long visit the good florence knew it not much later you may be sureand how he had got their address from nickand she took an extravagant pleasure in it mr sherringham had never been to see herthe like of herin his life therefore it was clear what had made him begin when he had once begun he kept it up and miss tressilians pleasure grew  good as she was she could remember without the slightest relenting what nick dormer had repeated to them at the theatre about the dreary side of peters present post however she was not bound to make a stand at this if persons more nearly concerned lady agnes and the girl herself didnt mind it how little they minded it and grace and julia dallow and even nick was proved in the course of a meeting that took place at harsh during the easter holidays the mistress of that seat had a small and intimate party to celebrate her brothers betrothal the two ladies came over from broadwood even nick for two days went back to his old huntingground and miss tressilian relinquished for as long a time the delights of her newly arranged flat peter sherringham obtained an extension of leave so that he might go back to his legation with a wife fortunately as it turned out biddys ordeal in the more or less torrid zone was not cruelly prolonged for the pair have already received a superior appointment it is lady agness proud opinion that her daughter is even now shaping their destiny i say even now for these facts bring me very close to contemporary history during those two days at harsh nick arranged with the former mistress of his fate the conditions as they might be called under which she should sit to him and every one will remember in how recent an exhibition general attention was attracted as the newspapers said in describing the private view to the noble portrait of a lady which was the final outcome of that arrangement gabriel nash had been at many a private view but he was not at that one  these matters are highly recent however as i say so that in glancing about the little circle of the interests i have tried to evoke i am suddenly warned by a sharp sense of modernness this renders it difficult to me for instance in taking leave of our wonderful miriam to do much more than allude to the general impression that her remarkable career is even yet only in its early prime basil dashwood has got his theatre and his wifepeople know now she is his wifehas added three or four new parts to her repertory but every one is agreed that both in public and in private she has a great deal more to show this is equally true of nick dormer in regard to whom i may finally say that his friend nashs predictions about his reunion with mrs dallow have not up to this time been justified on the other hand i must not omit to add this lady has not at the latest accounts married mr macgeorge it is very true there has been a rumour that mr macgeorge is worried about herhas even ceased at all fondly to believe in her
