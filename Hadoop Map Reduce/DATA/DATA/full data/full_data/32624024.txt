32624024	the philosophers joke  by jerome k jerome  author of paul kelver three men in a boat etc etc  new york  dodd mead  company  1909   copyright 1904 by jerome k jerome  copyright 1908 by dodd mead  company  published september 1908    myself i do not believe this story six persons are persuaded of its truth and the hope of these six is to convince themselves it was an hallucination their difficulty is there are six of them each one alone perceives clearly that it never could have been unfortunately they are close friends and cannot get away from one another and when they meet and look into each others eyes the thing takes shape again  the one who told it to me and who immediately wished he had not was armitage he told it to me one night when he and i were the only occupants of the club smokingroom his telling meas he explained afterwardswas an impulse of the moment sense of the thing had been pressing upon him all that day with unusual persistence and the idea had occurred to him on my entering the room that the flippant scepticism with which an essentially commonplace mind like my ownhe used the words in no offensive sensewould be sure to regard the affair might help to direct his own attention to its more absurd aspect i am inclined to think it did he thanked me for dismissing his entire narrative as the delusion of a disordered brain and begged me not to mention the matter to another living soul i promised and i may as well here observe that i do not call this mentioning the matter armitage is not the mans real name it does not even begin with an a you might read this story and dine next to him the same evening you would know nothing  also of course i did not consider myself debarred from speaking about it discreetly to mrs armitage a charming woman she burst into tears at the first mention of the thing it took me all i knew to tranquillize her she said that when she did not think about the thing she could be happy she and armitage never spoke of it to one another and left to themselves her opinion was that eventually they might put remembrance behind them she wished they were not quite so friendly with the everetts mr and mrs everett had both dreamt precisely the same dream that is assuming it was a dream mr everett was not the sort of person that a clergyman ought perhaps to know but as armitage would always argue for a teacher of christianity to withdraw his friendship from a man because that man was somewhat of a sinner would be inconsistent rather should he remain his friend and seek to influence him they dined with the everetts regularly on tuesdays and sitting opposite the everetts it seemed impossible to accept as a fact that all four of them at the same time and in the same manner had fallen victims to the same illusion i think i succeeded in leaving her more hopeful she acknowledged that the story looked at from the point of common sense did sound ridiculous and threatened me that if i ever breathed a word of it to anyone she never would speak to me again she is a charming woman as i have already mentioned  by a curious coincidence i happened at the time to be one of everetts directors on a company he had just promoted for taking over and developing the red sea coasting trade i lunched with him the following sunday he is an interesting talker and curiosity to discover how so shrewd a man would account for his connection with so insaneso impossible a fancy prompted me to hint my knowledge of the story the manner both of him and of his wife changed suddenly they wanted to know who it was had told me i refused the information because it was evident they would have been angry with him everetts theory was that one of them had dreamt itprobably camelfordand by hypnotic suggestion had conveyed to the rest of them the impression that they had dreamt it also he added that but for one slight incident he should have ridiculed from the very beginning the argument that it could have been anything else than a dream but what that incident was he would not tell me his object as he explained was not to dwell upon the business but to try and forget it speaking as a friend he advised me likewise not to cackle about the matter any more than i could help lest trouble should arise with regard to my directors fees his way of putting things is occasionally blunt  it was at the everetts later on that i met mrs camelford one of the handsomest women i have ever set eyes upon it was foolish of me but my memory for names is weak i forgot that mr and mrs camelford were the other two concerned and mentioned the story as a curious tale i had read years ago in an old miscellany i had reckoned on it to lead me into a discussion with her on platonic friendship she jumped up from her chair and gave me a look i remembered then and could have bitten out my tongue it took me a long while to make my peace but she came round in the end consenting to attribute my blunder to mere stupidity she was quite convinced herself she told me that the thing was pure imagination it was only when in company with the others that any doubt as to this crossed her mind her own idea was that if everybody would agree never to mention the matter again it would end in their forgetting it she supposed it was her husband who had been my informant he was just that sort of ass she did not say it unkindly she said when she was first married ten years ago few people had a more irritating effect upon her than had camelford but that since she had seen more of other men she had come to respect him i like to hear a woman speak well of her husband it is a departure which in my opinion should be more encouraged than it is i assured her camelford was not the culprit and on the understanding that i might come to see hernot too oftenon her thursdays i agreed with her that the best thing i could do would be to dismiss the subject from my mind and occupy myself instead with questions that concerned myself  i had never talked much with camelford before that time though i had often seen him at the club he is a strange man of whom many stories are told he writes journalism for a living and poetry which he publishes at his own expense apparently for recreation it occurred to me that his theory would at all events be interesting but at first he would not talk at all pretending to ignore the whole affair as idle nonsense i had almost despaired of drawing him out when one evening of his own accord he asked me if i thought mrs armitage with whom he knew i was on terms of friendship still attached importance to the thing on my expressing the opinion that mrs armitage was the most troubled of the group he was irritated and urged me to leave the rest of them alone and devote whatever sense i might possess to persuading her in particular that the entire thing was and could be nothing but pure myth he confessed frankly that to him it was still a mystery he could easily regard it as chimera but for one slight incident he would not for a long while say what that was but there is such a thing as perseverance and in the end i dragged it out of him this is what he told me  we happened by chance to find ourselves alone in the conservatory that night of the ballwe six most of the crowd had already left the last extra was being played the music came to us faintly stooping to pick up jessicas fan which she had let fall to the ground something shining on the tesselated pavement underneath a group of palms suddenly caught my eye we had not said a word to one another indeed it was the first evening we had any of us met one anotherthat is unless the thing was not a dream i picked it up the others gathered round me and when we looked into one anothers eyes we understood it was a broken winecup a curious goblet of bavarian glass it was the goblet out of which we had all dreamt that we had drunk  i have put the story together as it seems to me it must have happened the incidents at all events are facts things have since occurred to those concerned affording me hope that they will never read it i should not have troubled to tell it at all but that it has a moral    six persons sat round the great oak table in the wainscoted speise saal of that cosy hostelry the kneiper hof at konigsberg it was late into the night under ordinary circumstances they would have been in bed but having arrived by the last train from dantzic and having supped on german fare it had seemed to them discreeter to remain awhile in talk the house was strangely silent the rotund landlord leaving their candles ranged upon the sideboard had wished them gute nacht an hour before the spirit of the ancient house enfolded them within its wings  here in this very chamber if rumour is to be believed emmanuel kant himself had sat discoursing many a time and oft the walls behind which for more than forty years the little peakfaced man had thought and worked rose silvered by the moonlight just across the narrow way the three high windows of the speise saal give out upon the old cathedral tower beneath which now he rests philosophy curious concerning human phenomena eager for experience unhampered by the limitation convention would impose upon all speculation was in the smoky air  not into future events remarked the rev nathaniel armitage it is better they should be hidden from us but into the future of ourselvesour temperament our characteri think we ought to be allowed to see at twenty we are one individual at forty another person entirely with other views with other interests a different outlook upon life attracted by quite other attributes repelled by the very qualities that once attracted us it is extremely awkward for all of us  i am glad to hear somebody else say that observed mrs everett in her gentle sympathetic voice i have thought it all myself so often sometimes i have blamed myself yet how can one help it the things that appeared of importance to us they become indifferent new voices call to us the idols we once worshipped we see their feet of clay  if under the head of idols you include me laughed the jovial mr everett dont hesitate to say so he was a large redfaced gentleman with small twinkling eyes and a mouth both strong and sensuous i didnt make my feet myself i never asked anybody to take me for a stainedglass saint it is not i who have changed  i know dear it is i his thin wife answered with a meek smile i was beautiful there was no doubt about it when you married me  you were my dear agreed her husband as a girl few could hold a candle to you  it was the only thing about me that you valued my beauty continued his wife and it went so quickly i feel sometimes as if i had swindled you  but there is a beauty of the mind of the soul remarked the rev nathaniel armitage that to some men is more attractive than mere physical perfection  the soft eyes of the faded lady shone for a moment with the light of pleasure i am afraid dick is not of that number she sighed  well as i said just now about my feet answered her husband genially i didnt make myself i always have been a slave to beauty and always shall be there would be no sense in pretending among chums that you havent lost your looks old girl he laid his fine hand with kindly intent upon her bony shoulder but there is no call for you to fret yourself as if you had done it on purpose no one but a lover imagines a woman growing more beautiful as she grows older  some women would seem to answered his wife  involuntarily she glanced to where mrs camelford sat with elbows resting on the table and involuntarily also the small twinkling eyes of her husband followed in the same direction there is a type that reaches its prime in middle age mrs camelford nee jessica dearwood at twenty had been an uncannylooking creature the only thing about her appealing to general masculine taste having been her magnificent eyes and even these had frightened more than they had allured at forty mrs camelford might have posed for the entire juno  yes hes a cunning old joker is time murmured mr everett almost inaudibly  what ought to have happened said mrs armitage while with deft fingers rolling herself a cigarette was for you and nellie to have married  mrs everetts pale face flushed scarlet  my dear exclaimed the shocked nathaniel armitage flushing likewise  oh why may one not sometimes speak the truth answered his wife petulantly you and i are utterly unsuited to one anothereverybody sees it at nineteen it seemed to me beautiful holy the idea of being a clergymans wife fighting by his side against evil besides you have changed since then you were human my dear nat in those days and the best dancer i had ever met it was your dancing was your chief attraction for me as likely as not if i had only known myself at nineteen how can one know oneself  we loved each other the rev armitage reminded her  i know we did passionatelythen but we dont now she laughed a little bitterly poor nat i am only another trial added to your long list your beliefs your ideals are meaningless to memere narrowminded dogmas stifling thought nellie was the wife nature had intended for you so soon as she had lost her beauty and with it all her worldly ideas fate was maturing her for you if only we had known as for me i ought to have been the wife of an artist of a poet unconsciously a glance from her ever restless eyes flashed across the table to where horatio camelford sat puffing clouds of smoke into the air from a huge black meerschaum pipe bohemia is my country its poverty its struggle would have been a joy to me breathing its free air life would have been worth living  horatio camelford leant back with eyes fixed on the oaken ceiling it is a mistake said horatio camelford for the artist ever to marry  the handsome mrs camelford laughed goodnaturedly the artist remarked mrs camelford from what i have seen of him would never know the inside of his shirt from the outside if his wife was not there to take it out of the drawer and put it over his head  his wearing it inside out would not make much difference to the world argued her husband the sacrifice of his art to the necessity of keeping his wife and family does  well you at all events do not appear to have sacrificed much my boy came the breezy voice of dick everett why all the world is ringing with your name  when i am fortyone with all the best years of my life behind me answered the poet speaking as a man i have nothing to regret no one could have had a better wife my children are charming i have lived the peaceful existence of the successful citizen had i been true to my trust i should have gone out into the wilderness the only possible home of the teacher the prophet the artist is the bridegroom of art marriage for him is an immorality had i my time again i should remain a bachelor  time brings its revenges you see laughed mrs camelford at twenty that fellow threatened to commit suicide if i would not marry him and cordially disliking him i consented now twenty years later when i am just getting used to him he calmly turns round and says he would have been better without me  i heard something about it at the time said mrs armitage you were very much in love with somebody else were you not  is not the conversation assuming a rather dangerous direction laughed mrs camelford  i was thinking the same thing agreed mrs everett one would imagine some strange influence had seized upon us forcing us to speak our thoughts aloud  i am afraid i was the original culprit admitted the reverend nathaniel this room is becoming quite oppressive had we not better go to bed  the ancient lamp suspended from its smokegrimed beam uttered a faint gurgling sob and spluttered out the shadow of the old cathedral tower crept in and stretched across the room now illuminated only by occasional beams from the cloudcurtained moon at the other end of the table sat a peakfaced little gentleman cleanshaven in fullbottomed wig  forgive me said the little gentleman he spoke in english with a strong accent but it seems to me here is a case where two parties might be of service to one another  the six fellowtravellers round the table looked at one another but none spoke the idea that came to each of them as they explained to one another later was that without remembering it they had taken their candles and had gone to bed this was surely a dream  it would greatly assist me continued the little peakfaced gentleman in experiments i am conducting into the phenomena of human tendencies if you would allow me to put your lives back twenty years  still no one of the six replied it seemed to them that the little old gentleman must have been sitting there among them all the time unnoticed by them  judging from your talk this evening continued the peakfaced little gentleman you should welcome my offer you appear to me to be one and all of exceptional intelligence you perceive the mistakes that you have made you understand the causes the future veiled you could not help yourselves what i propose to do is to put you back twenty years you will be boys and girls again but with this difference that the knowledge of the future so far as it relates to yourselves will remain with you  come urged the old gentleman the thing is quite simple of accomplishment asas a certain philosopher has clearly proved the universe is only the result of our own perceptions by what may appear to you to be magicby what in reality will be simply a chemical operationi remove from your memory the events of the last twenty years with the exception of what immediately concerns your own personalities you will retain all knowledge of the changes physical and mental that will be in store for you all else will pass from your perception  the little old gentleman took a small phial from his waistcoat pocket and filling one of the massive wineglasses from a decanter measured into it some halfadozen drops then he placed the glass in the centre of the table  youth is a good time to go back to said the peakfaced little gentleman with a smile twenty years ago it was the night of the hunt ball you remember it  it was everett who drank first he drank it with his little twinkling eyes fixed hungrily on the proud handsome face of mrs camelford and then handed the glass to his wife it was she perhaps who drank from it most eagerly her life with everett from the day when she had risen from a bed of sickness stripped of all her beauty had been one bitter wrong she drank with the wild hope that the thing might possibly be not a dream and thrilled to the touch of the man she loved as reaching across the table he took the glass from her hand mrs armitage was the fourth to drink she took the cup from her husband drank with a quiet smile and passed it on to camelford and camelford drank looking at nobody and replaced the glass upon the table  come said the little old gentleman to mrs camelford you are the only one left the whole thing will be incomplete without you  i have no wish to drink said mrs camelford and her eyes sought those of her husband but he would not look at her  come again urged the figure and then camelford looked at her and laughed drily  you had better drink he said its only a dream  if you wish it she answered and it was from his hands she took the glass    it is from the narrative as armitage told it to me that night in the club smokingroom that i am taking most of my material it seemed to him that all things began slowly to rise upward leaving him stationary but with a great pain as though the inside of him were being torn awaythe same sensation greatly exaggerated so he likened it as descending in a lift but around him all the time was silence and darkness unrelieved after a period that might have been minutes that might have been years a faint light crept towards him it grew stronger and into the air which now fanned his cheek there stole the sound of faroff music the light and the music both increased and one by one his senses came back to him he was seated on a low cushioned bench beneath a group of palms a young girl was sitting beside him but her face was turned away from him  i did not catch your name he was saying would you mind telling it to me  she turned her face towards him it was the most spiritually beautiful face he had ever seen i am in the same predicament she laughed you had better write yours on my programme and i will write mine on yours  so they wrote upon each others programme and exchanged again the name she had written was alice blatchley  he had never seen her before that he could remember yet at the back of his mind there dwelt the haunting knowledge of her somewhere long ago they had met talked together slowly as one recalls a dream it came back to him in some other life vague shadowy he had married this woman for the first few years they had loved each other then the gulf had opened between them widened stern strong voices had called to him to lay aside his selfish dreams his boyish ambitions to take upon his shoulders the yoke of a great duty when more than ever he had demanded sympathy and help this woman had fallen away from him his ideals but irritated her only at the cost of daily bitterness had he been able to resist her endeavours to draw him from his path a facethat of a woman with soft eyes full of helpfulness shone through the mist of his dreamthe face of a woman who would one day come to him out of the future with outstretched hands that he would yearn to clasp  shall we not dance said the voice beside him i really wont sit out a waltz  they hurried into the ballroom with his arm about her form her wondrous eyes shyly at rare moments seeking his then vanishing again behind their drooping lashes the brain the mind the very soul of the young man passed out of his own keeping she complimented him in her bewitching manner a delightful blending of condescension and timidity  you dance extremely well she told him you may ask me for another later on  the words flashed out from that dim haunting future your dancing was your chief attraction for me as likely as not had i but known  all that evening and for many months to come the present and the future fought within him and the experience of nathaniel armitage divinity student was the experience likewise of alice blatchley who had fallen in love with him at first sight having found him the divinest dancer she had ever whirled with to the sensuous music of the waltz of horatio camelford journalist and minor poet whose journalism earned him a bare income but at whose minor poetry critics smiled of jessica dearwood with her glorious eyes and muddy complexion and her wild hopeless passion for the big handsome ruddybearded dick everett who knowing it only laughed at her in his kindly lordly way telling her with frank brutalness that the woman who was not beautiful had missed her vocation in life of that scheming conquering young gentleman himself who at twentyfive had already made his mark in the city shrewd clever coolheaded as a fox except where a pretty face and shapely hand or ankle were concerned of nellie fanshawe then in the pride of her ravishing beauty who loved none but herself whose claymade gods were jewels and fine dresses and rich feasts the envy of other women and the courtship of all mankind  that evening of the ball each clung to the hope that this memory of the future was but a dream they had been introduced to one another had heard each others names for the first time with a start of recognition had avoided one anothers eyes had hastened to plunge into meaningless talk till that moment when young camelford stooping to pick up jessicas fan had found that broken fragment of the rhenish wineglass then it was that conviction refused to be shaken off that knowledge of the future had to be sadly accepted  what they had not foreseen was that knowledge of the future in no way affected their emotions of the present nathaniel armitage grew day by day more hopelessly in love with bewitching alice blatchley the thought of her marrying anyone elsethe longhaired priggish camelford in particularsent the blood boiling through his veins added to which sweet alice with her arms about his neck would confess to him that life without him would be a misery hardly to be endured that the thought of him as the husband of another womanof nellie fanshawe in particularwas madness to her it was right perhaps knowing what they did that they should say goodbye to one another she would bring sorrow into his life better far that he should put her away from him that she should die of a broken heart as she felt sure she would how could he a fond lover inflict this suffering upon her he ought of course to marry nellie fanshawe but he could not bear the girl would it not be the height of absurdity to marry a girl he strongly disliked because twenty years hence she might be more suitable to him than the woman he now loved and who loved him  nor could nellie fanshawe bring herself to discuss without laughter the suggestion of marrying on a hundredandfifty a year a curate that she positively hated there would come a time when wealth would be indifferent to her when her exalted spirit would ask but for the satisfaction of selfsacrifice but that time had not arrived the emotions it would bring with it she could not in her present state even imagine her whole present being craved for the things of this world the things that were within her grasp to ask her to forego them now because later on she would not care for them it was like telling a schoolboy to avoid the tuckshop because when a man the thought of stickjaw would be nauseous to him if her capacity for enjoyment was to be shortlived all the more reason for grasping joy quickly  alice blatchley when her lover was not by gave herself many a headache trying to think the thing out logically was it not foolish of her to rush into this marriage with dear nat at forty she would wish she had married somebody else but most women at fortyshe judged from conversation round about herwished they had married somebody else if every girl at twenty listened to herself at forty there would be no more marriage at forty she would be a different person altogether that other elderly person did not interest her to ask a young girl to spoil her life purely in the interests of this middleaged partyit did not seem right besides whom else was she to marry camelford would not have her he did not want her then he was not going to want her at forty for practical purposes camelford was out of the question she might marry somebody else altogetherand fare worse she might remain a spinster she hated the mere name of spinster the inkyfingered woman journalist that if all went well she might become it was not her idea was she acting selfishly ought she in his own interests to refuse to marry dear nat nelliethe little catwho would suit him at forty would not have him if he was going to marry anyone but nellie he might as well marry her alice a bachelor clergyman it sounded almost improper nor was dear nat the type if she threw him over it would be into the arms of some designing minx what was she to do  camelford at forty under the influence of favourable criticism would have persuaded himself he was a heavensent prophet his whole life to be beautifully spent in the saving of mankind at twenty he felt he wanted to live weirdlooking jessica with her magnificent eyes veiling mysteries was of more importance to him than the rest of the species combined knowledge of the future in his ease only spurred desire the muddy complexion would grow pink and white the thin limbs round and shapely the now scornful eyes would one day light with love at his coming it was what he had once hoped it was what he now knew at forty the artist is stronger than the man at twenty the man is stronger than the artist  an uncanny creature so most folks would have described jessica dearwood few would have imagined her developing into the goodnatured easygoing mrs camelford of middle age the animal so strong within her at twenty at thirty had burnt itself out at eighteen madly blindly in love with redbearded deepvoiced dick everett she would had he whistled to her have flung herself gratefully at his feet and this in spite of the knowledge forewarning her of the miserable life he would certainly lead her at all events until her slowly developing beauty should give her the whip hand of himby which time she would have come to despise him fortunately as she told herself there was no fear of his doing so the future notwithstanding nellie fanshawes beauty held him as with chains of steel and nellie had no intention of allowing her rich prize to escape her her own lover it was true irritated her more than any man she had ever met but at least he would afford her refuge from the bread of charity jessica dearwood an orphan had been brought up by a distant relative she had not been the child to win affection of silent brooding nature every thoughtless incivility had been to her an insult a wrong acceptance of young camelford seemed her only escape from a life that had become to her a martyrdom at fortyone he would wish he had remained a bachelor but at thirtyeight that would not trouble her she would know herself he was much better off as he was meanwhile she would have come to like him to respect him he would be famous she would be proud of him crying into her pillowshe could not help itfor love of handsome dick it was still a comfort to reflect that nellie fanshawe as it were was watching over her protecting her from herself  dick as he muttered to himself a dozen times a day ought to marry jessica at thirtyeight she would be his ideal he looked at her as she was at eighteen and shuddered nellie at thirty would be plain and uninteresting but when did consideration of the future ever cry halt to passion when did a lover ever pause thinking of the morrow if her beauty was to quickly pass was not that one reason the more urging him to possess it while it lasted  nellie fanshawe at forty would be a saint the prospect did not please her she hated saints she would love the tiresome solemn nathaniel of what use was that to her now he did not desire her he was in love with alice and alice was in love with him what would be the senseeven if they all agreedin the three of them making themselves miserable for all their youth that they might be contented in their old age let age fend for itself and leave youth to its own instincts let elderly saints sufferit was their metierand youth drink the cup of life it was a pity dick was the only catch available but he was young and handsome other girls had to put up with sixty and the gout  another point a very serious point had been overlooked all that had arrived to them in that dim future of the past had happened to them as the results of their making the marriages they had made to what fate other roads would lead their knowledge could not tell them nellie fanshawe had become at forty a lovely character might not the hard life she had led with her husbanda life calling for continual sacrifice for daily selfcontrolhave helped towards this end as the wife of a poor curate of high moral principles would the same result have been secured the fever that had robbed her of her beauty and turned her thoughts inward had been the result of sitting out on the balcony of the paris opera house with an italian count on the occasion of a fancy dress ball as the wife of an east end clergyman the chances are she would have escaped that fever and its purifying effects was there not danger in the position a supremely beautiful young woman worldlyminded hungry for pleasure condemned to a life of poverty with a man she did not care for the influence of alice upon nathaniel armitage during those first years when his character was forming had been all for good could he be sure that married to nellie he might not have deteriorated  were alice blatchley to marry an artist could she be sure that at forty she would still be in sympathy with artistic ideals even as a child had not her desire ever been in the opposite direction to that favoured by her nurse did not the reading of conservative journals invariably incline her towards radicalism and the steady stream of radical talk round her husbands table invariably set her seeking arguments in favour of the feudal system might it not have been her husbands growing puritanism that had driven her to crave for bohemianism suppose that towards middle age the wife of a wild artist she suddenly took religion as the saying is her last state would be worse than the first  camelford was of delicate physique as an absentminded bachelor with no one to give him his meals no one to see that his things were aired could he have lived till forty could he be sure that home life had not given more to his art than it had taken from it  jessica dearwood of a nervous passionate nature married to a bad husband might at forty have posed for one of the furies not until her life had become restful had her good looks shown themselves hers was the type of beauty that for its development demands tranquillity  dick everett had no delusions concerning himself that had he married jessica he could for ten years have remained the faithful husband of a singularly plain wife he knew to be impossible but jessica would have been no patient griselda the extreme probability was that having married her at twenty for the sake of her beauty at thirty at twentynine at latest she would have divorced him  everett was a man of practical ideas it was he who took the matter in hand the refreshment contractor admitted that curious goblets of german glass occasionally crept into their stock one of the waiters on the understanding that in no case should he be called upon to pay for them admitted having broken more than one wineglass on that particular evening thought it not unlikely he might have attempted to hide the fragments under a convenient palm the whole thing evidently was a dream so youth decided at the time and the three marriages took place within three months of one another  it was some ten years later that armitage told me the story that night in the club smokingroom mrs everett had just recovered from a severe attack of rheumatic fever contracted the spring before in paris mrs camelford whom previously i had not met certainly seemed to me one of the handsomest women i have ever seen mrs armitagei knew her when she was alice blatchleyi found more charming as a woman than she had been as a girl what she could have seen in armitage i never could understand camelford made his mark some ten years later poor fellow he did not live long to enjoy his fame dick everett has still another six years to work off but he is well behaved and there is talk of a petition  it is a curious story altogether i admit as i said at the beginning i do not myself believe it
