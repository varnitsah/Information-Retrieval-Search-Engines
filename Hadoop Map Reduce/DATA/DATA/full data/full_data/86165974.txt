does not share and whose reading of the events and tendencies of our time was in most respects directly opposite to ones own but literature is neutral ground character is more than opinion here we may forget the loud cries and sounding strokes the watchwords and the tactics of the tented field and fraternise with the adversary of the eve and the morrow in friendly curiosity and liberal recognition it fell to the present writer at one time to have one or two bouts of public controversy with mr greg in these dialectics mr greg was never vehement and never pressed but he was inclined to beor at least was felt by an opponent to bedry mordant and almost harsh these disagreeable prepossessions were instantly dissipated as so often happens by personal acquaintance he had not only the courtesy of the good type of the man of the world but an air of moral suavity when one came near enough to him that was infinitely attractive and engaging he was urbane essentially modest and readily interested in ideas and subjects other than his own there was in his manner and address something of what the french call liant when the chances of residence made me his neighbour an evening in his drawingroom or half an hours talk in casual meetings in afternoon walks on wimbledon common was always a particularly agreeable incident some men and women have the quality of atmosphere the egotism of the natural man is surrounded by an elastic medium mr greg was one of these personalities with an atmosphere elastic stimulating elevating and yet composing we do wrong to narrow our interests to those only of our contemporaries who figure with great lustre and Ã©clat in the world some of the quiet characters away from the centre of great affairs are as well worth our attention as those who in highheeled cothurnus stalk across the foreground  mr greg it is not necessary to say has a serious reputation in the literature of our time in politics he was one of the best literary representatives of the fastidious or pedantocratic school of government in economics he spoke the last word and fell sword in hand in the last trench of the party of capitalist supremacy and industrial tutelage in the group of profound speculative questions that have come up for popular discussion since the great yawning rents and fissures have been made in the hypotheses of theology by the hypotheses of science he set a deep mark on many minds we are in the sick foggy dawn of a new era says one distinguished writer of our day and no one saw more clearly than w r greg what the day that would follow was likely to be to this i must humbly venture to demur for there is no true vision of the fortunes of human society without hope and without faith in the beneficent powers and processes of the unseen time that and no other is the mood in which our sight is most likely to pierce the obscuring mists from which the new era begins to emerge when we have said so much as this it remains as true as before that mr gregs faculty of disinterested speculation his feeling for the problems of life and his distinction of character all make it worth while to put something about him on record and to attempt to describe him as he was apart from the opaque influences of passing controversy and of discussions that are rapidly losing their point  mr greg was born at manchester in 1809 the family stock was irish by residence and settlement though scotch in origin the family name was half jocosely and half seriously believed to be the middle syllable of the famous clan of macgregor william rathbone gregs grandfather was a man of good position in the neighbourhood of belfast who sent two of his sons to push their fortunes in england the younger of the two was adopted by an uncle who carried on the business of a merchant at manchester he had no children of his own the boy was sent to harrow where dr samuel parr was then an assistant master when the post of head master became vacant parr though only fiveandtwenty entered into a very vehement contest for the prize he failed and in a fit of spleen set up an establishment of his own at stanmore many persons as de quincey tells us of station and influence both lent him money and gave him a sort of countenance equally useful to his interests by placing their sons under his care among those who accompanied him from harrow was samuel greg the lad was meant by his uncle to be a clergyman but this project he stoutly resisted instead of reading for orders he travelled abroad acquired foreign languages and found out something about the commercial affairs of the continent of europe his uncle died in 1783 and the nephew took up the business it was the date of the american peace samuel greg was carried forward on the tide of prosperity that poured over the country after that great event and in a moderate time he laid the foundation of a large and solid fortune the mighty industrial revolution that was begun by the inventions of arkwright was now in its first stage arkwrights earliest patent had been taken out a few years before and his factory in derbyshire had by this time proved a practical success instead of sharing the brutish animosity of the manufacturers of lancashire to the new processes that were destined to turn their county into a mine of gold greg discerned their immense importance the vast prospects of manufacturing industry grew upon his imagination he looked about him in search of waterpower in the neighbourhood of manchester and at length found what he wanted a dozen miles away at wilmslow over the cheshire border here the stream of the bollen cuts through a flat and uninteresting tableland and forms a pretty valley of its own as it winds between banks of red sandstone when the mill was built and a house close to it quarry bank became the home of the family and it was here that w r greg passed his childhood youth and early manhood  his mother was fifth in descent from philip henry one of the two thousand uncompromising divines who were driven out from their benefices on that black bartholomews day of 1662 which is still commemorated by the severer nonconformists of the old school his son was the better known mathew henry whose famous commentary on the bible has for more than a century and a half been the favourite manual of devotional reading in half the pious households all over england and the united states something of the puritan element was thus brought into the family in ireland the gregs belonged to the presbyterians of the new light and their doctrine allowed of a considerable relaxation in the rigours of older orthodoxy many again of the puritans of the north of england had favoured the teachings of priestley the result of these two streams of influence was that the gregs of manchester joined the unitarians in this body w r greg was brought up his mother was a woman of strongly marked character she was cultivated and had some literary capacity of her own she cared eagerly for the things of the mind both for herself and her children and in spite of ill health and abundant cares she persisted in strenuous effort after a high intellectual and moral standard a little book of maxims compiled by her still remains and she found time to write a couple of volumes of practical suggestions towards alleviating the sufferings of the sick one volume is little more than a selection of religious extracts not likely to be more apt or useful to the sick than to the whole the other is a discreet and homely little manual of nursing distinguished from the common run of such books by its delicate consideration and wise counsel for the peculiar mental susceptibilities of the invalid the collection of maxims and observations was designed to be an useful gift to her children gleaned from her own reading and reflection though not intended for publication they found their way into a few congenial circles and one at least of those who were educated at dr carpenters school at bristol can remember these maxims being read aloud to the boys and the impression that their wisdom and morality made upon his youthful mind the literary value of the compilation is modest enough along with some of the best of the sayings of chesterfield la rochefoucauld addison and other famous masters of sentences is much that is nearer to the level of nursery commonplace but then these commonplaces are new truths to the young and they are the unadorned unseen foundations on which character is built  the home over which this excellent woman presided offered an ideal picture of domestic felicity and worth the grave simplicity of the household their intellectual ways the absence of display and even of knickknacks the pale blue walls the unadorned furniture the wellfilled bookcases the portrait of george washington over the chimneypiece all took people back to a taste that was formed on mrs barbauld and dr channing stanley afterwards bishop of norwich and father of the famous dean of our own day was rector of the adjoining parish of alderley catherine stanley his wife has left a charming memorial of the home of the gregs    have you ever been to quarry bank it is such a   picture of rational happy life mr greg is quite a   gentleman his daughters have the delightful simplicity   of people who are perfectly satisfied in their place and   never trying to get out of it he is rich and he   spends just as people do not generally spend their money   keeping a sort of open house without pretension if he   has more guests than the old butler can manage he has   his maidservants in to wait he seldom goes out except   on journeys so that with the almost certainty of finding   a family party at home a large circle of connections and   literary people and foreigners and scotch and irish are   constantly dropping in knowing they cannot come amiss   you may imagine how this sort of life makes the whole   family sit loose to all the incumbrances and hindrances   of society they actually do not know what it is to be   formal or dull each with their separate pursuits and   tastes intelligent and wellinformed  mrs fletcher again that beautiful type of feminine character alike as maiden and mother whose autobiography was given to the world a few years ago tells how the family at quarry bank struck and delighted her we stayed a week with them she says and admired the cultivation of mind and refinement of manners which mrs greg preserved in the midst of a moneymaking and somewhat unpolished community of merchants and manufacturers mr greg too was most gentlemanly and hospitable and surrounded by eleven clever and wellconducted children i thought them the happiest family group i had ever seen1  footnote 1 autobiography of mrs fletcher p 97 edinburgh edmonston and douglas 1876  samuel greg was one of thirteen children and he in his turn became the father of thirteen w r greg was the youngest of them the brightness and sweetness of his disposition procured for him even more than the ordinary endearment of such a place in a large family after the usual amount of schooling first at home under the auspices of an elder sister then at leeds and finally at dr carpenters at bristol in the winter of 18261827 he went to the university of edinburgh and remained there until the end of the session of 1828 he was a diligent student but we may suspect from the turn of his pursuits on leaving the university that his mind worked most readily out of the academic groove after the manner of most young men with an aptitude for literature he competed for a prize poem in john wilsons class but he did not win when he was in low spiritsa mood so much more common in early manhood than we usually remember afterwardshe drove them away by energetic bursts of work on one occasion he says when i was so bad that i thought i should have gone distracted i shut myself up and for three days studied all the most abstruse works that i could find on the origin of government and society such as godwin goguet rousseau et cÃ¦tera from seven in the morning till twelve at night which quite set me up again natural history at another time he tells his sister is my principal pursuit at present and from halfpast six in the morning to twelve at night i am incessantly at work with the exception of about two hours for exercise and two more for meals  sir william hamilton was the chief intellectual influence in edinburgh at this time and greg followed his lectures with lively interest he was still more attracted by the controversy that then raged in edinburgh and elsewhere on the value of phrenology and animal magnetism hamilton as all students of contemporary philosophy are aware denounced the pretensions of phrenology with curious vehemence and asperity it was the only doctrine his friends said that he could not even tolerate on animal magnetism he held a very different opinion and he wrote to greg encouraging his enthusiasm in that direction there has always he said seemed to me a foundation of truth in the science however overlaid with a superstructure of credulity and enthusiasm i foresee as great a clamour in favour of the science as there is at present a contempt and prejudice against it and both equally absurd  it was in this field and not in literature or philosophy that gregs interests were most actively aroused during his university career when his life as a student came to an end he returned home with his whole faculties of curiosity and enthusiasm concentrated upon natural history phrenology and animal magnetism i have a canine appetite for natural history he told his brother in 1828 he describes with all the zeal of a clever youth of nineteen how busily he is employed in macerating skulls dissecting unsavoury creatures before breakfast watching the ants reduce a viper to a skeleton for him and striving with all his might to get a perfect collection of animal and human skulls all this however was rather an accidental outbreak of exuberant intellectual activity than serious and welldirected study he was full of the vague and morbid aspirations of youth    as for me he writes to his elder brother i am pining   after change i am thirsting for excitement when i   compare what i might be with what i shall be what i   might do with what i shall do i am ready to curse myself   with vexation why had i who am so low a taste   so high i know you are rather of a more peaceful   and quiet temper of mind than i but i am much mistaken   if you have not much of the same desire for some   kind of life more suited to mans lofty passions and his   glorious destiny how can one bear to know how much   is to be seen and learned and yet sit down content without   ransacking every corner of the earth for knowledge   and wonder and beauty and after all what is picking   a few skulls the occupation which gives me the greatest   pleasure now when compared with gaining an intimate   and practical acquaintance with all the varieties of man   all the varying phases of his character all the peculiarities   of his everchanging situations2  footnote 2 august 28 1828  we may smile at the youthful rhetoric as the writer proceeds to describe how shameful it would be to remain inactive in the sight of exertion to be satisfied with ignorance when in full view of the temple of knowledge and so forth but it is the language of a generous ardour for pure aims and not the commoner ambition for the glittering prizes of life this disinterested preference remained with greg from the beginning to the end  william gregs truest delight at this time lay in his affectionate and happy intercourse with his brother samuel there were three elder brothers one of them died comparatively young but robert and john were eminently successful in the affairs of life the former of them represented manchester they both lived to be octogenarians and both left behind them the beneficent traces of long years of intelligent and conscientious achievement in samuel greg an interesting clear and earnest intelligence was united to the finest natural piety of character enough remains to show the impression that samuel greg made even on those who were not bound to him by the ties of domestic affection the posthumous memorials of him disclose a nature moulded of no common clay and when he was gone even accomplished men of the world and scholars could not recall without emotion his bright and ardent spirit his forbearance his humility3 the two brothers says one who knew them were now both of them fresh from college their interest was alike keen in a great variety of subjectspoetry philosophy science politics social questions about these the two brothers were never tired of talking together they would pace up and down all the evening under the stars and late into the night discussing things in heaven and earth with a keen zest that seemed inexhaustible their appetite for knowledge was insatiable and their outlook over the rich life that was opening before them was full of hope and promise  footnote 3 see the little volume entitled a laymans legacy published in 1877 macmillan and co with a prefatory letter by the late dean of westminster  the energetic and highminded mother of the house died at the end of 1828 and the tenderness and skill of her youngest son in the sickroom surpassed the devotion of women in the following year he went to manage one of his fathers mills at bury where he went to reside the gregs had always been distinguished for their efforts to humanise the semibarbarous population that the extraordinary development of the cotton industry was then attracting to lancashire at quarry bank the sedulous cultivation of their own minds had always been subordinate to the constant and multifarious demands of their duties towards their workpeople one of the curious features of that not very distant time was the apprentice house the employer procured children from the workhouse and undertook the entire charge of them the gregs usually had a hundred boys and girls between the ages of ten and twentyone in their apprentice house and the care of them was one of the main occupations of the family they came from the refuse of the towns yet the harmony of wise and gentle rule for the young along with dutifully adjusted demand and compliance between the older hands and their employers ended in the transformation of the thin starved halfdazed creatures who entered the gates of the factory into the best type of workpeople to be found in the district the genial side of the patriarchal system was seen at its best there is a touch of grace about the picture of the pleasant house with its old beechtrees and its steep grassy lawns sloping to the river with the rhythmic hum of the mill the loud factory bell marking the hours like the voice of time itself the workers pouring through the garden in the summer morning on their way to wilmslow church and receiving flowers and friendly salutation from the group at the open door of the great house it was little wonder that these recollections acquired a fascination for william greg that never passed away and gave that characteristic form to his social ideas which they never lost  at bury and at quarry bank the two brothers were unresting in their efforts both to acquire knowledge for themselves and to communicate it to their neighbours they delivered courses of lectures and took boundless trouble to make them interesting and instructive in these lectures william greg took what opportunities he could find to enforce moral and religious sentiment i lay it down he said as an indubitable fact that religion has double the effect on saturday that it has on sunday and weekday morality incidentally introduced meets with far more attention than the tautology of sabbath subjects treated in the style in which they generally are by professed teachers a more questionable diligence displayed itself in the zealous practice of experiments in animal magnetism and mesmerism with a faith that might have moved mountains the two brothers laid their hands upon all sorts of sick folk and they believed themselves to have wrought many cures and wonders william greg described animal magnetism as a discovery bearing more immediately and extensively on the physical happiness of the world than any which the last three centuries have witnessed the cowardice of doctors and others who believed but were afraid to speak stirred all the generous fire of youth here of itself he cries out to his sister september 4 1829 is a bitter satire upon human nature and a sufficient answer to all who moralise on the impropriety of flying in the face of received opinions and public prejudice i assure you it is a knowledge of how often the ridicule and contempt of the world has crushed truth in the embryo or stifled it in the cradle which makes me so eager to examine and support those opinions which mankind generally condemn as visionary and irrational in later times these interests became a bond between w r greg and miss martineau he finally let the subject drop with the conviction that years of practice had brought it no farther on its way either to scientific rank or to practical fruitfulness the time would have been better spent in severer studies though these were not absent from green bank he writes to his sister in 1830    sam and i are at present engaged in some calculations   on population which have brought us to a very curious   beautiful and important conclusion hitherto overlooked   by all writers on the subject whom i have consulted and   which threatens to invalidate a considerable part of   malthuss theory it respects the increase or diminution   of fecundity but i will write you more fully when we have   quite established our facts i have just finished a number   of very tedious tables all of which confirm our conclusions   in a manner i had not ventured to anticipate    i am now september 3 1830 very busy reading   and arranging and meditating for my lectures on history   which will be ten times the labour of my last also   collecting from all history and all science every fact or   principle or opinion or admission or event which can   in any way bear upon magnetism or suggest any argument   for its correctness whereby i have amassed a   profusion of ancient and modern learning which i think   will astonish the natives when i bring it forward    my other occupations at present are reading through   the best authors and orators of our countryto get a   perfect command of language and styleas hooker   taylor burke canning erskine fox etc after which   i shall take to french literature and make myself as   well acquainted with voltaire moliÃ¨re bossuet massillon   flÃ©chier and condorcet as i am with mme de staÃ«l   and rousseau and montesquieu and volney this will   be work enough for another year and what fit may   then come upon me it is impossible to see my views   on population are confirmed by every fresh calculation   i see and sadlers new work affords me the means of   controverting his theory and establishing my own the   moral physical and political influence of manufactures   and poor laws i must next examine  a little later he writes    everything bears indications of some approaching   struggle between the higher and lower classes and the   guilt of it if it does come will lie at the door of those   who by their inflammatory speeches public and private   and by their constant and monotonous complaints have   raised among the people a universal spirit of rebellion   and disaffection to everything and everybody whom   nature has ordained to rule over them we are all   waiting in some alarm and much indignation for the   result and in the meantime entre nous i have written   a small pamphlet addressed to the higher classes on the   present state of public feeling among the lower urging   them to moderate and direct it if they can but sooner   than the present state of things should continue i would   adopt any principles conceiving it to be the duty of all   men as burke says so to be patriots as not to forget   that we are gentlemen to mould our principles to our   duties and our situations and to be convinced that all   public virtue which is impracticable is spurious i   write to induce the people to leave politics to wiser   heads to consent to learn and not endeavour to direct   or teach  we here see that before he was oneandtwenty years old greg was possessed by the conception that haunted him to the very end when the people complain their complaint savours of rebellion those who make themselves the mouthpieces of popular complaint must be wicked incendiaries the privileged classes must be ordained by nature to rule over the nonprivileged the few ought to direct and teach the many to learn that was gregs theory of government from first to last it was derived at this time i suppose from burke without the powerful correctives and indispensable supplements that are to be found in burkes earlier writings some one said of de tocqueville who afterwards became mr gregs friend and who showed in a milder form the same fear of democracy il a commencÃ© Ã  penser avant davoir rien appris ce qui fait quil a quelquefois pensÃ© creux what is to be said for mr greg now and always is that he most honourably accepted the obligations of his doctrine and did his best to discharge his own duties as a member of the directing class  he did not escape moods of reaction the truth seems to be that though his life was always well filled he inherited rather the easy and buoyant disposition of his father than the energy and strenuousness of his mother though he too could be energetic and strenuous enough upon occasion both william greg and his favourite brother were of what is called with doubtful fitness the feminine temperament it was much less true of william than of samuel greg but it was in some degree true of him also that though firm tenacious and infinitely patient he rather lacked that harder and tougher fibre both of mind and frame which makes the battle of life so easy and so successful to many men it may be suspected in both cases that their excessive and prolonged devotion to the practice of mesmerism and animal magnetism had tended to relax rather than to brace the natural fibre samuel greg broke down at a comparatively early age and though his brothers more vigorous system showed no evil results for many long years to come there was a severe reaction from the nervous tension of their mesmeric experimentation  those who trace despondent speculations of the mind to depressed or morbid conditions of body will find some support for their thesis in mr gregs case when he was only oneandtwenty he writes to his sister december 2 1830    i am again attacked with one of those fits of melancholy   indifference to everything and total incapacity for exertion   to which i am so often subject and which are indeed the   chronic malady of my existence they sometimes last   for many weeks and during their continuance i do not   believe among those whose external circumstances are   comfortable there exists any one more thoroughly miserable   for nearly four years these fits of melancholy   and depression have been my periodical torment and as   yet i have found no remedy against them except strong   stimulants or the society of intimate friends and even   these are only temporary and the latter seldom within   my reach and the former i abstain from partly on principle   but more from a fear of consequences every one   has a thorn in the flesh and this is mine but i am   egotistical if not selfish in inflicting it upon others i   begin to think i have mistaken my way both to my own   happiness and the affections of others my strongest   passion has always been the desire to be lovedas the   french call it le besoin dÃªtre aimÃ© it is the great   wish want desire necessity desideratum of my life the   source through which i expect happiness to flow to me   the ultimate aim and object which has led me on in all   the little i have done and the much that i have tried   to do  from these broodings the young man was rescued by a year of travel it was one of the elements in the domestic scheme of education that the university should be followed by a year abroad and in william gregs case it had been postponed for a season by the exigences of business and the factory at bury he went first through france and switzerland to italy at florence he steeped himself in italian and read beccaria and machiavelli but he had no dÃ¦monic passion like macaulays for literature italian he said is a wonderfully poor literature in everything but poetry and the poets i am not up to and i do not think that i shall take the trouble to study them when he reached that city which usually excites a traveller as no other city on earth can excite him dyspepsia neuralgia and vapours plunged him into bad spirits and prevented him from enjoying either rome or his books the sights of rome were very different fifty years ago from those that instruct and fascinate us today except the colosseum the pantheon and a few pillars covered thick with the filth of the modern city the traveller found the ancient rome an undistinguishable heap of bricks still when we reflect on the profound and undying impression that rome even then had made on such men as goethe or winckelmann or byron the shortcoming must have been partly in the traveller in truth mr greg was not readily stirred either by goethes high artistic sense or by byrons romantic sense of the vast pathos of rome    i pass my time here he says with extreme regularity   and quietness not knowing even to speak to a single   individual in rome and the direction to my valet when   i start on my perambulations al campidoglio al foro   forms the largest part of my daily utterances in a   fit of desperation i took to writing a kind of political   philosophy in default of my poetical aim which is quite   gone from me it is a setting forth of the peculiar political   and religious features of the age wherein it differs   from all preceding ones and is entitled the genius of the   nineteenth century i do not know if i shall ever finish   it but if i could write it as i have imagined it it will   at least be entitled to come under mr godwins definition   of eloquence that gentleman being in a company of   literati who were comparing their notions of what eloquence   could be defined to consist in when his opinion   was asked replied eloquence is truth spoken with fervour   i am going on with it though slowly and fill up the rest   of my leisure time with dante and machiavelli with   which last author i am delighted in the morning and   with boccaccio and our english poets in the evening   sightseeing does not occupy much of my time4  footnote 4 november 30 1831  from rome mr greg and a companion went to naples and from naples they made their way to sicily i have said that mr greg had not byrons historic sense still this was the byronic era and no one felt its influence more fervently from youth to the end of his life through good and evil repute mr greg maintained byrons supremacy among poets of the modern time it was no wonder then that he should write home to his friendsi am tired of civilised europe and i want to see a wild country if i can accordingly at naples he made up his mind to undertake what would be a very adventurous tour even in our day travelling through greece and asia minor to constantinople and thence northwards through hungary to vienna this wild and hazardous part of his tour gave him a refreshment and pleasure that he had not found in swiss landscapes or italian cities and he enjoyed the excitement of the wild countries as thoroughly as he had expected on his return to england he published anonymously an account of what he had seen in greece and turkey in a volume which if occasionally florid and imaginative is still a lively and copious piece of description it is even now worth turning to for a picture of the ruin and distraction of greece after the final expulsion of the turk5  footnote 5 sketches in greece and turkey with the present condition and future prospects of the turkish empire london ridgway 1833  on his return he found the country in the throes of the great election after the reform bill perhaps his experiences of the sovereign demos on that occasion helped to colour his opinions on popular government afterwards    december 5 1832on tuesday we nominatedthere   was a fearful crowd of 10000 ruffians grundys friends   from the country a tremendous uproar i seconded   mr walkers nomination but was received with yells and   groans owing chiefly to the prosecution which i have   instituted against the other candidate and four of his   supporters for intimidation of voters the ruffians roared   at me like so many bulls of bashan and shook their fists   at me whereupon i bowed profoundly and finding it   impossible to obtain a hearing i turned to the opposite   candidate and his immediate supporters on the hustings   and spoke to them when we concluded the uproar was   fearful i was warned to escape as i could which i did   amid groans and hisses but no violence the next   morning we started polling i had the honour of giving   the first vote and at four oclock the poll was decided in   our favourwalker 301 grundy 151 the next day   i returned from manchester and had not been in the mill   two hours before i was summoned to assist in quelling a   riot i rode down immediately with three other gentlemen   and a magistrate to the scene of faction we found plenty   of broken windows and heads but no one killed here   were two parties of such bludgeon men as i never before   witnessed evidently bent on mischief we read the riot   actsent for the military and the haslams i rode   among the ruffians they were in a state of extreme   exasperation especially against me but listened to my   exhortations and after shaking their bludgeons at me   came at last to shake hands about dusk i received   several hints to take care of myself so rode back to green   bank and lay with my blunderbuss and sword ready to   give entertainment to any visitor  it is little wonder that in a man of his literary temperament and predispositions a strong reaction followed close behind these energetic performances    do you know he writes december 29 i am sick of   public life i mean sicker than ever the reward or   rather success is so very inadequate to the sacrifice and   the exertion and the injury to ones character mentally   morally and religiously is so great and ones real happiness   suffers yet more my love for retirement and the   country scientific studies and calm quiet and refreshing   society such as the country only can afford which has   always been a sort of passion is now urging me more   strongly and imperiously than ever to weigh conflicting   interests and tastes and to hold fast that which is good   and is it not far better to retire in the full vigour of life   when the energy of application is still unimpaired and can   be usefully directed  in 1833 mr greg started in business on his own account at bury he inherited his fathers mechanical taste and took a lively interest in the improvements that were constantly being made in those years in the wonderful machinery of the cotton manufacture with his workpeople his relations were the most friendly and he was as active as he had ever been before in trying to better their condition a wider field was open for his philanthropic energies lancashire was then the scene of diligent social efforts of all kinds mr greg was an energetic member of the circle at manchester richard cobden was another which at this time pushed on educational sanitary and political improvements all over that important district he fully shared the new spirit of independence and selfassertion that began to animate the commercial and manufacturing classes in the north of england at the time of the reform bill it took a still more definite and resolute shape in the great struggle ten years later for the repeal of the corn laws it is among these classes he said in a speech in 1841 that the onward movements of society have generally had their origin it is among them that new discoveries in political and moral science have invariably found the readiest acceptance and the cause of peace civilisation and sound national morality has been more indebted to their humble but enterprising labours than to the measures of the most sagacious statesman or the teachings of the wisest moralist  in 1835 mr greg married the daughter of dr henry an eminent physician in manchester and honourably known to the wider world of science by contributions to the chemistry of gases that were in their day both ingenious and useful two years after his marriage he offered himself as a candidate for the parliamentary representation of lancaster he was much too scrupulous for that exceedingly disreputable borough and was beaten by a great majority in 1841 the health of his wife made it desirable to seek a purer air than that of the factory district and in the spring of 1842 they settled in a charming spot at the foot of wansfellthe hill that rises to the southeast above ambleside and was sung by wordsworth in one of his latest sonnets      wansfell this household has a favoured lot     living with liberty on thee to gaze     to watch while morn first crowns thee with her rays     or when along thy breast securely float     evenings angelic clouds                              when we are gone     from every object dear to mortal sight     as soon we shall be may these words attest     how oft to elevate our spirits shone     thy visionary majesties of light     how in thy pensive glooms our hearts found rest  such a step had long been in his mind from naples when on the threshold of active life he had written february 6 1832    i am becoming more and more anxious to realise a   competence speedily every time i look to the future and   reflect on the true objects of life and the likeliest means   of procuring them i am desirous to be able to realise   the projects i have formed before the age of feeling and   acting be past and before the energy of youth has been   evaporated by long repression life and talents and   desires were not given me to be wasted in a situation   where the power of doing good is at best very limited   and where that of acquiring the higher kinds of knowledge   and enjoying the best gifts of life is still more   confined  the nearer prospect of the world of business and actual contact with it made no change in the perpetual refrain    i wonder he writes may 15 1833 how long philosophy   or indecision will induce to continue the dogs life i am   leading here i never open a book but shun them as if   they were poison rise at halfpast five oclock go to bed   at ten and toil like a galley slave all day willy nilly   man labours for the meat which perisheth and the food   which satisfieth not  the move to the lakes though it enriched his lite with many delicious hours and gave him leisure for thought and composition yet seems to have led directly to commercial difficulties at first he spent alternate weeks at bury and at wansfell and for a little time he even removed to macclesfield but business fell by insensible degrees into the second place mr gregs temperament moreover was too sanguine in practical affairs as cobdens was and we might almost gather from his writings that he had not that faculty of sustained attention to details which is the pith and marrow of success in such a business as his at last the crash came in 1850 three years before this the health of his brother samuel had broken down and william greg added the management of his affairs to his own the strain was too great and a long struggle ended in defeat both mills were closed and the forty thousand pounds of capital with which mr greg had begun business were almost entirely swept away at the age of fortyone he was called upon to begin life afresh the elasticity of his mind proved equal to all the demands upon it and they were severe the illness of his wife cast the shadow of a terrible cloud over his house and for long periods it was deprived of a mother and he of a companion yet amid these sore anxieties and heavy depressions he never lost either his fortitude or what is much rarer than fortitude that delicate and watchful consideration for others which is one of the most endearing of human characteristics when he was twenty years younger he had written of himself to one of his sisters january 14 1830    nature never cut me out for a happy man for my   mind is so constituted as to create difficulties and sorrows   where i do not find them and to strive with and overcome   them when i meet them i am never so happy as   in times of difficulty and danger and excitement and i   am afraid my line of life will furnish me with but few of   these times so that i shall remain in the ground like the   seed of a strong plant which has never found the soil or   the atmosphere necessary for its germination  the judgment was not an unjust one and the apprehension that life would bring too few difficulties was superfluous as most of us find it to be when the difficulties came he confronted them with patient stoicism his passionate love of natural beauty was solace and nourishment to him during the fifteen years of his sojourn in that taking happy region of silver lake and green mountain slope he had many congenial neighbours of wordsworth he saw little the poet was in external manner and habit too much of the peasant for gregs intellectual fastidiousness he called on one occasion at rydal mount and wordsworth who had been regravelling his little gardenwalks would talk of nothing but gravel its various qualities and their respective virtues the fine and subtle understanding of hartley coleridge his lively fancy his literature his easy play of mind made him a more sympathetic companion for a man of letters than his great neighbour of him mr greg saw a good deal until his death in 18496 southey was still lingering at greta hall but it was death in life he cherished and fondled the books in his beloved library as if they had been children and moved mechanically to and fro in that mournful dream from which the sufferer can neither wake nor be awakened southeys example might perhaps have been a warning to the newcomer how difficult it is to preserve a clear healthy and serviceable faculty of thinking about public affairs without close and constant contact with those who are taking the lead in them7 there was a lesson for the cassandra of a later day in the picture of southey when mrs fletcher took tea with him in 1833  footnote 6 hartley coleridge must in mr gregs case have overcome one of his prepossessions i dont like cotton manufacturers much nor merchants over much cobden seems to be a good kind of fellow but i wish he were not a cottonspinner i rather respect him im always on the side of the poor  footnote 7 i do not forget the interesting passage in mills autobiography pp 262 263 where he contends that by means of the regular receipt of newspapers and periodicals a political writer who lives many hundreds of miles from the chief seat of the politics of his country is kept au courant of even the most temporary politics and is able to acquire a more correct view of the state and progress of opinion than he could acquire by personal contact with individuals    i never saw any one she said whose mind was in so   morbid a state as that of this excellent poet and amiable   man on the subject of the present political aspect of   affairs in england he is utterly desponding he believes   the downfall of the church and the subversion of all law   and government is at hand for in spite of all our   endeavours to steer clear of politics he slid unconsciously   into the subject and proclaimed his belief that the ruin   of all that was sacred and venerable was impending8  footnote 8 autobiography p 214  the condition say of bury in lancashire at that time contrasted with its condition today is the adequate answer to these dreary vaticinations  one resident of the lake district was as energetic and hopeful as southey was despondent this was harriet martineau whom mr greg first introduced to the captivating beauty of westmoreland and whom he induced in 1850 to settle there other friendsthe speddings the arnolds at fox how the davys at ambleside the fletchers at lancriggformed a delightful circle all within tolerably easy reach and affording a haven of kind and nourishing companionship but for a thinker upon the practical aspects of political and social science it was all too far from      labour in the deep midocean wind and wave and oar  for during these years mr greg did not handle merely the abstract principles of politics and sociology a very scanty livelihood would have come by that way he discussed the men measures and events of the day and most of what strikes one as unsatisfactory in the discussion is probably due to a want of that close observation of facts which was hardly possible to a student on the shores of windermere on the other hand it is still more certain that it was in these meditative scenes that the germs were ripened of those grave ingenious and affecting speculations which afterwards came to their full growth in the enigmas of lifeto most of us by so much the most interesting of all its authors performances his notebook shows that the thoughts that are suggested in this short but important volume were springing up in his mind for years and that it touches the problems that were most constantly present to him in his best moments it was during his residence at windermere that he worked out and published 1851 his memorable book on the creed of christendom it is enough here to remind ourselves how serious a place is held by that work in the dissolvent literature of the generation the present writer was at oxford in the last three years of the decade in which it appeared and can well recall the share that it had along with mansels bampton lectures and other books on both sides in shaking the fabric of early beliefs in some of the most active minds then in the university the landmarks have so shifted within the last twenty years that the creed of christendom is now comparatively orthodox but in those days it was a remarkable proof of intellectual courage and independence to venture on introducing to the english public the best results of german theological criticism with fresh applications from an original mind since then the floods have broken loose one may add that mr gregs speculations show as hume and smaller men than hume had shown before how easily scepticism in theology allies itself with the fastidious and aristocratic sentiment in politics  as was to be expected under the circumstances much of mr gregs time was given to merely fugitive articles on books or groups of passing events even the slightest of them so far as they are known to me show conscience and work in 1852 for example he wrote no less than twelve articles for the four leading quarterlies of that date they were with one exception all on political or economical subjects highland destitution and irish emigration investments for the working classes the modern exodusthese were not themes to be dealt with by the facile journalist standing on one foot mr greg always showed the highest conception of the functions and the obligations of the writer who addresses the public in however ephemeral a form on topics of social importance no article of his ever showed a trace either of slipshod writing or of makebelieve and perfunctory thinking to compose between four and five hundred pages like these on a variety of grave subjects all needing to be carefully prepared and systematically thought out was no inconsiderable piece of work for a single pen the strain was severe for there was insufficient stimulus from outside and insufficient refreshment within his own home long days of study were followed by solitary evening walks on the heights or lonely sailing on the lake in time visits to london became more frequent and he got closer to the world once a year he went to paris and he paid more than one visit to de tocqueville at his home in normandy i remember that he told me once how surprised and disappointed he was by the indifference of public men even the giants like peel to anything like general views and abstract principles of politics or society they listened to such views with reasonable interest but only as matters lying quite apart from their own business in the world the statesman who pleased him best and with whom he found most common ground was sir george cornewall lewis  like most men of letters who happen to be blessed or cursed with a prudential conscience mr greg was haunted by the uncertainty of his vocation he dreaded as he expressed it to depend on so precarious a thing as a brain always in thinking order in every other profession there is much that can be done by deputy or that does itself or is little more than routine and the mechanical in letters alone if the brain be not in working order all is lost in 1856 sir cornewall lewis who was then chancellor of the exchequer offered greg a place on the board of customs and he accepted it yet as he said he did so with some loathing and great misgiving five years earlier he would have entered upon it with eagerness but in five years he was conscious of having made sad progress in that philosophy whose root is idleness indulged freedom and increasing years to james spedding he wrote on the 24th of may 1856    my position every one but myself seems to think   most enviable i contrast lower thames street with the   craig and my heart sinks into my shoes the attendance   is onerous the actual work is not it seems to be   a place wherein a man may grow old comfortably there   is a good salary nominally Â£1200 and a liberal retiring   allowance when you are worked out a board every   dayexcept for two months holiday varied only by   occasional tours of inspectionsounds horrible slavery   to a man accustomed to wander at his own free will   and finally at my time of my life i have an indefinable   dislike to anything involving a total change of life and   habits en revanche i have a provision for old age and   for my family and shall be almost as glad to be spared   the necessity of writing for breadfor butter at leastas   sorry to be tied out from scribbling when and where   the spirit moves me    my last quarters labours are an article on america   in the national and on montalembert in the edinburgh   and one on macaulay in the north briton of which i am   not proud froudes history i have not yet seen i hope   now as i write less i shall have more time for reading   it seems to be somewhat paradoxical by the way is   not carlyle sadly gone off i met him the other day   and he did nothing but blaspheme and pour out a torrent   of bad language against blackguards fools and devils   that was appalling to listen to  on the whole when the time came his new employment brought him moderate interests of its own what may be called the literary part of the work such as the drawing up of reports naturally fell into his hands the necessity of working with other people which does not always come easily to men accustomed to the isolation and independence of their own libraries he found an agreeable novelty still he was not sorry when at the end of 1864 the chance came to him of a move to the stationery office here he was the head of a department and not merely a member of a board and the regulation of his hours fell more into his own hands  from the time when he came to london until his death five and twenty years later november 1881 his life was for the most part without any incident in which the world can have an interest he formed many acquaintances according to the cheerful and hospitable fashion of london and he made a number of warm and attached friends in 1873 his wife died in the following year he married a daughter of mr james wilson well known as the fellowworker of cobden and bright in the agitation against the corn laws and as finance minister in india where he sank under the cares of his office in 1860 mr wilson had been gregs intimate friend from the days of the league down to the time of his death when by and by mr greg retired from his post as controller 1877 he wrote    for myself since i gave up office i feel comparatively   and indeed positively in haven and peace and with   much and rather unusual brightness and sunshine round   me and with my interest in the world both speculative   and practical quite undiminished and finding old age on   the whole cheerful and quiet and the position of a spectator   by no means an unenviable one  this was his attitude to the end a heavy shock fell upon him in the death of his brotherinlaw walter bagehot 1877 that brilliant original well known to so many of us who saw events and books and men with so curious an eye    he was quite a unique man mr greg wrote to lady   derby as irreplaceable in private life as he is universally   felt to be in public he had the soundest head i ever   knew since cornewall lewis left us curiously original   yet without the faintest taint of crotchetiness or prejudice   or passion which so generally mars originality then   he was highminded and a gentleman to the backbone the   man of all i knew both mentally and morally best worth   talking things over with and i was besides deeply attached   to him personally we had been intimates and collaborateurs   in many lines for twentyfive years so that altogether   there is a great piece gone out of my daily life and   a great stay alsothe greatest in fact there is no man   living who was taken all in all so much of me  there is a pensive grace about one of his last letters to the widow of the favourite brother of earlier days    i cannot let christmas pass dear mary without sending   you a word of love and greeting from us both to all   of you of both generations it cannot be a merry   christmas for any of us exactly there is so much around   that is anxious and sad and indeed almost gloomy and   life is passing away to our juniors but we have still   much to make us thankful and even happy and as a   whole life to those whom it concerns much more than to   us to most of them at least is reasonably cheerful at   least they are young and vigorous and have pluck to face   the battle of years to come we have little to do now   but watch and sympathise and give what little help we   can  gregs own departure was not much longer deferred he died in november 1881  he was not one of the fortunate beings who can draw on a spontaneous and inexhaustible fund of geniality and high spirits he had a craving both for stimulation and for sympathy hence he belonged to those who are always happier in the society of women than of men in his case this choice was not due as it so often is to a love of procuring deference cheaply it was not deference that he sought but a sympathy that he could make sure of and that put him at his ease nobody that ever lived was less of a pedant academic don or loud sir oracle he was easy to live with a gay and appreciative companion and the most amiable of friends but nothing was further from his thoughts than to pose as guide and philosopher his conversation was particularly neat and pointed he had a lucidity of phrase such as is more common in french society than among ourselves the vice of small talk and the sin of prosing he was equally free from and if he did not happen to be interested he had a great gift of silence  the grace of humility is one of the supreme moral attractions in a man its outward signs are not always directly discernible and it may exist underneath marked intrepidity confidence in ones own judgment and even a strenuous push for the honours of the world but without humility no veracity there is a genuine touch of it in a letter which greg wrote to a friend who had consented to be the guardian of his children    i have no directions as to their education to give   i have too strong a sense of the value of religion myself   not to wish that my children should have so much of it   i speak of feeling not of creed as is compatible with   reason i have no ambition for them and can only   further say in the dying words of julie nen faites point   des savansfaitesen des hommes bienfaisans et justes   if they are this they will be more than their father ever   was and all he ever desired to be  this sentiment of the unprofitable servant was deep in his natureas it may well be in all who are not either blinded by inborn fatuity or condemned by natural poverty of mind to low and gross ideals   though he took great delight in the enchanted land of pure literature apart from all utility yet he was of those the fibres of whose nature makes it impossible for them to find real intellectual interest outside of what is of actual and present concern to their fellows composition again had to him none of the pain and travail that it brings to most writers the expression came with the thought his ideas were never vague and needed no laborious translation along with them came apt words and the finished sentence yet his fluency never ran off into the fatal channels of verbosity ease clearness precision and a certain smooth and surepaced consecutiveness made his written style for all purposes of statement and exposition one of the most telling and effective of his day this gift of expression helped him always to appear intellectually at his best it really came from a complete grasp of his own side of the case and that always produces the best style next after a complete grasp of both sides few men go into the troubled region of pamphleteering articlewriting public controversy and incessant dialectics without suffering a deterioration of character in consequence mr greg must be set down as one of these few he never fell into the habitual disputants vice of trying to elude the force of a fair argument he did not mix up his own personality in the defence of his thesis differences in argument and opinion produced not only no rancour but even no soreness  the epicurean element was undoubtedly strong in him he liked pleasant gardens set a high value on leisure and even vacuity did not disdain novels and had the sense to prefer good wine to bad when he travelled in later life he showed none of the overpraised desire to acquire information for informations sake while his companions were getting up the pyramids or antiquities in the troad or the great tomb of alyattis mr greg refused to take any trouble to form views or to pretend to find a sure footing among the shifting sands of archÃ¦ological or prehistoric research he chose to lie quietly among the ruins and let the beauty and wonder of the ancient world float silently about him for this poetic indolence he had a great faculty to a younger friend whom he suspected of unwholesome excess of strenuousness he once propounded this test of mental health could you sit for a whole day on the banks of a stream doing nothing and thinking of nothing only throwing stones into the water  the ascetic view of things was wholly distasteful to him he had a simple way of taking what was bright and enjoyable in life refusing to allow anything but very distinct duty to interfere with the prompt acceptance of the gifts of the gods yet as very seldom happens in natures thus composed he was before all things unselfish that is to say he struck those who knew him best as less of a centre to himself than most other people are though thoroughly capable of strong and persistent wishes and as far as possible from having a character of faint outlines and pale colours it came to him quite naturally and without an effort to think of those for whom he cared and of himself not at all there was something of the child of nature in him though nobody liked the fruits of cultivated life betterorder neatness and grace in all daily thingsyet nobody was more ready to make short work of conventionalities that might thrust shadows between him or others and the substance of happiness  it would be difficult for me here to examine mr gregs writings with perfect freedom and appropriateness the man rather than the author has prompted this short sketch his books tell their own story there is not one of them that does not abound in suggestion both in politics and in subjects where there is more room for free meditation and the subtler qualities of mind than politics can ever afford mr greg is not one of the thinkers whom we can place in any school still less in any party it may be safely said of him that he never took up an idea or an opinion as most writers even of high repute are not afraid of doing simply because it was proffered to him or because it was held by others with whom in a general way he was disposed to agree he did not even shrink from what looked like selfcontradiction so honest was his feeling for truth and so little faith had he in the infallibility of sect and the trustworthiness of system in the enigmas of life 1875 there is much that is hard to reconcile with his own fundamental theology and he was quite aware of it he was content with the thought that he had found fragments of true ore hence the extraordinary difficulty of classifying him one would be inclined to place him as a theist yet can we give any other name but agnostic to a man who speaks in such terms as these    i cannot for a moment not believe in a supreme   being and i cannot for a moment doubt that his arrangement   must be right and wise and benevolent but i   cannot also for a moment feel confident in any doctrines   or opinions i could form on this great question9  the same impossibility of classification meets us in his politics he was certainly in a philosophic sense a conservative he was antipopular and antidemocratic yet he was an ardent champion of the popular and democratic principle of nationalities he was all for the greeks and bulgarians against the turks and all for the hungarians and italians against the austrians10 nor had he any sympathy with the old ordering of society as such he had no zeal as far as one can see for an hereditary peerage and an established church he threw himself into the memorable battle of the reform bill of 1832 with characteristic spirit and energy his ideal like that of most literary thinkers on politics was an aristocracy not of caste but of education virtue and public spirit it was the old dream of lofty minds from plato down to turgot every page of gregs political writing is coloured by this attractive vision though as anxious as any politician of his time for practical improvements and as liberal in his conception of their scope and possibility he insisted that they could only be brought about by an aristocracy of intellect and virtue11 but then the great controversy turns on the best means of securing sense and probity in a government the democrat holds that under representative institutions the best security for the interests of the mass of the community is that the mass shall have a voice in their own affairs and that in proportion as that security is narrowed and weakened the interests of the mass will be subordinate to those of the class that has a decisive voice mr greg had no faith in the good issues of this rough and spontaneous play of social forces the extension of the suffrage in 1867 seemed to him to be the ruin of representative institutions and when that was capped by the ballot in 1872 the cup of his dismay was full perhaps he went on to say some degree of safety might be found by introducing the ballot inside the house of commons de tocqueville wrote mr greg a long and interesting letter in 1853 which is well worth reading today in connection with scrutin de liste and the ballot12 de tocqueville was for both he was as has been said an aristocrat who accepted his defeat and he tried to make the best of democracy greg fought against the enemy to the last and clung to every device for keeping out the deluge he could not get on to common ground with those who believe that education is no sort of guarantee for political competency that no class however wise and good can be safely trusted with the interests of other classes and finally that great social and economic currents cannot be checked or even guided by select political oligarchies on whatever base any such oligarchy may rest  footnote 9 to the rev e white  footnote 10 when the hungarian exiles were in england writes professor f w newman he was not too rich nor had i any close relations with him but he voluntarily gave me ten pounds for any service to them which i judged best  footnote 11 see his two volumes of reprinted articles essays on political and social science 1853  footnote 12 correspondence vol ii pp 212220  lord greys prescription for correcting the practical faults revealed by experience in our present system of representation consisted of the following ingredientsthe cumulative vote not fewer than three seats to each constituency universities and some other constituencies necessarily consisting of educated men to have increased representation a limited number of life members to be introduced into the house of commons the vacancies to be filled when not less than three had occurred by cumulative vote within the house itself on all this mr greg wrote to lord grey may 28 1874 i quite agree with you that this impending danger we both foresee might be averted if our country would listen either to you or to me  tenderness for these truly idle devices for keeping power in the hands of a restricted class was all the less to be expected in mr greg as he had made a serious study of french politics prior to 1848 now the monarchy of july maintained a narrow and exclusive franchise and its greatest minister was the very type of the class from whom mr greg would have sought the directors of national affairs if ever there was a statesman who approached the fulfilment of mr gregs conditions it was guizot guizot had undergone years of patient historic study nobody of his time had reflected more carefully on the causes and forces of great movements he had more of what is called the calm philosophic mind than any one then eminent in literature he overflowed with what mr greg describes as the highest kind of wisdom his moral pretensions were austere lofty and unbending to a fault no man of any time would seem to have been better entitled to a place among the wise and the good whom nations ought to seek out to rule over them yet this great man was one of the very worst statesmen that ever governed france the severe morality of the student was cast behind him by the minister he did not even shrink from defending from considerations of political convenience the malversations of a colleague the pattern of wisdom and goodness devised and executed a cynical and vile intrigue from which sir robert walpole would have shrunk with masculine disgust and that would have raised scruples in dubois or calonne finally this famous professor of political science possessed so little skill in political practice that a few years of his policy wrecked a constitution and brought a dynasty to the ground  all these political regrets and doubts however cannot lessen or affect our interest in those ingenious subtle and delicate speculations which mr greg called enigmas of life though his creed of christendom may have made a more definite and recognisable mark the later book rapidly fell in with the needs of many minds stirred much controversy of a useful and harmonious kind and attracted serious curiosity to a wider variety of problems it is at this moment in its fifteenth edition the chapters on malthus and on the nonsurvival of the fittest make a very genuine and original contribution to modern thought but it is the later essays in the little volume that touched most readers and will for long continue to touch them they are as far as possible from being vague or misty or aimless yet they have what is so curiously rare in english literature the charm of reverie as the author said they contain rather suggested thoughts that may fructify in other minds than distinct propositions which it is sought argumentatively to prove they have the ever seductive note of meditation and inwardness which when it sounds true as it assuredly did here moves the spirit like a divine music there is none of the thunder of carlyle which for that matter one may easily come in time to find prodigiously useless and unedifying there is not the piercing concentrated ray of emerson but the complaints the misgivings the aspirations of our generation find in certain pages of mr gregs book a voice of mingled fervour and recueillement a union of contemplative reason with spiritual sensibility which makes them one of the best expressions of one of the highest moods of this bewildered time they are in the true key for religious or spiritual composition as rousseaus savoyard vicar is thought and emotion are fused without the decorations of misplaced rhetoric that meditations so stamped with sincerity and so honestly directed to the actual perplexities of thoughtful people should have met with wide and grateful acceptance is no more than might have been expected least of all can their fine qualities be underrated even by those who like the present writer believe that ponder these great enigmas as we may we shall never get beyond goethes
