           virg Æneid                            the conquest of granada   this playfor the two parts only constitute an entire drama betwixt themseems to have been a favourite with dryden as well as with the public in the essay upon heroic plays as well as in the dedication the character of almanzor is dwelt upon with that degree of complacency which an author experiences in analyzing a successful effort of his genius unquestionably the gross improbability of a hero by his single arm turning the tide of battle as he lists did not appear so shocking in the age of dryden as in ours there is no doubt that while personal strength and prowess were of more consequence than military skill and conduct the feats of a single man were sometimes sufficient to determine the fate of an engagement more especially when exerted by a knight sheathed in complete mail against the heartless and halfarmed mass which constituted the feudal infantry those who have perused barbours history of robert bruce geoffrey de vinsaufs account of the wars of richard coeur de lion or even the battles detailed by froissart and joinville are familiar with instances of breaches defended and battles decided by the prowess of a single arm the leader of a feudal army was expected by his followers not only to point out the path to victory but to lead the way in person it is true that the military art had been changed in this particular long before the days of dryden complete armour was generally laid aside firearms had superseded the use of the lance and battleaxe and above all the universal institution of standing armies had given discipline and military skill their natural and decisive superiority over untaught strength and enthusiastic valour but the memory of what had been was still familiar to the popular mind and preserved not only by numerous legends and traditions but also by the cast of the fashionable works of fiction it is indeed curious to remark how many minute remnants of a system of ancient manners can be traced long after it has become totally obsolete even down to the eighteenth century the portrait of every soldier of rank was attired in complete armour though perhaps he never saw a suit of mail excepting in the tower of london and on the same principle of prescriptive custom addison was the first poet who ventured to celebrate a victorious general for skill and conduct instead of such feats as are appropriated to guy of warwick or bevis of hampton the fashion of attributing mighty effects to individual valour being thus prevalent even in circumstances when every one knew the supposition to be entirely gratuitous the same principle with much greater propriety continued to be applied in works of fiction where the scene was usually carried back to times in which the personal strength of a champion really had some efficacy it must be owned however that the authors of the french romances carried the influence of individual strength and courage beyond all bounds of modesty and reason in the grand cyrus artamenes upon a moderate computation exterminates with his own hand in the course of the work at least a hundred thousand fighting men these monstrous fictions however constituted the amusement of the young and the gay1 in the age of charles ii and from one of these very books dryden admits his having drawn at least in part the character of his moorish warrior the public was therefore every way familiarised with such chivalrous exploits as those of almanzor and if they did not altogether command the belief at least they did not revolt the imagination of an audience and this must certainly be admitted as a fair apology for the extravagance of his heroic achievements  but it is not only the actual effects of almanzors valour which appear to us unnatural but also the extraordinary principles and motives by which those exertions are guided here also we must look back to the gothic romances and to those of scudery and calprenede in fact the extravagance of sentiment is no less necessary than the extravagance of achievement to constitute a true knight errant and such is almanzor honour and love were the sole deities worshipped by this extraordinary race who though their memory and manners are preserved chiefly in works of fiction did once exist in real life and actually conducted armies and governed kingdoms upon principles as strained and hyperbolical as those of the moorish champion if almanzor at the command of his mistress aids his hated rival to the destruction of his own hopes he only discharges the duty of a good knight who was bound to sacrifice himself and all his hopes and wishes at the slightest command of her to whom he had vowed his service and who in the language of chivalry was to him as the soul is to the body the reader may recollect the memorable invasion of england by james iv of scotland in which he hazarded and actually lost his own life and the flower of his nobility because the queen of france who called him her knight had commanded him to march three miles on english ground for her sake  less can be said to justify the extravagant language in which almanzor threatens his enemies and vaunts his own importance this is not common in the heroes of romance who are usually as remarkable for their modesty of language as for their prowess and still more seldom does in real life a vainglorious boaster vindicate by his actions the threats of his tongue it is true that men of a fervent and glowing character are apt to strain their speech beyond the modesty of ordinary conversation and display in their language the fire which glows in their bosoms but the subject of their effusions is usually connected not with their own personal qualities or feats but with some extraneous object of their pursuit or admiration thus the burst of hotspur concerning the pursuit of honour paints his enthusiastic character but it would be hard to point out a passage indicating that exuberant confidence in his own prowess and contempt of every one else so liberally exhibited by almanzor instances of this defect are but too thickly sown through the piece for example the following rant    if from thy hands alone my death can be   i am immortal and a god to thee   if i would kill thee now thy fates so low   that i must stoop ere i can give the blow   but mine is fixed so far above thy crown   that all thy men   piled on thy back can never pull it down   but at my ease thy destiny i send   by ceasing from this hour to be thy friend   like heaven i need but only to stand still   and not concurring to thy life i kill   thou canst no title to my duty bring   i am not thy subject and my souls thy king   farewell when i am gone   theres not a star of thine dare stay with thee   ill whistle thy tame fortune after me   and whirl fate with me wheresoeer i fly   as winds drive storms before them in the sky  this curious passage did not escape the malicious criticism of settle who besides noticing the extravagant egotism of the hero questions with some probability whether abdalla would have chosen to scale almanzors fate at the risque of the personal consequences of having all his men piled on his own back in the same scene almanzor is so unreasonable as to tell his rival    thou shalt not dare   to be so impudent as to despair  and again    what are ten thousand subjects such as they   if i am scorned ill take myself away  drydens apology for these extravagancies seems to be that almanzor is in a passion but although talking nonsense is a common effect of passion it seems hardly one of those consequences adapted to shew forth the character of a hero in theatrical representation  it must be owned however that although the part of almanzor contains these and other bombastic passages there are many also which convey what the poet desired to representthe aspirations of a mind so heroic as almost to surmount the bonds of society and even the very laws of the universe leaving us often in doubt whether the vehemence of the wish does not even disguise the impossibility of its accomplishment    good heaven thy book of fate before me lay   but to tear out the journal of this day   or if the order of the world below   will not the gap of one whole day allow   give me that minute when she made her vow   that minute even the happy from their bliss might give   and those who live in grief a shorter time would live   so small a link if broke the eternal chain   would like divided waters join again   it wonnot be the fugitive is gone   pressed by the crowd of following minutes on   that precious moments out of nature fled   and in the heap of common rubbish laid   of things that once have been and now decayed  in the less inflated parts the ideas are usually as just as ingenious and beautiful for example    no there is a necessity in fate   why still the brave bold man is fortunate   he keeps his object ever full in sight   and that assurance holds him firm and right   true tis a narrow path that leads to bliss                  but right before there is no precipice                        fear makes men look aside and then their footing miss       the character of almanzor is well known as the original of drawcansir in the rehearsal into whose mouth parodies of some of drydens most extravagant flights have been put by the duke of buckingham shaftesbury also whose family had smarted under drydens satire attempts to trace the applause bestowed on the conquest of granada to what he calls the correspondence and relation between our royal theatre and popular circus or beargarden for in the former of these assemblys tis undeniable that at least the two upper regions or galleries contain such spectators as indifferently frequent each place of sport so that tis no wonder we hear such applause resounded on the victories of an almanzor when the same parties had possibly no later than the day before bestowed their applause as freely on the victorious butcher the hero of another stage miscellaneous reflections miscell 5  the other personages of the drama sink into lilliputians beside the gigantic almanzor although the under plot of the loves of ozmyn and benzayda is beautiful in itself and ingeniously managed the virtuous almahide is a fit object for the adoration of almanzor but her husband is a poor pageant of royalty as for lyndaraxa her repeated and unparalleled treachery can only be justified by the extreme imbecility of her lovers  the plot of the play is in part taken from history during the last years of its existence granada the poor remnant of the moorish empire in spain was torn to pieces with intestine discord and assailed without by the sword of the christians the history of the civil wars of granada affirmed to be translated into spanish from the arabian gives a romantic but not altogether fabulous account of their discord but a romance in the french taste called almahide seems to have been the chief source from which our author drew his plot  in the conduct of the story there is much brilliancy of event the reader or spectator is never allowed to repose on the scene before him and although the changes of fortune are too rapid to be either probable or altogether pleasing yet they arrest the attention by their splendour and importance and interest us in spite of our more sober judgment the introduction of the ghost of almanzors mother seems to have been intended to shew how the hero could support even an interview with an inhabitant of the other world at least the professed purpose of her coming might have been safely trusted to the virtue of almahide and her power over her lover it afforded an opportunity however to throw in some fine poetry of which dryden has not failed to avail himself were it not a peculiar attribute of the heroic drama it might be mentioned as a defect that during the siege of the last possession of the spanish moors by an enemy hated for his religion and for his success the principle of patriotism is hardly once alluded to through the whole piece the fate or the wishes of almahide lyndaraxa and benzayda are all that interest the moorish warriors around them as if the christian was not thundering at their gates to exterminate at once their nation and religion indeed so essentially necessary are the encouragements of beauty to military achievement that we find queen isabella ordering to the field of battle a corps de reserve of her maids of honour to animate the fighting warriors with their smiles and counteract the powerful charms of the moorish damsels nor is it an inferior fault that although the characters are called moors there is scarce any expression or allusion which can fix the readers attention upon their locality except an occasional interjection to alha or mahomet  if however the reader can abstract his mind from the qualities now deemed essential to a play and consider the conquest of granada as a piece of romantic poetry there are few compositions in the english language which convey a more lively and favourable display of the magnificence of fable of language and of action proper to that style of composition amid the splendid ornaments of the structure we lose sight of occasional disproportion and incongruity and at an early age particularly there are few poems which make a more deep impression upon the imagination than the conquest of granada  the two parts of this drama were brought out in the same season probably in winter 1669 or spring 1670 they were received with such applause that langbaine conceives their success to have been the occasion of drydens undervaluing his predecessors in dramatic writing the conquest of granada was not printed till 1672   footnote 1 there is something ludicrous in the idea of a beauty or a    gallant of that gay and licentious court poring over a work of    five or six folio volumes by way of amusement but such was the    taste of the age that fynes morison in his precepts to    travellers can think no book better for his pupils discourse    than amadis of gaule for the knights errant and the ladies of    court do therein exchange courtly speeches                                       to                            his royal highness                                   the                                 duke1   sir  heroic poesy has always been sacred to princes and to heroes thus virgil inscribed his Æneids to augustus cæsar and of latter ages tasso and ariosto dedicated their poems to the house of este it is indeed but justice that the most excellent and most profitable kind of writing should be addressed by poets to such persons whose characters have for the most part been the guides and patterns of their imitation and poets while they imitate instruct the feigned hero inflames the true and the dead virtue animates the living since therefore the world is governed by precept and example and both these can only have influence from those persons who are above us that kind of poesy which excites to virtue the greatest men is of the greatest use to human kind  it is from this consideration that i have presumed to dedicate to your royal highness these faint representations of your own worth and valour in heroick poetry or to speak more properly not to dedicate but to restore to you those ideas which in the more perfect part of my characters i have taken from you heroes may lawfully be delighted with their own praises both as they are farther incitements to their virtue and as they are the highest returns which mankind can make them for it  and certainly if ever nation were obliged either by the conduct the personal2 valour or the good fortune of a leader the english are acknowledging in all of them to your royal highness your whole life has been a continued series of heroick actions which you began so early that you were no sooner named in the world but it was with praise and admiration even the first blossoms of your youth paid us all that could be expected from a ripening manhood while you practised but the rudiments of war you outwent all other captains and have since found none to surpass but yourself alone the opening of your glory was like that of light you shone to us from afar and disclosed your first beams on distant nations yet so that the lustre of them was spread abroad and reflected brightly on your native country you were then an honour to it when it was a reproach to itself when the fortunate usurper sent his arms to flanders many of the adverse party were vanquished by your fame ere they tried your valour3 the report of it drew over to your ensigns whole troops and companies of converted rebels and made them forsake successful wickedness to follow an oppressed and exiled virtue your reputation waged war with the enemies of your royal family even within their trenches and the more obstinate or more guilty of them were forced to be spies over those whom they commanded lest the name of york should disband that army in whose fate it was to defeat the spaniards and force dunkirk to surrender yet those victorious forces of the rebels were not able to sustain your arms where you charged in person you were a conqueror it is true they afterwards recovered courage and wrested that victory from others which they had lost to you and it was a greater action for them to rally than it was to overcome thus by the presence of your royal highness the english on both sides remained victorious and that army which was broken by your valour became a terror to those for whom they conquered then it was that at the cost of other nations you informed and cultivated that valour which was to defend your native country and to vindicate its honour from the insolence of our encroaching neighbours when the hollanders not contented to withdraw themselves from the obedience which they owed their lawful sovereign affronted those by whose charity they were first protected and being swelled up to a preeminence of trade by a supine negligence on our side and a sordid parsimony on their own dared to dispute the sovereignty of the seas the eyes of three nations were then cast upon you and by the joint suffrage of king and people you were chosen to revenge their common injuries to which though you had an undoubted title by your birth you had a greater by your courage neither did the success deceive our hopes and expectations the most glorious victory which was gained by our navy in that war was in the first engagement wherein even by the confession of our enemies who ever palliate their own losses and diminish our advantages your absolute triumph was acknowledged you conquered at the hague as entirely as at london and the return of a shattered fleet without an admiral left not the most impudent among them the least pretence for a false bonfire or a dissembled day of public thanksgiving all our achievements against them afterwards though we sometimes conquered and were never overcome were but a copy of that victory and they still fell short of their original somewhat of fortune was ever wanting to fill up the title of so absolute a defeat or perhaps the guardian angel of our nation was not enough concerned when you were absent and would not employ his utmost vigour for a less important stake than the life and honour of a royal admiral  and if since that memorable day4 you have had leisure to enjoy in peace the fruits of so glorious a reputation it was occasion only has been wanting to your courage for that can never be wanting to occasion the same ardour still incites you to heroick actions and the same concernment for all the interests of your king and brother continues to give you restless nights and a generous emulation for your own glory you are still meditating on new labours for yourself and new triumphs for the nation and when our former enemies again provoke us you will again solicit fate to provide you another navy to overcome and another admiral to be slain you will then lead forth a nation eager to revenge their past injuries and like the romans inexorable to peace till they have fully vanquished let our enemies make their boast of a surprise5 as the samnities did of a successful stratagem but the furcæ caudinæ will never be forgiven till they are revenged i have always observed in your royal highness an extreme concernment for the honour of your country it is a passion common to you with a brother the most excellent of kings and in your two persons are eminent the characters which homer has given us of heroick virtue the commanding part in agamemnon and the executive in achilles and i doubt not from both your actions but to have abundant matter to fill the annals of a glorious reign and to perform the part of a just historian to my royal master without intermixing with it any thing of the poet  in the mean time while your royal highness is preparing fresh employments for our pens i have been examining my own forces and making trial of myself how i shall be able to transmit you to posterity i have formed a hero i confess not absolutely perfect but of an excessive and overboiling courage but homer and tasso are my precedents both the greek and the italian poet had well considered that a tame hero who never transgresses the bounds of moral virtue would shine but dimly in an epic poem the strictness of those rules might well give precepts to the reader but would administer little of occasion to the writer but a character of an eccentrick virtue is the more exact image of human life because he is not wholly exempted from its frailties such a person is almanzor whom i present with all humility to the patronage of your royal highness i designed in him a roughness of character impatient of injuries and a confidence of himself almost approaching to an arrogance but these errors are incident only to great spirits they are moles and dimples which hinder not a face from being beautiful though that beauty be not regular they are of the number of those amiable imperfections which we see in mistresses and which we pass over without a strict examination when they are accompanied with greater graces and such in almanzor are a frank and noble openness of nature an easiness to forgive his conquered enemies and to protect them in distress and above all an inviolable faith in his affection  this sir i have briefly shadowed to your royal highness that you may not be ashamed of that hero whose protection you undertake neither would i dedicate him to so illustrious a name if i were conscious to myself that he did or said any thing which was wholly unworthy of it however since it is not just that your royal highness should defend or own what possibly may be my error i bring before you this accused almanzor in the nature of a suspected criminal by the suffrage of the most and best he already is acquitted and by the sentence of some condemned but as i have no reason to stand to the award of my enemies so neither dare i trust the partiality of my friends i make my last appeal to your royal highness as to a sovereign tribunal heroes should only be judged by heroes because they only are capable of measuring great and heroick actions by the rule and standard of their own if almanzor has failed in any point of honour i must therein acknowledge that he deviates from your royal highness who are the pattern of it but if at any time he fulfils the parts of personal valour and of conduct of a soldier and of a general or if i could yet give him a character more advantageous than what he has of the most unshaken friend the greatest of subjects and the best of masters i should then draw to all the world a true resemblance of your worth and virtues at least as far as they are capable of being copied by the mean abilities of    sir      your royal highnesss       most humble and         most obedient servant           john dryden   footnotes 1 james duke of york afterwards james ii  2 although the valour of the unfortunate james ii seems to have sunk    with his good fortune there is no reason to question his having    merited the compliment in the text the duke of buckingham in his    memoirs has borne witness to the intrepidity with which he    encountered the dangers of his desperate naval actions with the    dutch captain carlton who was also an eyewitness of his    deportment on that occasion says that while the balls were flying    thickly around the duke of york was wont to rub his hands and    exclaim chearfully to his captain spragge spragge they follow    us fast  3 when general lockhart commanded the troops of the protector in    flanders the duke of york was a volunteer in the spanish army and    was present at the defeat which the latter received before    dunkirk 17th of june 1658  4 the defeat of the dutch off harwich 3d june 1665 in which their    admiral obdam was blown up eighteen of their ships taken and    fourteen destroyed  5 the author seems to refer to the burning of the english ships at    chatham by the dutch admiral de ruyter                                       of                              heroic plays                                an essay   whether heroic verse ought to be admitted into serious plays is not now to be disputed it is already in possession of the stage and i dare confidently affirm that very few tragedies in this age shall be received without it all the arguments which are formed against it can amount to no more than this that it is not so near conversation as prose and therefore not so natural but it is very clear to all who understand poetry that serious plays ought not to imitate conversation too nearly if nothing were to be raised above that level the foundation of poetry would be destroyed and if you once admit of a latitude that thoughts may be exalted and that images and actions may be raised above the life and described in measure without rhyme that leads you insensibly from your own principles to mine you are already so far onward of your way that you have forsaken the imitation of ordinary converse you are gone beyond it and to continue where you are is to lodge in the open fields betwixt two inns you have lost that which you call natural and have not acquired the last perfection of art but it was only custom which cozened us so long we thought because shakespeare and fletcher went no farther that there the pillars of poetry were to be erected that because they excellently described passion without rhime therefore rhime was not capable of describing it but time has now convinced most men of that error it is indeed so difficult to write verse that the adversaries of it have a good plea against many who undertook that task without being formed by art or nature for it yet even they who have written worst in it would have written worse without it they have cozened many with their sound who never took the pains to examine their sense in fine they have succeeded though it is true they have more dishonoured rhime by their good success than they have done by their ill but i am willing to let fall this argument it is free for every man to write or not to write in verse as he judges it to be or not to be his talent or as he imagines the audience will receive it  for heroic plays in which only i have used it without the mixture of prose the first light we had of them on the english theatre was from the late sir william davenant it being forbidden him in the rebellious times to act tragedies and comedies because they contained some matter of scandal to those good people who could more easily dispossess their lawful sovereign than endure a wanton jest he was forced to turn his thoughts another way and to introduce the examples of moral virtue writ in verse and performed in recitative music the original of this music and of the scenes which adorned his work he had from the italian operas but he heightened his characters as i may probably imagine from the example of corneille and some french poets in this condition did this part of poetry remain at his majestys return when growing bolder as being now owned by a public authority he reviewed his siege of rhodes and caused it be acted as a just drama but as few men have the happiness to begin and finish any new project so neither did he live to make his design perfect there wanted the fulness of a plot and the variety of characters to form it as it ought and perhaps something might have been added to the beauty of the style all which he would have performed with more exactness had he pleased to have given us another work of the same nature for myself and others who come after him we are bound with all veneration to his memory to acknowledge what advantage we received from that excellent groundwork which he laid and since it is an easy thing to add to what already is invented we ought all of us without envy to him or partiality to ourselves to yield him the precedence in it  having done him this justice as my guide i may do myself so much as to give an account of what i have performed after him i observed then as i said what was wanting to the perfection of his siege of rhodes which was design and variety of characters and in the midst of this consideration by mere accident i opened the next book that lay by me which was ariosto in italian and the very first two lines of that poem gave me light to all i could desire    le donne i cavalier larme gli amori   le cortesie laudaci imprese io canto c  for the very next reflection which i made was this that an heroic play ought to be an imitation in little of an heroic poem and consequently that love and valour ought to be the subject of it both these sir william davenant had begun to shadow but it was so as first discoverers draw their maps with headlands and promontories and some few outlines of somewhat taken at a distance and which the designer saw not clearly the common drama obliged him to a plot well formed and pleasant or as the ancients call it one entire and great action but this he afforded not himself in a story which he neither filled with persons nor beautified with characters nor varied with accidents the laws of an heroic poem did not dispense with those of the other but raised them to a greater height and indulged him a farther liberty of fancy and of drawing all things as far above the ordinary proportion of the stage as that is beyond the common words and actions of human life and therefore in the scanting of his images and design he complied not enough with the greatness and majesty of an heroic poem  i am sorry i cannot discover my opinion of this kind of writing without dissenting much from his whose memory i love and honour but i will do it with the same respect to him as if he were now alive and overlooking my paper while i write his judgment of an heroic poem was this that it ought to be dressed in a more familiar and easy shape more fitted to the common actions and passions of human life and in short more like a glass of nature shewing us ourselves in our ordinary habits and figuring a more practicable virtue to us than was done by the ancients or moderns thus he takes the image of an heroic poem from the drama or stage poetry and accordingly intended to divide it into five books representing the same number of acts and every book into several cantos imitating the scenes which compose our acts  but this i think is rather a play in narration as i may call it than an heroic poem if at least you will not prefer the opinion of a single man to the practice of the most excellent authors both of ancient and latter ages i am no admirer of quotations but you shall hear if you please one of the ancients delivering his judgment on this question it is petronius arbiter the most elegant and one of the most judicious authors of the latin tongue who after he had given many admirable rules for the structure and beauties of an epic poem concludes all in these following words  non enim res gestæ versibus comprehendendæ sunt quod longe melius historici faciunt sed per ambages deorumque ministeria præcipitanaus est liber spiritus ut potius furentis animi vaticinatio appareat quam religiosæ orationis sub testibus fides  in which sentence and his own essay of a poem which immediately he gives you it is thought he taxes lucan who followed too much the truth of history crowded sentences together was too full of points and too often offered at somewhat which had more of the sting of an epigram than of the dignity and state of an heroic poem lucan used not much the help of his heathen deities there was neither the ministry of the gods nor the precipitation of the soul nor the fury of a prophet of which my author speaks in his pharsalia he treats you more like a philosopher than a poet and instructs you in verse with what he had been taught by his uncle seneca in prose in one word he walks soberly afoot when he might fly yet lucan is not always this religious historian the oracle of appius and the witchcraft of erictho will somewhat atone for him who was indeed bound up by an illchosen and known argument to follow truth with great exactness for my part i am of opinion that neither homer virgil statius ariosto tasso nor our english spencer could have formed their poems half so beautiful without those gods and spirits and those enthusiastic parts of poetry which compose the most noble parts of all their writings and i will ask any man who loves heroic poetry for i will not dispute their tastes who do not if the ghost of polydorus in virgil the enchanted wood in tasso and the bower of bliss in spencer which he borrows from that admirable italian could have been omitted without taking from their works some of the greatest beauties in them and if any man object the improbabilities of a spirit appearing or of a palace raised by magic i boldly answer him that an heroic poet is not tied to a bare representation of what is true or exceeding probable but that he may let himself loose to visionary objects and to the representation of such things as depending not on sense and therefore not to be comprehended by knowledge may give him a freer scope for imagination it is enough that in all ages and religions the greatest part of mankind have believed the power of magic and that there are spirits or spectres which have appeared this i say is foundation enough for poetry and i dare farther affirm that the whole doctrine of separated beings whether those spirits are incorporeal substances which mr hobbes with some reason thinks to imply a contradiction or that they are a thinner and more aërial sort of bodies as some of the fathers have conjectured may better be explicated by poets than by philosophers or divines for their speculations on this subject are wholly poetical they have only their fancy for their guide and that being sharper in an excellent poet than it is likely it should in a phlegmatic heavy gownman will see farther in its own empire and produce more satisfactory notions on those dark and doubtful problems  some men think they have raised a great argument against the use of spectres and magic in heroic poetry by saying they are unnatural but whether they or i believe there are such things is not material it is enough that for aught we know they may be in nature and whatever is or may be is not properly unnatural neither am i much concerned at mr cowleys verses before gondibert though his authority is almost sacred to me it is true he has resembled the old epic poetry to a fantastic fairyland but he has contradicted himself by his own example for he has himself made use of angels and visions in his davideis as well as tasso in his godfrey  what i have written on this subject will not be thought a digression by the reader if he please to remember what i said in the beginning of this essay that i have modelled my heroic plays by the rules of an heroic poem and if that be the most noble the most pleasant and the most instructive way of writing in verse and withal the highest pattern of human life as all poets have agreed i shall need no other argument to justify my choice in this imitation one advantage the drama has above the other namely that it represents to view what the poem only does relate and segnius irritant animum demissa per aures quam quæ sunt oculis subjecta fidelibus as horace tells us  to those who object my frequent use of drums and trumpets and my representations of battles i answer i introduced them not on the english stage shakespeare used them frequently and though jonson shews no battle in his catiline yet you hear from behind the scenes the sounding of trumpets and the shouts of fighting armies but i add farther that these warlike instruments and even their presentations of fighting on the stage are no more than necessary to produce the effects of an heroic play that is to raise the imagination of the audience and to persuade them for the time that what they behold on the theatre is really performed the poet is then to endeavour an absolute dominion over the minds of the spectators for though our fancy will contribute to its own deceit yet a writer ought to help its operation and that the red bull has formerly done the same is no more an argument against our practice than it would be for a physician to forbear an approved medicine because a mountebank has used it with success  thus i have given a short account of heroic plays i might now with the usual eagerness of an author make a particular defence of this but the common opinion how unjust soever has been so much to my advantage that i have reason to be satisfied and to suffer with patience all that can be urged against it  for otherwise what can be more easy for me than to defend the character of almanzor which is one great exception that is made against the play tis said that almanzor is no perfect pattern of heroic virtue that he is a contemner of kings and that he is made to perform impossibilities  i must therefore avow in the first place from whence i took the character the first image i had of him was from the achilles of homer the next from tassos rinaldo who was a copy of the former and the third from the artaban of monsieur calpranede who has imitated both the original of these achilles is taken by homer for his hero and is described by him as one who in strength and courage surpassed the rest of the grecian army but withal of so fiery a temper so impatient of an injury even from his king and general that when his mistress was to be forced from him by the command of agamemnon he not only disobeyed it but returned him an answer full of contumely and in the most opprobrious terms he could imagine they are homers words which follow and i have cited but some few amongst a multitude    greek oinobares kynos ommat echôn kradiên d elaphoio                                    il a v 225    greek dêmoboros basileus c il a v 231  nay he proceeded so far in his insolence as to draw out his sword with intention to kill him    greek elketo d ek koleoio mega xiphos                                    il a v 194  and if minerva had not appeared and held his hand he had executed his design and it was all she could do to dissuade him from it the event was that he left the army and would fight no more agamemnon gives his character thus to nestor    greek all hod anêr ethelei peri pantôn emmenai allôn   pantôn men krateein ethelei pantessi d anassein                                    il a v 287 288  and horace gives the same description of him in his art of poetry    honoratum si fortè reponis achillem   inpiger iracundus inexorabilis acer   jura neget sibi nata nihil non arroget armis  tassos chief character rinaldo was a man of the same temper for when he had slain gernando in his heat of passion he not only refused to be judged by godfrey his general but threatened that if he came to seize him he would right himself by arms upon him witness these following lines of tasso    venga egli o mundi io terrò fermo il piede   giudici fian tra noi la sorte e larme   fera tragedia vuol che sappresenti   per lor diporto alle nemiche genti  you see how little these great authors did esteem the point of honour so much magnified by the french and so ridiculously aped by us they made their heroes men of honour but so as not to divest them quite of human passions and frailties they content themselves to shew you what men of great spirits would certainly do when they were provoked not what they were obliged to do by the strict rules of moral virtue for my own part i declare myself for homer and tasso and am more in love with achilles and rinaldo than with cyrus and oroondates i shall never subject my characters to the french standard where love and honour are to be weighed by drams and scruples yet where i have designed the patterns of exact virtues such as in this play are the parts of almahide of ozmyn and benzayda i may safely challenge the best of theirs  but almanzor is taxed with changing sides and what tie has he on him to the contrary he is not born their subject whom he serves and he is injured by them to a very high degree he threatens them and speaks insolently of sovereign power but so do achilles and rinaldo who were subjects and soldiers to agamemnon and godfrey of bulloigne he talks extravagantly in his passion but if i would take the pains to quote an hundred passages of ben jonsons cethegus i could easily shew you that the rhodomontades of almanzor are neither so irrational as his nor so impossible to be put in execution for cethegus threatens to destroy nature and to raise a new one out of it to kill all the senate for his part of the action to look cato dead and a thousand other things as extravagant he says but performs not one action in the play  but none of the former calumnies will stick and therefore it is at last charged upon me that almanzor does all things or if you will have an absurd accusation in their nonsense who make it that he performs impossibilities they say that being a stranger he appeases two fighting factions when the authority of their lawful sovereign could not this is indeed the most improbable of all his actions but it is far from being impossible their king had made himself contemptible to his people as the history of granada tells us and almanzor though a stranger yet was already known to them by his gallantry in the juego de torros his engagement on the weaker side and more especially by the character of his person and brave actions given by abdalla just before and after all the greatness of the enterprise consisted only in the daring for he had the kings guards to second him but we have read both of cæsar and many other generals who have not only calmed a mutiny with a word but have presented themselves single before an army of their enemies which upon sight of them has revolted from their own leaders and come over to their trenches in the rest of almanzors actions you see him for the most part victorious but the same fortune has constantly attended many heroes who were not imaginary yet you see it no inheritance to him for in the first place he is made a prisoner and in the last defeated and not able to preserve the city from being taken if the history of the late duke of guise be true he hazarded more and performed not less in naples than almanzor is feigned to have done in granada  i have been too tedious in this apology but to make some satisfaction i will leave the rest of my play exposed to the criticks without defence  the concernment of it is wholly passed from me and ought to be in them who have been favourable to it and are somewhat obliged to defend their opinions that there are errors in it i deny not    ast opere in tanto fas est obrepere somnum  but i have already swept the stakes and with the common good fortune of prosperous gamesters can be content to sit quietly to hear my fortune cursed by some and my faults arraigned by others and to suffer both without reply                                       on                            mr drydens play                         the conquest of

needful rest theres something noble labouring in my breast this raging fire which through the mass does move shall purge my dross and shall refine my love                                    exeunt

little service pay with a great favour i can shew the way  abdal i have a favour to demand of you that is to take the thing for which you sue  almanz then briefly thus when i the albayzyn won i found the beauteous almahide alone whose sad condition did my pity move and that compassion did produce my love  abdal this needs no suit in justice i declare she is your captive by the right of war  almanz she is no captive then i set her free and rather than i will her jailor be ill nobly lose her in her liberty  abdal your generosity i much approve but your excess of that shows want of love  almanz no tis the excess of love which mounts so high that seen far off it lessens to the eye had i not loved her and had set her free that sir had been my generosity but tis exalted passion when i show i dare be wretched not to make her so and while another passion fills her breast ill be all wretched rather than half blest  abdal may your heroic act so prosperous be that almahide may sigh you set her free

awe my sacrilege restored  zul what you deserve ill not dispute because i do not know this only i will say she shall not go  almanz thou single art not worth my answering but take what friends what armies thou canst bring what worlds and when you are united all then will i thunder in your earsshe shall  zul ill not one tittle of my right resign sir your implicit promise made her mine when i in general terms my love did show you swore our fortunes should together go  abdal the merits of the cause ill not decide but like my love i would my gift divide your equal titles then no longer plead but one of you for love of me recede  almanz i have receded to the utmost line when by my free consent she is not mine then let him equally recede with me and both of us will join to set her free  zul if you will free your part of her you may but sir i love not your romantic way dream on enjoy her soul and set that free im pleased her person should be left for me  almanz thou shalt not wish her thine thou shalt not dare to be so impudent as to despair  zul the zegrys sir are all concerned to see how much their merit you neglect in me  hamet your slighting zulema this very hour will take ten thousand subjects from your power  almanz what are ten thousand subjects such as they if i am scornedill take myself away  abdal since both cannot possess what both pursue i grieve my friend the chance should fall on you but when you hear what reason i can urge  almanz none none that your ingratitude can purge reasons a trick when it no grant affords it stamps the face of majesty on words

fates so low that i must stoop ere i can give the blow but mine is fixed so far above thy crown that all thy men piled on thy back can never pull it down but at my ease thy destiny i send by ceasing

scene of fancy moved so swift a pace and shifted that you can but think it was let then the short vexatious vision pass  almanz my joys indeed are dreams but not my pain twas a swift ruin but the marks remain when some fierce fire lays goodly buildings waste would you conclude there had been none because the burnings past  almah it was your fault that fire seized all your breast you should have blown up some to save the rest but tis at worst but so consumed by fire as cities are that by their fall rise higher build love a nobler temple in my place youll find the fire has but enlarged

thin food to men in fevers spent just keeps alive but gives no nourishment what hopes what fears what transports can it move tis but the ghost of a departed love  almah you like some greedy cormorant devour all my whole life can give you in an hour what more i can do for you is to die and that must follow if you this deny since i gave up my love that you might live you in refusing life my sentence

than beauty last   makes our sad poet mourn your favours past   for since without desert he got a name   he fears to lose it now with greater shame   fame like a little mistress of the town   is gained with ease but then shes lost as soon   for as those tawdry misses soon or late   jilt such as keep them at the highest rate   and oft the lacquey or the brawny clown   gets what is hid in the loosebodied gown   so fame is false to all that keep her long   and turns up to the fop thats brisk and young   some wiser poet now would leave fame first   but elder wits are like old lovers cursed   who when the vigour of their youth is spent   still grow more fond as they grow impotent   this some years hence our poets case may prove   but yet he hopes hes young enough to love   when forty comes if eer he live to see   that wretched fumbling age of poetry   twill be high time to bid his muse adieu   well may he please himself but never you   till then hell do as well as he began   and hopes you will not find him less a man   think him not duller for this years delay   he was prepared the women were away   and men without their parts can hardly play   if they through sickness seldom did appear   pity the virgins of each theatre   for at both houses twas a sickly year   and pity us your servants to whose cost   in one such sickness nine whole months are lost   their stay he fears has ruined what he writ   long waiting both disables love and wit   they thought they gave him leisure to do well   but when they forced him to attend he fell   yet though he much has failed he begs today   you will excuse his unperforming play   weakness sometimes great passion does express   he had pleased better had he loved you less

from a mean fifthrate wit a man of parts so common faces on the stage appear we take them in and they turn beauties here our author fears those critics as his fate and those he fears by consequence must hate for they the traffic of all wit invade as scriveners draw away the bankers trade howeer the poets safe enough to day they cannot censure an unfinished play but as when vizardmask appears in pit straight every man who thinks himself a wit perks up and managing his comb with grace with his white wig sets off his nutbrown face that done bears up to th prize and views each limb to know her by her rigging and her trim then the whole noise of fops to wagers go pox on her tmust be she anddamme no just so i prophesy these wits today will blindly guess at our imperfect play with what new plots our second part is filled who must be kept alive and who be killed and as those vizardmasks maintain that fashion to soothe and tickle sweet imagination so our dull poet keeps you on with masking to make you think theres something worth your asking but when tis shown that which does now delight you will prove a dowdy with a face to fright you                             almanzor and

about the place thus made for its first breathing free it moves again for ease and luxury till swelling by degrees it has possessed the greater space and now crowds up the rest when from behind there

dark absence to yourself ordain and i in charity will find the chain  almanz love is that madness which all lovers have but yet tis sweet and pleasing so to rave tis an enchantment where the reasons bound but paradise is in the enchanted ground a palace void of envy cares and strife where gentle hours delude so much of life to take those charms away and set me free is but to send me into misery

i perhaps should not receive your heart  almanz fair though you are as summer mornings and your eyes more bright than stars that twinkle in a winters night though you have eloquence to warm and move cold age and praying hermits into love though almahide with scorn rewards my care yet than to change tis nobler to despair my loves my soul and that from fate is free tis that unchanged and deathless

wandered round the crystal walls above but found the eternal fence so steeply high that when i mounted to the middle sky i flagged and fluttered down and could not fly then from the battlements of the

own esteem will he who may with heroes claim a place belie that fame and to himself be base think how august and godlike you did look when my defence unbribed you undertook but when an act so brave you disavow how little and how mercenary now  almanz are then my services no higher prized and can i fall so low to be despised  almah yes for whatever may be bought is low and you yourself who sell yourself are so remember the great act you did this day how did your love to virtue then give way when you gave freedom to my captive lord that rival who possessed what you adored of such a deed what price can there be made think well is that an action to be paid it was a miracle of virtue shown and wonders are with wonder paid alone and would you all that secret joy of mind which great souls only in great actions find all that for one tumultuous minute lose  almanz i would that minute before ages chuse praise is the pay of heaven for doing good but loves the best return for flesh and blood

hold hold such fatal proofs of love you shall not give deny me hate me both are justbut live your virtue i will neer disturb again nor dare to ask for fear i should obtain  almah tis generous to have conquered your desire you mount above your wish and lose it higher theres pride in virtue and a kindly heat not feverish like your love but full as great farewell and may our loves hereafter be but imagelike to heighten piety  almanz tis time i should be gone alas i am but half converted yet all i resolve i with one look forget and like a lion whom no arts can tame shall tear even those who

when men were dull and conversation low   then comedy was faultless but twas coarse   cobbs tankard was a jest and otters horse1   and as their comedy their love was mean   except by chance in some one laboured scene   which must atone for an illwritten play   they rose but at their height could seldom stay   fame then was cheap and the first comer sped   and they have kept it since by being dead   but were they now to write when critics weigh   each line and every word throughout a play   none of them no not jonson in his height   could pass without allowing grains for weight   think it not envy that these truths are told   our poets not malicious though hes bold   tis not to brand them that their faults are shown   but by their errors to excuse his own   if love and honour now are higher raised   tis not the poet but the age is praised   wits now arrived to a more high degree   our native language more refined and free   our ladies and our men now speak more wit   in conversation than those poets writ   then one of these is consequently true   that what this poet writes comes short of you   and imitates you ill which most he fears   or else his writing is not worse than theirs   yet though you judge as sure the critics will   that some before him writ with greater skill   in this one praise he has their fame surpast   to please an age more gallant than the

or                     an essay on the dramatic poetry                            of the last age   the promises of authors that they will write again are in effect a threatening of their readers with some new impertinence and they who perform not what they promise will have their pardon on easy terms it is from this consideration that i could be glad to spare you the trouble which i am now giving you of a postscript if i were not obliged by many reasons to write somewhat concerning our present plays and those of our predecessors on the english stage the truth is i have so far engaged myself in a bold epilogue to this play wherein i have somewhat taxed the former writing that it was necessary for me either not to print it or to show that i could defend it yet i would so maintain my opinion of the present age as not to be wanting in my veneration for the past i would ascribe to dead authors their just praises in those things wherein they have excelled us and in those wherein we contend with them for the preeminence i would acknowledge our advantages to the age and claim no victory from our wit this being what i have proposed to myself i hope i shall not be thought arrogant when i enquire into their errors for we live in an age so sceptical that as it determines little so it takes nothing from antiquity on trust and i profess to have no other ambition in this essay than that poetry may not go backward when all other arts and sciences are advancing whoever censures me for this inquiry let him hear his character from horace    ingeniis non ille favet plauditque sepultis   nostra sed impugnat nos nostraque lividus odit    he favours not dead wits but hates the living  it was upbraided to that excellent poet that he was an enemy to the writings of his predecessor lucilius because he had said lucilium lutulentum fluere that he ran muddy and that he ought to have retrenched from his satires many unnecessary verses but horace makes lucilius himself to justify him from the imputation of envy by telling you that he would have done the same had he lived in an age which was more refined    si foret hoc nostrum fato delapsus in ævum   detereret sibi multa recideret omne quod ultra   perfectum traheretur c  and both in the whole course of that satire and in his most admirable epistle to augustus he makes it his business to prove that antiquity alone is no plea for the excellency of a poem but that one age learning from another the last if we can suppose an equality of wit in the writers has the advantage of knowing more and better than the former and this i think is the state of the question in dispute it is therefore my part to make it clear that the language wit and conversation of our age are improved and refined above the last and then it will not be difficult to infer that our plays have received some part of those advantages  in the first place therefore it will be necessary to state in general what this refinement is of which we treat and that i think will not be defined amiss an improvement of our wit language and conversation or an alteration in them for the better  to begin with language that an alteration is lately made in ours or since the writers of the last age in which i comprehend shakespeare fletcher and jonson is manifest any man who reads those excellent poets and compares their language with what is now written will see it almost in every line but that this is an improvement of the language or an alteration for the better will not so easily be granted for many are of a contrary opinion that the english tongue was then in the height of its perfection that from jonsons time to ours it has been in a continual declination like that of the romans from the age of virgil to statius and so downward to claudian of which not only petronius but quintilian himself so much complains under the person of secundus in his famous dialogue de causis corruptæ eloquentiæ  but to shew that our language is improved and that those people have not a just value for the age in which they live let us consider in what the refinement of a language principally consists that is either in rejecting such old words or phrases which are ill sounding or improper or in admitting new which are more proper more sounding and more significant  the reader will easily take notice that when i speak of rejecting improper words and phrases i mention not such as are antiquated by custom only and as i may say without any fault of theirs for in this case the refinement can be but accidental that is when the words and phrases which are rejected happen to be improper neither would i be understood when i speak of impropriety of language either wholly to accuse the last age or to excuse the present and least of all myself for all writers have their imperfections and failings but i may safely conclude in the general that our improprieties are less frequent and less gross than theirs one testimony of this is undeniable that we are the first who have observed them and certainly to observe errors is a great step to the correcting of them but malice and partiality set apart let any man who understands english read diligently the works of shakespeare and fletcher and i dare undertake that he will find in every page either some solecism of speech or some notorious flaw in sense1 and yet these men are reverenced when we are not forgiven that their wit is great and many times their expressions noble envy itself cannot deny    neque ego illis detrahere ausim   hærentem capiti multâ cum laude coronam  but the times were ignorant in which they lived poetry was then if not in its infancy among us at least not arrived to its vigour and maturity witness the lameness of their plots many of which especially those which they writ first for even that age refined itself in some measure were made up of some ridiculous incoherent story which in one play many times took up the business of an age i suppose i need not name pericles prince of tyre nor the historical plays of shakespeare besides many of the rest as the winters tale loves labour lost measure for measure which were either grounded on impossibilities or at least so meanly written that the comedy neither caused your mirth nor the serious part your concernment2 if i would expatiate on this subject i could easily demonstrate that our admired fletcher who wrote after him neither understood correct plotting nor that which they call the decorum of the stage i would not search in his worst plays for examples he who will consider his philaster his humorous lieutenant his faithful shepherdess and many others which i could name will find them much below the applause which is now given them he will see philaster wounding his mistress and afterwards his boy to save himself not to mention the clown who enters immediately and not only has the advantage of the combat against the hero but diverts you from your serious concernment with his ridiculous and absurd raillery in his humorous lieutenant you find his demetrius and leontius staying in the midst of a routed army to hear the cold mirth of the lieutenant and demetrius afterwards appearing with a pistol in his hand in the next age to alexander the great3 and for his shepherd he falls twice into the former indecency of wounding women but these absurdities which those poets committed may more properly be called the ages fault than theirs for besides the want of education and learning which was their particular unhappiness they wanted the benefit of converse but of that i shall speak hereafter in a place more proper for it their audiences knew no better and therefore were satisfied with what they brought those who call theirs the golden age of poetry have only this reason for it that they were then content with acorns before they knew the use of bread or that greek alis druos was become a proverb they had many who admired them and few who blamed them and certainly a severe critic is the greatest help to a good wit he does the office of a friend while he designs that of an enemy and his malice keeps a poet within those bounds which the luxuriancy of his fancy would tempt him to overleap  but it is not their plots which i meant principally to tax i was speaking of their sense and language and i dare almost challenge any man to shew me a page together which is correct in both as for ben jonson i am loth to name him because he is a most judicious writer yet he very often falls into these errors and i once more beg the readers pardon for accusing him of them only let him consider that i live in an age where my least faults are severely censured and that i have no way left to extenuate my failings but by showing as great in those whom we admire    cædimus inque vicem præbemus crura sagittis  i cast my eyes but by chance on catiline and in the three or four last pages found enough to conclude that jonson writ not correctly    let the longhid seeds   of treason in thee now shoot forth in deeds   ranker than horror  in reading some bombast speeches of macbeth which are not to be understood he used to say that it was horror and i am much afraid that this is so    thy parricide late on thy only son   after his mother to make empty way   for thy last wicked nuptials worse than they   that blaze that act of thy incestuous life   which gained thee at once a daughter and a wife  the sense is here extremely perplexed and i doubt the word they is false grammar    and be free   not heaven itself from thy impiety  a synchysis or illplacing of words of which tully so much complains in oratory    the waves and dens of beasts could not receive   the bodies that those souls were frighted from  the preposition in the end of the sentence a common fault with him and which i have but lately observed in my own writings    what all the several ills that visit earth   plague famine fire could not reach unto   the sword nor surfeits let thy fury do  here are both the former faults for besides that the preposition unto is placed last in the verse and at the half period and is redundant there is the former synchysis in the words the sword nor surfeits which in construction ought to have been placed before the other  catiline says of cethegus that for his sake he would    go on upon the gods kiss lightning wrest   the engine from the cyclops and give fire   at face of a full cloud and stand his ire  to go on upon is only to go on twice4 to give fire at face of a full cloud was not understood in his own time and stand his ire besides the antiquated word ire there is the article his which makes false construction and giving fire at the face of a cloud is a perfect image of shooting however it came to be known in those days to catiline    others there are   whom envy to the state draws and pulls on   for contumelies received and such are sure ones  ones in the plural number but that is frequent with him for he says not long after    cæsar and crassus if they be ill men   are mighty ones   such men they do not succour more the cause c  they redundant    though heaven should speak with all his wrath at once   we should stand upright and unfeared  his is ill syntax with heaven and by unfeared he means unafraid words of a quite contrary signification  the ports are open he perpetually uses ports for gates which is an affected error in him to introduce latin by the loss of the english idiom as in the translation of tullys speeches he usually does  wellplacing of words for the sweetness of pronunciation was not known till mr waller introduced it and therefore it is not to be wondered if ben jonson has many such lines as these  but being bred up in his fathers needy fortunes brought up ins sisters prostitution c  but meanness of expression one would think not to be his error in a tragedy which ought to be more high and sounding than any other kind of poetry and yet amongst others in catiline i find these four lines together    so asia thou art cruelly even   with us for all the blows thee given   when we whose virtues conquered thee   thus by thy vices ruined be  be there is false english for are though the rhyme hides it  but i am willing to close the book partly out of veneration to the author partly out of weariness to pursue an argument which is so fruitful in so small a compass and what correctness after this can be expected from shakespeare or from fletcher who wanted that learning and care which jonson had i will therefore spare my own trouble of enquiring into their faults who had they lived now had doubtless written more correctly i suppose it will be enough for me to affirm as i think i safely may that these and the like errors which i taxed in the most correct of the last age are such into which we do not ordinarily fall i think few of our present writers would have left behind them such a line as this    contain your spirit in more stricter bounds  but that gross way of two comparatives was then ordinary and therefore more pardonable in jonson  as for the other part of refining which consists in receiving new words and phrases i shall not insist much on it it is obvious that we have admitted many some of which we wanted and therefore our language is the richer for them as it would be by importation of bullion others are rather ornamental than necessary yet by their admission the language is become more courtly and our thoughts are better drest these are to be found scattered in the writers of our age and it is not my business to collect them they who have lately written with most care have i believe taken the rule of horace for their guide that is not to be too hasty in receiving of words but rather stay till custom has made them familiar to us    quern penes arbitrium est et jus et norma loquendi  for i cannot approve of their way of refining who corrupt our english idiom by mixing it too much with french that is a sophistication of language not an improvement of it a turning english into french rather than a refining of english by french we meet daily with those fops who value themselves on their travelling and pretend they cannot express their meaning in english because they would put off to us some french phrase of the last edition without considering that for aught they know we have a better of our own but these are not the men who are to refine us their talent is to prescribe fashions not words at best they are only serviceable to a writer so as ennius was to virgil he may aurum ex stercore colligere for it is hard if amongst many insignificant phrases there happen not something worth preserving though they themselves like indians know not the value of their own commodity  there is yet another way of improving language which poets especially have practised in all ages that is by applying received words to a new signification and this i believe is meant by horace in that precept which is so variously construed by expositors    dixeris egregie notum si callida verbum   reddiderit junctura novum  and in this way he himself had a particular happiness using all the tropes and particular metaphors with that grace which is observable in his odes where the beauty of expression is often greater than that of thought as in that one example amongst an infinite number of others et vultus nimium lubricus aspici  and therefore though he innovated a little he may justly be called a great refiner of the roman tongue this choice of words and heightening of their natural signification was observed in him by the writers of the following ages for petronius says of him et horatii curiosa felicitas by this graffing as i may call it on old words has our tongue been beautified by the three beforementioned poets shakespeare fletcher and jonson whose excellencies i can never enough admire and in this they have been followed especially by sir john suckling and mr waller who refined upon them neither have they who succeeded them been wanting in their endeavours to adorn our mother tongue but it is not so lawful for me to praise my living contemporaries as to admire my dead predecessors  i should now speak of the refinement of wit but i have been so large on the former subject that i am forced to contract myself in this i will therefore only observe to you that the wit of the last age was yet more incorrect than their language shakespeare who many times has written better than any poet in any language is yet so far from writing wit always or expressing that wit according to the dignity of the subject that he writes in many places below the dullest writers of ours or any precedent age never did any author precipitate himself from such height of thought to so low expressions as he often does he is the very janus of poets he wears almost every where two faces and you have scarce begun to admire the one ere you despise the other neither is the luxuriance of fletcher which his friends have taxed in him a less fault than the carelessness of shakespeare he does not well always and when he does he is a true englishmanhe knows not when to give over if he wakes in one scene he commonly slumbers in another and if he pleases you in the first three acts he is frequently so tired with his labour that he goes heavily in the fourth and sinks under his burden in the fifth  for ben jonson the most judicious of poets he always writ properly and as the character required and i will not contest farther with my friends who call that wit it being very certain that even folly itself well represented is wit in a larger signification and that there is fancy as well as judgment in it though not so much or noble because all poetry being imitation that of folly is a lower exercise of fancy though perhaps as difficult as the other for it is a kind of looking downward in the poet and representing that part of mankind which is below him  in these low characters of vice and folly lay the excellency of that inimitable writer who when at any time he aimed at wit in the stricter sense that is sharpness of conceit was forced either to borrow from the ancients as to my knowledge he did very much from plautus or when he trusted himself alone often fell into meanness of expression nay he was not free from the lowest and most groveling kind of wit which we call clenches of which every man in his humour is infinitely full and which is worse the wittiest persons in the drama speak them his other comedies are not exempt from them will you give me leave to name some few asper in which character he personates himself and he neither was nor thought himself a fool exclaiming against the ignorant judges of the age speaks thus    how monstrous and detested ist to see   a fellow that has neither art nor brain   sit like an aristarchus or starkass   taking mens lines with a tobacco face   in snuff c  and presently after i marvel whose wit twas to put a prologue in yond sackbuts mouth they might well think he would be out of tune and yet youd play upon him toowill you have another of the same stamp o i cannot abide these limbs of sattin or rather satan  but it may be you will object that this was asper macilente or carlo buffone you shall therefore hear him speak in his own person and that in the two last lines or sting of an epigram it is inscribed to fine grand who he says was indebted to him for many things which he reckons there and concludes thus    forty things more dear grand which you know true   for which or pay me quickly or ill pay you  this was then the mode of wit the vice of the age and not ben jonsons for you see a little before him that admirable wit sir philip sidney perpetually playing with his words in his time i believe it ascended first into the pulpit where if you will give me leave to clench too it yet finds the benefit of its clergy for they are commonly the first corrupters of eloquence and the last reformed from vicious oratory as a famous italian has observed before me in his treatise of the corruption of the italian tongue which he principally ascribes to priests and preaching friars  but to conclude with what brevity i can i will only add this in defence of our present writers that if they reach not some excellencies of ben jonson which no age i am confident ever shall yet at least they are above that meanness of thought which i have taxed and which is frequent in him  that the wit of this age is much more courtly may easily be proved by viewing the characters of gentlemen which were written in the last first for jonsontruewit in the silent woman was his masterpiece and truewit was a scholarlike kind of man a gentleman with an allay of pedantry a man who seems mortified to the world by much reading the best of his discourse is drawn not from the knowledge of the town but books and in short he would be a fine gentleman in an university shakespeare shewed the best of his skill in his mercutio and he said himself that he was forced to kill him in the third act to prevent being killed by him but for my part i cannot find he was so dangerous a person i see nothing in him but what was so exceeding harmless that he might have lived to the end of the play and died in his bed without offence to any man  fletchers don john is our only bugbear and yet i may affirm without suspicion of flattery that he now speaks better and that his character is maintained with much more vigour in the fourth and fifth acts than it was by fletcher in the three former i have always acknowledged the wit of our predecessors with all the veneration which becomes me but i am sure their wit was not that of gentlemen there was ever somewhat that was illbred and clownish in it and which confessed the conversation of the authors  and this leads me to the last and greatest advantage of our writing which proceeds from conversation in the age wherein those poets lived there was less of gallantry than in ours neither did they keep the best company of theirs their fortune has been much like that of epicurus in the retirement of his gardens to live almost unknown and to be celebrated after their decease i cannot find that any of them had been conversant in courts except ben jonson and his genius lay not so much that way as to make an improvement by it greatness was not then so easy of access nor conversation so free as now it is i cannot therefore conceive it any insolence to affirm that by the knowledge and pattern of their wit who writ before us and by the advantage of our own conversation the discourse and raillery of our comedies excel what has been written by them and this will be denied by none but some few old fellows who value themselves on their acquaintance with the black friars who because they saw their plays would pretend a right to judge ours the memory of these grave gentlemen is their only plea for being wits they can tell a story of ben jonson and perhaps have had fancy enough to give a supper in the apollo that they might be called his sons5 and because they were drawn in to be laughed at in those times they think themselves now sufficiently entitled to laugh at ours learning i never saw in any of them and wit no more than they could remember in short they were unlucky to have been bred in an unpolished age and more unlucky to live to a refined one they have lasted beyond their own and are cast behind ours and not contented to have known little at the age of twenty they boast of their ignorance at threescore  now if they ask me whence it is that our conversation is so much refined i must freely and without flattery ascribe it to the court and in it particularly to the king whose example gives a law to it his own misfortunes and the nations afforded him an opportunity which is rarely allowed to sovereign princes i mean of travelling and being conversant in the most polished courts of europe and thereby of cultivating a spirit which was formed by nature to receive the impressions of a gallant and generous education at his return he found a nation lost as much in barbarism as in rebellion and as the excellency of his nature forgave the one so the excellency of his manners reformed the other the desire of imitating so great a pattern first awakened the dull and heavy spirits of the english from their natural reservedness loosened them from their stiff forms of conversation and made them easy and pliant to each other in discourse thus insensibly our way of living became more free and the fire of the english wit which was before stifled under a constrained melancholy way of breeding began first to display its force by mixing the solidity of our nation with the air and gaiety of our neighbours6 this being granted to be true it would be a wonder if the poets whose work is imitation should be the only persons in three kingdoms who should not receive advantage by it or if they should not more easily imitate the wit and conversation of the present age than of the past  let us therefore admire the beauties and the heights of shakespeare without falling after him into a carelessness and as i may call it a lethargy of thought for whole scenes together let us imitate as we are able the quickness and easiness of fletcher without proposing him as a pattern to us either in the redundancy of his matter or the incorrectness of his language let us admire his wit and sharpness of conceit but let us at the same time acknowledge that it was seldom so fixed and made proper to his character as that the same things might not be spoken by any person in the play let us applaud his scenes of love but let us confess that he understood not either greatness or perfect honour in the parts of any of his women in fine let us allow that he had so much fancy as when he pleased he could write wit but that he wanted so much judgment as seldom to have written humour or described a pleasant folly let us ascribe to jonson the height and accuracy of judgment in the ordering of his plots his choice of characters and maintaining what he had chosen to the end but let us not think him a perfect pattern of imitation except it be in humour for love which is the foundation of all comedies in other languages is scarcely mentioned in any of his plays and for humour itself the poets of this age will be more wary than to imitate the meanness of his persons gentlemen will now be entertained with the follies of each other and though they allow cobb and tib to speak properly yet they are not much pleased with their tankard or with their rags and surely their conversation can be no jest to them on the theatre when they would avoid it in the street  to conclude all let us render to our predecessors what is their due without confining ourselves to a servile imitation of all they writ and without assuming to ourselves the title of better poets let us ascribe to the gallantry and civility of our age the advantage which we have above them and to our knowledge of the customs and manners of it the happiness we have to please beyond them                                       the bold epilogue which is here defended with so much animation and the censure which it threw on the fathers of the stage seems to have given great offence it is thus severely assailed by rochester    but does not dryden find even jonson dull   beaumont and fletcher incorrect and full   of lewd lines as he calls them shakespeares style   stiff and affected to his own the while   allowing all the justice that his pride   so arrogantly had to these denied   and may i not have leave impartially   to search and censure drydens works and try   if those gross faults his choice pen doth commit   proceed from want of judgment or of wit   or if his lumpish fancy doth refuse   spirit and grace to his loose slattern muse   five hundred verses every morning writ   prove him no more a poet than a wit  it is a bold perhaps a presumptuous task to attempt to separate the true from the false criticism in the foregoing essay for who is qualified to be umpire betwixt shakespeare and dryden nevertheless our knowledge of the manners of the respective ages which these extraordinary men adorned and the remoteness of our own from both may enable us with impartiality at least to sift the grounds of drydens censure the nature of the stage in the days of shakespeare has been ascertained by the sedulous exertions of his commentators a variety of small theatres all of them accessible to the lowest of the people poor and rude in all the arts of decoration were dispersed through london when shakespeare and jonson wrote for the stage it was a natural consequence that the writings of these great men were biassed by the taste of those for whom they wrote    for those who live to please must please to live  art was not demanded and when used by jonson he complains it was not duly appreciated men of a middle rank were then probably worse educated than our mere vulgar but the good old time bore rough and manly spirits who came prepared with a tribute of tears and laughter to bursts of pathos or effusions of humour although incapable of receiving the delights which a cultivated mind derives from the gradual developement of a story the just dependence of its parts upon each other the minute beauties of language and the absence of every thing incongruous or indecorous dryden on the other hand wrote for a stage patronized by a monarch and his courtiers who were professed judges of dramatic composition while the rigour of religious prejudice and perhaps a just abhorrence of the licentious turn of the drama banished from the theatres a great proportion of the middle classes always the most valuable part of an audience because with a certain degree of cultivation they unite an unhacknied energy of feeling art therefore became in the days of dryden not only a requisite qualification but even the principal attribute of the dramatic poet he was to address himself to the heads and judgments of his audience on the acuteness of which they piqued themselves not to their feelings stupified probably by selfish dissipation even the acquisition and exercise of critical knowledge tends to blunt the sense of natural beauties as a refined harmonist becomes indifferent to the strains of simple melody hence the sacrifices which shakespeare made without being aware to the taste of his age were amply compensated by his being called upon and as it were compelled by the nature of his audience to rouse them with his thunder and to melt them with his dew i question much if the age of charles ii would have borne the introduction of othello or falstaff we may find something like drydens selfcomplacent opinion expressed by the editor of corneille where he civilly admits corneille etoit inegal comme shakespeare et plein de genie comme lui mais le genie de corneille etoit a celui de shakespeare ce qu un seigneur est a legard dun homme de peuple né avec le meme esprit que lui in other words the works of the one retain the rough bold tints of nature and originality while those of the other are qualified by the artificial restraints which fashion imposes upon the homme de condition it is therefore unjustly that dryden dwells so long on shakespeares irregularities amongst which i cannot help suspecting he includes some of his greatest beauties while we do not defend his quibbles and carwitchets as bibber would have termed them we may rejoice that he purchased at so slight a sacrifice the power and privilege of launching into every subject with a liberty as unbounded as his genius    as there is music uninformed by art   in those wild notes which with a merry heart   the birds in unfrequented shades express   which better taught at home yet please us less   footnotes 1 in mitigation of the censure which must be passed on our author for    this hasty and illconsidered judgment let us remember the very    inaccurate manner in which shakespeares plays were printed in the    early editions  2 mr malone has judiciously remarked that dryden seems to have been    ignorant of the order in which shakespeare wrote his plays and    there will be charity in believing that he was not intimately    acquainted with those he so summarily and unjustly censures  3 in these criticisms we see the effects of the refinement which our    stage had now borrowed from the french it is probable that in    the age of heroic plays any degree of dulness or extravagance    would have been tolerated in the dialogue rather than an offence    against the decorum of the scene  4 jonson seems to have used it for to go on against  5 the apollo was ben jonsons favourite clubroom in the devil    tavern the custom of adopting his admirers and imitators by    bestowing upon them the title of son is often alluded to in his    works in drydens time the fashion had so far changed that the    poetical progeny of old ben seem to have incurred more ridicule    than honour by this ambitious distinction oldwit in shadwells    play called bury fair is described as a paltry oldfashioned wit    and punner of the last age that pretends to have been one of ben    jonsons sons and to have seen plays at the blackfriars  6 this passage though complimentary to charles contains much sober    truth having considerable taste for the belles lettres he    cultivated them during his exile and was naturally swayed by the    french rules of composition particularly as applicable to the    theatre these he imported with him at his restoration and hence    arose the heroic drama so much cultivated by our author                                                                             marriage alamode                                a comedy               quicquid sum ego quamvis              infra lucili censum ingeniumque tamen me

this account of its first representation this comedy acted by his majestys servants at the theatreroyal made its first appearance with extraordinary lustre divesting myself of the old man i solemnly

unquestionable judge of the humour of a coquette or coxcomb the illustrious colley cibber melantha says cibber is as finished an impertinent as ever fluttered in a drawingroom and seems to contain the most complete system of female foppery that could possibly be crowded into the tortured form of a fine lady her language dress motion manners soul and body are in a continual hurry to be something

him to her good graces as an honourable lover here now one would think she might naturally shew a little of the sexs decent reserve though never so slightly covered no sir not a tittle of it modesty is a poorsouled country gentlewoman she is too much a court lady to be under so vulgar a confusion she reads the letter therefore with a careless dropping lip and an erected brow humming it hastily

and pours down upon him her whole artillery of airs eyes and motion down goes her dainty diving body to the ground as it she were sinking under the conscious load of her own attractions then launches into a flood of fine language and compliment still playing her chest forward in fifty falls and risings like a swan upon waving water and to complete her impertinence she is so rapidly fond of her own wit that she will not give her lover leave to praise it silent assenting bows and vain endeavours to speak are all the share of the conversation he is admitted to which at last he is removed from by her engagement to half a score of visits which she swims from him to make with a promise to return in a twinkling cibbers apology p 99  by this lively sketch some judgment may be formed of the effect produced by the character of melantha when ably represented but to say the truth we could hardly have drawn the same deduction from a simple perusal of the piece of the french phrases which the affected lady throws into her conversation some have been since naturalized as good graces minuet chagrin grimace ridicule and others little can be said of the tragic part of the drama the sudden turn of fortune in the conclusion is ridiculed in the rehearsal  the researches of mr malone have ascertained that marriage alamode was first acted in 1673 in an old theatre in lincolns inn fields occupied by the kings company after that in drurylane had been burned and during its rebuilding the play was printed in the same year                                       to                           the

patron before it was acted on the stage i may yet go farther with your permission and say that it received amendment from your noble hands ere it was fit to be presented you may please likewise to remember with how much favour to the author and indulgence to the play you commended it to the view of his majesty then at windsor and by his approbation of it in writing made way for its kind reception on the theatre in this dedication therefore i may seem to imitate a custom of the ancients who offered to their gods the firstlings of the flock which i think they called ver sacrum because they helped them to increase i am sure if there be any thing in this play wherein i have raised myself beyond the ordinary lowness of my comedies i ought wholly to acknowledge it to the favour of being admitted into your lordships conversation and not only i who pretend not to this way but the best comic writers of our age will join with me to acknowledge that they have copied the gallantries of courts the delicacy of expression and the decencies of behaviour from your lordship with more success than if they had taken their models from the court of france but this my lord will be no wonder to the world which knows the excellency of your natural parts and those you have acquired in a noble education that which with more reason i admire is that being so absolute a courtier you have not forgot either the ties of friendship or the practice of generosity in my little experience of a court which i confess i desire not to improve i have found in it much of interest and more of detraction few men there have that assurance of a friend as not to be made ridiculous by him when they are absent there are a middling sort of courtiers who become happy by their want of wit but they supply that want by an excess of malice to those who have it and there is no such persecution as that of fools they can never be considerable enough to be talked of themselves so that they are safe only in their obscurity and grow mischievous to witty men by the great diligence of their envy and by being always present to represent and aggravate their faults in the mean time they are forced when they endeavour to be pleasant to live on the offals of their wit whom they decry and either to quote it which they do unwillingly or to pass it upon others for their own these are the men who make it their business to chace wit from the knowledge of princes lest it should disgrace their ignorance and this kind of malice your lordship has not so much avoided as surmounted but if by the excellent temper of a royal master always more ready to hear good than ill if by his inclination to love you if by your own merit and address if by the charms of your conversation the grace of your behaviour your knowledge of greatness and habitude in courts you have been able to preserve yourself with honour in the midst of so dangerous a course yet at least the remembrance of those hazards has inspired you with pity for other men who being of an inferior wit and quality to you are yet persecuted for being that in little which your lordship is in great2 for the quarrel of those people extends itself to any thing of sense and if i may be so vain to own it amongst the rest of the poets has sometimes reached to the very borders of it even to me so that if our general good fortune had not raised up your lordship to defend us i know not whether any thing had been more ridiculous in court than writers it is to your lordships favour we generally owe our protection and patronage and to the nobleness of your nature which will not suffer the least shadow of your wit to be contemned in other men you have been often pleased not only to excuse my imperfections but to vindicate what was tolerable in my writings from their censures and what i never can forget you have not only been careful of my reputation but of my fortune you have been solicitous to supply my neglect of myself and to overcome the fatal modesty of poets which submits them to perpetual wants rather than to become importunate with those people who have the liberality of kings in their disposing and who dishonouring the bounty of their master suffer such to be in necessity who endeavour at least to please him and for whose entertainment he has generously provided if the fruits of his royal favour were not often stopped in other hands but your lordship has given me occasion not to complain of courts whilst you are there i have found the effects of your mediation in all my concernments and they were so much the more noble in you because they were wholly voluntary i became your lordships if i may venture on the similitude as the world was made without knowing him who made it and brought only a passive obedience to be your creature this nobleness of yours i think myself the rather obliged to own because otherwise it must have been lost to all remembrance for you are endowed with that excellent quality of a frank nature to forget the good which you have done  but my lord i ought to have considered that you are as great a judge as you are a patron and that in praising you ill i should incur a higher note of ingratitude than that i thought to have avoided i stand in need of all your accustomed goodness for the dedication of this play which though perhaps it be the best of my comedies is yet so faulty that i should have feared you for my critic if i had not with some policy given you the trouble of being my protector wit seems to have lodged itself more nobly in this age than in any of the former and people of my mean condition are only writers because some of the nobility and your lordship in the first place are above the narrow praises which poesy could give you but let those who love to see themselves exceeded encourage your lordship in so dangerous a quality for my own part i must confess that i have so much of selfinterest as to be content with reading some papers of your verses without desiring you should proceed to a scene or play with the common prudence of those who are worsted in a duel and declare they are satisfied when they are first wounded your lordship has but another step to make and from the patron of wit you may become its tyrant and oppress our little reputations with more ease than you now protect them but these my lord are designs which i am sure you harbour not any more than the french king is contriving the conquest of the swissers it is a barren triumph which is not worth your pains and would only rank him amongst your slaves who is already    my lord      your lordships most obedient       and most faithful servant         john dryden   footnotes 1 the patron whom dryden here addresses was the famous john wilmot    earl of rochester the wittiest perhaps and most dissolute among    the witty and dissolute courtiers of charles ii it is somewhat    remarkable and may be considered as a just judgment upon the poet    that he was a few years afterwards waylaid and severely beaten    by bravoes whom lord rochester employed to revenge the share which    dryden is supposed to have had in the essay on satire the reader    is referred to the life of the author for the particulars of this    occurrence which is here recalled to his recollection as a    striking illustration of the inutility as well as meanness of ill    applied praise since even the eulogy of dryden however liberally    bestowed and beautifully expressed failed to save him from the    most unmanly treatment at the hands of the worthless and heartless    object on whom it was wasted it is melancholy to see dryden as    may be fairly inferred from his motto piqueing himself on being    admitted into the society of such men as rochester and enjoying    their precarious favour mr malone has remarked that even in the    course of the year 1673 when this dedication came forth rochester    entertained the perverse ambition of directing the public favour    not according to merit but to his own caprice accordingly he    countenanced settle in his impudent rivalry of dryden and wrote a    prologue to the empress of morocco when it was exhibited at    whitehall perhaps joined to a certain envy of drydens talents    the poets intimacy with sheffield earl of mulgrave gave offence to    rochester it is certain they were never afterwards reconciled and    even after rochesters death dryden only mentions his once valued    patron as a man of quality whose ashes he will not    disturbessay on the origin and progress of satire prefixed    to juvenal it would seem however that this dedication was very    favourably received by rochester since a letter of drydens to    that nobleman is still extant in which he acknowledges a    flattering return of compliment from his lordship in exchange for    it  2 when this play was acted for the first time in 1673 but about    1675 rochester contrived to give such offence as even the    excellent temper of his royal master was unable to digest this was    by writing a lampoon called the insipids in which the person and    character of charles are treated with most merciless and irreverent    severity it begins thus       chaste pious prudent charles the second        the miracle of thy restoration      may like to that of quails be reckoned        rained on the israelitish nation      the wishedfor blessing from heaven sent      became their curse and punishment     for this satiric effusion the author was banished from the court                                   prologue     lord how reformed

 rho the king best knows the reason of the progress but answer me i beseech you what brought you home from travel  pala the commands of an old rich father  rho and the hopes of burying him  pala both together as you see have prevailed on my good nature in few words my old man has already married me for he has agreed with another old man as rich and as covetous as himself the articles are drawn and i have given my consent for fear of being disinherited and yet know not what kind of woman i am to marry  rho sure your father intends you some very ugly wife and has a mind to keep you in ignorance till you have shot the gulf  pala i know not that but obey i will and must  rho then i cannot chuse but grieve for all the good girls and courtezans of france and italy they have lost the most kindhearted doting prodigal humble servant in europe  pala all i could do in these three years i staid behind you was to comfort the poor creatures for the loss of you but whats the reason that in all this time a friend could never hear from you  rho alas dear palamede i have had no joy to write nor indeed to do any thing in the world to please me the greatest misfortune imaginable is fallen upon me  pala prythee whats the matter  rho in one word i am married wretchedly married and have been above these two years yes faith the devil has had power over me in spite of my vows and resolutions to the contrary  pala i find you have sold yourself for filthy lucre shes old or ill conditioned  rho no none of these im sure shes young and for her humour she laughs sings and dances eternally and which is more we never quarrel about it for i do the same  pala youre very unfortunate indeed then the case is plain she is not handsome  rho a great beauty too as people say  pala as people say why you should know that best yourself  rho ask those who have smelt to a strong perfume two years together whats the scent  pala but here are good qualities enough for one woman  rho ay too many palamede if i could put them into three or four women i should be content  pala o now i have found it you dislike her for no other reason but because shes your wife  rho and is not that enough all that i know of her perfections now is only by memory i remember indeed that about two years ago i loved her passionately but those golden days are gone palamede yet i loved her a whole half year double the natural term of any mistress and i think in my conscience i could have held out another quarter but then the world began to laugh at me and a certain shame of being out of fashion seized me at last we arrived at that point that there was nothing left in us to make us new to one another yet still i set a good face upon the matter and am infinite fond of her before company but when we are alone we walk like lions in a room she one way and i another and we lie with our backs to each other so far distant as if the fashion of great beds was only invented to keep husband and wife sufficiently asunder  pala the truth is your disease is very desperate but though you cannot be cured you may be patched up a little you must get you a mistress rhodophil that indeed is living upon cordials but as fast as one fails you must supply it with another youre like a gamester who has lost his estate yet in doing that you have learned the advantages of play and can arrive to live upont  rho truth is i have been thinking ont and have just resolved to take your counsel and faith considering the damned disadvantages of a married man i have provided well enough for a poor humble sinner that is not ambitious of great matters  pala what is she for a woman  rho one of the stars of syracuse i assure you young enough fair enough and but for one quality just such a woman as i could wish  pala o friend this is not an age to be critical in beauty when we had good store of handsome women and but few chapmen you might have been more curious in your choice but now the price is enhanced upon us and all mankind set up for mistresses so that poor little creatures without beauty birth or breeding but only impudence go off at unreasonable rates and a man in these hard times snaps at them as he does at broad gold never examines the weight but takes light or heavy as he can get it  rho but my mistress has one fault thats almost unpardonable for being a townlady without any relation to the court yet she thinks herself undone if she be not seen there three or four times a day with the princess amalthea and for the king she haunts and watches him so narrowly in a morning that she prevents even the chemists who beset his chamber to turn their mercury into his gold  pala yet hitherto methinks you are no very unhappy man  rho with all this shes the greatest gossip in nature for besides the court shes the most eternal visitor of the town and yet manages her time so well that she seems ubiquitary for my part i can compare her to nothing but the sun for like him she takes no rest nor ever sets in one place but to rise in another  pala i confess she had need be handsome with these qualities  rho no lady can be so curious of a new fashion as she is of a new french word shes the very mint of the nation and as fast as any bullion comes out of france coins it immediately into our language  pala and her name is  rho no naming thats not like a cavalier find her if you can by my description and i am not so ill a painter that i need write the name beneath the picture  pala well then how far have you proceeded in your love  rho tis yet in the bud and what fruit it may bear i cannot tell for this insufferable humour of haunting the court is so predominant that she has hitherto broken all her assignations with me for fear of missing her visits there  pala thats the hardest part of your adventure but for aught i see fortune has used us both alike i have a strange kind of mistress too in court besides her i am to marry  rho you have made haste to be in love then for if i am not mistaken you are but this day arrived  pala thats all one i have seen the lady already who has charmed me seen her in these walks courted her and received for the first time an answer that does not put me into despair    to them argaleon amalthea and artemis  ill tell you more at leisure my adventures the walks fill apace i see stay is not that the young lord argaleon the kings favourite  rho yes and as proud as ever as ambitious and as revengeful  pala how keeps he the kings favour with these qualities  rho argaleons father helped him to the crown besides he gilds over all his vices to the king and standing in the dark to him sees all his inclinations interests and humours which he so times and soothes that in effect he reigns  pala his sister amalthea who i guess stands by him seems not to be of his temper  rho o shes all goodness and generosity  arga rhodophil the king expects you earnestly  rho tis done my lord what he commanded i only waited his return from hunting shall i attend your lordship to him  arga no i go first another way                   exit hastily  pala he seems in haste and discomposed  amal to rhod after a short whisper your friend then he must needs be of much merit  rho when he has kissed the kings hand i know hell beg the honour to kiss yours come palamede                         exeunt rhodo and pala bowing to amal  arte madam you tell me most surprising news  amal the fear of it you see has discomposed my brother but to me all that can bring my country good is welcome  arte it seems incredible that this old king whom all the world thought childless should come to search the farthest parts of sicily in hope to find an heir  amal to lessen your astonishment i will unfold some private passages of state of which you are yet ignorant know first that this polydamus who reigns unjustly gained the crown  arte somewhat of this i have confusedly heard  amal ill tell you all in brief theagenes our last great king had by his queen one only son an infant of three years old called after him theagenes the general this polydamus then married the public feasts for which were scarcely past when a rebellion in the heart of sicily called out the king to arms  arte polydamus had then a just excuse to stay behind  amal his temper was too warlike to accept it he left his bride and the new joys of marriage and followed to the field in short they fought the rebels were oercome but in the fight the too bold king received a mortal wound when he perceived his end approaching near he called the general to whose care he left his widow queen and orphan son then died  arte then false polydamus betrayed his trust  amal he did and with my fathers helpfor which heaven pardon himso gained their soldiers hearts that in a few days he was saluted king and when his crimes had impudence enough to bear the eye of day he marched his army back to syracuse but see how heaven can punish wicked men in granting their desires the news was brought him that day he was to enter it that eubulus whom his dead master had left governor was fled and with him bore away the queen and royal orphan but what more amazed him his wife now big with child and much detesting her husbands practices had willingly accompanied their flight  arte how i admire her virtue  amal what became of her and them since that was never known only some few days since a famous robber was taken with some jewels of vast price which when they were delivered to the king he knew had been his wifes with these a letter much torn and sullied but which yet he knew to be her writing  arte sure from hence he learned he had a son  amal it was not left so plain the paper only said she died in childbed but when it should have mentioned son or daughter just there it was torn off  arte madam the king    to them polydamus argaleon guard and attendants  arga the robber though thrice racked confessed no more but that he took those jewels near this place  poly but yet the circumstances strongly argue that those for whom i search are not far off  arga i cannot easily believe it  arte no you would not have it so                                    aside  poly those i employed have in the neighbouring hamlet amongst the fishers cabins made discovery of some young persons whose uncommon beauty and graceful carriage make it seem suspicious they are not what they seem i therefore sent the captain of my guards this morning early with orders to secure and bring them to me    enter rhodophil and palamede  o here he ishave you performed my will  rho sir those whom you commanded me to bring are waiting in the walks  poly conduct them hither  rho first give me leave to beg your notice of this gentleman  poly he seems to merit it his name and quality  rho palamede son to lord

first caused  leon show not my disobedience by your prayers for i must still deny you though i now appear more guilty to myself than you i have some reasons which i cannot utter that force my

saucily and indirectly what interest can you pretend in her  arga it may be sir i made her some expressions which i would not repeat because they were below my rank to one of hers  leon what did he say palmyra  palm ill tell you all first he began to look and then he sighed and then he looked again at last he said my eyes wounded his heart and after that he talked of flames and fires and such strange words that i believed he conjured  leon o my heartleave me argaleon  arga come sweet palmyra i will instruct you better in my meaning you see he would be private  leon go yourself and leave her here  arga alas shes ignorant and is not fit to entertain a prince  leon first learn whats fit for you thats to obey  arga i know my duty is to wait on you a great kings son like you ought to

shines faint and dimly here light is not half so long nor half so clear but oh when every day was yours and mine how early up what haste he made to shine  leon such golden days no prince must hope to see whose every subject is more blessed than he  palm do you remember when their tasks were done how all the youth did to our cottage run while winterwinds were whistling loud without our cheerful

awake i cannot tell when first i thought you fair but sucked in love insensibly as air  palm i know too well when first my love began when at our wake you for the chaplet ran then i was made the lady of the may and with the garland at the goal did stay still as you ran i kept you full in view i hoped and wished and ran methought for you as you came near i hastily did rise and stretched my arm outright that held the prize the custom was to kiss whom i should crown you kneeled and in my lap your head laid down i blushed and blushed and did the kiss delay at last my subjects forced me to obey but when i gave the crown and then the kiss i scarce had breath to say take thatand this  leon i felt the while a pleasing kind of smart that kiss went tingling to my very heart when it was gone the sense of it did stay the sweetness clinged upon my lips all day like drops of honey loth to fall away  palm life like a prodigal gave all his store to my first youth and now can give no more you are a

being happy loads it with a wife  palm speak quickly what have you resolved to do  leon to keep my faith inviolate to you he threatens me with exile and with shame to lose my birthright and a princes

counsel which you give were you a princess would you not be true  palm i would but cannot merit it from you  leon did you not merit as you do my heart love gives esteem and then it gives desert but if i basely could forget my vow poor helpless innocence what would you do  palm in woods and plains where first my love began there would i live retired from faithless man id sit all day within some lonely shade or that close arbour which your hands have made id search the groves and every tree to find where you had carved our names upon the rind your hook your scrip all that was yours id keep and lay them by me when i went to sleep thus would i live and maidens when i die upon my hearse white trueloveknots should tie and thus my tomb should be inscribed above here the forsaken virgin rests

imagined i should have been this fond fool i would never have married the man i loved i married to be happy and have made myself miserable by overloving nay and now my case is desperate for i have been married above these two years and find myself every day worse and worse in love nothing but madness can be the end ont  arte doat on to the extremity and you are happy  dor he deserves so infinitely much that the truth is there can be no doating in the matter but to love well i confess is a work that pays itself tis telling gold and after taking it for ones pains  rho by that i should

they are not the same to us because they cannot feed on one dish therefore we must be starved tis enough that they have a sufficient ordinary provided and a table ready spread for them if they cannot

dear pity me i am so chagrin to day and have had the most signal affront at court i went this afternoon to do my devoir to princess amalthea found her conversed with her and helped to make her court some half an hour after which she went to take the air chose out two ladies to go with her that came in after me and left me most barbarously behind her  arte you are the less to be pitied melantha because you subject yourself to these affronts by coming perpetually to court where you have no business nor employment  mel i declare i had rather of the two be rallied nay mal traitée at court than be deified in the town for assuredly nothing can be so ridicule as a mere town lady  dor especially at court how i have seen them crowd and sweat in the drawingroom on a holidaynight for thats their time to swarm and invade the presence o how they catch at a bow or any little salute from a courtier to make show of their acquaintance and rather than be thought to be quite unknown they courtsy to one another but they take true pains to come near the circle and press and peep upon the princess to write letters into the country how she was dressed while the ladies that stand about make their court to her with abusing them  arte these are sad truths melantha and therefore i would een advise you to quit the court and live either wholly in the town or if you like not that in the country  dor in the country nay thats to fall beneath the town for they live upon our offals here their entertainment of wit is only the remembrance of what they had when they were last in townthey live this year upon the last years knowledge as their cattle do all night by chewing the cud of what they eat in the afternoon  mel and they tell for news such unlikely stories a letter from one of us is such a present to them that the poor souls wait for the carriersday with such devotion that they cannot sleep the night before  arte no more than i can the night before i am to go a journey  dor or i before

friend of mine who makes songs sometimes came lately out of the west and vowed he was so put out of countenance with a song of his for at the first country gentlemans he visited he saw three tailors

like death he knows no difference in degrees but plains and levels all  palm alas i had not rendered up my heart had he not loved me first but he preferred me above the maidens of my age and rank still shunned their company and still sought mine i was not won by gifts yet still he gave and all his gifts though small yet spoke his love he picked the earliest strawberries in woods the clustered filberds and the purple grapes he taught a prating stare to speak my name and when he found a nest of nightingales or callow linnets he would show them me and let me take them out  poly this is a little mistress meanly born fit only for a princes vacant hours and then to laugh at her simplicity not fix a passion there now hear my sentence  leon remember ere you give it tis pronounced against

your meaning  her then in few words palmyra is your daughter  poly how can i give belief to this impostor he who has once abused me often may ill hear no more  arga for your own sake you must  her a parents lovefor i confess my crime moved me to say leonidas was yours but when i heard palmyra was to die the fear of guiltless blood so stung my conscience that i resolved even with my shame to save your daughters life  poly but how can i be certain but that interest which moved you first to say your son was mine does not now move you too to save your daughter  her you had but then my word i

my eyes grow full and swim in their own light   he embraces palm  palm i fear sir this is your intended pageant you sport yourself at poor palmyras cost but if you think to make me proud indeed i cannot be so i was born with humble thoughts and lowly like my birth a real fortune could not make me haughty much less a feigned  poly this was her mothers temper i have too much deserved thou shouldst suspect that i am not thy father but my love shall henceforth show i am behold my eyes and see a father there begin to flow this is not feigned palmyra  palm i doubt no longer sir you are a king and cannot lie falsehoods a vice too base to find a room in any royal breast i know in spite of my unworthiness i am your child for when you would have killed me methought i loved you then  arga sir we forget the prince leonidas his greatness should not stand neglected thus  poly guards you may now retire give him his sword and leave him free  leon then the first use i make of liberty shall

this act of your obedience you should kneel to nothing but to heaven and to a king  leon i never shall forget what nature owes nor be ashamed to pay it though my father be not a king i know him brave and honest and well deserving of a worthier son  poly he bears it gallantly  leon why would you not instruct me sir before        to herm where i should place my duty from which if ignorance have made me swerve i beg your pardon for an erring son  palm i almost grieve i am a princess since it makes him lose a crown  leon and next to you my king thus low i kneel to implore your mercy if in that small time i had the honour to be thought your son i paid not strict obedience to your will i thought indeed i should not be compelled but thought it as your son so what i took in duty from you i restored in courage because your son should not be forced  poly you have my pardon for it  leon to you fair princess i congratulate your birth of which i ever thought you worthy and give me leave to add that i am proud the gods have picked me out to be the man by whose dejected fate yours is to rise because no man could more desire your fortune or franklier part with his to make you great  palm i know the king though you are not his son will still regard you as my fosterbrother and so conduct you downward from a throne by slow degrees so unperceived and soft that it may seem no fall or if it be may fortune lay a bed of down beneath you  poly he shall be ranked with my nobility and kept from scorn by a large pension given him  leon you are all great and royal in your gifts          bowing but at the donors feet i lay them down should i take riches from you it would seem as i did want a soul to bear that poverty to which the gods designed my humble birth and should i take your honours without merit it would appear i wanted manly courage to hope them in your service from my sword  poly still brave and like yourself the court shall shine this night in its full splendour and celebrate this new discovery argaleon lead my daughter as we go i shall have time to give her my commands in which you are concerned                exeunt all but leonidas  leon methinks i do not want that huge long train of fawning followers that swept a furlong after me tis true i am alone so was the godhead ere he made the world and better served himself than served by nature and yet i have a soul above this humble fate i could command love to do good give largely to true merit all that a king should do but though these are not my province i have scene enough within to exercise my virtue all that a heart so fixed as mine can move is that my niggard fortune starves my love                  exit   scene ii    palamede and doralice meet she with a book in her hand seems   to start at the sight of

 pala yes and you see i have observed my cue exactly i am come to relieve you from them come shut up shut up your book the mans come who is to supply all your necessities  dor then it seems you are so impudent to think it was an assignation this i warrant was your lewd interpretation of my innocent meaning  pala venus forbid that i should harbour so unreasonable a thought of a fair young lady that you should lead me hither into temptation i confess i might think indeed it was a kind of honourable challenge to meet privately without seconds and decide the difference betwixt the two sexes but heaven forgive me if i thought amiss  dor you thought too ill lay my life ont that you might as well make love to me as my husband does to your mistress  pala i was so unreasonable to think so too  dor and then you wickedly inferred that there was some justice in the revenge of it or at least but little injury for a man to endeavour to enjoy that which he accounts a blessing and which is not valued as it ought by the dull possessor confess your wickednessdid you not think so  pala i confess i was thinking so as fast as i could but you think so much before me that you will let me think nothing  dor tis the very thing that i designed i have forestalled all your arguments and left you without a word more to plead for mercy if you have any thing farther to offer ere sentence passpoor animal i brought you hither only for my diversion  pala that you may have if youll make use of me the right way but i tell thee woman i am now past talking  dor but it may be i came hither to hear what fine things you could say for yourself  pala you would be very angry to my knowledge if i should lose so much time to say many of themby this hand you would  dor fye palamede i am a woman of honour  pala i see you are you have kept touch with your assignation and before we part you shall find that i am a man of honour yet i have one scruple of conscience  dor i warrant you will not want some naughty argument or other to satisfy yourselfi hope you are afraid of betraying your friend  pala of betraying my friend i am more afraid of being betrayed by you to my friend you women now are got into the way of telling first yourselves a man who has any care of his reputation will be loth to trust it with you  dor o you charge your faults upon our sex you men are like cocks you never make love but you clap your wings and crow when you have done  pala nay rather you women are like hens you never lay but you cackle an hour after to discover your nestbut ill venture it for once  dor to convince you that you are in the wrong ill retire into the dark grotto to my devotion and make so little noise that it shall be impossible for you to find me  pala but if i find you  dor ay if you

scandalous ill go no further besides you have a sweet lady of your own  rho but a sweet mistress now and then makes my sweet lady so much more sweet  mel i hope you will not force me  rho but i will

heard you were here alone and could not in civility but bring her to you  mel youll pardon the effects of a passion which i may now avow for you if it transported me beyond the rules of bienseance  pala but who told you i was here they that told you that may tell you more for aught i know  rho o for that matter we had intelligence  pala but let me tell you we came hither so very privately that you could not trace us  rho us what us you are alone  pala us the devils in me for mistakingme i meant or us that is you are me or i you as we are friends thats us  dor palamede palamede

am resolved to see whos there ill not be daunted with a bugbear thats certainprithee dispute it not it shall be so nay do not put me to swear but go quickly theres an effort of pure friendship for you now    enter doralice and looks amazed seeing them  rho doralice i am thunderstruck to see you here  pala so am i quite thunderstruck was it you that called me withini must be impudent  rho how came you hither spouse  pala ay how came you hither and which is more how could you be here without my knowledge  dor to her husband o gentlemen have i caught you ifaith have i broke forth in ambush upon you i thought my suspicions would prove true  rho suspicions this is very fine spouse prithee what suspicions  dor o you feign ignorance why of you and melantha here have i staid these two hours waiting with all the rage of a passionate loving wife but infinitely jealous to take you two in the manner for hither i was certain you would come  rho but you are mistaken spouse in the occasion for we came hither on purpose to find palamede on intelligence he was gone before  pala ill be hanged then if the same party who gave you intelligence i was here did not tell your wife you would come hither now i smell the malice ont on both sides  dor was it so think you nay then ill confess my part of the malice too as soon as ever i spied my husband and melantha come together i had a strange temptation to make him jealous in revenge and that made me call palamede palamede as though there had been an intrigue between us  mel nay i avow there was an appearance of an intrigue between us too  pala to see how things will come about  rho and was it only thus my dear doralice             embrace  dor and did i wrong nown rhodophil with a false suspicion                                                      embracing him  pala aside now i am confident we had all four the same design tis a pretty odd kind of game this where each of us plays for double stakes this is just thrust and parry with the same motion i am to get his wife and yet to guard my own mistress but i am vilely suspicious that while i conquer in the right wing i shall be routed in the left for both our women will certainly betray their party because they are each of them for gaining of two as well as we and i much fear    if their necessities and ours were known   they have more need of two than we of one                                      exeunt embracing one another   act iv scene i    enter leonidas musing amalthea following him  amal yonder he is and i must speak or die and yet tis death to speak yet he must know i have a passion for him and may know it with a less blush because to offer it to his low fortunes shows i loved before his person not his greatness  leon first scorned and now commanded from the court the king is good but he is wrought to this by proud argaleons malice what more disgrace can love and fortune join to inflict upon one man i cannot now behold my dear palmyra she perhaps too is grown ashamed of a mean illplaced love  amal assist me venus for i tremble when i am to speak but i must force myself                      aside sir i would crave but one short minute with you and some few words  leon the proud argaleons sister                         aside  amal alas it will not out shame stops my mouth                                                              aside pardon my error sir i was mistaken and took you for another  leon in spite of all his guards ill see palmyra        aside though meanly born i have a kingly soul  amal i stand upon a precipice where fain i would retire but love still thrusts me on now i grow bolder and will speak to him                    aside sir tis indeed to you that i would speak and if  leon o you are sent to scorn my fortunes your sex and beauty are your privilege but should your brother  amal now he looks angry and i dare not speak i had some business with you sir but tis not worth your knowledge  leon then twill be charity to let me mourn my griefs alone for i am much disordered  amal twill be more charity to mourn them with you heaven knows i pity you  leon your pity madam is generous but tis unavailable  amal you know not till tis tried your sorrows are no secret you have lost a crown and mistress  leon are not these enough hang two such weights on any other soul and see if it can bear them  amal more you are banished by my brothers means and neer must hope again to see your princess except as prisoners view fair walks and streets and careless passengers going by their grates to make them feel the want of liberty but worse than all the king this morning has enjoined his daughter to accept my brothers love  leon is this your pity you aggravate my griefs and print them deeper in new and heavier stamps  amal tis as physicians show the desperate ill to endear their art by mitigating pains they cannot wholly cure when you despair of all you wish some part of it because unhoped for may be grateful and some other  leon what other  amal some other may my shame again has seized me and i can go                   aside no farther  leon these often failing sighs and interruptions make me imagine you have grief like mine have you neer loved  amal i nevertis in vain i must despair in silence                                   aside  leon you come as i suspected then to mock at least observe my griefs take it not ill that i must leave you                                    is going  amal you must not go with these unjust opinions command my life and fortunes you are wise think and think well what i can do to serve you  leon i have but one thing in my thoughts and wishes if by your means i can obtain the sight of my adored palmyra or whats harder one minutes time to tell her i die hers       she starts back i see i am not to expect it from you nor could indeed with reason  amal name any other thing is amalthea so despicable she can serve your wishes in this alone  leon if i should ask of heaven i have no other suit  amal to show you then i can deny you nothing though tis more hard to me than any other yet i will do it for you  leon name quickly name the means speak my good angel  amal be not so much oerjoyed for if you are ill rather die than dot this night the court will be in masquerade you shall attend on me in that disguise you may both see and speak to her if you dare venture it  leon yes were a god her guardian and bore in each hand thunder i would venture  amal farewell then two hours hence i will expect you my hearts so full that i can stay no longer                exit  leon already it grows dusky ill prepare with haste for my disguise but who are these    enter hermogenes and eubulus  her tis he we need not fear to speak to him  eub leonidas  leon sure i have known that voice  her you have some reason sir tis eubulus who bred you with the princess and departing bequeathed you to my care  leon my fosterfather let my knees express my joys for your return                                  kneeling  eub rise sir you must not kneel  leon eer since you left me i have been wandering in a maze of fate led by false fires of a fantastic glory and the vain lustre of imagined crowns but ah why would you leave me or how could you absent yourself so long  eub ill give you a most just account of both and something more i have to tell you which i know must cause your wonder but this place though almost hid in darkness is not safe already i discern some coming towards us            torches appear with lights who may discover me hermogenes your lodgings are hard by and much more private  her there you may freely speak  leon let us make haste for some affairs and of no small importance call me another way                                        exeunt   scene ii    enter palamede and rhodophil with vizor masques in their   hands and torches before them  pala we shall have noble sport tonight rhodophil this masquerading is a most glorious invention  rho i believe it was invented first by some jealous lover to discover the haunts of his jilting mistress or perhaps by some distressed servant to gain an opportunity with a jealous mans wife  pala no it must be the invention of a woman it has so much of subtilty and love in it  rho i am sure tis extremely pleasant for to go unknown is the next degree to going invisible  pala what with our antic habits and feigned voicesdo you know me andi know youmethinks we move and talk just like so many overgrown puppets  rho masquerade is only vizormask improved a heightening of the same fashion  pala no masquerade is vizormask in debauch and i like it the better fort for with a vizormask we fool ourselves into courtship for the sake of an eye that glanced or a hand that stole itself out of the glove sometimes to give us a sample of the skin but in masquerade there is nothing to be known shes all terra incognita and the bold discoverer leaps ashore and takes his lot among the wild indians and savages without the vile consideration of safety to his person or of beauty or wholesomeness in his mistress    enter beliza  rho beliza what make you here  bel sir my lady sent me after you to let you know she finds herself a little indisposed so that she cannot be at court but is retired to rest in her own apartment where she shall want the happiness of your dear embraces to night  rho a very fine phrase beliza to let me know my wife desires to lie alone  pala i doubt rhodophil you take the pains sometimes to instruct your wifes woman in these elegancies  rho tell my dear lady that since i must be so unhappy as not to wait on her tonight i will lament bitterly for her absence tis true i shall be at court but i will take no divertisement there and when i return to my solitary bed if i am so forgetful of my passion as to sleep i will dream of her and betwixt sleep and waking put out my foot towards her side for midnight consolation and not finding her i will sigh and imagine myself a most desolate widower  bel i shall do your commands sir                         exit  rho aside shes sick as aptly for my purpose as if she had contrived it so well if ever woman was a helpmate for man my spouse is so for within this hour i received a note from melantha that she would meet me this evening in masquerade in boys habit to rejoice with me before she entered into fetters for i find she loves me better than palamede only because hes to be her husband theres something of antipathy in the word marriage to the nature of love marriage is the mere ladle of affection that cools it when tis never so fiercely boiling over  pala dear rhodophil i must needs beg your pardon there is an occasion fallen out which i had forgot i cannot be at court tonight  rho dear palamede i am sorry we shall not have one course together at the herd but i find your game lies single good fortune to you with your mistress                                           exit  pala he has wished me good

before that wooing was so laborious an exercise if she were worth a million i have deserved her and now methinks too with taking all this pains for her i begin to like her tis so i have known many who never cared for hare nor partridge but those they caught themselves would eat heartily the pains and the story a man tells of the taking them makes the meat go down more pleasantly besides last night i had a sweet dream of her and gad she i have once dreamed of i am stark mad till i enjoy her let her be never so ugly    enter doralice  dor whos that you are so mad to enjoy palamede  pala you may easily imagine that sweet dorarlice  dor more easily than you think i can i met just now with a certain man who came to you with letters from a certain old gentleman ycleped your father whereby i am given to understand that tomorrow you are to take an oath in the church to be grave henceforward to go illdressed and slovenly to get heirs for your estate and to dandle them for your diversion and in short that love and courtship are to be no more  pala now have i so much shame to be thus apprehended in the manner that i can neither speak nor look upon you i have abundance of grace in me that i find but if you have any spark of true friendship in you retire with me a little into the next room that hath a couch or bed in it and bestow your charity upon a dying man a little comfort from a mistress before a man is going to give himself in marriage is as good as a lusty dose of strongwater to a dying malefactor it takes away the sense of hell and hanging from him  dor no good palamede i must not be so injurious to your bride tis ill drawing from the bank today when all your ready money is payable tomorrow  pala a wife is only to have the ripe fruit that falls of itself but a wise man will always preserve a shaking for a mistress  dor but a wife for the first quarter is a mistress  pala but when the second comes  dor when it does come you are so given to variety that you would make a wife of me in another quarter  pala no never except i were married to you married people can never oblige one another for all they do is duty and consequently there can be no thanks but love is more frank and generous than he is honest hes a liberal giver but a cursed paymaster  dor i declare i will have no gallant but if i would he should never be a married man a married man is but a mistresss halfservant as a clergyman is but the kings halfsubject for a man to come to me that smells of the wife slife i would as soon wear her old gown after her as her husband  pala yet tis a kind of fashion to wear a princesss cast shoes you see the country ladies buy them to be fine in them  dor yes a princesss shoes may be worn after her because they keep their fashion by being so very little used but generally a married man is the creature of the world the most out of fashion his behaviour is dumpish his discourse his wife and family his habit so much neglected it looks as if that were married too his hat is married his peruke is married his breeches are marriedand if we could look within his breeches we should find him married there too  pala am i then to be discarded for ever pray do but mark how that word sounds for ever it has a very damnd sound doralice  dor ay for ever it sounds as hellishly to me as it can do to you but theres no help for it  pala yet if we had but once enjoyed one anotherbut then once only is worse than not at all it leaves a man with such a lingering after it  dor for aught i know tis better that we have not we might upon trial have liked each other less as many a man and woman that have loved as desperately as we and yet when they came to possession have sighed and cried to themselves is this all  pala that is only if the servant were not found a man of this world but if upon trial we had not liked each other we had certainly left loving and faith thats the greater happiness of the two  dor tis better as tis we have drawn off already as much of our love as would run clear after possessing the rest is but jealousies and disquiets and quarrelling and piecing  pala nay after one great quarrel theres never any sound piecing the love is apt to break in the same place again  dor i declare i would never renew a love thats like him who trims an old coach for ten years together he might buy a new one better cheap  pala well madam i am convinced that tis best for us not to have enjoyed but gad the strongest reason is because i cant help it  dor the only way to keep us new to one another is never to enjoy as they keep grapes by hanging them upon a line they must touch nothing if you would preserve them fresh  pala but then they wither and grow dry in the very keeping however i shall have a warmth for you and an eagerness every time i see you and if i chance to outlive melantha  dor and if i chance to outlive rhodophil  pala well ill cherish my body as much as i can upon that hope tis true i would not directly murder the wife of my bosom but to kill her civilly by the way of kindness ill put as fair as another man ill begin tomorrow night and be very wrathful with her thats resolved on  dor well palamede heres my hand ill venture to be your second wife for all your threatenings  pala in the mean time ill watch you hourly as i would the ripeness of a melon and i hope youll give me leave now and then to look on you and to see if you are not ready to be cut yet  dor no no that must not be palamede for fear the gardener should come and catch you taking up the glass    enter rhodophil  rho aside billing so sweetly now i am confirmed in my suspicions i must put an end to this ere it go fartherto doralice cry you mercy spouse i fear i have interrupted your recreations  dor what recreations  rho nay no excuses good spouse

would you have debauched my mistress  rho what do you think of that civil couple that played at a game called hide and seek last evening in the grotto  pala what do you think of that innocent pair who made it their pretence to seek for others but came indeed to hide themselves there  rho all things considered i begin vehemently to suspect that the young gentleman i found in your company last night was a certain youth of my acquaintance  pala and i have an odd imagination that you could never have suspected my small gallant if your little villainous frenchman had not been a false brother  rho further arguments are needless draw off i shall speak to you now by the way of bilbo             claps his hand to his sword  pala and i shall answer you by the way of dangerfield2

marry  rho and he courts you whom i have married  dor but you can neither of you be jealous of what you love not  rho faith i am jealous and this makes me partly suspect that i love you better than i thought  dor pish a mere jealousy of honour  rho gad i am afraid theres something else int for palamede has wit and if he loves you theres something more in ye than i have found some rich mine for aught i know that i have not yet discovered  pala slife whats this heres an argument for me to love melantha for he has loved her and he has wit too and for aught i know there may be a mine but if there be i am resolved ill dig for it  dor to rhodophil then i have found my account in raising your jealousy o tis the most delicate sharp sauce to a cloyed stomach it will give you a new edge

faith consider if i have played false you can never find it out by any experiment you can make upon me  rho no why suppose i had a delicate screwed gun if i left her clean and found her foul i should discover to my cost she had been shot in  dor but if you left her clean and found her only rusty you would discover to your shame she was only so for want of shooting  pala rhodophil you know me too well to imagine i speak for fear and therefore in consideration of our past friendship i will tell you and bind it by all things holy that doralice is innocent  rho friend i will believe you and vow the same for your melantha but the devil ont is how shall we keep them so  pala what dost think of a blessed community betwixt us four for the solace of the women and relief of the men methinks it would be a pleasant kind of life wife and husband for the standing dish and mistress and gallant for the desert  rho but suppose the wife and mistress should both long for the standing dish how should they be satisfied together  pala in such a case they must draw lots and yet that would not do neither for they would both be wishing for the longest cut  rho then i think palamede we had as good make a firm league not to invade each others propriety  pala content say i from henceforth let all acts of hostility cease betwixt us and that in the usual form of treaties as well by sea as land and in

our poet would not run   though twas well offered there was nothing done   he would not quite the womens frailty bare   but stript them to the waist and left them there   and the mens faults are less severely shown   for he considers that himself is one   some stabbing wits to bloody satire bent   would treat both sexes with less compliment   would lay the scene at home of husbands tell   for wenches taking up their wives i the mall   and a brisk bout which each of them did want   made by mistake of mistress and gallant   our modest author thought it was enough   to cut you off a sample of the stuff   he spared my shame which you im sure would not   for you were all for driving on the plot   you sighed when i came in to break the sport   and set your teeth when each design fell short

                       the assignation  this play was unfortunate in the representation it is needless at the distance of more than a century to investigate the grounds of the dislike of an audience who perhaps could at the very time have given no good reason for their capricious condemnation of a play not worse than many others which they received with applause the author in the dedication hints at the lameness of the action but as the poet and performers are nearly equally involved in the disgrace of a condemned piece it is a very natural desire on either side to assign the cause of its failure to the imperfections of the other of which there is a ludicrous representation in a dialogue betwixt the player and the poet in joseph andrews another cause of its unfavourable reception seems to have been its second title of love in a nunnery dryden certainly could last of any man have been justly suspected of an intention to ridicule the duke of york and the catholic religion yet as he fell under the same censure for the spanish friar it seems probable that such suspicions were actually entertained the play certainly contains in the present instance nothing to justify them in point of merit the assignation seems pretty much on a level with drydens other comedies and certainly the spectators who had received the blunders of sir martin marall with such unbounded applause might have taken some interest in those of poor benito perhaps the absurd and vulgar scene in which the prince pretends a fit of the cholic had some share in occasioning the fall of the piece this inelegant jeu de theatre is severely ridiculed in the rehearsal  to one person the damnation of this play seems to have afforded exquisite pleasure this was edward ravenscroft once a member of the middle templean ingenious gentleman of whose taste it may be held a satisfactory instance that he deemed the tragedy of titus andronicus too mild for representation and generously added a few more murders rapes and parricides to that charnelhouse of horrors1 his turn for comedy being at least equal to his success in the bloodstained buskin mr ravenscroft translated and mangled several of the more farcical french comedies which he decorated with the lustre of his own great name amongst others which he thus appropriated were the most extravagant and buffoon scenes in molieres bourgeois gentilhomme in which monsieur jourdain is with much absurd ceremony created a turkish paladin and where moliere took the opportunity to introduce an entrée de ballet danced and sung by the mufti dervises and others in eastern habits ravenscrofts translation entitled the citizen turned gentleman was acted in 1672 and printed in the same year the jargon of the songs like similar nonsense of our own day seems to have been well received on the stage dryden who was not always above feeling indignation at the bad taste and unjust preferences of the age attacked ravenscroft in the prologue to the assignation as he had before though less directly in that of marriage alamode hence the exuberant and unrepressed joy of that miserable scribbler broke forth upon the damnation of drydens performance in the following passage of a prologue to another of his pilfered performances called the careless lovers acted according to langbaine in the vacation succeeding the fall of the assignation in 1673    an author did to please you let his wit run   of late much on a serving man and cittern   and yet you would not like the serenade   nay and you damned his nuns in masquerade   you did his spanish singsong too abhor   ah que locura con tanto rigor   in fine the whole by you so much was blamed   to act their parts the players were ashamed2   ah how severe your malice was that day   to damn at once the poet and his play3   but why was your rage just at that time shown   when what the author writ was all his own   till then he borrowed from romance and did translate4   and those plays found a more indulgent fate  ravenscroft however seems to have given the first offence for in the prologue to the citizen turned gentleman licensed 9th august 1672 we find the following lines obviously levelled at the conquest of granada and other heroic dramas of our author    then shall the knight that had a knock ins cradle   such as sir martin and sir arthur addle5   be flocked unto as the great heroes now   in plays of rhyme and noise with wondrous show   then shall the house to see these hectors kill and slay   that bravely fight out the whole plot of the play   be for at least six months full every day  langbaine who quotes the lines from the prologue to ravenscrofts careless lovers is of opinion that he paid dryden too great a compliment in admitting the originality of the assignation and labours to shew that the characters are imitated from the romance comique of scarron and other novels of the time but langbaine seems to have been unable to comprehend that originality consists in the mode of treating a subject more than in the subject itself  the assignation was acted in 1672 and printed in 1673   footnotes  1 in the prologue to this beautified edition ravenscroft modestly    tells us       like other poets hell not proudly scorn      to own that he but winnowed shakespeares corn      so far was he from robbing him ofs treasure      that he did add his own to make full measure  2 this looks as if there had been some ground for drydens censure    upon the actors  3 a flat parody on the lines in drydens prologue referring to    mamamouchi       grimace and habit sent you pleased away      you damned the poet but cried up the play  4 it is somewhat remarkable that the censure contained in what is    above printed like verses recoils upon the head of the author who    never wrote a single original performance langbaine the    persecutor of all plagiarism though he did not know very well in    what it consisted threatens to pull off ravenscrofts disguise    and discover the politic plagiary that lurks under it i know    continues the biographer he has endeavoured to shew himself    master of the art of swift writing and would persuade the world    that what he writes is extempore wit and written currente    calamo but i doubt not to shew that though he would be thought    to imitate the silkworm that spins its web from its own bowels    yet i shall make him appear like the leech that lives upon the    blood of other men drawn from the gums and when he is rubbed    with salt spews it up again  5 sir martin marall we are acquainted with sir arthur addle is a    similar character in a play called sir solomon or the cautious    coxcomb attributed to one john caryll                                       to                         my most honoured friend                       sir charles sedley bart1   sir  the design of dedicating plays is as common and unjust as that of desiring seconds in a duel it is engaging our friends it may be in a senseless quarrel where they have much to venture without any concernment of their own2 i have declared thus much beforehand to prevent you from suspicion that i intend to interest either your judgment or your kindness in defending the errors of this comedy it succeeded ill in the representation against the opinion of many of the best judges of our age to whom you know i read it ere it was presented publicly whether the fault was in the play itself or in the lameness of the action or in the number of its enemies who came resolved to damn it for the title i will not now dispute that would be too like the little satisfaction which an unlucky gamester finds in the relation of every cast by which he came to lose his money i have had formerly so much success that the miscarriage of this play was only my giving fortune her revenge i owed it her and she was indulgent that she exacted not the payment long before i will therefore deal more reasonably with you than any poet has ever done with any patron i do not so much as oblige you for my sake to pass two ill hours in reading of my play think if you please that this dedication is only an occasion i have taken to do myself the greatest honour imaginable with posterity that is to be recorded in the number of those men whom you have favoured with your friendship and esteem for i am well assured that besides the present satisfaction i have it will gain me the greatest part of my reputation with after ages when they shall find me valuing myself on your kindness to me i may have reason to suspect my own credit with them but i have none to doubt of yours and they who perhaps would forget me in my poems would remember me in this epistle  this was the course which has formerly been practised by the poets of that nation who were masters of the universe horace and ovid who had little reason to distrust their immortality yet took occasion to speak with honour of virgil varius tibullus and propertius their contemporaries as if they sought in the testimony of their friendship a farther evidence of their fame for my own part i who am the least amongst the poets have yet the fortune to be honoured with the best patron and the best friend for to omit some great persons of our court to whom i am many ways obliged and who have taken care of me even amidst the exigencies of a war3 i can make my boast to have found a better mæcenas in the person of my lord treasurer clifford4 and a more elegant tibullus in that of sir charles sedley i have chosen that poet to whom i would resemble you not only because i think him at least equal if not superior to ovid in his elegies nor because of his quality for he was you know a roman knight as well as ovid but for his candour his wealth his way of living and particularly because of this testimony which is given him by horace which i have a thousand times in my mind applied to you    non tu corpus eras sine pectore dii tibi formam   dii tibi divitias dederant artemque fruendi   quid voveat dulci nutricula majus alumno   quam sapere et fari possit quæ sentiat et cui   gratia forma valetudo contingat abunde   et mundus victus non deficiente crumena  certainly the poets of that age enjoyed much happiness in the conversation and friendship of one another they imitated the best way of living which was to pursue an innocent and inoffensive pleasure that which one of the ancients called eruditam voluptatem we have like them our genial nights where our discourse is neither too serious nor too light but always pleasant and for the most part instructive the raillery neither too sharp upon the present nor too censorious on the absent and the cups only such as will raise the conversation of the night without disturbing the business of the morrow5 and thus far not only the philosophers but the fathers of the church have gone without lessening their reputation of good manners or of piety for this reason i have often laughed at the ignorant and ridiculous descriptions which some pedants have given of the wits as they are pleased to call them which are a generation of men as unknown to them as the people of tartary or the terra australia are to us and therefore as we draw giants and anthropophagi in those vacancies of our maps where we have not travelled to discover better so those wretches paint lewdness atheism folly illreasoning and all manner of extravagancies amongst us for want of understanding what we are oftentimes it so falls out that they have a particular pique to some one amongst us and then they immediately interest heaven in their quarrel as it is an usual trick in courts when one designs the ruin of his enemy to disguise his malice with some concernment of the kings and to revenge his own cause with pretence of vindicating the honour of his master such wits as they describe i have never been so unfortunate as to meet in your company but have often heard much better reasoning at your table than i have encountered in their books the wits they describe are the fops we banish for blasphemy and atheism if they were neither sin nor ill manners are subjects so very common and worn so threadbare that people who have sense avoid them for fear of being suspected to have none it calls the good name of their wit in question as it does the credit of a citizen when his shop is filled with trumperies and painted titles instead of wares we conclude them bankrupt to all manner of understanding and that to use blasphemy is a kind of applying pigeons to the soles of the feet it proclaims their fancy as well as judgment to be in a desperate condition i am sure for your own particular if any of these judges had once the happiness to converse with youto hear the candour of your opinions how freely you commend that wit in others of which you have so large a portion yourself how unapt you are to be censorious with how much easiness you speak so many things and those so pointed that no other man is able to excel or perhaps to reach by studythey would instead of your accusers become your proselytes they would reverence so much sense and so much good nature in the same person and come like the satyr to warm themselves at that fire of which they were ignorantly afraid when they stood at a distance but you have too great a reputation to be wholly free from censure it is a fine which fortune sets upon all extraordinary persons and from which you should not wish to be delivered until you are dead i have been used by my critics much more severely and have more reason to complain because i am deeper taxed for a less estate i am ridiculously enough accused to be a contemner of universities that is in other words an enemy of learning without the foundation of which i am sure no man can pretend to be a poet and if this be not enough i am made a detractor from my predecessors whom i confess to have been my masters in the art but this latter was the accusation of the best judge and almost the best poet in the latin tongue you find horace complaining that for taxing some verses in lucilius he himself was blamed by others though his design was no other than mine now to improve the knowledge of poetry and it was no defence to him amongst his enemies any more than it is for me that he praised lucilius where he deserved it paginâ laudatur eâdem it is for this reason i will be no more mistaken for my good meaning i know i honour ben jonson more than my little critics because without vanity i may own i understand him better6 as for the errors they pretend to find in me i could easily show them that the greatest part of them are beauties and for the rest i could recriminate upon the best poets of our nation if i could resolve to accuse another of little faults whom at the same time i admire for greater excellencies but i have neither concernment enough upon me to write any thing in my own defence neither will i gratify the ambition of two wretched scribblers who desire nothing more than to be answered i have not wanted friends even among strangers who have defended me more strongly than my contemptible pedant could attack me7 for the other he is only like fungoso in the play who follows the fashion at a distance and adores the fastidious brisk of oxford8 you can bear me witness that i have not consideration enough for either of them to be angry let mævius and bavius admire each other i wish to be hated by them and their fellows by the same reason for which i desire to be loved by you and i leave it to the world whether their judgment of my poetry ought to be preferred to yours though they are as much prejudiced by their malice as i desire you should be led by your kindness to be partial to    sir      your most humble       and most faithful servant         john dryden   footnotes  1 sir charles sedley noted among the mob of gentlemen who wrote    with ease was so highly applauded for his taste and judgment    that charles said nature had given him a patent to be apollos    viceroy some account has been given of this celebrated courtier    in the introduction to the essay on dramatic poetry dryden was at    this time particularly induced to appeal to the taste of the first    among the gay world by the repeated censures which had been    launched against him from the groves of academe mr malone gives    the titles of three pamphlets which had appeared against dryden    1 the censure of the rota on mr drydens conquest of granada    printed at oxford 2 a description of the academy of the athenian    virtuoso with a discourse held there in vindication of mr drydens    conquest of granada against the author of the censure of the rota    3 a friendly vindication of mr dryden from the author of the    censure of the rota printed at cambridge thus assailed by the    grave and the learned censured for the irregularities of his gay    patrons which he countenanced although he did not partake and    stigmatized as a detractor of his predecessors and a defamer of    classical learning it was natural for dryden to appeal to the most    accomplished of those amongst whom he lived and to whose taste he    was but too strongly compelled to adapt his productions sedley    therefore as a man of wit and gallantry is called upon to support    our author against the censures of pedantic severity whatever may    be thought of the subject the appeal is made with all drydens    spirit and elegance and his description of the attic evenings    spent with sedley and his gay associates glosses over and almost    justifies their occasional irregularities we have but too often    occasion to notice with censure the licentious manners of the    giddy court of charles let us not omit its merited commendation    if the talents of the men of parts of that period were often    illdirected and illrewarded let not us from whom that    gratitude is justly due forget that they were called forth and    stimulated to exertion by the countenance and applause of the    great we at least who enjoy the fruit of these exertions ought    to rejoice that the courtiers of charles possessed the taste to    countenance and applaud the genius which was too often perverted    by the profligacy of their example and left unrewarded amid their    selfish prodigality  2 at this period seconds in a duel fought as well as principals  3 the second dutch war then raging  4 to whom the tragedy of amboyna is dedicated  5 it is impossible to avoid contrasting this beautiful account of    elegant dissipation with the noted freak of sir charles sedley to    whom it is addressed in june 1663 being in company with lord    buckhurst and sir thomas ogle in a tavern in bowstreet and having    become furious with intoxication they not only exposed themselves    by committing the grossest indecencies in the balcony in the sight    of the passengers but a mob being thus collected sedley stripped    himself naked and proceeded to harangue them in the grossest and    most impious language the indignation of the populace being    excited they attempted to burst into the house and a desperate    riot ensued in which the orator and his companions had nearly paid    for their frolic with their lives for this riot they were indicted    in the court of common pleas and heavily fined sedley in the sum    of l 500 when the lord chief justice sir robert hyde to repress    his insolence asked him if he had ever read the complete    gentleman sedley answered that he had read more books than his    lordship a repartee which exhibits more effrontery than wit the    culprits employed killigrew and another courtier to solicit a    mitigation of the fine but in the true spirit of court    friendship they begged it for themselves and extorted every    farthing  6 our author here shortly repeats what he has said at more length in    his defence of the epilogue to the second part of the conquest of    granada  7 the pedant mr malone conjectures to be matthew clifford master of    the charterhouse one of the duke of buckinghams colleagues in    writing the rehearsal but the pedant is obviously the same    with the fastidious brisk of oxford mentioned in the following    sentence which can hardly apply to clifford who was educated at    cambridge one leigh is said by wood to have written the censure of    the rota and as he was educated at oxford and the book printed    there he may be the contemptible pedant though his profession    was that of a player in the dukes company  8 fungoso and sir fastidious brisk are two characters in every man    out of his humour the former of whom is represented as copying    the dress and manners of the latter dryden seems only to mean    that one of those pamphleteers was the servile imitator of the    other                                   prologue     prologues like bells to churches toll you in   with chiming verse till the dull plays begin   with this sad difference though of pit and pew   you damn the poet but the priest damns you   but priests can treat you at your own expence   and gravely call you fools without offence   poets poor devils have neer your folly shown   but to their cost you proved it was their own   for when a fops presented on the stage   straight all the coxcombs in the town engage   for his deliverance and revenge they join   and grunt like hogs about their captive swine   your poets daily split upon this shelf   you must have fools yet none will have himself   or if in kindness you that leave would give   no man could write you at that rate you live   for some of you grow fops with so much haste   riot in nonsense and commit such waste   twould ruin poets should they spend so fast   he who made this observed what farces hit   and durst not disoblige you now with wit   but gentlemen you overdo the mode   you must have fools out of the common road   th unnatural strained buffoon is only taking   no fop can please you now of gods own making   pardon our poet if he speaks his mind   you come to plays with your own follies lined   small fools fall on you like small showers in vain   your own oiled

my damned master should call a man of my extraordinary endowments sirrah a man of my endowments gad i ask my own pardon i mean a person of my endowments for a man of my parts and talents though he be but a valet de chambre is a person and let me tell my mastergad i frown too as like a person as any jackgentleman of them all but gad when i do not frown i am an absolute beauty whatever this glass says to the contrary and if this glass deny it tis a base lying glass so ill tell it to its face and kick it down into the bargain  aur within why benito how long shall we stay for you  ben i come sirwhat the devil would he have but by his favour ill first survey my dancing and my singing he plays on his guitar and dances and sings to the glass i think that was not amiss i think so gad i can dance lays down the guitar and play no longer i am in such a rapture with myself what a villanous fate have i with all these excellencies and a profound wit and yet to be a servingman    enter aurelian and camillo  aur why you slave you dog you son of twenty fathers am i to be served at this rate eternally a pox of your conceited coxcomb  cam nay prythee aurelian be not angry  aur you do not know this rogue as i do camillo now by this guitar and that great lookingglass i am certain how he has spent his time he courts himself every morning in that glass at least an hour there admires his own person and his parts and studies postures and grimaces to make himself yet more ridiculous than he was born to be  cam you wrong him sure  aur i do for he is yet more fool than i can speak him i never sent him on a message but he runs first to that glass to practise how he may become his errand speak is this a lie sirrah  ben i confess i have some kindness for the mirror  aur the mirror theres a touch of his poetry too he could not call it a glass then the rogue has the impudence to make sonnets as he calls them and which is greater impudence he sings them too theres not a street in all rome which he does not nightly disquiet with his villanous serenade with that guitar there the younger brother of a cittern he frights away the watch and for his violin it squeaks so lewdly that sir tibert1 in the gutter mistakes him for his mistress tis a mere catcall  cam is this true benito  ben to cam aside my master sir may say his pleasure i divert myself sometimes with hearing him alas good gentleman tis not given to all persons to penetrate into mens parts and qualities but i look on you sir as a man of judgment and therefore you shall hear me play and sing          he takes up the

occasion for him  aur i think that was well kicked  ben and i think that was well sung too  cam enough aurelian  ben no sir let him proceed to discourage virtue and see what will come on it  cam now to our business but we must first instruct benito  aur be ruled by me and do not trust him i prophesy hell spoil the whole affair he has a worm in his head as long as a conger a brain so barren of all sense and yet so fruitful of foolish plots that if he does not all things his own way yet at least hell ever be mingling his designs with yours and go halves with you so that what with his ignorance what with his plotting hell be sure to ruin you with an intention to serve you for my part i had turned him off long since but that my wise father commanded the contrary  cam still you speak as if what we did were choice and not necessity you know their uncle is suspicious of me and consequently jealous of all my servants but if we employ yours who is not suspected because you are a stranger i doubt not to get an assignation with the younger sister  aur well use your own way camillo but if it ever succeed with his management  cam you must understand then benito that this old signior mario has two nieces with one of which i am desperately in love and  ben aside to him i understand you already sir and you desire love reciprocal leave your business in my hands and if it succeed not think me no wiser than my master  cam pray take me with you these sisters are great beauties and vast fortunes but by a clause in their fathers will if they marry without their uncles consent are to forfeit all their uncle who is covetous and base to the last degree takes advantage of this clause and under pretence of not finding fit matches for them denies his consent to all who love them  ben denies them marriage very good sir  cam more than this he refuses access to any suitor and immures them in a mean apartment on the garden side where he barbarously debars them from all human society  ben uses them most barbarously still better and better  cam the younger of these sisters violetta i have seen often in the garden from the balcony in this chamber which looks into it have divers times shot tickets on the point of an arrow which she has taken and by the signs she made me i find they were not ill received  ben ill tell you now just such an amour as this had i once with a young lady that  aur quote yourself again you rogue and my feet shall renew their acquaintance with your buttocks  cam dear benito take care to convey this ticket to violetta i saw her just now go by to the next chapel be sure to stand ready to give her holy water and slip the ticket into the hand of her woman beatrix and take care the elder sister laura sees you not for she knows nothing of our amour  ben a word to the wise have you no service to laura    to aur  aur none that i shall trouble you withal ill see first what returns you make from this voyage before i put in my venture with you away begone mr mercury  ben i fly mr jupiter                                     exit  aur this lady laura i have seen from your balcony and was seen by her methought too she looked with a languishing eye upon me as who should say are you a man and have no pity for a poor distressed virgin for my part i never found so much disposition in myself to love any woman at first sight handsome she is of that i am certain  cam and has wit i dare assure you but i have not heard she has admitted of any gallantry  aur her hour is not come yet she has not met with a man to love when that happens as i am resolved to push my fortune you shall see that as her love warms her virtue will melt down and dissolve in it for theres no such bawd to a woman as her own wit is  cam i look upon the assignation as certain will you promise me to go you and benito shall walk in the garden while i search the nymph within the shade one thing i had forgot to tell you that our general of the church the duke of mantua and the prince his son are just approaching the gates of rome will you go see the ceremony of their entrance  aur with all my heart they say he has behaved himself gallantly against the french at their return from naples besides i have a particular knowledge of young prince frederick ever since he was last at our venetian carnivals  cam away then quickly lest we miss the solemnity     exeunt    enter laura and violetta striving about a letter which   laura holds  vio let it go i say  lau i say let you go  vio nay sweet sister laura  lau nay dear violetta it is in vain to contend i am resolved ill see it                        plucks the paper from violetta  vio but i am resolved you shall not read it i know not what authority this is which you assume or what privilege a year or two can give you to use this sovereignty over me  lau do you rebel young gentlewoman ill make you know i have a double right over you one as i have more years and the other as i have more wit  vio though i am not all air and fire as you are yet that little wit i have will serve to conduct my affairs without a governess  lau no gentlewoman but it shall not are you fit at fifteen to be trusted with a maidenhead it is as much as your betters can manage at full twenty    for tis of a nature so subtile     that if its not luted with care   the spirit will work through the bottle     and vanish away into air    to keep it there nothing so hard is     twill go betwixt waking and sleeping   the simple too weak for a guard is     and no wit would be plagued with the keeping  vio for aught i see you are as little to be trusted with your madness as i with my simplicity and therefore pray restore my letter  lau reading it whats here an humble petition for a private meeting are you twittering at that sport already mistress novice  vio how i a novice at ripe fifteen i would have you to know that i have killed my man before i was fourteen and now am ready for another execution  lau a very forward rosebud you open apace gentlewoman i find indeed your desires are quick enough but where will you have cunning to carry on your business with decency and secrecy secrecy i say which is a main part of chastity in our sex where wit to be sensible of the delicacies of love the tenderness of a farewellsigh for an absence the joy of a return the zeal of a pressing hand the sweetness of little quarrels caused and cured by the excess of love and in short the pleasing disquiets of the soul always restless and wandering up and down in a paradise of thought of its own making  vio if i understood not thus much before i find you are an excellent instructor and that argues you have had a feeling of the cause in your time too sister  lau what have i confessed before i was aware shell find out my inclination to that stranger whom i have only seen and to whom i have never spokenaside no good violetta i never was in love all my experience is from plays and romances but who is this man to whom you have promised an assignation  vio youll tell my uncle  lau i hate my uncle more than you do  vio you know the man tis signior camillo his birth and fortunes are equal to what i can expect and he tells me his intentions are honourable  lau have i not seen him lately in his balcony which looks into our garden with another handsome gentleman in his company who seems a stranger  vio they are the same do you think it a reasonable thing dear laura that my uncle should keep us so strictly that we must be beholden to hearsay to know a young gallant is in the next house to us  lau tis hard indeed to be mewed like hawks and never manned to be locked in like nuns here  vio they that look for nuns flesh in me shall be mistaken  lau well what answer have you returned to this letter  vio that i would meet him at eight this evening in the close walk in the garden attended only by beatrix my woman  lau who comes with him  vio only his friends man benito the same who brought me the letter which you took from me  lau stay let me think a little does camillo or this benito know your maid beatrix  vio they have never talked with her but only seen her  lau tis concluded then you shall meet your servant but ill be your beatrix ill go instead of her and counterfeit your waitingwoman in the dark i may easily pass for her by this means i shall be present to instruct you for you are yet a callow maid i must teach you to peck a little you may come to prey for yourself in time  vio a little teaching will serve my turn if the old one left me to myself i could go near to get my living  lau i find you are eager and baiting to be gone already and ill not hinder you when your hour approaches in the mean time go in and sigh and think fondly and ignorantly of your approaching pleasures    love in young hearts is like the must of wine   tis sweetest then but elder tis more fine             exeunt   act ii  scene ithe front of a nunnery    prince frederick aurelian camillo and ascanio the princes   page  fred my fathers ancient and may repose himself if he pleases after the ceremony of his entrance but we who are younger should think it a sin to spend any part of daylight in a chamber what are your ways of living here  cam why sir we pass our time either in conversation alone or in love alone or in love and conversation together  fred come explain explain my counsel learned in the laws of living  cam for conversation alone thats either in going to court with a face of business and there discoursing of the affairs of europe of which rome you know is the public mart or at best meeting the virtuosi and there wearying one another with rehearsing our own works in prose and poetry  fred away with that dry method i will have none ont to the next  cam love alone is either plain wenching where every courtezan is your mistress and every man your rival or else whats worse plain whining after one woman that is walking before her door by day and haunting her street by night with guitars darklanthorns and rondaches3  aur which i take it is or will he our case camillo  fred neither of these will fit my humour if your third prove not more pleasant i shall stick to the old almain recreation the divine bottle and the bounteous glass that tuned up old horace to his odes  aur you shall need to have no recourse to that for love and conversation will do your business that is sir a most delicious courtezani do not mean downright punkbut punk of more than ordinary sense in conversation punk in ragou punk who plays on the lute and sings and to sum up all punk who cooks and dresses up herself with poignant sauce to become a new dish every time she is served up to you  fred this i believe aurelian is your method of living you talk of it so savourily  aur there is yet another more insipid sort of love and conversation as for example look you there sir the courtship of our nuns pointing to the nunnery they talk prettily but a pox on them they raise our appetites and then starve us they are as dangerous as cold fruits without wine and are never to be used but where there are abundance of wenches in readiness to qualify them  cam but yet they are ever at hand and easy to come by and if youll believe an experienced sinner easiness in love is more than half the pleasure of it  fred this way of chatting pleases me for debauchery i hate it and to love is not in my nature except it be my friends pray what do you call that nunnery  cam tis a house of benedictines called the torre di specchi where only ladies of the best quality are professed                       lucretia and hippolita appear at the grate  aur look you yonder sir are two of the pretty magpies in white and black if you will lull yourself into a platonic dream you may but consider your sport will be dull when you play without stakes  fred no matter ill fool away an hour of courtship for i never was engaged in a serious love nor i believe can be farewell gentlemen at this time i shall dispense with your attendancenay without ceremony because i would be incognito  cam come then aurelian to our own affairs                                      exeunt aurelian and camillo    the prince and ascanio approach  fred to lucretia for what crime fair creature were you condemned to this perpetual prison  luc for chastity and devotion and two or three such melancholy virtues they first brought me hither and must now keep me company  fred i should rather have guessed it had been murder and that you are veiled for fear of doing more mischief with those eyes for indeed they are too sharp to be trusted out of the scabbard  luc cease i beseech you to accuse my eyes till they have done some execution on your heart  fred but i am out of reach perhaps  luc trust not to that they may shoot at a distance though they cannot strike you near at hand  fred but if they should kill you are neer the better theres a grate betwixt us and you cannot fetch in the dead quarry  luc provided we destroy the enemy we do not value their dead bodies but you perhaps are in your first error and think we are rather captives than warriors that we come like prisoners to the grate to beg the charity of passengers for their love  fred to ascanio enquire as dextrously as you can what is the name and quality of this charming creature  luc to hippolita be sure if the page approaches you to get out of him his masters name                             the prince and lucretia seem to talk  hip to ascanio by that short whisper which i observed you took with your master i imagine mr page you come to ask a certain question of me  asca by this thy question and by that whisper with thy lady o thou nymph of devotion i find i am to impart a secret and not to ask one therefore either confess thou art yet a mere woman under that veil and by consequence most horribly inquisitive or thou shalt lose thy longing and know nothing of my master  hip by my virginity you shall tell first  asca youll break your oath on purpose to make the forfeit  hip your master is called  asca your lady is ycleped  hip for decency in all matters of love the man should offer first you know  asca that needs not when the damsel is so willing  hip but i have sworn not to discover first that her name is madam lucretia fair as you see to a miracle and of a most charming conversation of royal blood and niece to his holiness and if she were not espoused to heaven a mistress for a sovereign prince  asca after these encomiums twere vain for me to praise my master he is only poor prince frederick otherwise called the prince of mantua liberal and valiant discreet and handsome and in my simple judgment a fitter servant for your lady than his old father who is a sovereign  hip dare you make all this good you have said of your master  asca yes and as much more of myself to you  hip i defy you upont as my ladys second  asca as my masters i accept it the time  hip six this evening  asca the place  hip at this grate  asca the weapons  hip hands and it may be lips  asca tis enough expect to hear from me                      they withdraw and whisper to their principals                       after the whisper  fred to lucretia madam i am glad i know my enemy for since it is impossible to see and not admire you the name of lucretia is the best excuse for my defeat  luc persons like prince frederick ought not to assault religious houses or to pursue chastity and virtue to their last retreat  fred a monastery is no retreat for chastity tis only a hiding place for bad faces where they are thrust in crowds together like heaps of rubbish out of the way that the world may not be peopled with deformed persons and that such who are out of play themselves may pray for a blessing on their endeavours who are getting handsome children and carrying on the work for public benefit  luc then you would put off heaven with your leavings and use it like them who play at cards alone take the courts for yourselves and give the refuse to the gentlemen  fred you mistake me madam i would so contrive it that heaven and we might be served at once we have occasion for wit and beauty now piety and ugliness will do as well for heaven that plays at one game and we at another and therefore heaven may make its hand with the same cards that we put out  luc i could easily convince you if the argument concerned me hut i am one of those whom for want of wit and beauty you have condemned to religion and therefore am your humble servant to pray for your handsome wife and children  fred heaven forbid madam that i should condemn you or indeed any handsome woman to be religious no madam the occasions of the world are great and urgent for such as you and for my part i am of opinion that it is as great a sin for a beauty to enter into a nunnery as for an ugly woman to stay out of it  luc the cares of the world are not yet upon you but as soon as ever you come to be afflicted with sickness or visited with a wife youll be content i should pray for you  fred any where rather than in a cloyster for truly i suppose all your prayers there will be how to get out of it and upon that supposition madam i am come to offer you my service for your redemption come faith be persuaded the church shall lose nothing by it ill take you out and put in two or three crooked apostles in your place

curiosity redoubles i must needs hail that unknown vessel and enquire whither shes bound and what freight she carries  fred shes not worth your trouble sir shell either prove some common courtezan in disguise or at best some homely person of honour that only dances well enough to invite a sight of herself and would look ill enough to fright you  duke thats maliciously said all i see of her is charming and i have reason to think her face is of the same piece at least ill try my fortune  fred what an unlucky accident is this if my father should discover her shes ruined if he does not yet i have lost her conversation tonight    duke approaches lucretia  asca tis the duke himself who comes to court you  luc peace ill fit him for i have been informed to the least tittle of his actions since he came to town  duke to luc madam the duke of mantua whom you must needs imagine to be in this company has sent me to you to know what kind of face there is belonging to that excellent shape and to those charming motions which he observed so lately in your dancing  luc tell his highness if you please that there is a face within the mask so very deformed that if it were discovered it would prove the worst visor of the two and that of all men he ought not to desire it should be exposed because then something would be found amiss in an entertainment which he has made so splendid and magnificent  duke the duke i am sure would be very proud of your compliment but it would leave him more unsatisfied than before for he will find in it so much of gallantry as being added to your other graces will move him to a strange temptation of knowing you  luc i should still have the same reason to refuse him for twere a madness when i had charmed him by my motion and converse to hazard the loss of that conquest by my eyes  duke i am on fire till i discover her asideat least madam tell me of what family you are  luc will you be satisfied if i tell you i am of the colonne you have seen julia of that house  duke then you are she  luc have i not her stature most exactly  duke as near as i remember  luc but by your favour i have nothing of her shape for if i may be so vain to praise myself shes a little thicker in the shoulders and besides she moves ungracefully  duke then you are not she again  luc no not she but you have forgotten emilia of the ursini whom the duke saluted yesterday at her balcony when he entered her air and motion  duke are the very same with yours now i am sure i know you  luc but theres too little of her to make a beauty my stature is more advantageous  duke you have cozened me again  luc well i find at last i must confess myself what think you of eugenia beata the duke seemed to be infinitely pleased last night when my brother presented me to him at the belvidere  duke now i am certain you are she for you have both her stature and her motion  luc but if you remember yourself a little better theres some small difference in our wit for she has indeed the air and beauty of a roman lady but all the dulness of a dutch woman  duke i see madam you are resolved to conceal yourself and i am as fully resolved to know you  luc see which of our resolutions will take place  duke i come from the duke and can assure you he is of an humour to be obeyed  luc and i am of an humour not to obey him but why should he be so curious  duke if you would have my opinion i believe he is in love with you  luc without seeing me  duke without seeing all of you love is love let it wound us from what part it please and if he have enough from your shape and conversation his business is done the more compendiously without the face  luc but the duke cannot be taken with my conversation for he never heard me speak  duke aside slife i shall discover myselfyes madam he stood by incognito and heard me speak with you but  luc i wish he had trusted to his own courtship and spoke himself for it gives us a bad impression of a princes wit when we see fools in favour about his person  duke whatever i am i have it in commission from him to tell you hes in love with you  luc the good old gentleman may dote if he so pleases but love and fifty years old are stark nonsense  duke but some men you know are green at fifty  luc yes in their understandings  duke you speak with great contempt of a prince who has some reputation in the world  luc no tis you that speak with contempt of him by saying he is in love at such an age  duke then madam tis necessary you should know him better for his reputation and that shall be though he violate the laws of masquerade and force you  fred i suspected this from his violent temper aside sir the emperors ambassador is here in masquerade and i believe this to be his lady it were well if you inquired of him before you forced her to discover  duke which is the ambassador  fred that farthermost                     duke retires farther  fred to luc take your opportunity to escape while his

resign lucretia  fred ah no i never can resign her to you but sir i can my life which on my knees i tender as the atoning sacrifice or if your hand because you are a father be loth to take away that life you gave i will redeem your crime by making it my own so you shall still be innocent and i die blessed and unindebted for my being  duke o frederick you are too much a son         embracing him and i too little am a father you and you alone have merited lucretia tis now my only grief i can do nothing to requite this virtue for to restore her to you is not an act of generosity but a scant niggard justice yet i love her so much that even this little which i do is like the bounty of an usurer high to be prizd from me because tis drawn from such a wretched mind  fred you give me now a second better life    kissing his hand butthat the gift may be more easy to you consider sir lucretia did not love you i fear to say neer would  duke you do well to help me to oercome that difficulty ill weigh that too hereafter for a love so violent as mine will ask long time and much of reason to effect the cure my present care shall be to make you happy for that will make my wish impossible and then the remedies will be more easy    enter sophronia lucretia violetta laura hippolita  soph i have with joy oerheard this happy change and come with blessings to applaud your conquest over the greatest of mankind yourself  duke i hope twill be a full and lasting one  luc thus let me kneel and pay my thanks and duty    kneeling both to my prince and father  duke rise rise too charming maid for yet i cannot call you my daughter that first name lucretia hangs on my lips and would be still pronounced look not too kindly on me one sweet glance perhaps would ruin both therefore ill go and try to get new strength to bear your eyes till then farewell be sure you love my frederick and do not hate his father                exeunt duke and valerio  fred at the door now friends you may appear    enter aurelian camillo benito  your pardon madam that we thus intrude on holy ground yourself best know it could not be avoided and it shall be my care it be excused  soph though sovereign princes bear a privilege of entering when they please within our walls in others tis a crime past dispensation and therefore to avoid a public scandal be pleased sir to retire and quit this garden  aur we shall obey you madam but that we may do it with less regret we hope you will give these ladies leave to accompany us  soph they shall and nieces for myself i only ask you to justify my conduct to the world that none may think i have betrayed a trust but freed you from a tyranny  lau our duty binds us to acknowledge it  cam and our gratitude to witness it  vio with a holy and lasting remembrance of your favour  fred and it shall be my care either by reason to bend your uncles will or by my fathers interest to force your dowry from his hands  ben to aur pray sir let us make haste over these walls again these gardens are unlucky to me i have lost my reputation of music in one of them and of wit in the other  aur to lau now laura you may take your choice betwixt the two benitos and consider whether you had rather he should serenade you in the garden or i in bed tonight  lau you may be sure i shall give sentence for benito for the effect of your serenading would be to make me pay the music nine months hence  hip to asca you see brother heres a general gaoldelivery there has been a great deal of bustle and disturbance in the cloister tonight enough to distract a soul which is given up like me to contemplation and therefore if you think fit i could even be content to retire with you into the world and by way of penance to marry you which as husbands and wives go now is a greater mortification than a nunnery  asca no sister if you love me keep to your monastery ill come now and then to the grate and beg you a recreation but i know myself so well that if i had you one twelvemonth in the world i should run myself into a cloister to be rid of you  soph nieces once more farewell adieu lucretia my wishes and my prayers attend you all  luc to fred i am so fearful that though i gladly run to your embraces yet venturing in the world a second time methinks i put to sea in a rough storm with shipwrecks round about me  fred my dear be kinder to yourself and me and let not fear fright back our coming joys for we at length stand reconciled to fate and now to fear when to such bliss we move were not to doubt our fortune but our love                exeunt                                 epilogue    some have expected from our bills today   to find a satire in our poets play   the zealous route from colemanstreet did run   to see the story of the friar and nun   or tales yet more ridiculous to hear   vouched by their vicar of ten pounds ayear   of nuns who did against temptation pray   and discipline laid on the pleasant way   or that to please the malice of the town           our poet should in some close cell have shown        some sister playing at content alone               this they did hope the other side did fear   and both you see alike are cozened here   some thought the title of our play to blame   they liked the thing but yet abhorred the name   like modest punks who all you ask afford   but for the world they would not name that word   yet if youll credit what i heard him say   our poet meant no scandal in his play   his nuns are good which on the stage are shown   and sure behind our scenes youll look for none   footnotes 1 a common
