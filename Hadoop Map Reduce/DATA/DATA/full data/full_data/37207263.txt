37207263	dorothys double                             by g a henty  author of rujub the juggler in the days of the mutiny the curse of carnes hold etc  in three volumesvol ii       london     chatto  windus piccadilly     1894      printed by     spottiswoode and co newstreet square     london     dorothys double     chapter ix   just before twelve oclock on the following day mr hawtreys carriage drew up at charles levines office in the waiting room they found danvers who had arrived shortly before them  thank you for coming mr hawtrey said as he shook hands with him i think i am rather afraid of levine by himself of course i know that he is the best adviser one can have in a business of this sort but that way he has of lifting his eyebrows makes me nervous i feel as david copperfield did with that manservant of steerforths he thought him very young indeed it does not make me feel young but rather that he is considering me to be an old fool i dont suppose he means exactly that but that is the impression i get from those eyebrows of his  i am sure he does not mean that mr hawtrey danvers laughed though it may be that the action is expressive of a passing doubt in his mind or rather of his perceiving some point that is unfavourable to the cause he is retained to defend i hope you have come here to say that you agree with our view in the matter  you will hear presently danvers i came to that conclusion yesterday but the position is somewhat changed  at this moment the door opened and a clerk asked them to follow him as mr levine was now disengaged  this is your clientmy daughter dorothy mr hawtrey said as he introduced her to the lawyer this is mr singleton an old friend and neighbour of ours  mr levine shook hands with dorothy looking at her scrutinisingly as he did so she looked as frankly at him  so you thought i was guilty mr levine  i am sure that your father will do me the justice to say that i said nothing that could in any way be construed into such an opinion miss hawtrey he replied courteously  perhaps not but you thought so all the same i am learning to be a thought reader i saw that and also i think that a slight feeling of doubt came into your mind as you shook hands  i must be careful i see he said smiling however without either admitting or denying anything i may say that i am glad that mr hawtrey brought you with him  and now mr levine mr hawtrey said i will tell you what we have come about yesterday we had quite made up our minds to take your advice although my daughter assented to it only with the greatest reluctance a fresh complication has occurred which i will leave mr singleton to tell for himself  mr levine took up a pen and prepared to take notes as mr singleton began the story with his conversation with dorothy at mrs deans at the point when dorothy called her father mr levine interposed  pardon me for interrupting you but it is very important that i should understand the position exactly before you go farther whatever this matter may be of which you are about to tell me do i understand that it was one entirely between miss hawtrey and yourself  entirely  it was one of which you never intended to have spoken and of which miss hawtrey felt perfectly confident that under no circumstances whatever would you have revealed it  certainly i have known her from a child and nothing whatever would have induced me to have mentioned it to any one and miss hawtrey had i am certain an absolute confidence that i would not do so  it was then therefore a wholly spontaneous action on the part of miss hawtrey in summoning her father to her side and asking him to take you home with him  entirely so i was myself absolutely bewildered at what appeared to me her determination to make her father acquainted with the particulars of the painful scenes of which i will now tell you  and he then related the particulars of the interview in his chambers  at the time he concluded no doubt whatever entered my mind that the person who called upon me was miss hawtrey thinking it over now and having an absolute confidence in her i see that i may have been mistaken she was veiled when she entered and in all the years i have known miss hawtrey i have never seen her wear a veil a veil certainly alters the appearance of a face and for an instant when she entered i did not recognise her but the likeness must be very great for my hesitation was only momentary afterwards she had a handkerchief up to her face during the greater part of the interview and during the whole time she spoke in a low voice broken by sobs no doubt there must be some similarity between the voices but heard in that way it was so different from her usual outspoken tones that i should be sorry to be called upon to swear whether at other times it would resemble her voice or not  i may add mr levine mr hawtrey said when he had finished that i have this morning received a bill from allertons where my daughter usually gets things for four silk dresses and two mantles which were ordered on the same day and at about the same hour at which the jewels were stolen and this interview with mr singleton took place i drove down there after breakfast and found that the goods were taken out and placed in a cab that was waiting at the door my daughter saying that she wished to take them at once to her dressmaker i also called in at gilliats and found that there as well as at allertons the woman was veiled when she gave the orders  mr levine had listened with close attention to mr singleton glancing keenly at times towards dorothy who was sitting with her sideface to him absorbed in the repetition of the story  when mr hawtrey ceased speaking he was silent for a minute and then said  in the first place miss hawtrey i have to make an apology to you you were right i see so much of the bad side of human nature that i own that until i saw you i did not entertain a shadow of a doubt that you driven by some pressure had resorted to this desperate expedient of raising money the whole story appeared to be consistent only with your guilt providing that you were possessed of an extraordinary amount of selfpossession and audacity i admit and apologise for the mistake now that i hear the same thing has been done in two other cases and that within an hour or two of the first it is to me conclusive that your fathers theory is the correct one and that you were personated by some clever woman who must bear an extraordinary likeness to you that a young lady of your age driven into a corner should commit a barefaced robbery is a matter that my experience has taught me to believe to be very possible but that she should a few minutes afterwards proceed to raise money from a friend and still more to commit the petty crime of swindling a tradesman of four silk dresses or rather the materials of the value perhaps of thirty or forty pounds seems to me incredible for once i have been entirely at fault  now as to paying this money for the jewels mr levine mr hawtrey said do you still advise it  i must think that over it is an extremely difficult matter on which to give an opinion and i shall be glad in the first place to have mr danvers opinion about it perhaps he will be good enough to come and see you after we have talked it over but i will not give a final opinion until i have turned it over in my mind for a day or two perhaps i may ask you to come and see me again  danvers went out to the carriage with them i congratulate you most heartily miss hawtrey he said there is no doubt that this will immensely strengthen your position it has had at any rate a great effect on the mind of levine it is not often he has to own that his first impressions are entirely erroneous i will come round this evening if you will be at home  we will be at home danvers mr hawtrey said and i particularly want to see you about another matter come to dinner halfpast seven can you come too singleton he went on as the carriage drove off you are in the thick of it now and are indeed one of the parties interested for of course i shall see that you are not a loser by your intended kindness to dorothy  if i hear any nonsense of that sort mr singleton said hotly i will get out of the carriage at once and have nothing more to do with the affair dorothy is my goddaughter and if i choose to give her one thousand or ten i have a perfect right to do so so let us hear no more about it  mr hawtrey shook his old friend warmly by the hand you always were an obstinate fellow he said and i suppose i must let you have your own way dorothy i think i will get out at the top of st jamess street and if ned hampton is not in leave my card with a line asking him to join us at dinner he has worked most nobly for us singleton as i told you last night and ought certainly to be told of this new development it will make us an odd number for my cousin mary daintree hasi was going to remark i am glad to say but i suppose i oughtntnot yet recovered from the shock given her by dorothy breaking off her engagement and is keeping to her bed however it does not matter about there being an odd number  of course you can ask captain hampton if you like father dorothy said coldly but at any rate for my part i would rather that he did not meddle any more in my affairs  hulloa hulloa mr singleton exclaimed what is in the wind now dorothy i thought you and ned hampton were sworn friends and next to yourself ned has always stood very high in my regard a nicer lad than he was i have not come across i only wish he was master of the old place down there instead of his brother who is by no means a popular character in the county although perhaps that is his wifes fault rather than his own what have you been quarrelling with him about i should have thought that for a young fellow after being six years from england to give up everything for a month and spend it in your service was in itself a strong claim to your regard  there has been no quarrel between captain hampton and myself dorothy said as coldly as before i do not say that it was not kind of him to take the pains he did about my affairs but he acknowledged that he had doubted me and after that i do not wish him to trouble himself any further in the matter  what nonsense dorothy her father said warmly who could have helped doubting you under the circumstances why without half the excuse even i was inclined to doubt you for a moment levine doubted you danvers though he has not said as much no doubt took the same view and even singleton here when he gave you as he believed that money thought that you had got into some horrible scrape singleton could not disbelieve the evidence of his eyes and you are not angry with him for it why should you be so with hampton who also believed the evidence of his eyes  what was that if i may ask mr singleton said i have heard nothing about that and i am quite sure that ned hampton would not have doubted dorothy without what he believed to be very strong evidence  well singleton i will tell you though i should not tell either levine or danvers for it is undoubtedly the strongest piece of evidence against dorothy he went up to islington late in the afternoon of the day when all this took place to see if he could light upon that scoundrel truscott and he saw truscott in close confabulation in a quiet street with the woman who came to your chambers and whom he like you of course took to be dorothy at that time neither he nor any one else knew of the jewel robbery but naturally it struck him as of course it would have struck every one that dorothy had got into some scrape and that she had met that man to endeavour to persuade or bribe him to give up the letters or at any rate to move and so escape from the search we were making for him ned went out of town at once and came back just about the time we heard of the jewel robbery by that time he had on thinking it over concluded that his first idea was altogether erroneous and when at my wits end i told him of the jewel affair he said at once it was absolutely impossible that dorothy could have done such a thing and that indeed it seemed to him a confirmation of the theory he had formed that some adventuress having a singular likeness to dorothy was personating her the idea had never occurred to me and i was delighted on finding a possible explanation of what seemed to me a blank and absolute mystery i consider that dorothy is even more indebted to him for that suggestion than for the pains he took in trying to discover truscott  i certainly think you are wrong dorothy mr singleton said gravely seeing that the girl listened with cold indifference to her fathers explanation he did no more than i did namely believe the evidence of his eyes and on that evidence both of us were forced to believe that you had got into a scrape of some sort and were under the thumb of a rascal  i cannot argue about it mr singleton i only know that i believed captain hampton would trust me implicitly as i should have trusted him and it is a great disappointment to me to find that i was mistaken i do not defend myself i admit that it may be silly and wrong on my part i only say that i am disappointed in captain hampton and that i would much rather he did not interfere in any way in my affairs  mr hawtrey shrugged his shoulders mr singleton lifted his eyebrows slightly and then glanced with a furtive smile which it was well that dorothy did not detect at her father who looked somewhat surprised at this unexpected demonstration  at any rate dorothy the latter said i must ask him to dinner there will be no occasion for him to interfere farther in the matter so far as i can see and i should think that after your manner to him he will not be inclined to do so still it is impossible after the pains he has taken in the matter not to acquaint him with what has occurred here we are at the top of st jamess street and he pulled the check string i suppose you will get out here too singleton  certainly it is my lunch time i will walk round with you to ned hamptons and you had better lunch with me at the travellers i will take him round there too if we find him in  tell james we shall be five to dinner dorothy as soon as you get back  as the carriage drove away mr singleton indulged in a quiet laugh  what is it singleton i could not make out that glance you gave me in the carriage i own i see nothing at all laughable in it to my mind this fancy of dorothys is at once utterly unreasonable and confoundedly annoying and is i may say altogether unlike her  my dear hawtrey i would ask you a question has it ever entered your mind that you would like ned hampton as a soninlaw  as a sonin law mr hawtrey repeated in astonishment what do you mean singleton no such idea ever occurred to mehow should it there was a boy and girl friendship of a certain kind between them before he went away but at that time dorothy was a mere child of twelve years old and of course no idea about her future marriage to him or any one else had entered my mind when he came home the other day she was on the verge of being engaged to halliburn and was so engaged a week later so again the idea could not have occurred to me he is the son of an old friend and was constantly in and out of our house as a boy and i have a very great regard and liking for him but i certainly should not regard him as a very eligible match for dorothy  i should think hawtrey you have had enough of eligible marriages mr singleton said sarcastically and i should think dorothy has too next time i hope her heart will have something to say in the matter i dont see why ned hampton should not be eligible he is a younger son tis true and has i believe only about four hundred a year in addition to his pay dorothy has i know some twenty thousand pounds from her mothers settlements and some land that brings in about two hundred more and she will some day have what you can leave her besides which as you have told me would be something like fifteen thousand more so with her money and his it would come some day to not very far short of two thousand a year as i told you i have put her down in my will for five thousand i should have put her down for more had i thought she wanted it but as it seemed likely that she would make a good match i did not think it would be of any use to leave her more i have put him down for a like sum and certainly if those two were to come together i should considerably increase it i have no children of my own my relations as far as i know of them are welltodo people and therefore i am perfectly free to do what i like with my money and estate that being so i think you may dismiss from your mind any idea that dorothy is likely to come to poverty if she marries ned hampton  well old friend that certainly alters the case however as you see there is no probability whatever of the young people taking that view of the case ned hampton has always been like an elder brother or if you like a favourite cousin of dorothys and since he came home i have never seen the slightest change in his manner towards her as to her you have just heard what she has said  i know nothing of his ideas on the subject hawtrey but as dorothy was and is so far as he knows engaged to the earl of halliburn ned whatever he might think would scarcely embark in a flirtation with her as to dorothy as you say she showed pretty clearly the state of her mind just now  yes she has evidently taken a strong prejudice against him singleton it is a pity too for i like him exceedingly and i dont know any one to whom personally i would more willingly entrust dorothys happiness  i dont know mr singleton remarked meditatively why fathers should be so much more blind about their daughters than other people are you dont suppose that if dorothy had been quite indifferent as to ned hamptons opinion of her she would have been so exceedingly sore at his having doubted her i do not say she loves him i do not even suppose that she has the remotest idea of such a thing i only say that she evidently attaches a very great weight to his good opinion and is proportionately grieved at what she considers his want of confidence in herself  she makes light of having broken off her engagement to halliburn but we know she must feel it a great deal more than she pretends to do no girl in her position in society would break off such a match without feeling sore about ithowever convinced she might be that it was the best thing to doand in that temper the defection as she considers it of a faithful ally would naturally be keenly felt of course there is nothing to do but to let the matter rest only please do not attempt to argue the point with her but let her have her own way without comment she is far more likely to come round in time if left alone than if constantly put upon the defence but bless me here we are at waterloo place and have forgotten altogether the business in hand which is to call at ned hamptons lodgings well they are about halfway along jermyn street so that we may as well turn up here nowto continue our conversation for another minute or twoi should say we had best put all this out of our minds for the present and leave matters to right themselves there are more urgent things to think of for i am afraid hawtrey there is a good deal of trouble ahead for her and for you whatever course you may decide to take about gilliats matter we who know and love dorothy may be absolutely certain of her innocence in these matters but you must remember that unless we can produce the woman it will be uphill work indeed to get the world to see matters in the same light if it comes to a trial and all the facts come out on the other hand if you compromise it is morally certain these things will go on you will be absolutely driven to fight one of these claims and every claim you pay you will make it harder to resist the next so that either way there is trouble i am afraid great trouble ahead and the only way out of it that i can see is to find this man and woman who may for aught i know at the present moment be on the other side of the atlantic there does not seem to be a shadow of a clue which we can follow up and a wildgoose chase is a joke to it  i agree with you entirely singleton of course in an affair like this money is nothing and i shall employ the best detectives i can get levine will be able to tell me of good men if i find ned hampton in i will tell him the whole story at once which will save explanations this evening  you mean you will tell him while we are at lunch hawtrey for it is past two oclock now and at my age one cannot afford to neglect the inner man in this way  they met captain hampton half way along the street  we were just coming for you ned mr hawtrey said singleton wants you to come and lunch with him he and i want to have a talk with you  i have only just finished my lunch but i am perfectly ready for the talk mr hawtrey  where were you going now  i think i was principally going to smoke a cigar i have been in all the morning and on a day like this one gets restless after a time  then you shall take a turn for twenty minutes ned there is nothing more unpleasant than looking on at people eating unless it is eating with people looking on besides we could not begin our talk now what do you say hawtrey shall we join him say at the foot of the duke of yorks steps turn in to st jamess park and sit down if we can find a bench free of nursemaids as i daresay we shall as they wont come out till later at any rate we dont want to be overheard and we can never make sure of that in a club smokingroom  that will suit me very well mr singleton but dont hurry over your lunch you will see me somewhere about when you are coming down the steps i have just time to stroll down the mall and back by birdcage walk  well we will say in halfanhour from the time you leave us  this is another proof mr hawtrey that our suspicion that truscott is at the bottom of it all is well founded captain hampton said when he had heard the story it must have been somebody who was accurately acquainted with your affairs some one who knew that mr singleton was an intimate friend so intimate that your daughter would be likely to go to him were she in any trouble and that he would be likely to assist her  it is certainly another link in the chain mr hawtrey agreed  i would give a thousand pounds if we could lay our hands on the fellow mr singleton exclaimed fiercely  but if we could find him singleton we could not touch him you and i ned may be morally certain that he is at the bottom of all this but we have not the remotest shadow of evidence on which a magistrate would grant a warrant for his arrest if we found him he would snap his fingers in our face  you forget mr hawtrey said ned if we find him we are pretty sure of being able to find this woman i do not say we are certain to find her because we know nothing of their relations to each other perhaps they are only united to carry out this piece of swindling truscott is shrewd enough to see that it would be better for them to part perhaps they kept together until they went over to hamburg and sold the diamonds then she might go over to paris and he to america or they may have gone to any other two widely separated places in the world if they have kept together and are still in england i should say they are most likely to be at present in some quiet and respectable lodgings at some large wateringplace where they pass as father and daughter i quite agree with you in what you say that the fact of these two fresh robberies altogether alters the case and that you can never calculate upon being free of annoyance still i should say that you are safe for some little time they ought to be satisfied with what they have got and will naturally wait to see whether there is any stir made and what comes of it before repeating the same game have you seen levine again  yes we were there an hour and a half ago and i am glad to say these last occurrences have completely changed his opinion of the case we left him going into the matter with danvers who is coming to dine with us this evening and will tell us what they think as to fighting gilliat  what does halliburn think of it captain hampton asked suddenly after all everything will depend i should think upon his opinion  on that point fortunately we have not got to consult him neddorothy has definitely broken off the engagement as soon as we heard from gilliat of the robbery she declared that it was positively impossible that the matter should go on and i quite agreed with her decision  captain hampton made no remark for a minute or two  mr hawtrey presently went on i want you to come round to dinner too ned there will only be singleton and danvers and it will be a sort of family council  thank you mr hawtrey captain hampton replied after a pause i think i would rather not come i have been unfortunate enough to offend miss hawtrey deeply already and i dont think that my presence at such a council would be in any way agreeable to her and that being so i need hardly say that it would not be pleasant to me  tut tut lad that is all nonsense for a moment i was inclined to doubt her myself those fellows story seemed so terribly straightforward that i was completely taken aback singleton let himself be led to believe that she had got into some terrible scrape and how could you disbelieve your eyes more than he could she will soon get over her little touchiness  i rather doubt it mr hawtrey i think it natural that she should feel very much hurt just at present my taking any part in the affair would i feel sure be very distasteful to her but when you say to me dorothy has quite got over her indignation and wants you to come and have a chat with her i shall be delighted to come in the meantime i would rather give no opinion whatever as to the matter but i shall nevertheless work quietly in my own way and do my best to discover some clue as to the movements of this man i have the great advantage of knowing him by sight which no detective would do i am certain i am not likely to make any mistake as to the woman please dont mention to dorothy that i am taking any further part in the affair levine will i should think advise you to put the matter into the hands of detectives and i shall be glad to know from time to time what their opinion is and whether they have gained any clue as to their whereabouts i would suggest that you should get from allerton two or three small pieces of each of the silks that were taken should there be anything at all peculiar in colour or pattern it might be an aid to the detectives  you are right there ned mr singleton said an adventuress of that kind having got hold of some handsome silks would not be able to forego the pleasure of having them made up and showing off in them do you mean to pay allerton hawtrey  i gave him a cheque at once i told him that this was one of several robberies that had been committed by some woman personating my daughter but that it would be so unpleasant to go into the matter and so difficult to find the thief that i would rather pay the money at once in addition to the patterns of the dresses i will get him to have some sketches made of the mantles they will probably have some others like them but if not they are sure to know the exact particulars of them there may be some slight peculiarity about the fashion of the things that would help a detective  i think you would do even better than that captain hampton said if you got a dozen of your daughters daguerreotypes they would assist detectives much more than anything else in making inquiries they would only have to show them to a waiter in any hotel where this woman stopped and they could hardly fail to be recognised at once for she would certainly attract attention wherever she went dorothy gave me one a few days after i came back but as i should be very sorry to have that knocked about i should be glad if you would let me have another  that is an excellent idea ned i will order a couple of dozen of her photos this afternoon from watson who took the last she had done well i am sorry you wont come and dine with us though i dont know but that it is better for you to leave her to herself for a short time i admit that she has not quite got over it yet but i expect that she will come round before long which way are you going  i think i shall sit where i am for a bit mr hawtrey it is very pleasant here in the shade and i want to think over all that you have been saying i must try and see what i had best do next  he got up however half an hour later with an impatient exclamation  what is the use of my wasting my time here i was three weeks looking for the fellow before and slippen found him a few hours after taking the matter in hand i will take his advice anyhow he is more likely to have an idea as to what a fellow like this would do under the circumstances than i could have  i have been doing nothing more about that case captain hampton the detective said when the caller was shown in by a boy who reminded him strongly of jacob i wrote to mr hawtrey that the man had altogether disappeared but that i would have the racecourses watched and that if he turned up at any of them we would let him know that is three weeks ago and he certainly has not shown up at any racecourse and my men have ascertained beyond much doubt that none of his usual pals have seen or heard anything of him from the day he left his quarters at islington i am glad you have come as i was going to write to mr hawtrey to ask if he considered it worth while keeping up the search certainly it seems to me that if a man like that who has been a constant attendant at the races for the last twenty years and makes his living out of them doesnt go near them for three weeks it must be because he has either gone away or is very ill or has taken to some new life altogether  that is just the opinion that i have formed mr slippen and i wanted to ask your opinion about it we have a very strong idea that there is a woman acting in concert with him and between them they have victimised a friend of mr hawtreys out of a considerable sum of money we may take it then for granted that they have means sufficient to live on for some little time or to take them wherever they may want to go i fancy myself that they must have left london a man like that could hardly keep away from racecourses altogether therefore i agree with you that nothing but severe illness or absence can be the cause of his staying away from racecourses and from all his own intimates for three weeks  that is just how i reasoned it captain hampton and now that you tell me that he has got hold of some money i have not the least doubt that he has sloped  well from your experience in such matters mr slippen where do you think that a man like that would be likely to go  there is no saying at all he might go down to some quiet place in the country but lor bless you a man like that could never stand three weeks of it it is very likely that if he is in funds and has got a clever woman with him they may have got themselves up and be staying at some swell hotel at one of the seaside places or at harrogate or buxton and be carrying on some little swindle there then again after this job you say they have managed they may think it best to make themselves scarce altogether and may be at some foreign wateringplace a clever sharp can always make his living at those sort of places especially with a woman to help him i suppose she is young and pretty  captain hampton nodded  bound to be the detective went on well a sharp fellow with a girl like that if she is shrewd and clever can just turn over money at places of that kind they are full of young fools most of whom have got money in their pockets well then again they may have gone across the water somewheremore likely the states than anywhere else it is a big place for hiding in and when a fellow has done a bit of clever sharping here and knows that he is wanted he somehow always makes for the states just as naturally as a duck takes to water  have you agents who would be of any use at these places  no i will acknowledge frankly that i have not captain hampton it would be no use taking mr hawtreys money for a job of that sort it is too big for me if there was any one place to which you could track them i could send out a man there well enough but i could not work either the continent or the states if you have got proof of a bad piece of swindling against this man your best plan will be to go to scotland yard and get them to put a man at your service the foreign police would not move a finger if i were to write to them but they would be willing enough to move if scotland yard had the thing in hand  mr hawtrey has put himself in charles levines hands and in these matters he will have to act as he suggests but i am taking the matter up on my own account i have spent a good deal of time over it and dont like to be beaten and if you could have undertaken it and it would have been at all within my means i would have arranged with you as it is i shall come to you again for advice and assistance if i require them i think you had better send in your account to mr hawtrey for the work done so far with a letter asking for instructions he may like to have the racecourses watched for a bit longer if you see him do not mention this talk with me by the way i found that boy you had on my doorstep a few days ago he told me he had left you and as he seemed a sharp little fellow i have taken him on to run errands and that sort of thing  he is not a bad boy as that sort of boy goes they are all young scamps but he took it into his head to be cheeky and i had to kick him out i am glad to hear he has not gone on the streets again you will have to look pretty sharp after him but you may find him useful if as you say you are going to try to unearth this fellow we have been in search of     chapter x   we shall be only four at dinner dorothy mr hawtrey said when he returned i could not get hampton to come  engaged i suppose dorothy said indifferently  no dear he simply said that as he had had the misfortune to displease youi think those were his very wordshe thought it would be better to stay away i could not say that i did not agree with him and so the matter dropped of course i am sorry for i have always liked the lad naturally the interest he has shown in us in this trouble and the pains he has taken about it have quite renewed the old feeling i have turned to him for advice and talked matters over with him almost as if he had been a son and of course i shall miss him a good deal nowbut it cannot be helped  i am sure i dont want him to stay away from the house father dorothy said in an aggrieved tone  i dont know whether you want it or not dorothy but naturally that has been the effect you do not suppose that a man who has been on so friendly a footing with us for the last twenty years is going to put up with being called captain hampton and addressed as if he were a stranger and treated with a sort of freezing politeness by a girl whom almost from the day when he arrived in england he has been giving up his time to assist i think he is perfectly right to keep away from the house and i think any man of spirit would do the same  did he say that he resented it father  well no he didnt he seemed to think that while it was reasonable that i your father should have had doubts and that your old friend singleton should have readily accepted the evidence of his senses and have believed that you had got into some sort of bad scrape that you should feel hurt because he did so singleton and i both said that it was preposterous however he stuck to his own opinion just as you do to yours however there is an end of the matter i am heartily sorry i dont think one makes so many real friends as he has of late shown himself to be that one can afford to throw even one away especially just at a time like this well it is of no use talking about it any more  danvers report of the consultation between himself and charles levine left matters pretty nearly as they were before it was greatly desirable for the purpose of preventing any further personation that the jewellers claim should be contested but upon the other hand it was equally certain that it would be an extremely unpleasant thing for mr and miss hawtrey the chances of obtaining a verdict were very slight as they had merely an hypothesis to oppose to the direct evidence of the jeweller and his assistants it was a case that the principals must decide for themselves in case they were willing to meet the inevitable unpleasantness of a trial it would be incumbent on them to use every possible effort to obtain some evidence in confirmation of their hypothesis scotland yard should be communicated with and detectives set to work a reward say of 100l might be offered in the papers for information that would lead to the arrest of the female who had been personating miss hawtrey and in her name obtaining goods under false pretences a description of the womans appearance being given even if no evidence was forthcoming from the advertisement it would serve as a preparation for the trial and the defence to the claim would not come as a surprise moreover the appearance of the advertisement would deter the woman from attempting for some time to repeat her operations mr levine also recommended that a letter should be sent to all the shops where they dealt to warn them that it was possible that a person very closely resembling miss hawtrey might attempt to obtain goods and that everything ordered should be sent to the house and not delivered personally and it would be desirable if possible that they should be told that in future miss hawtrey when giving an order would give her visiting card and that of mr hawtrey and that any person purporting to be her and being unable when asked to give her card should be detained and given in charge of the police this at least was the line which they recommended should be adopted but of course the matter would be further considered and gone into later on if mr hawtrey decided to contest the claim  levine considers it one of the most difficult cases he has ever been engaged in said danvers he says frankly he does not think you have the remotest chance of getting a verdict unless before the trial comes on you can lay your hand on this woman and he suggests that you and he together should see gilliatwho of course has no personal feeling in the matter and would naturally be most averse to taking anything like hostile action against youand inform him of the exact position of the case and your desire that they should not send in their account to you for another three or four months this would give at least six months before the trial would come on and in that time if ever we ought to be able to lay our hands on this woman and you would still have the option of paying if before the case comes on you can obtain no evidence lastly he says that unpleasant as it is to contemplate the possibility of such a thing it must not be forgotten that in the event of the trial coming on and the verdict being an adverse one it is quite upon the cards that if public opinion is strongly aroused on the subject the treasury may feel compelled to order a prosecution of miss hawtrey for perjuryif not for obtaining goods under false pretencesor possibly for theft  would it be possible to trace the jewels in any way mr hawtrey asked after a long pause  quite possible if they were pawned or sold to a jeweller in this country but that is hardly likely to be the case very few jewellers would purchase such goods without making enquiries as to the vendor and the same may be said of the class of pawnbrokers who would be in a position to advance so large a sum it is much more probable that the tiaras were broken up an hour after they were stolen and the setting put in a melting pot and the diamonds taken over to hamburg and as they have not been advertised there would be little or no trouble in disposing of them to a diamond merchant there enquiries can be made in that direction only we must obtain from gilliat the technical description of the size number and weight of the gems  do i understand that your opinion completely agrees with that of charles levine danvers  precisely those are the two courses mr hawtrey and it is a matter entirely for you and miss hawtrey to decide upon the easiest the most pleasant and i may say the cheapestfor costs will follow the verdictwould be to pay the money the other course would involve immense trouble and annoyance the payment of detectives public scandal and i am afraid an adverse verdict from the public as well as from the jury  i should say hawtrey mr singleton put in you had better take a sort of middle course tell gilliat that the thing is a swindle but that if you cannot obtain proof that it is so within six months you will pay him and in the meantime move heaven and earth to discover these people if you succeed well and good if you dont pay the money it seems to me that anything would be better than going into court and being beaten  i think that is very sound advice danvers said eagerly gain time fight if you can fight with a chance of success but if not pay him in that way you will save all legal expenses for you can arrange with gilliat to take no steps until you give him a decided answer six months hence and you will avoid all the terrible scandal the trial would entail the detectives will of course cost money but i do not see how that is to be helped  i think that would be the best plan mr hawtrey said i hope you agree with me dorothy i own that the prospect of a trial terrifies me and i would do anything to avoid it  just as you like father it seems to me that i would rather fight than be robbed but as everyone seems to think that we should be certainly beaten i am willing to agree to anything you wish  then we will consider that matter settled danvers mr hawtrey said in a tone of relief and the decision has taken a tremendous load off my mind will you kindly see levine tell him i put myself entirely in his hands as to the employment of detectives i got samples after i left you singleton of the silks that hussy took and i am bound to say that they are handsome and do credit to her taste i am to have sketches of the mantles tomorrow will you ask levine danvers whether he advises i should still put in the advertisement you spoke of and write to the tradesmen you can mention that we shall go abroad next week and on our return go down into lincolnshire so that perhaps it would be well not to stop these people for of course if they were to repeat the trick when we were in a position to prove that we were hundreds of miles away at the time it would be a pretty conclusive defence if we fought gilliats claim  it would be so conclusive a defence sir that gilliat would never bring the case into court the moment he saw that there really was an impostor going about as miss hawtrey he would see that he had been victimised and that his only course was to apologise to miss hawtrey for having doubted her word and to withdraw his claim yes there is no doubt it would be the wisest plan to do nothing whatever in the way of advertising or warning the tradespeople  a week later the authorities at scotland yard had notified the french belgian and german police that a man and woman whose description was accurately given and a likeness of the latter sent would be probably passing themselves off under an assumed name and that should they show themselves they were to be arrested as swindlers small samples of four pieces of silk and drawings of the mantles were also enclosed to aid in the identification of the female prisoner who would probably have these clothes with her  similar letters were also sent off to the police authorities in all large towns and wateringplaces in the united kingdom  mr hawtrey called twice in jermyn street but found that captain hampton was away he wrote him however a full account of all that had been decided upon and asked him should he return before they started for the continent to call and see them he came in on the last evening before they left town  i only returned an hour ago he said i was delighted to get your letter and to find the decision you had arrived at he had shaken hands cordially with mr hawtrey formally with mrs daintree and dorothy mr hawtrey glanced at the former and shook his head to intimate that that lady had not been taken into the family council  mary knows nothing about it he took occasion afterwards to say in a low voice the whole thing has been kept a secret from her she kept her bed for four days after that halliburn affair and had she known that dorothy was accused of stealing she would have had a fit  you mean as to going away before the season is quite over captain hampton mrs daintree said in reference to his remark on entering yes i think it is very wise dorothy has been looking far from well for the last month and the excitement and late hours have been too much for her i shall be very glad myself to be back again in my quiet home the season has been a very trying one  i am sorry to hear you have been poorly mrs daintree london seems pleasant enough to me though there have been two or three very hot days  what are you going to do ned mr hawtrey asked i suppose you are not going to stay after every one else has gone i have heard nothing more about that yacht you talked of  i have given up the idea i daresay i should have enjoyed it very much but one wants a pleasant party and it does not seem to me that i can get one together so i have abandoned it and intend taking a run across the atlantic for two or three months i did switzerland and italy before i went away and should not care about doing switzerland again at the time when every hotel is crowded and as for italy it would be too hot i have always thought that i should like a run through the states and i am never likely to have a better opportunity than this  i suppose you will be back by christmas ned i need not say how glad i shall be if you come down and spend it with us it would be like old times lad  thank you mr hawtrey i should like it greatly but i will make no promises  well suppose you come down to my den and smoke a cigar ned there are several matters i want to chat with you about  why i want to get off in a hurry he went on when they were seated in the library i saw halliburn on the day after the affair was broken off and i suggested to him that the matter should not be made public for a week or two the house will separate next week and i thought it would be pleasanter to both parties if nothing was said about it till after that when both will be away and society scattered so that all gossip or annoying questions would be avoided he agreed with me thoroughly as he evidently objected quite as much as i did to there being any talk on the subject so i wrote a paragraph with his approval it will be sent round to halfadozen of these gossipy papers the day after parliament goes down this is it we are authorised to state that the match arranged between the earl of halliburn and miss hawtrey will not take place we understand that the initiative in the matter was taken by the lady who in view of the malicious reports concerning her that have appeared in some of the papers has decided to withdraw from the engagement much we believe to the regret of the noble earl  that will do excellently captain hampton agreed i may tell you frankly mr hawtrey that the idea of going to the states only occurred to me after reading your letter for the last week i have been working along the south coast wateringplaces giving a day to each i began at hastings and went to eastbourne brighton worthing southsea and southampton and took a run to ryde and cowes i went to every hotel of any size at each of those towns saw the manager and two or three of the waiters and showed them the photograph and the scraps of silk but none of them had had any lady at all answering to that description or resembling the likeness staying there i intended to have made the entire tour of the seaports but now that instructions have been sent to all the local police officers i need spend no more time over it they will do it infinitely better than i could for whereas i could only see to the hotels they will naturally keep an eye upon all visitors and it is as likely that they may be in lodgings as at an hotel more likely indeed for at present they are flush of cash and would not want to make the acquaintance of people especially at hotels where there would be the risk of running up against somebody who knew miss hawtrey so with england and the continent both provided for i am free to try the states i should not have said anything to you about it but i want you to write to me if the police find any trace of them i will go to the metropolitan hotel at new york and when i leave will keep them posted as to my whereabouts so that they can forward any letter to me  my dear ned mr hawtrey said feelingly you are indeed a good friend i do not know how to thank you enough but i really do not like you to be wasting your holiday in this fashion  dont worry about that if it hadnt been for this i should have been hanging about with no particular object and should have been heartily sick of doing nothing long before my year was out this will give an interest and an object in travelling about and it is always a pleasure to be working for ones dearest friends there are but few people in england now for whom i really care i never got on with my brothers and beyond yourself and kind old mr singleton i have really no friends except army men or school chums like danvers and every time i come home their number will diminish you must remember i am a police officer and i suppose the instinct of thiefcatching is strong in me certainty i shall not feel happy until i have got at the root of this mystery you must remember the hypothesis as to this woman is my own and i feel that my honour is concerned to prove its correctness but mind mr hawtrey i particularly request that dorothy shall know nothing of the matter  why not ned  i have not been successful so far and in fact have done more harm than good and the betting is very strongly against my succeeding they may not have gone to america i simply choose it because the other ground is occupied and also because there is an undoubted tendency among criminals to make for the states in the next place even if they are in america it is almost like looking for a needle in a cartload of hay still if fortune favours me i may possibly succeed but if i do not i certainly do not wish to let dorothy know that i have been trying i have wronged her by having doubted her for a moment and i do not wish to compel her to feel under an obligation to me merely because i have united amusement with a little work on her behalf  well i think you are wrong nedwrong altogether but of course you must do as you like in the matter have you sketched out any plan for yourself  i have not thought it over yet but it will be similar to that i have been just working if they have gone to america new york is of course their most probable destination i suppose there are not above five or six hotels that are usually frequented by people coming from england i shall try them first then go down rather lower in the grade and if i do not succeed there i shall try boston then i must take the other ports to which liners run until i have exhausted them i have at least one advantage there there will be no question as to their going direct into lodgings they will be certain to put up at an hotel at first there is no saying as to where they will go afterwards my movements will depend entirely on whether i can pick up a clue if i cannot get one at any of the seaports there is an end of it for it would be mere folly to search at random in the interior of course before starting i shall go to all the steamship offices in london and find what vessels sailed between the 17th and 24th of last month that will give me a margin of a week if they did not go within a week after the robbery they wont have gone at all  perhaps we had better join the ladies again or they may be suspecting us of arranging some plan or other  i will just go up and say goodbye and go i hope i shall find dorothy looking better on my return the troubles of the last eight weeks have told their tale on her but i hope that two months change and then a time of rest and quiet will soon set her up again  well god bless you ned i hope that your search will be successful but i shall not build upon it at all and pray do not worry yourself if you do not succeed  they went upstairs again mrs daintree had already gone to bed  dorothy was sitting with the teatray before her when her father and ned hampton entered  i was just going to send down to you father i thought that you must have nearly finished your cigars  thank you i wont take any tea miss hawtrey captain hampton said as she was about to pour out two cups i only came up to say goodbye and to wish you a pleasant time abroad as i only came back half an hour before i came across to you i have a pile of notes to open and answer and as i shall sail in a day or two i shall have my hands full  dorothy stood up and shook hands  goodbye captain hampton thank you for your good wishes i hope that you too will enjoy your trip it was said in the tone of voice in which she might have said goodbye to the most ordinary acquaintance  captain hampton dropped her hand abruptly and shook hands heartily with mr hawtrey who said goodbye ned dont get yourself into any scrapes with indians or grizzly bears or anything of that sort  i will try not to sir and captain hampton turned and left the room mr hawtrey turned as the door closed and was about to say something sharply when he saw that there were tears in dorothys eyes he gulped down his irritation took his cup of tea off the tray and stirred it with unnecessary violence then he abruptly asked dorothy if her packing was all finished  we must breakfast at seven sharp he said so as to catch the boat with a quarter of an hour to spare the exodus has begun and there is sure to be a crowd  ten minutes in the morning will finish everything dorothy said i will be down at a quarter to seven mildred can put the rest of the things in while we are at breakfast all the boxes are packed and corded but one and can be brought down as soon as i am out of the room is captain hampton going to shoot bears and that sort of thing that you gave him warning  he does not seem to have any fixed plan dorothy but i fancy from what he said that he is more likely to wander about and look at the towns and such places as niagara and the other places tourists go to as a matter of course he certainly did not say a word about shooting and my warning was in no way given seriously if we were not going away ourselves i should miss him amazingly for a better fellow never trod in shoe leather now its halfpast ten dear and the sooner we are both in bed the better for we are to be called at six  while ned hampton had been away jacob had spent his whole time in wandering in the suburbs in the vain hope of catching sight of the man and woman of whom he was in search ned had shown him the portrait and the boy had examined it closely  i shall know her when i see her captain one doesnt see gals like that every day i seem to have seen some one like her but i cant think where i am sure she was not so pretty as that not by a long way but there is something in the picture that i seem to know  he was in when his master returned from the hawtreys  no luck captain he said apologetically and it aint been from want of tramping about for i have walked about every day from eight in the morning and got home at evening that tired i could hardly get upstairs to bed  by the way jacob have you ever thought of whom the likeness reminded you i told you to try and think who it was  yes i know who it was now but it aint in our way at all four or five years ago i lived up a court at chelsea not far from that big hospital where they put the old soldiers well there was a gal about two years older than me lived up in the attic of one of the houses in the court along with a woman i dont remember what the old ones name was now but she used to drink awful she was about fifteenthe gal i meanand i was about twelve that gal had something of the look of the lady in the picture except that the picture is smiling and she used in general to look cross i dont know what there was in her face that comes back to me as being like the picture but there must have been something else it would not have made me think of her  was the woman her mother  i dont know sir  well you go down to that court tomorrow jacob the first thing and find out if that woman is there still and whether the girl is with her and if they have moved try to find out where they have gone to i dont suppose there can be the slightest connection between that girl and the woman that i am in search of for the woman must have been educated to a certain extent or she would have been detected by the jeweller or mr singleton directly she spoke still as there is nothing else for you to do it would be just as well for you to make inquiries  there is something else i want to speak to you about jacob in a day or two i shall leave for america and may be away some monthsi only settled the matter an hour agoand i dont see what i am to do with you i dont know what sort of place you are fit for here and if i did know i dont see how i could get it for you  take me with you captain jacob said promptly couldnt i be of use to you there sir as well as here i knows as i havent done no good yet but it aint been for want of trying i will take my davy on that  i dont say that you would not be of use jacob but you would add very heavily to my expenses the distances there are very great and the extra train fares would come to quite a large sum you would not cost much besides not more perhaps than here  i would not cost so much captain jacob said confidently i calls it just chucking money away as it is now i would be willing to live on dry bread if you would take me three pennyworth a day would do me fine and i could take my old clothes with me and put them on at nights and sleep anywhere as to the trains captain i could walk firstrate and i expect i could get a lift in a waggon sometimes  well i will think it over jacob i dont quite see what use you would be to me though there might be occasions when i might want some one to keep watch well go off to bed now i shall have thought it over by the time i see you in the middle of the day  while captain hampton sat smoking he finally settled the question commonsense as he told himself was altogether against taking the boy his passage out and back in the steerage would cost eight or ten pounds there was no saying how much the railway fares would be if he got on these peoples track and found they had gone inland it was not likely that the boy could be of any material use to him  the more he thought of it the more absurd the idea of taking him appeared and yet that was what he decided upon doing it was a luxury but he had laid by money each year to enable him to enjoy his trip home thoroughly circumstances had occurred that had altogether upset the programme he had formed and there was no reason why he should not enjoy the luxury of having jacob with him  he had taken a strong liking to the boy jacob had attached himself to him without any other reason than that he liked him and he was certain that he would serve him faithfully he was as sharp as a needle with that precocious sharpness which comes of want and necessity supposing these people were found they would certainly have to be watched until an extradition warrant could be obtained from england but above all in such a quest it would be a satisfaction to have some one to talk to some one who would be as keen in the search as he was himself  i dont suppose it will cost more than fifty pounds he said finally and that bit of extravagance wont hurt me  in the morning his first visit was to danvers chambers  i was wondering where you had hidden yourself hampton i have seen scarcely anything of you for the last fortnight  i have been trying to get to the bottom of this affair of hawtreys on my own account and of course have failed i am going for a run over to the states i dont care for the continent in august and september the hotels are so frightfully crowded it has struck me that it is possible that these people may have gone to the states and i will stop a day or two in new york to see if i can find any trace of their having passed through there i found a letter from hawtrey when i came home last night telling me all that you are doing as you are acting in the matter with charles levine i thought it would be a help to me if you would get a letter for me from scotland yard to the police there saying that i was in search of two notorious swindlers and asking them to give me any assistance they can  that is a very good idea hampton it is quite on the cards that they made for the states directly they had realised the money for their plunder  how long do you think they would have been doing that  two or three days it is not likely they would sell the diamonds here the man probably started with them for hamburg the night they were stolen and a few hours would be sufficient there  the robbery was on the 15th of last month there is no reason why they should not have sailed by the 20th from liverpool or he may have taken her with him danvers and they may have gone by one of the german steamers  that is likely enough danvers agreed if they have gone to the states and if there happened to be a steamer anywhere about at that time it is the route they would naturally choose they would of course be pretty sure that it would be some days before the robbery of the diamonds would be discovered still longer before it occurred to anyone that miss hawtrey herself had nothing whatever to do with it still they would not care to delay and would certainly prefer a route that would obviate the necessity for their passing through england  well i will see about this matter at once i have not been in communication with scotland yard myself of course all that comes into levines province i will go down to him and ask him to get the letter at once when are you leaving  i have nothing to keep me here and if i find there is a steamer going on wednesday i will take a berth in her i can be ready to leave here tomorrow night indeed i could leave tonight if necessary  wednesday is the regular mail day that is i know letters have to be posted here on tuesday afternoon so you will get one of the fast boats on wednesday you have heard all the fresh developments i suppose in miss hawtreys affair  captain hampton nodded  i tell you it surprised me and it surprised levine even more he scoffed altogether at the suggestion of which mr hawtrey told me you were the author that it was a case of personation but these two cases staggered him i dont think that the getting money from singleton would have done so alone but the getting the silk dresses seemed to him conclusive he quite believed that a girl might be driven to any straits if threatened by a scoundrel who had a hold on her but that miss hawtrey should have taken to motiveless petty swindling seemed to him incredible i was not as surprised as he was because strong as the case seemed against her i could not bring myself to believe altogether that she was guilty i am heartily glad at any rate that we have persuaded hawtrey to pay the money if he cannot get any evidence in support of the impersonation theory  so am i danvers hawtrey told me that you both said he had no chance whatever of getting a verdict and i quite agree with you but even if the jury had been persuaded numbers of the public would still have believed her guilty and the story would have told against her all her life  i am very sorry that i am engaged this evening hampton or else we might have dined together it is one i cannot very well get out of how long do you mean to be away  it is quite uncertain if i can get any trace of these people i mean to follow it up if it takes months to do it  the other nodded  i suppose hawtrey told you that that engagement was broken off he said carelessly  yes hampton said shortly hawtrey told me i was very glad to hear it for this sort of thing might have been started on an even bigger scale if she had married him and might have ruined her life altogether it is bad enough as it is  no means of writing to you i suppose while you are away  i shall be glad if you will write to me to the metropolitan hotel new york if anything should be heard of these people here or on the continent and i shall telegraph to those hotel people two or three times a week saying where i am so that they can forward anything on to me but i dont think that letters will be likely to overtake me as i shall be moving about i suppose you have arranged to telegraph at once to him if you get any news from the foreign police  yes he is going to send me a line three or four times a week with his address for the next day or two  then in that case it would be of no use your writing to me as he will know directly you do if anything turns up well goodbye old fellow  goodbye i suppose that you will be back by the end of the year at any rate i hope so i am off tomorrow myself i am going to vienna i have a case coming on next sessions and want to see some people there so i can combine business with pleasure i think it possible that i may go on from there to constantinople and then go down to greece and home by water i should have started a week ago if it had not been for this business of hawtreys which seemed at one time to look so serious that i really did not like to go away until something was settled  captain hamptons arrangements occupied him little more than halfanhour he bought a case of cartridges for his revolver took a passage for himself and one in the steerage for jacob he hesitated as to whether to get the boy some more clothes but decided to put that off till he got out as there might be some slight difference in make that would attract attention the only thing he bought for him was a small portmanteau after taking his passage therefore he went home and read the paper till jacob came in  well jacob to begin with what is your news  the woman died two years ago sir drank herself to death the neighbours say the gal had left her two years before no one knows where she went to no one saw her go the woman let out some time afterwards as she had gone a friend had took her she said but no one heard her say anything more she wasnt a great one for talking the woman wasnt buried by the parish an undertaker came and said he had been sent to do the job and she was buried decent there were a hearse and a carriage and some of the people in the court went to the funeral cause she wasnt a bad sort when she was sober and please captain am i going with you  yes i have made up my mind to take you  the boy threw up the cap that he held in his hand to the ceiling and caught it again thank you sir he said i laid awake all night thinking on it i will do all that you tell me sir and if i dont act right just you turn me adrift out therethere aint nothing as would be too bad for me     chapter xi   the hawtreys were ten days out from england and were spending the day in a trip up lake lucerne not as yet were the great caravansaries that have well nigh spoiled lucerne and converted the most picturesque town in europe into a line of brand new hotels that might just as well be at brighton ostend or any other watering place so much as thought of not as yet had the whole of the middle class of england discovered that a month on the continent was one of the necessities of life nor had the great summer invasion from the other side of the atlantic begun such hotels as existed were however crowded when the season was over in london and those who had met so frequently during the last four months came across each other at every turn in steamboats diligences and in hotels not as yet had the steam whistle seriously invaded switzerland and travellers were content to jog quietly along enjoying the beauties of nature instead of merely rushing through them from point to point mr singleton was with the hawtreys he had said goodbye when he left them on their last evening at home without a hint of his intention of accompanying them but he was quietly walking up and down the deck of the boat at dover when they went on board  why there is mr singleton father dorothy exclaimed in surprise as her eye fell upon him as she went down the gangway why he did not say anything about coming over when we said goodbye to him last night  well my dear her godfather said as he came up to them you did not expect to see me  no indeed mr singleton why didnt you say yesterday when we saw you that you were going across today  i dont know that i had quite made up my mind dorothy i had been thinking about it but i often think of things and nothing comes of it after i had left you i thought it over seriously i had not been abroad for some years and i said to myself if i dont go now i suppose i shall never go at all here is a good opportunity it is lonely work when one gets the wrong side of sixty to travel alone at my age one does not make acquaintances at every turn as young fellows do no doubt i should meet men i know but as a rule people one knows are not so fond of each others society as they are in london i think my old friend hawtrey and my little goddaughter would not mind putting up with me and i can travel with them till they begin to get tired of me and then jog quietly back my own way  then you will stop with us all the time mr singleton i am delighted and i am sure father is too  that i am mr hawtrey said heartily understanding perhaps better than dorothy did why his friend had at the last moment decided to go with them when did you come down  i came by the same train you did i came straight on board for i have brought my man with me and he is looking after my things i have got into regular old bachelor ways dear and am so accustomed to have my hot water brought in of a morning and my clothes laid out for me and my boxes packed and corded that i should feel like a fish out of water without them  it is your first trip abroad isnt it at least i know you went to paris last year but i dont think you got any further  no we stayed there a fortnight but that was all  well you had better take your things down now mr hawtrey broke in in case you have to lie down there seems to be a fresh wind blowing outside  oh i dont mean to be ill father i think it was a rougher day than this last time and i did not go below still i may as well secure a place  this is awfully good of you singleton mr hawtrey said i know you are doing it out of regard for her  a little that way perhaps hawtrey and a good deal because i am sure i shall enjoy myself greatly as a rule i should be very chary of offering to join anyone travelling a third person is often a nuisance just as much so in travelling as at other times i own that i dont much care for going about by myself but i thought you really would be glad to have me with you dorothy has had so much to try her of late that i felt this was really a case where a third person would be of advantage i can help to keep up conversation and prevent her from thinking and worrying over these things besides there is no doubt you will be running continually against people you know the announcement that will appear tomorrow of the breaking off of her engagement will set people talking again it is just one of the things that the last arrival from england will mention as being the latest bit of society news and i think somehow that three people together can face public attention better than two can  thank you old friend it will be better for her in every way i am not a good hand at making conversation and it will be the thing of all others for dorothy she always chatters away with you more than with anyone else and i can assure you that i feel your coming a perfect godsend she scarcely said a word coming down this morning and though i tried occasionally to talk about our trip she only answered with an evident effort i am afraid it will take some time to get all this out of her mind  it would be strange if it didnt hawtrey for a girl who has practically never known a care to find herself suddenly suspected and talked of first as having compromised herself with some unknown person and then as being a thief is enough to give her a tremendous shaking up  then the breaking off of her engagement was another trial i dont say that it was the same thing as if she had loved the man with a real earnest love still it is a trial for any girl to break off a thing of that sort and to know that it will be a matter of general talk and discussion especially coming at the top of the other business  here she comes again and looking a hundred per cent better than she did before she caught sight of you singleton i shall begin to be veritably jealous of you  they had stopped two days in paris and as much at basle and had now been four days at lucerne where they had met many of their own set the news had already been told and dorothy was conscious of being regarded with a certain curiosity at the table dhôte as the girl who had just broken off a brilliant match but she betrayed no signs of consciousness that she was the object of attention and those who had been most intimate with her and had been inclined to condole with her felt that in face of the lighthearted gaiety with which she chatted with her father and mr singleton and the brightness of her looks anything of the kind would be out of place  she looks quite a different girl to what she did during the season one of her acquaintances said to mrs dean who had arrived at lucerne the day before the hawtreys i suppose she never really cared for halliburn after all no doubt those curious stories that there were about had something to do with the affair being broken off for my part i think it would have been better taste for her  to have gone about with a long face i dont agree with you at all mrs dean replied warmly i am an old friend of hers and am delighted to see her look so much happier and better i said a month ago that i thought the marriage would never come off i was at a dinner party with them and halliburn was there if i had been dorothy hawtrey i would have given him his congé that evening his conduct was in the worst taste instead of showing the world how entirely he trusted her and how he despised these reports he was so fidgety and irritable that it was impossible to avoid noticing it the man is a peer and a rising politician a clever man and a large landowner but for all that he is not a gentleman i always said that he was not good enough for dorothy and i am heartily glad she has broken it off at any rate it is quite evident that she feels no regret about it whatever was the actual cause of the rupture she might laugh and talk and try to look unconcernedany girl of spirit would do that under the circumstancesbut she couldnt have got her natural colour back again or have made her eyes laugh as well as her lips unless she had really felt relieved at being free again  mrs dean had been a good deal with the hawtreys during their four days at lucerne and dorothy had felt her society a great assistance to her in supporting the first brunt of public remark she was the only person who had spoken to dorothy of what all the others were talking about  they were standing together on the deck of a steamer going up the lake when mrs dean said suddenly  i know dorothy you will not mind an old friend speaking to you and i really want to congratulate you heartily on breaking off your match i dont know the exact reasons that influenced you but i am sure that you were right i dont think you would ever have been really happy with him there would never have been any true sympathy between you some women could be content with rank and wealth but i am sure you could not  no i think it was a mistake altogether mrs dean dorothy said thoughtfully i did not become engaged to him for thati mean for rank and wealth i dont say they did not count for something but i honestly did think i liked him and there was no real reason for its being broken off except that i found that i had made a mistake i should not say so of course to anyone but an old friend like you i shall never say anything about it but let people think what they like and i know that you will never repeat it  certainly not dorothy but if you dont say it in words i think everyone could see that at least there is no regret on your part at the match being broken off the wonder wont last longanother week and something fresh will be talked of and by next year the whole affair will have died away people have wonderfully short memories in society do you know i rather take credit to myself as a prophetess for on the evening of that dinner party where i last met you and halliburn together i told captain hampton that i didnt think your match would ever come off by the bye what a nice fellow he is he is wonderfully little changed since i knew him as a boy down in lincolnshire before he went into the army sometimes boys change so when they become men that it is quite a pleasure to meet one who has grown up exactly as you might have expected he would do you saw a good deal of him i believe  yes at the beginning of the season we did not see so much of him afterwards i dont think he is so little changed as you do  mrs dean gave a quick keen glance at dorothy who was looking a little dreamily at the mountains at the head of the lake  no she said carelessly well of course you knew him better than i did he was so often over at your fathers you were but a child then and i daresay that you endowed him as most young girls do boys older than themselves with all sorts of impossible qualities  no i dont know that it was that dorothy said but he seems to me to be changed a good deal in many respects he was almost like an elder brother of mine then  yes dear but then you see when he came back he found that another had stepped into a much closer place than even an elder brothers and he could hardly have assumed his former relationship these brother and sisterhoods are very nice when the young lady is twelve and the boy eighteen or nineteen but they are a little difficult to maintain when the boy is a man of sixandtwenty and the girl eighteen and is engaged to somebody else who might not unreasonably object to the relationship a boy and girl friendship is not to be picked up again after a lapse of six years just where it was dropped it would be very ridiculous to suppose that it could be so it seems to me that you have been expecting too much from him for my part i think he has changed very little  i did not expect anything of him mrs dean one way or the other i had often thought of him while he was away because he was very kind to me in the old days i used to write to him when he first went out and he wrote to me of course that dropped but when he came home just at first it seemed to me that he was exactly what i expected though i found in some respects that he was changed however i dont know why we are talking about him captain hampton has gone to america i believe and it is likely enough we may not see him again before he goes back to india then she changed her tone it is rather a sore subject to me mrs dean it is the last of my illusions of childhood gone i quite agree with you that it was very foolish of me to think that we could drop quite into our old relations especially as things stood but at least i expected something and was disappointed he has been very kind and has taken an immense deal of trouble to assist my father to get to the bottom of some of the things that have been troubling us i have not the least ground for complainton the contrary i have every reason to be grateful to him but as i say i have all the same been disappointed in some of my illusions and i would rather not talk about it what a change it is to be on this quiet lake and among these great silent hills after six months in london there one always seemed to be in a bustle and fever here one feels as if nothing that happened could matter  the london season is pleasant enough mrs dean said and though this is all very charming and delightful for a change and very restful i fancy that before long we should get tired of this changeless calm of nature and begin to long for i wont say excitement but the pleasure of societyof people you like we only came up to town for three months and i own that i enjoyed it heartily there is so much to look at i have no daughters to marry off no personal interest in the comedy so i look on and like it and enjoy my home during the other nine months all the better for having been away we do not often come abroad i suppose now these railways are being made everywhere there will be a great deal more travelling about but i dont think we should often come you talk of the bustle of life in london it is nothing to the bustle of travelling as soon as one gets settled down at an hotel it is time to be going on if i come out again next year i shall persuade my husband to take a little châlet high up on the hill there where one can rest and take ones fill of the view of those mountains i shall bring plenty of work with me and my own maid then i could sit in the shade and pretend to embroider and talk to her while william read his times and amused himself in his own way which lies chiefly in going about with a hammer and collecting geological specimens  this last was addressed partly to mr dean who just then came up with his friends  i fancy you would be tired of that sort of life long before i should sarah he said laughing women always seem to have an idea hawtrey that one rock is as good as another and that if a man goes out with a hammer it can make no difference to him whether he brings in twenty specimens from a radius of a hundred yards from a house or the same number collected during a fifty miles ramble personally i should not at all mind making my head quarters for six weeks or so on this lake providing one did not go up too high one wants to be within a quarterofanhours walk of a village where one can hire a boat to land where one likes and make excursions among the hills i should not want to do any snowclimbing but there are plenty of problems one would be glad to go into if one could investigate them without that it is really a treat to me after lincolnshire to get into a country where you can go into geological problems without having to begin by digging  i may frankly say that i know nothing about it mr hawtrey replied the only problem connected with digging that i have been interested in is how to get the heaviest crops possible out of the ground well here we are at the head of the lake it will be two hours before a steamer goes back i propose lunch in the first place and then we shall have time for a walk to althorp where we can examine the marketplace where william tell shot at the apple that is to say ifas now seems doubtfulwilliam tell ever had an existence at all  i wont have it doubted mr hawtrey mrs dean exclaimed it would be the destruction of another of ones cherished heroes of childhood and she glanced with a little smile at dorothy who smiled back but shook her head decidedly  a group of people were gathered on the wharf to see the steamer come in  why there are the fortescuesfather mother and daughters mrs dean exclaimed captain armstrong and mr fitzwarren one cannot get out of london  a moment later they were exchanging greetings on the wharf the fortescues had arrived that morning in a postcarriage from milan captain armstrong and fitzwarren had got in an hour before by diligence from como both parties were going down by the boat to lucerne  it is too hot for anything in italy mrs fortescue said it was foolish of us trying it of course we ought not to have gone over there until the end of september or else in may may was out of the question because of the house september was equally so because of the shooting so my husband paired till the end of the session and we started early last month we have been doing florence and bologna and venice and the places along to milan and then i struck the heat was unbearable so now we shall spend a fortnight in switzerland before we go back i suppose there are lots of people one knows at lucerne  but you wont be back in time for the 1st mrs fortescue if you do that  no we have lately settled to give up the idea it would be such a pity now we are here to deprive the girls of the pleasure of a ramble through switzerland so mr fortescue has made up his mind to sacrifice himself and we have promised faithfully that he shall be back in time for the pheasants  mr fortescue a tall powerfullybuilt specimen of english squiredom shrugged his shoulders unseen by his wife he was not altogether unaccustomed to sacrifices his career as a legislator was altogether a sacrifice he hated london he hated parliament where his voice was never heard except upon some question connected with the agricultural interest and if he had had his own way he would never have been seen outside his native county but as mrs fortescue held that it was clearly his duty for the sake of his family that he should represent his division and that the season should be spent in town he had in this as indeed in almost every other matter to give way experience had taught him that it was well to do so at once for that it always came to the same thing in the end upon the present occasion he had indeed remonstrated he hated travelling and was longing to be at his country seat and to keep him out another five weeks was a clear and distinct breach of the agreement that had been made before starting  while they were talking with mr hawtrey and mrs dean the girls and dorothy who had been intimate in london were holding a little colloquy apart  is it true dearthe news we heard at milan just before we started the eldest asked  i suppose i know what you mean ada yes it is quite true and best for all parties so we need not say anything more about it  you are looking wonderfully well dorothy clara the younger of the two girls remarked to change the subject which she saw was not to be discussed it is quite refreshing to see you we are feeling quite washed out talk about the season i felt quite fresh when i left town to what i do now we have scarcely known what it is to be cool for the last month and there has been no sleeping at night half the time because of the mosquitos it is nice meeting captain armstrong and mr fitzwarren here isnt it  dorothy said yes but she did not feel at all sure about it captain armstrong who was in the blues had been among her most persistent admirers at the beginning of the season and she had refused him a month before her engagement to lord halliburn doubtless he also would have heard of her engagement being off and might renew his attentions he was a very popular man and she was conscious that she liked him and had said no if not less decidedly at least after more hesitation and doubt than she had done to any of her previous admirers she felt sure that she should give the same answer if he ever repeated the question but she did not want it repeated and she wished that they had not met again just at this time  the awkwardness of the rejection had long since passed they had met and danced together a score of times since she had said when she rejected him let us be friends captain armstrong i like you very much though i dont want to marry you and they had been friends and had met and chatted just as if that interview had not taken place the only allusion he had ever made to it had been when they met for the first time after her engagement had been announced and he had said so halliburn is to be the lucky man miss hawtrey i dont think it quite fair that he should have all the good things of life and she had replied there are good things for us all captain armstrong if we do but look for them and not like children set our minds on what we cant get i think i would rather see you marry him than most people miss hawtrey perhaps because he is altogether unlike myself  she had made no answer at the time but had thought afterwards of what he had said yes the two men were very unlike and there was no doubt something in what captain armstrong had said she thought that if she loved a man she could bear better to see him marry a woman altogether unlike herself in every respect than one who resembled her closely though perhaps she could hardly explain to herself why this should be so  they were a merry party on board the steamer going down the lake and the new comers took rooms at the same hotel as the hawtreys  well what do you mean to do armstrong fitzwarren asked as they strolled out to smoke a cigar by the lake after the rest of the party had gone to bed you know what i mean you told me the other day about your affair with miss hawtrey  i should not have said anything about it the other returned if i had had any idea that her engagement with halliburn would come to nothing we had been talking over that business of hers and i expressed my opinion pretty strongly as to halliburns behaviour to her in public and said that i wondered she stood it then getting heated i was ass enough to say that had i been in his position i should have behaved in a different sort of way and generally expressed my contempt for him then you asked why hadnt i put myself in his position and i told you it was no fault of mine for that i had tried and failed when you made some uncomplimentary remarks as to her taste and we nearly had a row  you ask me what i am going to do of course if we had not heard that news when we got to milan i should have gone this afternoon directly we arrived here to take my place in the first diligence that started no matter where now i shall stay and try my luck again it is quite evident by her manner that she never really cared for the fellow and that this breaking off of the engagement is a great relief to her i never saw her in higher spirits and i am sure there was nothing forced about them i am sure she would not have accepted him unless she thought she liked him she is not the sort of girl to marry for position alone though i dare say if it had not been for the other business she would have married him and would have believed all her life that he was a very fine fellow well you see he came very badly out of it and showed himself to her in his true light as a selfish coldhearted miserable little prig and you see directly her eyes were opened she threw him over so it seems to me that there is a chance  one could not have met her again under more favourable circumstances one gets ten times the opportunities travelling about together that one does in a london season however i think my chance is worth very little she said honestly that she liked me very much before and i could see it really pained her to refuse me i dont think it was halliburn who stood in the way although he was attentive at that time  i should have thought that would have been all in your favour if she acknowledged that she liked you very much and was cut up at refusing you why should she not like you better when she sees more of you  because fitzwarren it was not the right sort of liking we were if i may so express it chums and i am afraid we shall never get beyond that on her side you see a woman wants something ideal now there is nothing ideal about me i suppose i may say i am a decent pleasant sort of fellow but there are no what you may call possibilities about me now halliburn you see was full of possibilities he had the reputation of being somehow a superior sort of young manand there is no doubt he is clever in his wayhe will probably some day be in the cabinet and the idea of ones husband being a ruler of men is fascinating to the female mind i suppose there was no woman ever married a curate who had not a private belief that he would some day be an archbishop now there is not a shadow of this sort of thing about me i may possibly get to command the regiment some day and then when i have held the command for the usual time i shall be shelved and shall i suppose retire gracefully to my estate in yorkshire i suppose i am good enough for the ruck of girls but i feel sure that i am not up to dorothy hawtreys ideal and that though this may end by our being greater friends than before i doubt whether there is much chance of anything else coming of it  it is no use your running yourself down in that way armstrong when a man stands six foot two and is one of the bestlooking fellows in london and one of the most popular men and is not only a captain of the blues but has a fine estate down in yorkshire he ought to have a fair chance with almost any girl  even accepting all you say as gospel fitzwarren it comes to the same thing it might succeed with most women as you say but i dont think it will with her it may make her like me but i dont think it will make her love me i dont think she is a bit worldly and i know by what she let drop one day when we were chatting together when we got rather confidential at the beginning of the season that she had got the idea in her head that a woman ought to respect her husband and look up to him and had in fact formed a distinct notion of the sort of man she should choose and i felt at the time though there was nothing whatever personal in our talk i was the very last sort of fellow she would choose for her husband well i shall try again i have won more than one steeplechase after a horse going down with me at a bad fence this is the same sort of thing after all it is of no use mounting and going on again when you see another fellow sailing away ahead and close to the winning post but if he has fallen too and nothing seems to have a better chance than you have a man who gives up the race because he has had an awkward purler is no better than a cur  as it does not make much difference to me which way we go armstrong i am willing enough to keep with you for a bit and see how things go but i dont suppose i shall be able to stand it long and i shall reserve to myself the right of striking off on my own account or joining someone else if i find your society insupportable  that is all right old fellow our arrangement was to travel together of course if i give up travelling and take to loitering about you are free to do what you like and i am the last man to wish you to alter your plans because i have changed my mind as a rule i think it is always wise to steer clear of people one knows when one is travelling and to be free to do exactly as one likes which one never can if one gets mixed up with a party i have always been dead against that they want to see things you dont want to see they want to stay in towns and to potter about picture galleries and churches while you want to go right away up a hill  that is not the worst of it armstrong it is the danger  the danger what do you mean  the danger of going too far a flirtation means nothing in town but it is apt to become a very serious matter when you are travelling about together a row in a boat on an evening like this or as you say going about to churches and picture galleries when you are dead certain to get separated from the rest of the party or a climb through a pine forestthese things are all full of peril and you are liable to find yourself saying things that there is no getting out of and there you areengaged to perhaps the last girl that you would had you calmly and patiently thought the matter out have gone in for  captain armstrong laughed  ah it is all very well for you to laugh in the first place you have been what is called a general flirt for years and would not be suspected of serious intentions unless you went very far indeed and in the second place you could afford to marry a girl without a penny if you had any inclination to do so it is a different thing altogether with fellows like myself who have no choice between remaining single and marrying a wife with some money there are some luxuries i absolutely cannot afford and among them i may reckon travelling about in a party in which are some tocherless damselsfor instance the fortescues who i daresay will for the next ten days or a fortnight travel with the hawtreys they are nice unaffected girls pretty and pleasant but they have three elder brothers i could not afford one of them my line in life is clearly chalked out not for me is the gilded heiress her friends will look after her too sharply for that i have pictured to myself that in another eight or ten years i may be able to secure the affections of the relict of some respectable man who has left her with a snug jointure she will not be too young but just approaching nearly enough to middle age to begin to fear being laid on the shelf then in the comfortable home that she will provide for me i can journey pleasantly and contentedly down the vale of life  captain armstrong burst into a loud laugh you will never do it fitzwarren never there is a vein of romance in your composition that will be too much for you it is always young men who fancy they are prudent who end by falling victims to some nice girl without a penny you may take all the precautions you like walk as circumspectly as you will but when the time comes you will succumb without a struggle however do not let me lead you into the net of the fowler keep away from the snare as long as you can when your fate comes upon you you will be captured and i doubt whether you will make as much as a struggle  we shall see armstrong at present you serve as a terrible example well i suppose we may as well turn in  there was a great consultation after breakfast the next morning mr hawtrey had already marked out his own line of travel and had arranged for a carriage by which they would travel by easy stages through brienz interlaken thun freyburg and then on to lausanne they would stay for a week by the lake of geneva and then take another carriage to martigny beyond that nothing was at present settled but they would make martigny their head quarters for some little time the fortescues had no particular plan and were quite ready to fall into that of their friends though as they had as yet seen nothing of lucerne and intended to make some excursions from there they said that they must stop there for a few days but would join the others at martigny  the girls indeed would gladly have gone forward at once being really fond of dorothy and thinking that it would be nice to travel together but their mother overruled this  no no my dears we must see what there is to be seen and it would be a great pity to hurry away at once we shall all meet again at martigny and may perhaps have a fortnight there together besides there are inconveniences in two parties travelling together one may happen to have faster horses than the other and be kept waiting for their meals until the other arrives then they dont always want to stop at the same places or for the same time whoever gets in first may be able to find accommodation at an inn while the second one may find it full dont you think so mr singleton  yes i quite agree with you two parties are apt to be a tie upon each other i think that your plan that we should all meet at martigny is the wisest  what are your plans captain armstrong  beyond the fact that we have a month to wander about before we are due in london we have no particular plans we of course stick to diligence routes bachelors do not indulge in the luxury of posting and indeed i greatly prefer the banquette of a diligence to a carriageyou get a better view you meet other people and learn more of the country we intend to do a little climbingi dont mean high peaks i have no ambition that way whatever but some of the passes and glaciers i was at martigny last year it is perhaps the best central position for the mountains and i think it is very likely that we shall be there while you are  i hope you will mr hawtrey said cordially these three young ladies will be only too glad of two stalwart guides as far as carriages can go or even donkeys we elders can accompany them but when it comes to scrambling about on glaciers or doing anything like climbing we are getting past that  nonsense father dorothy exclaimed why you are often out for eight or ten hours over the turnip fields with a gun you know you could walk four times as far as i could  not twice as far dorothy i have known you walk fifteen miles more than once and i certainly should not care about walking thirty but that has nothing to do with climbing which is a question of weight and wind you have only half my weight to carry i am sure that after dancing through a london season your lungs ought to be in perfect order however i dare say i shall be able to go with you if your views are not too ambitious but the mania for climbing always seems to seize young people when they get among mountains though for my part i prefer the view in a valley to one on the top of a hill at any rate we shall be glad to see you both captain armstrong at martigny whether we requisition your services as guides or not i am sorry dorothy the deans are not coming our way he told me yesterday they were going to zurich and then by constance into bavaria  i am sorry too father i like them so much and it would have been very pleasant indeed if they had been with us     chapter xii   during the voyage captain hampton saw but little of jacob each day he went to the rope across the deck marking the division between the cabin and the steerage passengers and the boy at once came running up to him his report always was that he was getting on fust rate while each day his wonder at the amount of water increased  i would not have believed if i hadnt seen it that there could be so much water captain i cant think where it all comes from i heard some of them say it was tremendous deepten times as deep as that monument with the chap on the top of it in trafalgar square why it must have rained for years and years to have got such a lot of water here as this and it tastes bad i had a wash in a bucket on deck this morning and some of the water got in my mouth and it wur as nasty as could beawful it wur what can make it like that why the water in the thames looks ten times as dirty but it dont taste particular nasty for all that  i will tell you about it some day jacob it is too long to go into now you remind me of it some evening when we are at a lonely inn with nothing to do how do you get on at night  i sleeps all right sir it is awful hot down there in them bunks as they call em one above another just like a threepenny lodginghouse where i used to sleep sometimes when i had had good luck the first night or two was bad there was no mistake about it most of em was awful ill and made noises enough to frighten one i could not think what made them so it seemed to me as if someone must have put pison in the food and i kept on expecting i was going to be took bad too but a young chap tells me in the morning as most people is so the first day they goes to sea if they wur to drink that water i could understand it but it is all right what they gives us and there are some of them as grumbles at the food but i calls it just bang up how much more of this water is there sir  about five more days steaming jacob it is a twelvedays voyage from liverpool to new york i suppose some day they will get to do it in six for they keep on building faster and faster steamers  we are going wonderful fast now the boy said a chaps cap as was sitting up in the end there blew off yesterday and i ran to keep alongside with it but it went a lot faster than i could run i shall be glad when it is over captain not as i aint jolly for i never was so jolly before but i aint doing nothing for you here and i wants to be at work for you somehow if they would let me wait on you and put stuff on those white shoes i should not so much mind  i am very well waited on jacob and if you were to try to wait on me at table while the vessel is rolling you would be pretty sure to spill a plate of soup down my neck or something of that sort you amuse yourself in your own way and dont worry about me when there is anything to do i know you will do it  i find you wont land till tomorrow jacob captain hampton said as the vessel neared the wharf here is the name of the hotel where i shall be in case by any chance i should miss you they say you will probably come ashore at nine oclock in the morning  why cant we all land at once sir  it is late now jacob and it is as much as they will be able to do to get through the cabin passengers baggage before dark indeed it is probable they will only examine the light luggage  what do they want to examine it for sir what business have they with your luggage  they always do it when you go into a foreign country they do it in england too when you come in from abroad everything has to be opened there are some things that pay duty going into a country and they want to see that you have got none of them in your boxes for if you have you must pay for them  then must i open my box if they ask me  you must jacob  and let them rummage my things about  if they want to jacob but i dont suppose they search the steerage baggage much they will probably ask you who you are and where you are going and you must tell them that you are my servant and that i am at the metropolitan hotel but i am pretty sure to be here to see you through  however at halfpast eight as captain hampton went to the door of the hotel with the intention of taking a vehicle down to the wharf he saw jacob coming along carrying his little portmanteau  why jacob i was just starting to the wharf they told me that you were not to land till nine  they said so last night captain but they began just about seven i heard there was another ship come in and they wanted to get us out of the way i was one of the fust ashore and it didnt take many minutes afore i was out of the shed where they looks at the things i says to the first chap i meets where can i take a bus to the metropolitan hotel you wont get no bus here says he how far is it better than two miles he says that settled it and i started off to walk i ought to have been here sooner but some one i asked the way of put me wrong i suppose and a box like this feels wonderful heavier the second mile than it does the first  an arrangement had already been made for jacobs board and lodging and a messenger boy showed him up to his little room at the top of the house and then took him down to a room where the few white servants in the hotel had their meals in half an hour he returned to the hall which served as smokingroom and general meetingplace captain hampton had already had a talk with the clerk  i have not seen a young woman like that the latter said positively when the photograph was produced but then if the man had registered and written her name and his she might not have come up to the desk if you go up to the entrance of the diningroom and ask the negro who takes the hats there he will tell you for certain he has a wonderful head that chap has sometimes there are as many as three hundred come in to dinner between five and seven he takes their hats and puts them on the pegs and racks and as they come out he will give every man his own hat and never make a mistake i never saw such a chap for remembering faces  the negro replied unhesitatingly on seeing the photograph that no such lady had taken any meals at the hotel  de ladies dont come into my department sah but i notice them as they goes in and out and if that young lady had been here i should have noticed her for sartin captain hampton returned to the clerk in the hall who as he happened for the moment to be disengaged was not averse to a talk the darkey has not seen her  then you may be sure she hasnt been here yes i reckon that is about the list of the hotels most of the passengers by the steamers go to he said as he glanced down a list of names captain hampton had got a fellow passenger to draw up i will put down two or three others they are not firstclass but they are a good deal used by people to whom a dollar a day more or less makes a difference and so you say they have been doing some swindling across the water she dont look that sort either from her photograph but they get the things up so one can never tell i see you havent got any german hotels and if as you say you think they came by the line from hamburg they might have gone to one of them  i should not think it likely they spoke german captain hampton said  oh that makes no odds the waiters all talk english and like enough on the voyage they would make friends with some germans who have been here before and they would recommend them one of their own people  that is probable and they would be likely to go there too captain hampton agreed because anyone coming over to search for them would be less likely to search in such places than in houses like yours  then again you see they might have gone straight through without going into an hotel at all that would be the safest way because then there would be no trace left of them  but i suppose not many people do that  oh yes they dolots of them a man saves his hotel bills if he goes straight to the train and there is only one move but of course that is only when a man has quite made up his mind where he is going as a rule when a britisher comes here he waits a few days and asks questions and tries to find out about things unless he is going somewhere straight to a friend is that boy looking for you he has been standing there staring at you for the last five minutes  oh yes that is my servant will you give me the address of the central police station  the clerk wrote the address on a piece of paper and handed it to him  i dont think you will get much good from them he said when people want to hunt a man up here they generally go to an agency they are a way ahead of the regular police and have got some smart fellows among them i can tell you  thank you i should prefer carrying out the matter myself if i can if not i will certainly go to an agency  there is one advantage in going to the police first the man said you will find at a good many hotels the people will have nothing to say to you if you go by yourself it is no business of theirs whether the people who stay at their hotels are swindlers or not and they aint going to meddle in it but if you can get the police to give you a sharp officer to go round with you it will be a different thing altogether  yes that is what i thought myself and why i am going to the police in the first place  turning from the desk he joined jacob  you have had your breakfast he asked  i just have had a breakfast captain i never seed such a lot of thingsand scrumptious too i only wish i could have eaten twice as much  i am going out now jacob and as i shall be calling at several places you had better go your own way remember this street is broadway it is the principal street here so if you do by any chance lose yourself any one can tell you the way  what time am i to be here again captain  did you ask what time dinner was jacob  the black man who brought the things to me said it was two oclock but i shant never be able to eat again so soon  oh yes you will jacob take a good long walk and you will soon get your appetite back again  on stating his business at the central police station he was shown into the room of the chief a quiet but keenfaced man dressed in plain clothes he presented to him the letter from scotland yard  i shall be happy to help you captain hampton if i can he said after glancing through it if you had known for certain what steamer they came over by we should no doubt be able to lay hold of them in the course of a few hours if they are still in the city  i think the probabilities are greatly in favour of their having come by the bremen which sailed from hamburg on july 20 and got here as i saw on august 4 if they did not come by that i think it likely they sailed from some english port two or three days later my first object of course is to find the hotel at which they put up  i will send one of my men round with you and the chief touched a bell is mr tricher in if so ask him to come here  a young man entered the room two minutes later  mr tricher this gentleman has brought us a letter from scotland yard he is in search of two swindlers who have made off with a good deal of money his name is captain hampton he does not belong to the british force but is a friend of some of the parties who have been swindled and has made it his business to find these people they are believed to have come out in the bremen which arrived here on august 4 but if not they may have come by a boat from an english port within a few days of that date of course they may have come to boston or halifax or one of the southern ports our first step is to inquire at all the hotels here will you please to go with him and give him any assistance you can if you are unsuccessful in your search captain hampton i shall be glad if you will come in again and talk the matter over with me i have all the dates of the arrivals of the steamers from the other side which may help you in deciding at which port you had better continue your search  captain hamptons guide proved to be a pleasant and chatty young fellow your first visit here captain hampton he asked as they issued out on the street  yes it is the first time i have crossed the atlantic i have not had much chance of coming before for i have been out with my regiment in india for the last six years  i suppose it is a big business this as you have taken the trouble to come out about it  no in point of money it is not a very large amount a thousand pounds in money and about two thousand pounds worth of diamonds i am interested in the matter chiefly because suspicion has fallen upon a lady of my acquaintance between whom and this woman there is an extraordinary likeness so great a one that i myself was once deceived by it the woman herself knows of it for she personated my friend and in her name obtained the jewels and money so you see it is a matter of extreme importance to get her back to england  i can quite understand that i suppose you have a likeness of her  yes at least a likeness of the lady which will be quite sufficient to enable anyone to identify the woman at once  he handed dorothys likeness to the detective  there ought to be no difficulty in identifying that he said after examining it closely no one who has seen her will be likely to forget it in a hurry and what is the man like  he is old enough to be her father and no doubt passes as being so he is a cleanshaved manat least he was when i last saw him he is a betting man of the lowest type but has had the education of a gentleman and when well dressed and got up would no doubt pass as one anywhere this is the list of hotels i obtained as being those they would be most likely to go to you see there are some german ones included as if they came out in the bremen they might have been directed by germans returning here to go to one of their hotels and would have done so as they would be less likely to meet english people and attract attention  yes that is a good idea however we will try the others first nineteen out of twenty cabin passengers who land here and dont go straight on put up at one or other of the principal places  hotel after hotel was visited until they arrived at the end of the list the detective did the talking he was well known to all the clerks  i generally am put on hotel thief business he said as his companion remarked on his acquaintance with all the houses they visited no doubt that is why the chief sent me with you now we will try these german houses you may take it for granted that they have not been at any of the others if none of the clerks or waiters recognise that photograph it is because she wasnt there you see they all said no right off when they saw it if it had been an ordinary face they would have thought it over but they did not want half a minute to say they had never seen her  at the first two german houses they went to they received the usual answer  now i have rather hopes of this next place the detective said it is a quiet sort of house and used by a good class of germansrich men who have been over to europe and are waiting here for a day or two before they go west again if the man was asking as he would be likely to do for a quiet hotel and said that he did not mind paying for comfort a german who knew the ropes would probably send him here this is the house  he went up to the clerks desk  good morning mr muller how goes on business  pretty brisk mr tricher what can i do for you this morning you are on business too i suppose  yes the chief asked me to come round with this gentleman captain hampton from england he wants to find out about a man and a woman who are believed to have come across on the bremen which arrived here on august 4 i think it likely enough that they may have been recommended to your house will you turn to august 4  the clerk turned over the leaves of the register  had you an english lady and gentleman father and daughter arrive on that day  i had mr and miss white the man was clean shaven about fortyfive years old  this is the portrait of his daughter  that is all right the clerk said she was just as goodlooking a girl as ever i saw  captain hampton uttered an exclamation of satisfaction here then was the first absolute proof that his theory was correct and that there really existed a double of dorothy and the evidence of this clerk would in itself go far to disprove the charge against her  how long did they stay here the detective asked  the clerk turned to the ledger two days they left on the evening of the sixth they were charged the full day  how did they go  by carriage here is the chargea dollar and a half  which station did they go to  ah that i cannot tell you we have two carriages and they are both out now but i can find out this evening anything else  yes i want to know if they made any inquiries about trains  i dont know that they inquired but the man spent a whole morning going through the train books and looking through the tables hanging up there i wondered what in thunder he could be wanting to spend such a time over them when a couple of minutes would have shown him the train time to any place he wanted to go to i expect he had not made up his mind where to go i reckon that was it i saw him come in with half a dozen books under his arm the morning after they got here  well we can do nothing till we hear what station they were taken to i will look in again this evening  do you mean to say they were bad ones mr tricher  the detective nodded  well well one never knows what to believe i dont know about the man but that gal i should never have thought could have been bad  please look at the photograph again captain hampton said examine it closely is it what you would call a very good likeness  it is a good likeness the man said i should have known it if i had seen it in a shop window anywhere but photographs are never quite likemens may be but i have never seen a womans that was the real thing they always smooth out their faces somehow and put on a sort of company expression this is as like her as two peas and yet it isnt quite like if you can understand it that has got a pretty innocent sort of expression the girls face was harder than that it was just as pretty but somehow it looked older as if she had had some sort of disappointment and had had a bad time of it this one looks like the face of a thoroughly happy girl the other didnt you know i said to myself that she had made up her mind to marry some chap her father didnt like and that he had brought her over here to get her out of his way you see she was an unusual sort of woman i dont know that i ever saw a much prettier oneand one naturally reckoned her up a bit she only went out once while they were here and did not seem to have much interest in the city  well i think we have been pretty lucky captain hampton the detective said when he went out  wonderfully lucky i am more thankful than i can express the evidence of that man alone would go a long way towards clearing my friend for it would at any rate prove that just after these robberies were committed and at the exact time at which a thief would reach here from england a woman precisely like her arrived here with a man answering to the description of the one believed to be her accomplice  that would be a great thing certainly at any rate if i were you captain hampton i would get an affidavit made by muller and one or two of the waiters to the effect that a man of whom they would give a description and the original of a portrait that would of course be marked for identification arrived at the hotel on august 4 having come by the steamer bremen from hamburg there is nothing like getting an affidavit when you can and the waiters are to hand now there is no saying where they might be three months hence i dont say that muller is likely to leave but he is bright and might get a better offer any day from one of the big hotels at st louis or cincinnati or any other place where there are many germans  i will certainly do so and send it across to england at once  arranging with the detective to call for him at the metropolitan at seven oclock that evening captain hampton returned to the hotel it had been a splendid mornings work even if all further search was unsuccessful enough had been done to establish at least a strong case in favour of the contention that the person who called upon the jeweller and mr singleton was not dorothy hawtrey the interview he himself had witnessed which had he been compelled to give evidence would have been in itself almost fatal to her was now strongly in her favour for it showed the connecting link between the person who had taken the jewels and this man who was now proved to be passing as her father in the states it was no longer dorothy hawtrey buying off the man who had been persecuting her but truscotts partner in the crime informing him of the success of her operations  jacob was standing at the door of the hotel when he arrived there he had long since been made acquainted with the object for which a search was being made for the betting man marvel and the woman whose likeness he had been shown he was greatly delighted at learning that a trace had been obtained of him and eager to set to work to follow it up  it will be bang up captain if we find them here while all them perlice at home is running after them everywhere  well i did not think of it in that light and i dont much care whether they are run down by us or by any one else so long as they are caught at last but it is a long way between hearing of them here and catching them you must remember that this country is twenty times as large as england and we have really nothing to go upon we dont know what the mans intentions are if he intended to go in for swindling i should think he would have done better on the continent than here there are not many very large towns where he could as a stranger expect to make much money and it would be easier to trace him here than in europe where the distances are so much shorter that one can get out of any country in a few hours if he intends as i should think most likely only to stop over here for a short time so as to be out of the way and then go back and begin the same thing over again he might take lodgings here or anywhere else  he may know some one who has come over here and has gone in for farming and may be going to stay with him for a time there is no saying in fact what he may be going to do i do not suppose that he has the slightest fear that the share he and this woman have played has been discovered and his motive in coming away was chiefly to ensure miss hawtreys disgrace and he was anxious that there should be no chance whatever of any one who knew her meeting this woman and discovering that there was some one about who was so strikingly like miss hawtrey as to be able to pass for her my best hope is that we shall get some clue this evening from the man who drove them away from the hotel  this hope was realised on reaching the hotel with the detective the clerk at once sent for the driver he remembers the parties well enough but i dont know that you will find his news altogether satisfactory you have got a crafty bird to deal with here is the man he had better tell you himself now mike this is the gentleman who wants to know about those people i was speaking to you about  i mind them well enough sora gintleman with as pretty a little girl as ive seen since i left ould ireland i drove them down to the wharf and saw the baggage carried on board the steamer  and what steamer was it mike the detective asked  the steamer for new orleans of course that was where they told me to take them she had got her steam up when we got there and a nicelooking crowd there was going on board  would the steamer touch anywhere else on its way captain hampton asked  it might put in at mobile some do and some dont the detective replied but as we know the day she sailed there will be no difficulty at finding that out at the office  that was the lady i suppose captain hampton said showing the photograph to the driver  thats her sor i would swear to her anywhere  well here is a couple of dollars for you now i shall want to see you again tomorrow  we shall be getting some affidavits out the detective said to the clerk it is important to us to be able to prove that they have been here even if we never succeed in catching them it will be a simple thing merely a statement signed before a justice of the peace to the effect that you make oath that a man of the appearance and description set down and a young woman passing as his daughter and whose photograph which will of course be marked and verified you recognise as being hers without any possibility of doubt arrived at this hotel on august 4 and left on august 6 being driven from here and seen on board a steamer starting for new orleans i shall be glad of the signatures of yourself and as many of the waiters as attended upon them at their meals and can recognise the portrait also of the chambermaid we shall have a separate affidavit drawn out for the driver  very well can you leave the photograph with me i will give it to the head waiter and tell him to show it to the others as they were here two days and took all their meals here i should say most of the crowd would recognise her look here you had better bring a justice round here to swear them for it would be difficult to let a dozen of them all go at once  i will manage that well can you spare a couple of minutes to come round into the bar and have a drink  the clerk thought he could manage it and drinks were taken in due course  now what is my best way of getting down to new orleans captain hampton asked as they left the hotel  steamer the detective said the railway is not fairly through yet and it will take pretty nearly as long as if you go by boat and be a deal more uncomfortable  how often do the boats go  once or twice a week sometimes more there are considerable people travelling down there now a good many of the folk going to california go that way they either strike across from there or go up the river by steamer and then make across the plains it saves a long land journey but i will tell you about it when i see you in the morning i will go round the first thing and find out whether that boat that sailed on the 6th put in anywhere and also what her name was also whether they took their berths under the name of white or changed them again then i will see when the next boat goes i will bring the man before whom they can take an affidavit round here with mei know two or three i can lay my hands on any timeand then we will go together to the hotel  by twelve oclock next day the business was finished and the affidavits sworn in duplicate by thirteen witnesses in addition to that of the driver  when all was done captain hampton asked the detective as to how much he was indebted to him  nothing at all sir my services were placed at your disposal by the chief and it is all in the way of business i am very glad to have been of assistance to you  you have been of immense assistance indeed mr tricher and i feel deeply obliged to you i should never have got on by myself in the same way it was entirely owing to the clerk at the hotel knowing you that he so readily gave me the information i required and interested himself in the matter well will you come round and lunch with me at the hotel at two oclock we shall go on board the steamer this evening i am going round now to thank your chief  i shall be happy to lunch with you and by the way you might as well ask the chief to give you a line to the chief at new orleans you might find it very useful there it is a pretty lively place and if this man happens to have any pals there you may find it mighty useful to have the aid of the police  thank you very much for the suggestion which i will certainly follow  on saying goodbye to the detective captain hampton with much pressure succeeded in inducing him to accept as a remembrance a handsome meerschaum that he had the evening before admired  upon the voyage down captain hampton was much struck at the difference between the passengers on board the enterprise and those with whom he was associated on his passage across the atlantic there were among them a sprinkling of southern gentlemen a few travellers and northern manufacturers but the majority were men who were bound to the far west some to texas only but california was the destination of the greater part these again were sharply divided into two sections the one composed of hardylooking men the sons of eastern farmers or british emigrants who were going out with the fixed intention of making their fortune at the goldfields  few of the other section were he thought likely to get so far they were simply rough characters who were more likely to remain at new orleans or some of the river towns than to undertake a long and perilous journey whatever might be their nominal vocation he set them down as being thieves gamblinghouse bullies or ruffians ready to turn their hand to any scoundrelism that presented itself the real working men soon came to know each other and being bound by a common object kept aloof from the others and generally sat in little groups discussing the journey before them and the best methods of proceeding  some were in favour of ascending the missouri to omaha others of going up the arkansas and striking across by the santa fé route all had evidently studied the newspapers diligently and had almost by heart the narratives of travel that had appeared there and before the end of the voyage several parties had been made up of men who agreed to journey together for mutual aid and protection  in the saloon gambling went on all day as night came on voices were raised in anger and fierce quarrels took place which were only prevented from going further by the captains prompt intervention and by his declaration that any man who drew pistol or bowie knife should be put in irons for the rest of the voyage  captain hampton was heartily glad when the vessel entered the mississippi he had associated principally with two or three of the southern gentlemen and had kept as far as possible aloof from the rowdy portion of the passengers this however he had been unable to do altogether he himself was an object of general curiosity he was a britisher he was not bound for the west he was not thinking of taking up land he was unconnected with any commercial house his explanation that he was travelling for pleasure and intended to go up the two great rivers of the continent was considered altogether unsatisfactory and one after another most of his fellow passengers endeavoured by a series of searching questions to get at the facts of the case jacob on the other hand enjoyed the voyage greatly unconsciously to himself he was a student of human nature and this was a phase entirely new to him  it seems to me captain he said to his master one evening that most of this ere gang ought to be in newgate why to hear what they say of themselves there is scarce one of them that hasnt killed one or two men in his time i have been alistening to some of that blackbearded chaps stories and if all that he says is true he has killed over twenty i counted them up careful i cant make out how it is that a chap like that is going about free why he would have been hung a dozen times if he had been at home what is the good of the perlice if they lets a chap like that go on as he likes  you may be sure that the greater part of his stories are lies jacob though some of them may be true new orleans is perhaps as rough a city as any of its size in the world and as you go farther west life becomes still more unsafe in so vast a country the law is powerless and men settle their disputes in their own way almost every one carries arms and shooting affrays are of common occurrence and as long as what is considered fair play is preserved no one thinks of interfering a man who is killed is buried and the one who killed him goes his way unconcernedly so though a good many of these stories you hear are lies there may be more truth in some of them than you would think  they have been apumping me lots of them has jacob said and trying to find out what you are doing out here i have stuffed them up nicely i have told them as you had been out in india and had killed thousands upon thousands of lions and tigers and elephants  what was the use of telling lies jacob captain hampton asked angrily  well sir i dont suppose as they believe it all because i dont believe their stories but it was i thought just as well as they should think you was a great fighter and could shoot wonderful straight i know by what they said that some of them was half inclined to get up a quarrel with you cause as they said you was stuck up and thought yourself better than other people and it seemed to me as it was best they should think as you wasnt a good man to quarrel with bless you says i over and over again there aint nothing stuck up about my master only i know as he hates getting into trouble cause he dont like having to kill a man and so he keeps hisself to hisself and then i pitches it in strong about killing indians and that sort of thing and i do think captain as it has kept them a bit quiet  captain hampton laughed  well perhaps it may have done jacob these fellows seldom interfere with a man unless they think it safe to do so still i would much rather in future you did not invent any stories about me always stick to the truth lad lying never pays in the long run     chapter xiii   ten days later the party were reunited at martigny the fortescues had been there two days having travelled faster than the hawtreys had done captain armstrong and mr fitzwarren only turned up the next day they had learnt at lucerne the inn at which the hawtreys intended to stay and went straight there the others were all absent on an excursion to the col de la forclaz and did not return until late in the afternoon captain armstrong and mr fitzwarren were standing on the steps of the hotel when the three girls clattered up on donkeys the elders having been left a quarter of a mile behind  how are you both ada fortescue who had won the race by a length said as they came down the steps no thank you captain armstrong i can slip off without any assistance we were talking of you this morning at breakfast and wondering when you were likely to turn up  they stood talking at the door of the hotel until the others arrived  which way have you come mr hawtrey asked after they had shaken hands  we went over the brunig pass to interlaken we stopped there a day or two and came from thun over the simmenthal to aigle we stayed there four days and a day at st maurice and got in here half an hour after you had started and have since been for a stroll among the pines  we were over at st maurice the day before yesterday  it is splendid up here ada fortescue put in we have been grumbling ever since we came because we did not come on here at once instead of spending those four days at lucerne it was all very lovely but it was so hot one really could not enjoy it as one ought to have done up here it is so deliciously cool at least except in the middle of the day that one feels up to anything i wish you could persuade papa to let us go up one of the mountains not a difficult one of course at present mamma wont hear of it though mr hawtrey said he would go with us and dorothy i dont think papa would mind she added confidentially  captain armstrong smiled mr fortescue was really but a cipher in the family he accompanied his wife and daughters and was very useful in looking after the luggage and paying bills but his wife was the real manager of the party she was not one of those women who assert their predominance over their husbands upon the contrary she made a point of consulting him on everything but as his opinions were always in accord with hers this was little more than a form she herself among her intimates frequently bewailed her husbands disinclination to take a leading part in anything  it is a great disadvantage to the girls for it compels me to put myself much more forward than i like it is always bad for a mother to have to do so it gets her the name of being a managing woman and there is nothing men are more shy of and yet in spite of mrs fortescues disclaimer there were people who believed that if mr fortescue had had a chance there would have been no occasion for his wife to take matters so entirely in hand as she did within an hour of meeting captain armstrong and mr fitzwarren she had discussed the matter with her husband  i dont know what to think of these men coming here just as we have arrived it must mean one thing or the other  mr fortescue remarked that no doubt it did  captain armstrong is of course an excellent match she said the question is has he come here on his own account or on that of mr fitzwarren if on his own account it must be in order to see more of one of our girls or of dorothy hawtrey on the other hand mr fitzwarren cannot be considered at all an eligible person of course he is in society and all that sort of thing and is very well connected but that wont keep up a household it would not do at all and i shall warn ada and clara that they are not to think of flirting with him and that if i see any signs of them doing so we shall at once move away  he is a very pleasant young man mr fortescue said i believe he has a good position in the foreign office and is private secretary to lord wolverhouse  yes that is all very well mrs fortescue said sharply and i dare say it is a very good position for a clerk in a foreign office but as i said it wont do to keep up an establishment so i shall keep my eyes open  this mrs fortescue did for the next four days and the results were so far satisfactory that she assured herself that mr fitzwarren had no design upon either of her daughters he always made one of the party on their excursions but divided his attentions equally between the three girls and there was nothing in his manner that could excite the smallest suspicion even in her mind that he viewed one with a greater degree of preference than the other captain armstrong appeared equally general in his attentions and even dorothy who had felt at first a certain uneasiness when they joined thought no more of the matter he happened to be there when they were and it was natural that he should attach himself to her party and she soon ceased to feel at all shy with him or to think of him in any other light than as a pleasant companion in their rambles  for the first week mrs fortescue always formed one of the party but as the walks extended and they went higher and higher up the hillside she was glad as soon as she felt that her suspicions of mr fitzwarrens attentions were unfounded to let them go under their fathers escort mr singleton was the only person who complained  i wonder how long those two men are going to stay here he said to mr hawtrey one day  i have not heard them say anything about it i shall be sorry when they go for they are both pleasant and it makes it very much more agreeable for the girls to have them to go about with of course when we take the carriage we all ride together but i am sure the young people enjoy walking much more they are capital climbers and i can tell you they pretty nearly tire me out sometimes  i dont care how soon they go hawtrey you know what my hopes are about dorothy and i feel pretty confident that armstrong has altogether different views on the matter i have nothing to say against him personally i admit that he is a downright good fellow every one knows he has a good estate so i have nothing to say against him except that i see he is doing his best to upset my special plans  i have not seen anything of it at all i did not notice on our walks that he was more with her than with the others i imagine that it is only fancy on your part  you do not suppose he would be wasting his time in rambling about here with three girls unless he had some sort of object it is one of the three and i have not the least doubt that it is dorothy  i dont fancy so forquite between ourselves singletoni can tell you that she refused him some months since  umph mr singleton grunted that must have been just before she became engaged to halliburn now he is out of the way again and a better opportunity for lovemaking than armstrong has got he could hardly desire  i dont see that i can do anything in the matter singleton even supposing that your suspicions are correct  no i dont suppose you can the other said irritably if we were to go away he would come after us if he means to ask the question he will ask it and the worst of it is that he is such a good fellow so unobjectionable in every way but it is hard that while the other is spending his time in looking out for evidence that will completely clear dorothy from these abominable charges this man should be cutting in and making all the running here  i dont think dorothy suspects anything of the sort singleton  no i dont suppose she does but a girl cant be thrown with a pleasant man day after day like this without getting to like him i am sure she does not know it herselfshe is too frank and natural with him still when the time comes and he asks her the question again it will come upon her how much she does like him and the contrast between him and halliburn will be all in his favour we might move to chamounix pretend you are tired of this place and see whether all the others will go too  we may as well do that anyhow mr hawtrey agreed we have done pretty well all the walks and drives near here it will be a change anyhow and accordingly at breakfast next morning mr hawtrey said i think we have pretty well done this neighbourhood it will be a change to move on to chamounix we could stay there for a week and then go on to geneva  i think that would be a very good plan mr singleton put in i own i am getting rather tired of this valley it is all very well for you young people who can climb about among the hills but i think i know the exterior of every house in the place and have made the acquaintance of almost every man woman and child in it  mr fortescue at once assented  it makes no difference to me captain armstrong said carelessly but i have been thinking for the last day or two that there would be more to be seen at chamounix i have rather an idea of climbing mont blanc fitzwarren finds that time is running short and has made up his mind to turn his face homewards  after some farther talk it was arranged that the carriages should be ordered for the following morning there was much regret expressed at mr fitzwarrens departure or as the girls called it his desertion but his determination was not to be shaken he had talked it over with armstrong on the previous evening when the latter had urged him to stay a week longer  i cannot afford it my dear fellow he said it is pleasant very pleasant but it is too dangerous a pleasure to be indulged in however strict a mans principles may be hes but human another week of this might be fatal to me i cannot afford to marry clara fortescue even if she would have me and her mother were willing which by the way i am perfectly sure she would not be the way she played duenna the first few days would have been amusing if it had not been annoying it was almost heroic whenever i happened to be a few yards ahead or a few yards behind with either of her girls she would be certain to range alongside in the course of two or three minutes and though naturally she did not express her feelings in words there was no possible mistaking her manner she was the watchdog i was the wolf and she was prepared to do battle to save her lambs from the devourer at that time i had no idea of devouring and indeed i have no idea now nevertheless i am beginning to feel that the repast would not be an unpleasant one against the ordinary temptations that occur in ballrooms and conservatories at fêtes and even country houses i am proof but this daily companionship wandering and picnicking is beyond me my armour is giving way and i feel that flight is the prudent course before i am too severely wounded  the next morning therefore he took his place on the diligence and halfanhour later two carriages started up the valley with the rest of the party they had sent on a letter the previous day to secure rooms and were comfortably established there late in the afternoon  the dinnerbell will ring in five minutes dorothy mr hawtrey said tapping at his daughters door  dorothy was ready and went down with him to the drawingroom as they entered she caught sight of ada fortescues face which wore a puzzled and disturbed look and she gave what seemed to dorothy a warning shake of the head she moved across the room towards her chair to inquire what she meant a gentleman stepped aside to make way for her she looked up and as their eyes met each gave a slight start for it was lord halliburn who stood before her  it was an awkward moment but as usual the woman was the first to recover her presence of mind  how do you do lord halliburn she said cordially holding out her hand who would have thought of our running against each other here  certainly i did not miss hawtrey i heard that you left town a fortnight before i did but though i had no particular reason for doing so i supposed you had gone down to lincolnshire when did you arrive here  only half an hour ago when did you come in  yesterday i came up from geneva  we came the other way mr hawtrey said he had only just noticed whom dorothy was speaking to and had at once come up to her assistance the three stood chatting together for a time  terribly awkwardmost unfortunate is it not mrs fortescue remarked to mr singleton it quite gave me a shock when i saw him come into the room just now  i dont think it matters much mrs fortescue there is no reason in the world why they should not meet and they might just as well do so here as in london  do you think there is any chance of its coming on again the lady asked  not the slightest in the world he replied curtly then he rose from his seat and went across to the little group who were directly afterwards joined by ada fortescue and her father  as the party stood laughing and chatting together no one unacquainted with the circumstances would have guessed that the meeting had been so embarrassing to two of the number  are you wandering about by yourself halliburn or are you with a party mr hawtrey asked  ulleswater and dick trafford are with me he replied i suppose you have been all travelling together  yes we first met at lucerne then we came on and the fortescues joined us at martigny captain armstrong and fitzwarren were there too so it made a pleasant party fitzwarren left us this morning he was off home again  at dinner the two parties were at opposite ends of the long table  deuced awkward for you halliburn lord ulleswater said  oh i dont know i dont mind if she doesnt  i should say we had better move on anyhow halliburn if it gets known that you are here together it is sure to be reported the affair is on again  i certainly shant run away if i had known she was coming i should not have come here but now we have met and spoken i dont see there will be anything gained by my leaving besides it would look as if i had done something to be ashamed of if i were to go directly they came  i think perhaps you are right she behaved very pluckily i think clara fortescue had just whispered to me she was here i was coming across to warn you when she came in and i watched the meeting i must say she pulled herself together wonderfully it was an awkward moment for her meeting you here so suddenly with a dozen people who knew all about it looking on i see armstrong is sitting there with them as if he belonged to the party he and the elder of those fortescue girls seem to be on rather confidential terms  that is armstrongs way lord halliburn said he means nothing and by this time i should say that most of the girls know that he means nothing i cant make out why he doesnt marry  ada fortescue at any rate understood that captain armstrongs manner at the present moment meant nothing she had from the first detected that dorothy hawtrey was the attraction that kept him with the party but she had said no word when her mother had frequently expressed her surprise at his prolonged stay at martigny and had cautiously endeavoured to learn her opinion on the subject adas silence was due partly to a feeling of loyalty towards dorothy partly because she shrewdly conjectured that their own stay there was not unconnected with an idea in her mothers mind that something might come of it and that did mrs fortescue believe dorothy to be the attraction she would lose no time in leaving for england captain armstrong said no word regarding the meeting with lord halliburn until she began the subject  did you see the meeting captain armstrong i was on thorns the hawtreys are not on the same side of the hotel as we are but if i had known which her room was i should have made some excuse to slip away and warn her however it did not matter she behaved beautifully didnt she  captain armstrong nodded it is a nuisance his turning up here he said but i dont think she cares do you miss fortescue  no i dont think she does if she had done so i dont think she could have been so cool and collected all at once i am sure i couldnt if i had been in her place she met him just as she might have met any intimate acquaintance  if he has got any common sense captain armstrong growled he will be off the first thing tomorrow morning  ada was silent  dont you think so he urged  well it all depends i know nothing about why the match was broken off beyond that paragraph in the paper that said it was her doing and dorothy has never alluded to it when we have been together it depends i should think whether he cared very much for her i suppose he did it seems to me that everyone must love dorothy hawtrey if so he may think it worth trying whether he cannot bring it on again  captain armstrong muttered something between his lips that she did not catch  i am almost sure you are swearing captain armstrong and that is very bad manners still i dont say that i shouldnt swear if i were a man and all this happened so i forgive you  we have had such a pleasant time he said ruefully and if this fellow is going to stay here i can see it is all going to be spoilt  i dont see why it should be spoilt at any rate i am sure that if dorothy broke off the match she is not the sort of girl to make it up again it must be an awful thing to break off an engagement when everyone is aware of it and you know it will set everyone talking i dont think i could ever bring myself to do it i think dorothy has put it quite aside i have seen so much of her in the last fortnight and if there had been anything on her mind i should have noticed it  she coloured up when they met  of course she coloured up you dont suppose captain armstrong a girl can suddenly meet a man she has been engaged to and has been fond offor of course she was fond of himand who has been acting as lover to her for weeks and all that sort of thing without the colour coming into her cheeks it did not last a moment either it just came and went i am sure if it had been me even if i had ceased to care for him my cheeks would have flared up and i should have been hot and uncomfortable for hours afterwards  i should not think he was ever very loverlike captain armstrong said savagely i dont think he has got it in him  i dont know ada said demurely i have never been engaged captain armstrong so i cant say what men do under such circumstances i believei suppose that they do take what novelists call a chaste salute sometimes now if you swear like that captain armstrong i shall sit between papa and mamma at the next meal it is downright scandalous  i really beg your pardon miss fortescue captain armstrong said penitently but there are certain provocations under which even the mildest of men may be excused for breaking down  i do not see where the provocation comes in she said we were merely discussing the conduct of engaged couples in general and of lord halliburn in particular  i would rather not discuss the matter at all i have nothing whatever to say against him he may be an excellent fellow for anything i know but at the present moment it is distinctly unfortunate that he has turned up here and i hope he will have the common sense to see it himself and to start the first thing in the morning  but this lord halliburn did not do he and his two friends started early for the mer de glace while the hawtreys party went off on mules in another direction after dinner the men met in the balcony and smoked their cigars together the only absentee being captain armstrong who went for a walk by himself on the following day the hawtreys determined to visit the mer de glace mr singleton and mrs fortescue declined to form part of the expedition the others took two guides with them as the ice was said to be in bad condition they started at six in the morning and made a considerable portion of the ascent on mules when they reached the edge of the glacier the guides who had been consulting together as they led the way said that they should not advise them going far for the weather looked bad mont blanc was wreathed in clouds and the other peaks were also hidden  what do you expect giuseppe mr hawtrey asked there is no wind and the clouds do not look any lower than they did an hour ago  the storms here are very sudden the guide replied and when they do sweep down they come with terrible violence and conrad and i both think there may be snow with these ladies it would not be safe to venture far on the ice  well we will only go as far as you think it safe it would be a pity to have had this climb for nothing  all must keep together the guide said let there be no straying the snow over some of the crevasses is very thin and treacherous  on they went for some distance admiring the ice pinnacles leaning over crevasses and peering down into the depths where the deep blue of the ice walls shaded off into blackness the guides went ahead sounding carefully the snow before them for a few inches the first precursor of coming change had fallen two days before suddenly one of the guides uttered an exclamation  see he said the clouds are coming down the mountains we have not a moment to lose it will be on us now before we are off the glacier  the sun was still shining brightly and the parties as they turned glanced somewhat incredulously up the mountain  by jove it is coming down captain armstrong exclaimed it is more like an avalanche of snow than clouds  a minute later there was a faint moaning sound which grew louder and louder  stand close together and take a firm footing the guide exclaimed the storm will be on us in a minute look after the ladies messieurs  the warning was scarcely out of his lips when there was an icy blast it lasted but a second or two and it was succeeded by a dead calm then a mighty wind struck them with such violence that they were nearly swept from their feet while particles of ice pricking like needles forced them to close their eyes and hold down their heads before the blast the sun disappeared and at the same moment they were enveloped in a dense mist clara fortescue had clung to her fathers arm and ada who was with captain armstrong a few paces in the rear hurried forward towards them but the storm struck them before they reached them unprepared for the sudden shock ada would have been swept before it had not her companion clasped his arm around her you must just fancy that we are waltzing he shouted in her ear cling tight to me this cant last long and with great difficulty he dragged her along until they reached the others  that is better mr fortescue said as they arranged the shawls to cover the girls heads we will take care of them armstrong if you will ask the guides how long this is likely to last  the guides were but two or three paces away with alpenstocks firmly planted in the ice and their heads bent down to meet the force of the gale they were talking together when captain armstrong joined them  is this likely to last he asked in french  it may last for twentyfour hours the guide said  then we must be moving the ladies could not stand this cold an hour  it is no easy matter the guide said when one cannot see three paces in front of one still we must try as you say it would be death to the ladies to stop here and indeed for all of us we have only one rope with us we did not expect this when we started it is not long enough for all i will be tied at one end giuseppe will go ahead and lead the way the three ladies and one of the gentlemen will be tied to the rope behind me the other two had better walk between the ladies and hold the rope  i will give them instructions i have been up some of the mountains  the guide fastened the rope round the girls and mr fortescue now you must all understand captain armstrong said if one goes through those in front must stick their alpenstocks in the ice and throw their whole weight on the rope forward those behind must do the same with their alpenstocks but must stick their heels in the snow and pull backwards on the rope  ada fortescue was placed next to the guide and was followed by dorothy whose father took hold of the rope a yard or two in front of her while captain armstrong stationed himself between her and clara behind whom came her father then they began to move forward in the teeth of the gale giuseppe went ahead feeling his way cautiously the mist was so thick that he could not see the ground he trod on talking was impossible for it was difficult to breathe in face of the wind and fine snow it was slow work and in five minutes captain armstrong passed forward and joined the guide in front  the wind is more on our right hand he shouted do you think we are keeping our course  the wind is no guide the man replied it comes down sometimes one gorge sometimes another we may have it all round the compass  in 1850 mountaineering was almost in its infancy the ascent of mont blanc was considered a great feat and as yet no woman had undertaken it the icefields and peaks were still almost unknown and the guides had not as now an intimate acquaintance with every foot of the mountains the danger of being lost in a fog or storm was therefore infinitely greater than at present  several times giuseppe was doubtful as to the true course and the party halted while he made short casts in various directions the girls strength became rapidly exhausted the icy wind seemed to deaden all their energies mr fortescue had moved up alongside his youngest daughter to help her along mr hawtrey had his arm round dorothy and captain armstrong was assisting ada  several times the whole party stopped and stood with their backs to the wind to recover their breath at last giuseppe gave a shout and the others were soon beside him he was standing under the shelter of some rocks which projected through the glacier  i know where i am now he said we have not gone far from our course another ten minutes and we shall be at the edge of the glacier  this was welcome news to the men but to the girls it seemed that it would be impossible to struggle even for ten minutes further all had sunk down close together in the shelter  you must not stop here mr hawtrey said you can have two or three minutes to recover your breath but you must keep moving or you will be frozen to death  is it necessary to be roped any further giuseppe captain armstrong asked  not necessary monsieur but it is better to continue so it keeps all together and were any to lag behind it would be certain death for our shouts could not be heard any distance away in this gale  clara was unable to rise when the guide said they must no longer delay  i must carry her her father said  i will carry her monsieur i am accustomed to carry burdens if you will lift her on to my back i can fasten the shawl round me so that she cannot fall if another gives way conrad will take her if the third then two of you together must help her that will do let us go forward  five minutes later ada fortescue sank down in spite of the assistance captain armstrong was giving her conrad at once unroped her and took her on his back  now mr hawtrey captain armstrong said if you put your arm round your daughter on one side and i on the other we can pretty well carry her along  it was soon necessary to carry her altogether  i will take her feet mr fortescue who was beside them said we shall get along capitally like that nevertheless the ten minutes seemed to the three men to be a long halfhour and it was with a feeling of the deepest satisfaction that they saw a rocky barrier in front of them and left the frozen plain they had been traversing  we are not out of the wood yet mr hawtrey said nor shall we be till we get down among the trees and i confess that i am feeling rather done myself  it is awkward walking like this mr hawtrey when one can scarcely see where one is putting ones foot down if you will let me i will carry miss hawtrey in the same way the guides are doing her weight will be nothing if i get her well up on my back we shall get on ever so much faster that way  there was a feeble protest from dorothy who although utterly exhausted was not insensible it passed unheeded  are you sure you can do it armstrong  quite certain if you and fortescue will lift her up that is it the weight is nothing now to what it was on the arms  the guides had been standing impatiently by while this colloquy was going on they started as soon as they saw captain armstrong had his burden fairly arranged  keep close behind me monsieur conrad said if you follow quite close you will see whether i make a step down or up  they descended rapidly from time to time the guides paused and asked if all were together and as soon as the reply was given pushed on again powerful man as he was it taxed captain armstrongs strength to the utmost to keep up with the guides who strode on rapidly ahead as if their weights were nothing to them the perspiration streamed from his faceless from the weight than from anxiety lest he should fall and several times he only saved himself by means of his alpenstock behind him he could hear the panting breath of the two elder men as they hurried along stumbling and slipping at last the gloom became denser the roar of wind increased and the guides came to a standstill  we must halt here giuseppe said we are in the wood we will rest for a little while and see if we can find a shelter and light a fire if not we must go on again there is a break in the ground somewhere about here i must look for it  mr fortescue and his friend lifted clara from his back and he hurried away in a few minutes he returned  it is close by he said we shall do there  he led the way and in a minute they stood at the edge of a little ravine some fifteen feet deep running through the wood the girls were carefully carried down to the bottom the change in the temperature now they were sheltered from the wind was very great all three girls were conscious the motion and the heat of the guides bodies having revived both the fortescues none of them were however able to stand  huddle as close together as you can girls the guides are going to try and light a fire and we shall soon have you comfortable  oh by the way i have a flask in my pocket with some brandy in it mr fortescue said i had forgotten all about it until now  thank god for that mr hawtrey said it is worth fifty times its weight in gold now take a good sip of it girls it will do you a world of good  as soon as they were free of their burdens the guides accompanied by captain armstrong had hurried away and the former were soon engaged in chopping off strips of bark from the pines while the latter collected sticks a pile was soon heaped up close to where the girls were sitting a match struck and in two or three minutes a bright fire was blazing     chapter xiv   two men were sitting together in an inner room in a saloon in new orleans  i was never more surprised than when you came in yesterday bob regular floored i was it was only a few days ago i was thinking over that rig we were in together we made a good bit out of that  yes we didnt do badly i have wished sometimes since that i had been as deep in it as you were and had bolted and cleared out altogether  yes i made most out of it but then you see i ran most risk by a long way you might have got a year or two for being mixed up in it but what with nobbling the horse and what with having to pretty near choke the stableboy i should have got fourteen years safe you could have been with me in that if you had been game instead of only taking the part of getting round the girl and persuading her to get the stable boy to slip out to see her for five minutes if the fools had played their part better we should have got off without my having to meddle with him but she made such a poor story of it that he suspected something was up and came back again and just met me as i was dropping from the window of the loft he knew me by sight and there was nothing to do but to bolt while as you had been swelling it with those false moustaches no one twigged you from the girls description and you were able to spend your money at home  well it did not do me much good it went after the rest quick enough  you knew where to find me from laxey i suppose i know he is a pal of yours  yes we work together sometimes we knew each other years and years ago when we both had money to spend and spent it and more besides he had more than i had he came into a biggish fortune when he came of age but ran through it in a couple of years then he had a bit of luck on the turf and more luck still they used to say at cards at the clubs he belonged to till he was one day kicked out of one of them and that did for him altogether and he came down to the threecard dodge and games of that sort yes he was wonderfully clever at cards could do almost anything with them i have seen him bet a company all round that he cut a king three times following let them shuffle them as much as they liked and he never touched the cards till he cut and i never saw him miss it though there were a score of men round looking at his fingers  aye i have seen him do that trick and nobody was ever able to make out how he did it he could make the cards do most anything i have written to him half a dozen times within the last few years telling him what an opening there was out here for a chap with such talents as he has got but i told him straight it was of no use his coming unless he was ready to play with pistols as well as with cards and i expect that is what has kept him away i fancy it was from what he wrote laxeys weak point was that he never had nerveif it had not been for that he could have made money anywhere  well he gave me your address it suited my book to be out of england for a few months and when i had got across the water i said to myself i will go down and see joe murdoch at new orleans i am not as handy with the cards as laxey and i dont know who is but i have worked the threecard trick and many an evening when laxey and i have been together in my room or his we spent an hour or two over the cards and he has put me up to some of his tricks and i have worked at them when i have had nothing else to do and could not sleep till i have come to do some of them pretty near as well as he does i dont mean to say that i thought of going into that line when i came down here but i said to myself there is joe murdoch we have played more than one game together and i can trust him and i think he can trust me he has been out here six years and i expect he must know the ropes and can give me some good advice whether we go in for anything together or not  that is so warbles we can run straight together or if we dont run together perhaps i can put you on to a line of country where you may make good running for yourself you left england suddenly i suppose  the other nodded  turf business  no i suppose they would call it money under false pretences i only ran dark it was a girl i have got here with me that did the trick  brought a girl over with you warbles well i should not have thought you would have bothered yourself with a girl out here  well no i dont suppose i should if it hadnt been that i expected to make her useful she goes as my daughter and she looks on me as an old friend of her fathers  is that so the other asked doubtfully  that is so joe the girl is straightas straight as a line i met hernever mind how i met herbut i saw she was a sharp girl and would be a goodlooking one and it struck me that such a girl could be made very useful i had her taught a bit and trained and i fancy she could pass anywhere as a lady well you know when a respectable gentleman of my age with an uncommon pretty daughter arrives at a big hotel say at scarborough or brighton and the girl is clever you can see for yourself that there is money to be made in lots of ways young men make the acquaintance of the gentleman for the sake of the girl they will come up to his rooms and after a little supper they may take a hand at écarté then you see a young girl can get round a young flat with some pitiful story or other and get a loan from him to meet temporary difficulties then when the time gets near for leaving she may take a fancy to a few things from jewellers and have them sent to choose from altogether there is no end of money to be made if the game is played well  yes i see that but your coming over here shows that the game can be cut short  no that is the game i am going to play when i go back we worked in a different direction last time and brought it off i think we might have stopped safely enough but i had particular reasons for wanting to get here out of the way so i tell you i ran off the track and came over here do you think that game could be played here  not much the other replied at some of the summer resorts it might be done but it could not last long there aint enough big towns and places to work in besides at our hotels there aint the same chance of getting to know people that there is at home or in paris or in those places people sit down to a little table to themselves to their meals and there is no sort of general meetingplace you would find it very hard to work it got some money i suppose  about five hundred pounds joe  the other smoked in silence for two or three minutes  twentyfive hundred dollars he said at last is a tidy sum but it would not go far here besides if you are thinking of doing anything with the cards you would have to move about it wouldnt do to bide too long anywhere they are up to most tricks i can tell you and they would think here no more of shooting a man they had a suspicion of playing false than you would of eating your dinner stores are paying well here because there is a crowd of people going through to the west and most of them lay in their stock for the journey here but twentyfive hundred dollars would go no way towards a store if i were to sell out i could with what i could get for this place and what i have got by me put as much more in still five thousand dollars would be no use for a store that would make anything of a show i have thought a good deal about going west myself  west the other repeated doubtfully  yes to california there is big money to be made out there i dont mean in digging for gold in a place like that it dont want a deal of capital a big tent and a few casks of spirits and a stock of cheap wines and some tables and benches is about all but that would be too much for me by the time i had made the journey across with your money and mine i dont know that we mightnt manage it and if we could it ought to pay big money i could run the saloon you could work the card rig in a room behind and if the girl is as goodlooking as you say she is she would fetch them in crowds if she looked after the bar there are no end of mining camps i hear and the miners just chuck their gold about and one could move off from one to another when we found the game playing out  it sounds a good thing warbles said but it is a long journey isnt it  well yes its a long journey theres no denying that but there are hundreds of people starting every week most of them go by the southern route but i am told it is a much better way to go up the river by steamer to a place called omaha which is growing into a big town and strike across from there  it is not the difficulty but the time i am thinking of i only intended to stop for a few months  what difference will that make you want to get money i suppose well you would get as much in a week there as you would in a month by your scheme which might be cut short any day and you might find yourself with your hair cropped and in for five years why from what i have heard there are men coining money out there at drinkingsaloons and after two or three years of it we might cut it and go home and keep racehorses of our own if we liked  well i will think it over joe it is a biggish thing to decide on but there ought certainly to be money in it as you say there is no chance of getting five years but it seems to me from what i have heard of it there is a goodish chance of a pistolbullet or a stab from a bowieknife  i expect all that there is exaggerated besides the rows are between the men that drink and not between them and those that sell drink as to the cards there is no occasion to do any hanky panky with them unless you see you have got a greenhorn to deal with and the chances are good the cards pay anyhow they bring men into the place and they help to sell the drink  well i will think it over warbles repeated i am getting tired of doing nothing all day how i shall get through three or four months of it is more than i can think perhaps i might as well do this as anything else the girl would certainly be useful to tell you the truth she is pretty difficult to manage and i am not sure she might not after a time kick over the traces altogether but i dont think she would mind what we are talking about i am sure it will be more to her taste than the other well i will come in again in the morning it is too big a thing to be decided on straight off  warbles went back to his hotel a girl was standing at the window looking out upon the river she turned round as he entered  well have you settled anything she asked i am sick of doing nothing but just thinking and thinking  care killed a cat linda the man said lightly thinking is a pure waste of time i have had a long talk with murdoch and he has put an entirely new idea into my head  an honest idea of course she said scornfully  you may scarcely believe me but you are right my dear it is a strictly honest line  the girl looked at him intently  well let us hear what it is she said you promised me the other should be the last i did not believe it and told you so i shall find it hard to believe that there is not something crooked about this somewhere  well there isnt it just honest trade and he repeated the conversation he had had with murdoch omitting however all allusions to his skill at cards her face brightened as he went on  that will do she said i should say that will do firstrate when i was a young un i often peeped in at the doors of big publichouses i used to think the women behind the bars had a fine time of it i should not think so nowat least not in a big townbut in places like those you talk of it would be different altogether i should like the journey too it would be like going with gipsies which i used to think would be the happiest life in the world i was afraid when we got out here you would be wanting to do another thing like the last and i would not have helped youat any rate not till we were getting down to our last shilling but i like the thought of this and i will do my best for you i suppose they are a rough wild lot out there but i think i can take care of myself but this time mind i shall want a share i am not going to work for years and then be thrown over when it suits you i will have my share of the profits paid over to me once a week or once a month at the outside and will put it away where i like how much are you going to put into this thing  i told him i could manage five hundred and he said he could do the same but i doubt whether that will be enough to carry it out properly  well you have got two thousand left now you said you would go halves with me i dont want that but give me five hundred and you can tell this man that i have got that money of my own and am ready to put it in with yours but that i am going to have an even share i know you are calculating that my good looks will draw and no doubt they will i am not a fool and can see what you are after and i can see too that it wont be an easy game for me to play these miners with their pistols and their knives are not like the young fellows who come into a london bar they will be in real earnest out there and it will be a dangerous game to play with them one has got to be pleasant with everyone and not to give a smile more to one than to another not to give one the right to think that he has a chance or causes him to believe that another has a better one than he has  i think that is rather too much sal mr warbles said doubtfully i have always been kind to you  there is no occasion to have any lying between us she broke in why you took me up and paid for me for years i dont know and i dont suppose i ever shall know but at any rate i know you well enough to be sure that it was not out of pure kindness if it had been would you have put me into the hands of a woman who was always drunk would you have left me to be brought up in that court to grow up a young thief who might any day have been taken off and hauled before a beak do you think i am such a fool as to swallow that then came the time when you took me away i saw you look me over i saw that you said to yourself she will do  what i was to do for you i neither knew nor cared you said you would have me taughtthat was enough for me then i had three quiet years and i made the most of them you told me something that first day about expecting me to be useful to you and when the time came i carried out your orders it was only right to do so you had bought my services it was a bargainbut dont let us call it anything else from the first you had an object in saving me from starving or from the workhouse and i suppose you thought that object was worth spending money on but certainly the object was not kindness you were always kind when you came to see me once a year all the time i was with that woman and it is for that more than anything else that i am ready to help you and to carry out your orders but i dont want to be altogether at your mercy still less at the mercy of the man you are going to take as partner  i will work with you but not under you i dont want to interfere in your plans and as you would be two to one of course you could outvote me if i did still it will give me a better position if it is known that i am your partner and not your drudge and i shall know that i cannot be cast off or thrown aside and left alone and friendless and that i can if i like wash my hands of the business  i would not mind agreeing mr warbles said after sitting rubbing his chin thoughtfully for some time i should not mind your having a third of the profits and i think that would be fair enough seeing that you would put in a third of the capital and as you rightly suppose we consider that you would prove a great help to us but suppose you took it into your head to marry where should we be then  the girl waved her hand impatiently i am not likely to marry she said  so you think at present linda and so a good many other girls have thought still there it is i have got to put the matter before murdoch and it has got to be put in a business shape would you be willing if we agree with you that as long as you remain with us you take a third share of the profits in case of your leaving us either to marry or for any other cause to forfeit your third of the concern you see if you werent to do that your husband if you had one might set himself down as a third owner or supposing you did not marry you might get a good offer for your share and sell out and that would not be fair on us  no that would not be fair yes i would agree to that i am to be joint proprietor with you both and to take my third of the profits to do what i like with but if i leave you i forfeit all i have in the concern we will have the agreement made before a lawyer as far as i am concerned there shall be two copies made one i will take with me the other i shall leave with him so that if by any chance i lose mine i shall be able to prove my rights of course i have no fear with you papa no man would wrong his daughter but when there is a third person in the matter it is as well that one should look after oneself  mr warbles with difficulty repressed an angry ejaculation however he was so impressed with the value of his ally that he mastered himself and said with an attempt at a smile i had no idea you were such a businesslike young woman sally  i have always had to take care of myself a good deal she said quietly and i mean to do so as long as i can now it is time to go down to lunch i think then we might go for a drive and have a look at the place are you going to see your friend again today  no i told him i must think the matter over and see whether you liked the idea before i decided one way or the other  joe murdoch offered no objection whatever when mr warbles informed him of the conditions on which alone miss myrtlefor they had adopted another name when booking for new orleansconsented to join in the venture  it is her money i suppose that she puts in he asked  it is her share of the last thing we pulled off  ah well it is hers then well it is only fair that she should have a third you were quite right in insisting that if she left us she should forfeit all further share in it i dont like her any the worse for being able to look after her own interests one wants a longheaded girl for this business a weak fool who would be ready to throw herself away on the first goodlooking miner with his pockets well filled would be of no use to us at all one who would be inclined to flirt right and left might be worse still for there would be a shooting affair in the place in no time one wants just what i think she is by your account of what she said a coolheaded clever woman who has the wit to see that the best game is to steer clear of them all show no preference to anyone and to give no one an excuse for being jealous she is exactly the one we want i think even better of the thing than i did before warbles the extra five hundred will make all the difference in our outfit i should say it would take us five hundred to get across but then we should have the waggon and horses and they would do to take the tent or the frame and boardings of the house up to work backwards and forwards to the nearest town for spirits and food and would pay its expenses by hauling things for storekeepers i reckon it is a firstrate lookout  where would you buy the outfit  well we can get a waggon in pieces all numbered and ready to put together when we get to omaha we shant want a very heavy one as there are only three of us we had better buy horses here there is no saying how much we might have to pay at omaha or what would be better i can send a letter by a boat that starts this evening to a man i know who has a farm near the last steamboat stoppingplace about a hundred miles this side of omaha and give him a commission to buy me four of the strongest horses he can get there and to drive them to omaha so as to meet us by next thursdays boat there will be nothing to keep us beyond then  no the sooner we are off the better i suppose you know pretty well what are the things people take with them  yes it is generally about the same thing flour bacon tea and sugar molasses and bakingpowder of course we shall want a few pounds of salt and some pepper and mustard and a keg of salt butter that about fills the list have you got any firearms  no  you will want a brace of coltsthats revolvers you knowand a bowie knife which is handy for all sorts of things i have got everything the first thing to do is to have this agreement made i can find a man to draw it up  that wont do the girl said this morning that she should ask the landlord of the hotel for the name of one of the most respectable lawyers in our place and should go with us when we give our instructions to him  good murdoch said she must be chock full of good sense it is clear that there will be no getting over her easily she is right you know quite right for the man i was thinking of going to might not have taken sufficient care of her copy and he winked at his associate  that is what she suspected no doubt mr warbles said in an injured tone after all i have done for her it is hard to be distrusted  it must be i should say warbles mightily hard after as you say all you have done for her  she said when i came out shed get the name and address before i came back and that i had better bring you with me so that we could go together at once you had better tog yourself up a bit  i should think so you are such a respectable looking swell warbles that i aint fit to walk down the street with you let alone to be introduced to a young lady well just look at that paper for a few minutes  mr warbles sat down and amused himself until murdochs return in watching the young man in charge of the bar who having been up till four oclock in the morning was now languidly wiping down the counter decanting liquids from one bottle to another washing glasses and generally setting things straight when murdoch appeared he was dressed and mr warbles looked at him approvingly  this is my english suit murdoch explained i have not put it on ten times since i came over you see people here mostly wear either black or white with waistcoats cut low so as to show a lot of white shirt i dress their way of course as a rule it dont do to look peculiar besides there is rather a prejudice against britishers down here and it is no use rubbing them down the wrong way if you dress as other people do and keep a quiet tongue in your head you have a good chance of steering clear of rows of course you cannot always do that when you are running a saloon but even here you can do fairly well if you keep your eyes open and act according to character if it is a great big swaggering sort of bully who gets drunk and kicks up a row i have pistols always handy behind the bar and when i jump over with one in each hand i can generally get him out as quiet as a lamb if i see that it is a regular hard case a fellow who means downright mischief i lie low and take no heed only sending out my man quietly to fetch a constable as a rule he never finds one still it makes all the difference if there is a man shot and an inquest the next morning i am able to prove that i did my best to put a stop to the matter and so i get off without being blamed for a new orleans jury are not fools enough to suppose anyone is going to shove himself between two angry men when their hands go to their pistol pockets  when they arrived at the hotel mr warbles asked his companion to stop outside while he fetched the girl down  joe murdoch had been prepared to see a goodlooking young woman but he was completely taken aback by the appearance of the girl who came out with mr warbles he had been on english racecourses long enough to be able to distinguish a lady when he saw her and he at once decided that this girl would pass for one in any society she was well but quietly dressed had a graceful walk and a good carriage while her face was exceptionally pretty my eye he muttered to himself wherever did warbles pick her up  this is my old friend joe murdoch lindafor the name of sally had been dropped as being vulgar and objectionable from the day her training had begun this is my adopted daughter joe  glad to meet her i am sure mr murdoch said with a humility altogether uncommon to him i am very glad to think that we are going to travel together miss myrtle  i shall be glad to travel anywhere mr murdoch this seems to me a dreary place  not dreary when you know it far from that it is a stirring place except in the old french quarters but one wants to know it  we took a drive yesterday linda said and it seems to me that it is the worst smelling and most unhealthy sort of place i was ever in  well yes i cant say much for it in that way and occasionally we get yellow fever here bad but i have never had an attack myself whose office are we going to warbles  i wish you would call me myrtle the latter said irritably there is no good in calling up that old name here  we are going to mr searles linda said quietly this is the street i think i got the directions how to find it at the hotel he is a respectable lawyer i am told  very much so miss myrtle quite highly so i believe that he is a very sharp fellow too and it is not always the two things go together he was with his father the old man died two years ago and now the young one has got it all in his own hands he does all the best shipping business here  on entering they found that mr searle was disengaged and were at once shown into his office     chapter xv   we wish a deed of partnership drawn out between john myrtle that is myself linda myrtle and joseph murdoch each of the three parties agrees to put in the sum of five hundred pounds which is to be jointly expended on the journey to california and on starting and carrying on a saloon or other establishment there the profits to be divided monthly each of the three parties becoming absolute possessor of his or her share in the event of linda myrtle marrying or leaving the partnership for any reason whatever she is to forfeit all share in the property or effects of the partnership  the lawyer listened attentively do either of the other parties similarly forfeit their share on leaving the partnership  no but it might be as well to put in a clause that in the event of his doing so the partner remaining has the first option of purchasing his share at a price to be fixed upon by an umpire agreed upon by both  i have a question to ask the girl said suddenly would such a deed as this be rendered useless or invalid if the names of one or more of the parties were not those properly belonging to them  the lawyer looked at her in surprise it would certainly be very desirable that the real names should be inserted this however would not be indispensable if the identity of the parties with those named here could be proved for instance if you were to come here to prove the deed i could testify that you were the lady who signed as linda myrtle and that under that name for example you registered at the hotel and were generally known did you wish to prove it elsewhere you would take an affidavit that you were the person designated and known as linda myrtle did you sign under your real name whatever it might be it would be just as difficult for you in california to prove that you were entitled to it as to that under which you sign you intend i suppose to continue to pass under the name given and will be generally known by it moreover in case of necessity you might write to me and forward your likeness and i could then make an affidavit to the effect that the original of that portrait was the lady who in my presence signed the deed of partnership under the name of linda myrtle  we should each wish to have copies of the deed of partnership and i desire that a fourth copy may be made and this i shall request you to hold in charge for me so that in case i should at any time lose or be deprived of my copy i should by applying to you be able to obtain another copy  i will certainly do that miss myrtle and i think it a very wise precaution on your part i will have the draft ready this afternoon the lawyer said i shall be glad if you will call in at three oclock to see if it meets your joint views and if so i will have the deedwhich will be a very short onecopied four times in readiness for the signatures in the morning  what did you want to go on like this for linda mr warbles grumbled as he went out into the street why the man will suppose that you suspect us of some plot to rob you  no i dont suspect anything particular but there is nothing like having things put on a satisfactory footing i see that it is for our interest that we should act square to each other and i certainly see no reason whatever why you should wish to get rid of me still no one can say what might happen after all i am only ensuring to myself my share of the profits so long as i do my share of the business as well as i canand i should think from what you have seen of my powers of acting you can rest well assured that i shall do it very wellbut i want to be independent and i will be so i dont know anything of this place we are going to except that the men are rough and quarrelsome and i want if after two or three months trial i find the life altogether unbearable to be able to leave with money enough in my pocket to pay my fare to san francisco if not home and to be able to keep myself until i can find some situation  you are right enough miss linda joe murdoch broke in and i havent the least feeling against you for what you have said and done i like you all the better that you can stand up for yourself and though i am not much of a fighting man i will promise you i will stand by you out there whatever comes any man that says a word to you that he ought not to say i will reckon with him i aint a straight man myself and never have been since i was a kid but by gosh i would be cut in pieces rather than see anything happen to a girl that is as straight as you are  thank you joe she said quietly holding out her hand to him i did not know you before but now that i do i feel there is no occasion for me to have that fourth copy made  you have it made miss it is best you should have one i might go under and bob might get another partner or he might go under and i might get another partner and in either case it would save trouble if you have your rights clearly marked out and set down  let us go down to the wharf joe his comrade said changing the conversation it is all as good as settled now and we may as well begin to get the things how long will it take us  it wont take more than two hours any way joe said there are big stores here where we can get every mortal thing we want we could go by the boat tonight if we wanted to but we dont want to in the first place i have got to settle about selling my saloon and in the second the order for the horses is only going by tonights boat and it aint no manner of use our getting into omaha before they do it would cost us twice as much to live in a shanty where every square foot is occupied by sleepers than it would to stop comfortably in an hotel here i shall not be long in getting rid of my place two or three of the men who use it have asked me at one time or another what i would take to clear out of it it is handy for the river and i do a fairish trade with sailors of an evening still it would take a day or two to arrange it and it will never do to look as if one was in a hurry if they thought i wanted to clear out they would not offer half the sum they would if they thought that i did not care one way or the other about making a deal  they walked along the wharves looking at the steamers  there are plenty of them going up the river murdoch said but thursdays boat is the first that goes up to omaha and that is about as close as we can cut it it is monday now and the day is pretty near half gone i reckon i shall want all the time for carrying out my deal i will go now and see one of the chaps i spoke of at three oclock we have got to meet at that lawyers office and then if you like we will go and get our outfit and take our passages i have got more than enough money to pay for my share if you will take my advice miss linda you will go back to the hotel and overhaul your things and see what you want for the journey you will want some good strong plain dresses and serviceable things underneath for it is a rough business i can tell you you want a store of all sorts of little thingsbuttons and such like needles and thread and all that sort of thingand plenty of stout shoes that will bear knocking about you must bear in mind that you wont see a shop for four or five months but remember the less baggage you take the better as i have heard that many a waggonload of emigrants going across the plains have had to chuck everything overboard kit and food and all except a sack of flour so as to lighten the waggons when the horses broke down i am not sure bob that it would not be wiser to write for six horses or better still for two mules for wheelers and four horses it may cost a bit more but it will make things more easy and will give us a better chance of getting to the end of our journey with all our kit  all right joe you know more of these things than i do if you think that six are best order them i suppose the tent we shall get out there  yes the tent is a mighty heavy thing i should never think of dragging that with us  i should not have given you credit for being so soft murdoch truscott growled as after seeing the girl into the hotel they turned away together  i dare say not softness aint much in my line but that girl fetched me altogether here she is right away from england and without a friend in the world and she speaks out as firm and as brave as if she had twenty men within call ready to help her if she had been one of the crying sort she would have got no pity from me but she regular took my breath away when she spoke out like that and i says to myself she has got to be ridden on a snaffle just touch the curb and she will bolt with you and will break your neck as well as her own but i meant what i said for all that she is just the girl for what we want and if she finds we treat her well and act square by her she will act square by us she will keep them all at a distance and keep her head straight all the time only you will have to humour her i dont know where you picked her up but i should wager a dollar to a cent that she is thoroughbred  you would not have said so if you had seen her three years and a half ago when i picked her out from a slum in london  i might not have said so then that is likely enough one cant always tell whether a yearling is going to turn out a good horse and a good many who think they are clever get sucked in over it but a man who has an eye to horseflesh can tell whether a threeyearold is well bred or not and i guess i am not far out with this one yes i am struck over her it is not often that women or men either for that matter get on the soft side of me you know pretty well that i wasnt afraid of running a bit of risk in the old days and you may guess that this country doesnt make a baby of one no sir i have seen pistols and knives out pretty often since i came here and would use them myself if there was any occasion and i guess that if we ever get into a mess you will find i shall play my part as well as you do only i want it clearly understood that in this job we are going in for i am ready to go through it whatever comes but i am fixed in my mind that we are going to act straight to that girl  who wants not to act straight the other said angrily havent i brought her all the way out here because i thought she would be useful couldnt i have slipped away with all the pot we had made and left her behind me if i had wanted to and who is talking about my not acting square with her now  that is right enough mate we wont quarrel over it so that we three all act straight to each other all round i am satisfied  they did not get away from new orleans as soon as they had expected the various purchases were all made in ample time but the business of disposing of murdochs saloon was not so speedily arranged he suggested that the other two should go on by the mississippi belle and that he should follow by the next steamer but warbles was against this  a week wont make much difference one way or the other he said it is better that we should keep together you are more up to the ropes here than i am i suppose they will change our tickets for those of next weeks boat  there will be no difficulty about that i could change them in five minutes there are lots of people who could not get berths on her and have had to take them in the next boat and they would jump at the chance of going up at once  it was not until they had been at new orleans nearly three weeks that murdochs business was finally arranged and everything was ready for a start warbles was in no particular hurry he had been accustomed to do a great deal of aimless loafing about during his career and found plenty to amuse him looking at the busy scene by the riverside but at last all was ready and their goods were all on board the steamer that was to start on the following morning  there is a new york steamer signalled coming up murdoch said as they stood together smoking on one of the quays she will be in by five oclock it is the savannah she is a smart boat and i guess she has made the passage down in four or five days quicker time than you did  i am glad she is in before we start i dare say she will have papers from england a good week later than any we have got here it is as well to get the last news while we can we shant have the chance for some months again  i dont care for english papers now i look at them because sometimes an english skipper or mate comes into my place and when they find i am a countryman and know something about the turf they will put a few dollars on some horse or other for the derby if the news is expected in before they sail sometimes they will turn to the english paper and pick out a horse just for the fun of the thing for some other race of which the news ought to be in in a day or two and put two or three dollars on it if it was not for that i should never take the trouble to look at them though i always take them regular in the saloon  it was not long before a steamer appeared at a distant turn of the river and as she came up to the city the two men walked down to the wharf where she would arrive and where a crowd of idlers like themselves had already assembled as she warped alongside truscott gave a sudden exclamation and nervously grasped his companions arm  what is up the latter asked angrily confound it there is no occasion to grip a man like that i thought for a moment a big dog had got hold of me what is the matter with you  truscott had pulled his hat far down over his eyes  do you see that man upon the hurricane deck with his hands in his pockets smoking a cigar  yes i see him fast enough he is an englishman one can tell with half an eye well what about him  take a good look at him so as to know him again and then let us get out of this and i will tell you  murdoch took another look and then followed his companion out of the crowd  well you look as if you had had a facer he said when they had moved a hundred yards away i have seen chaps look like that when they have had every penny they own in the world on the favourite and it has not even been placed  i feel something like that joe i believe that fellow is on my track  you do why how can that be how can he have followed you here  that is more than i can say but it dont much matter if he has followed me  are you sure it is the man  quite sure i am a good hand at faces one wants to be when one is a bookmaker and dont always find it convenient to pay up i saw that man at the oaks he was talking for some time to a man i knewthe very man who was mixed up in the job i pulled off before leaving england  you mean it was his money you got at  yes well that fellow you saw there has been after me two or three of my pals told me there had been a man asking about me on the racecourses and one day it was the only time i went down one of them pointed him out to me he got into the train with me at epsom he thought i did not see him but i did he got into the next compartment but i slipped him at vauxhall and did not see any more of him i believe that fellow is on my track though how he has got hold of it is more than i can guess anyhow i cannot believe it is accident that brings him alongside of me again i should not be surprised if he has got a warrant against the girl and me in his pocket now  well he has brought his pigs to the wrong market if he has murdoch said fiercely we have gone into this affair now and if anyone thinks he is going to meddle with us he will find he is mistaken well there aint any time to be lost if he happens to go to the same hotel you are at the game is up you had best go straight back get a carriage and have all your things taken right down to the boat then if you are smart you will be in time to get on board the boat that starts in two hours for baton rouge get off there and be on the look out for our boat as she comes along tomorrow i shall be up in the bow if you see me wave my handkerchief you will know it is all right and you can step right on board if you dont see me wave do you and the girl move off at once get behind one of the stores and come on by the next boat i dont think it likely he will be there mighty unlikely but it is just as well to settle what to do in case he is if he should by any chance guess that the mr and miss myrtle he sees in the hotel books are the pair he is looking for he would find out that they are bound up the river and in the morning he might go down to the steamer to see if it is them he would watch till she went off and when he found out that you are not among the passengers he would think that he had made a mistake and go back to the hotel again and would hunt about in other places before he had made up his mind that you had given him the slip it is a week before another steamer goes up to omaha and we should be a week out on the plains before he got there  i should like to see anyone talking about an arrest out there however i dont think you need be afraid of him i fancy i can arrange about that  you aint going  never mind what i am going to do the other interrupted i am not going to have our plans broken up nor the pleasure of our journey spoilt by being hunted as if we were dogs i dont know who this fellow is and i dont care if he chooses to meddle with our affairs he has got to take the consequences he is not in london now there dont stand here another minute he may land in halfanhour and you have got to be out of the hotel before then i heard the girl say that the boxes were all packed mind first get the boxes on board then go to the wharf and get on board the baton rouge steamer look out for our boat if you see me wave my white handkerchief it is safe to come on board if not slip away and get behind something till we go on again then come by next boat if he gets off at any of the landings going up the river i shall get off too and come on board again as you come along  murdoch went back to the landingplace the passengers were pouring off the steamer with bags and boxes of all kinds the man he was to watch was still walking quietly up and down the hurricane deck evidently in no hurry to land until the rush was over sometimes he stopped to speak a word or two to a boy who was standing at the rail watching the others landing  i guess that fellow is with him murdoch muttered it may be some boy he has made friends with on the passage if he has brought him from england it must be because the boy knows tom and the girl but if he does he could do no harm if the other was out of the way you are taking it cool and quiet my fine fellow if you guessed that every five minutes you spent there spoilt your chance you would not take it quite so easily  it was a good halfhour before the stream of passengers and porters with baggage had ceased crossing the gangway then the man and boy left the hurricane deck and a minute or two later appeared at the gangway followed by two men with portmanteaux there was but one vehicle remaining by the wharf murdoch knew the driver  mike he said here are a couple of dollars for you if that man just landing tells you to drive him to planters hotel you take him somewhere else pretend you misunderstood him i have my reasons for not wanting him to go there  all right i will take him to reardons it is at the other end of the town  come back here and let me know where you put him down and murdoch moved off as the gentleman came up to the carriage  he watched them drive off and then took a seat on a baulk of timber till mike returned  he told me to take him to the crescent city and its there i put him down mr murdoch  all right mike i dont care where he goes so that it isnt to planters then he walked away and after threading several of the worst streets of the town stopped at a low wine shop there was no one in but the man behind the bar  they tell me that you have sold out murdoch and are going west is it true  that is right i have had enough of this i am going to try my luck west have you got black mat with you still  no you will find him at luttrells you know the place at the corner of plantation street that is to say he was there a fortnight ago if he has not got shot or hung since not thinking of taking him with you  no murdoch laughed he is strong enough and would be useful but he gets so confoundedly sulky if he takes a drop too much that was why i had to get rid of him he got into three or four rows and i had him on my hands each time for over a fortnight so i thought he had better go  yes you told me about it i found him useful here especially when i wanted the place cleared but it would not do he broke one fellows shoulder throwing him out and it was getting me a bad name  well goodbye murdoch said i am off by the boat tomorrow i will look you up if i come back this way and let you know how i have got on  five minutes later murdoch turned into luttrells a powerful negro whose face was disfigured by the scars of several cuts and gashes at once came up to him waall boss how are you  i am all right mat i came to have a word with you  there aint no one to prevent you the boss has just gone out we dont do no business here till late  what i want you for is this mat there is a friend of mine just come from new york he is going up the river with me but there is a police chap just come down after him and like enough he will be at the boat to put his hand on his shoulder i want to arrange that he shant be there you understand i dont want him killed but i just want him to have a hint that he had better not meddle with other peoples businessa hint you know strong enough to lay him up for three weeks or a month and i should not mind paying twenty dollars to the man who gives him the hint  you point him out to me and the job will be done boss only i dont sees as i can hit it to exact three weeks or a month when one is in a bit of a hurry it aint no easy matter to figure it out just exact  well we are not particular to a week what we want is not to be bothered with him  i will fix that boss you can go on board that boat with your mind easy  of course you cant go now  well i could go if it was downright necessary but it would be rough on the boss to find no one here when he came back i expect he will be in in ten minutes he said if anyone asked for him he would be back in halfanhour and it is getting on for that now  i will wait then i know luttrell very well he will let you go out for a bit with me if i ask him  the keeper of the saloon soon returned i can do without him he said when murdoch told him that he wanted the negro to do a job for him i dont expect it will be a very busy night and if it is i will call my wife down and put her behind the bar while i keep things straightened out  upon arriving at the hotel captain hampton dined quietly then he went to the clerks desk had a talk with him over the people who had been staying there and showed him dorothys photograph  nothing like that been here the clerk said positively i should have noticed her at once if she had been  i have no reason to suppose that she came here more than to any other hotel hampton said i will go round in the morning and try the others i suppose there are not a great many where a gentleman with a lady with him would be likely to put up  not more than six i should say at the outside the clerk said and gave the names which captain hampton at once wrote down in a notebook  it is just possible that they might not have come here at all but may have stopped at mobile where the steamer touched on her way down still i think it much more likely that they have come here then he went upstairs and wrote a chatty letter to danvers giving him an account of the voyage  i hear there is a steamer leaves tomorrow and i hope to be able to give you some news before i close this i am going round the hotels the first thing and hope if not to find them to get some news of them the latter is most probable i dont see truscott could have any motive in stopping here and i shall expect to find that they only stayed a day or two and then went up the river i have a strong conviction he means to go to california but even in that case he may have chosen some other routehave gone down to panama and crossed the isthmus there or may have taken steamer to galveston and started from there by the southern route though i dont think that is likely for the indians are worse on that line than on the other anyhow whichever route they have taken i shall follow i wrote from new york to the war office asking that my leave might be extended for another six months from the end of the year on very urgent business that compelled me to travel in america i have sent a private letter to colonel eversfield telling him something of the nature of the work i have in hand and asking him to back up my request i have no doubt he can manage it that ought to give me plenty of time but if the worst comes to the worst and i find myself pinched i must take ship at san francisco and get to china and from there by a p and o to india this will be the last letter you will get i fancy for a very long time though for aught i know there may be means of sending off letters from some of the stations on the plains  he addressed an envelope laid it by the unfinished letter and then went downstairs it was dark now and beckoning to jacob who was sitting in the hall to accompany him he strolled out through the door for nearly an hour they wandered about and at the end of that time came out on the quays     chapter xvi   it is pleasant here jacob after those close streets  it is an awful place for smells captain  it is smelly jacob i fancy the town was built on a swamp i think i have read something about it well there are no smells here suppose we sit down and look at the river for a bit the air is fresh and pleasant  a minute later a man with naked feet stole up behind them he was close to them before any sound warned them of his approach jacob looked round and uttered a sharp exclamation captain hampton was in the act of springing to his feet when he received a violent blow on the shoulder and fell face foremost on the ground with a cry of rage jacob sprang at his assailant and caught him by the throat the man shook him off and brought down his hand on the top of his head with such force that he fell insensible then he stooped over captain hampton and having turned him over on his back felt in his pockets but rose with an exclamation of disgust having only found two or three dollars in them as captain hampton had taken the precaution of laying aside his watch and emptying his pockets of money and papers before leaving his room ten minutes later some sailors coming along the wharf came across jacob who was just trying to get on to his feet  hello mate what is the matter  i dunno he replied stupidly  been having a drop too much  no it aint thatoh i remember now i was there with my master sitting on that log when a great nigger attacked us he stabbed my master and i suppose he stabbed me i dont remember much about it except that i got hold of his throat  where is your master  the question completely aroused jacobs faculties and he hurried round to the other side of the log  here he is he cried oh my dear master are you hurt bad and stooping over him he burst out crying  that wont do any good lad the sailor said here let us have a look at him he has been stabbed sure enough jack he is just soaking with blood  is he dead bill  the sailor tried to turn the body over but as he did so there was a faint moan  he aint gone yet thats clear who is he boy  he is captain hampton an english gentleman we only got in here this afternoon he is staying at the crescent city  well we cant let him lie here you stay here with him jack and we will go off and get some one to carry him  in a few minutes the men returned with two constables carrying a stretcher on this the body was placed four of the sailors lifted it and carried it to the hotel and then up to his room where two surgeons were quickly in attendance jacob stood by listening with breathless anxiety to their talk as they examined his master  will he die sir he asked in a broken voice as they rose from the examination  no i reckon he hasnt had his call this time but it has been a close thing what was he doing when he was struck  he was just getting up sir from the log that he was sitting on  ah that saved him another half inch and we could have done nothing for him you see he was struck from above the wound is just behind the shoulderbone and it has gone right down inside the bladebone but has missed the lungs altogetherat least we think so do you see that dark mark under the skin below the bone that is where the point of the knife came to of course he has lost a lot of blood but there is no reason why if he goes on well he should not be about again soon did he drink  no sir jacob replied indignantly  well that is all in his favour in this climate a man with his blood heated has but a poor chance if he gets hurt he is english the clerk told me as i came up  yes sir he is an english captain  ah well he will have a chance of fighting some more battles yet you are his servant i hear  yes sir  well you are not going to lose your master this time you had better sit up with him tonight we will get a nurse for him in the morning i will order some lemonade to be sent up and will bring round some medicine in half an hour and sit here for a bit doctor hawthorne will wait until i come back  by this time they had finished bandaging the wound  hullo what is the matter with you he exclaimed as jacob reeled and would have fallen had he not caught him here is another patient hawthorne the boy is bleeding from the head somewhere i thought he looked half stupid  they laid him down and examined him  he has had a tremendous blow on the head the other said it has cut right through the cap and has laid the bone bare i expect that thick cap saved his life i wonder what he was struck with  they bathed the boys head with iced water for some time presently he opened his eyes  do not move lad you have had an awkward blow on the head you must lie still for a bit else we shall be having you on our hands too what did he hit you with  i dunno sir he had nothing in his hand but the knife  it wasnt done with a fist doctor hawthorne said and is certainly not the cut of a knife  i fancy it was done with the handle of the knife the other said the negro could have had no motive in killing the boy i expect he had the knife in his hand and he struck down on him with the end of the hilt that would make just the sort of wound this is you see it is a little to one side of the centre of the skull and so glanced off the bone if it had caught him fairly in the centre it would have staved in the skull to a certainty they placed a pillow from the sofa under the boys head gave him a little lemonade to drink and then one of the doctors left after having aided in placing captain hampton on the bed propped up almost into a sitting position by pillows jacob dozed off into a confused sleep occasionally he woke up and saw the doctor sitting by his masters bedside and then relapsed into sleep at last he started up at the sound of a voice the sun was gleaming through the window and the doctor was standing speaking to captain hampton  you have a nasty wound he was saying but fortunately it has not touched any vital point you have been simply insensible from loss of blood there is every chance of your doing well but you must not try to move  what is the matter with jacob captain hampton said feebly as the boy appeared at the foot of his bed with a wet towel still bound round his head  i am all right captain though i feel queer and my head is aching terribly but i dont care a bit now you have come round  captain hamptons eyes turned to the surgeon for an explanation  he has had a heavy blow on the head we have heard nothing from him beyond the fact that he had hold of the throat of the negro who attacked you the man evidently struck him down and from the appearance of the wound we gather that he struck him with the haft of the knife fortunately it fell rather on the side of his head or it might have killed him as it is it has laid the bone bare we bandaged it up with a cloth soaked in ice water and he will be all right in a day or two  where am i wounded captain hampton asked  the surgeon explained the nature of the wound  no doubt it was some negro who had gone down to sleep on the wharf and seeing you come along with this boy thought he would rob you your pockets were turned inside out  captain hampton did not speak for a minute then with a faint smile he said  he did not get much for his pains i put everything in that drawer and locked it before coming out and dropped the key into my portmanteau  that is all right the surgeon said cheerfully i was afraid you might have lost a good deal of money we gave notice to the police last night but it is not likely you will ever hear of the fellow again such things are common enough in the streets of new orleans and it is not once in a hundred times that the police ever manage to lay a finger on the scoundrels had you been in any gambling place because in that case some one may have tracked you  captain hampton shook his head no i had only taken a stroll through the town how long am i likely to be laid up  you must be in bed for a fortnight at least the wound was made by a bowie knife and is a broad deep cut and the knife penetrated to its whole depth for there is a bruise each side of the mouth of the wound if you were to attempt to move earlier than that you might have a great deal of trouble now there is no occasion for me to stay with you any longer dr hawthorne who was called in with me will be here at nine oclock and will bring a nurse with him you must have some one with you your wound might break out suddenly at any moment we shall give you a little weak broth but we must not begin building you up at present the great thing is to avoid any chance of fever setting in your having lost so much blood is all in your favour in that respect now lad i will have a look at your head yes you had better keep on applying cloths dipped in ice water to it i will tell them to send you up a basin of broth when they send some up to your master you had better not take any solid food today  at ten oclock captain hampton having taken a few spoonfuls of broth from his nurse fell off into a quiet sleep jacob who had taken off his boots so as to move about noiselessly had tidied up the room he had glanced several times towards the unfinished letter and the addressed envelope on the table and he now took his shoes in his hand and went out through the door put on his shoes again and proceeded down stairs having before he left the room laid aside his wet cloths and put on his cap  when does the post go out for england he asked the clerk  it is mail day today there is a steamer going direct to england  he went back to his masters room took up a pen and with infinite labour scrawled a few lines at the bottom of the unfinished letter making several blots and smudges as he did so these he dried with blottingpaper and with much selfdisapproval folded the letter placed it in the envelope and going downstairs again handed it to the clerk to post  for three or four days captain hampton remained in a very weak state then he began to rally and picked up strength fast at the end of ten days he was able to walk across the room  what has become of the letter i left on the table when i went out with you jacob  i saw the envelope was to mr danvers sir and you had told me about him i asked about the post and they said that it was going out that day and as you had written before you went out i was sure that you wanted the letter to go by it so i made a shift to write a line at the bottom to say that you could not finish it because you had got hurt and then fastened it up and posted it i hope that was right sir  you intended well anyhow jacob but it would have been better perhaps if you hadnt done it as it will only alarm him needlessly  i told him the doctor said you would get round sir  ah well that is all right i am glad you sent it as he would be looking for a letter from me i suppose you are quite sure that it was a negro who stabbed me  quite sure sir it was dark but not so dark that i could not see his face  well in another three or four days i shall be able to be out jacob if i find that these people were here at the time i landed i shall have no doubt that this business was their work i knew the man by sight and he may have known me someone may have pointed me out to him on the racecourse as i had been asking about him of course it may have been done merely for the sake of plunder but i think the other is more likely  three days later captain hampton was able to go for a ride in a carriage he went first to the police office  we have no news whatever to give you captain hampton the superintendent who had been to see him several times said as he entered  i did not expect you would have any he replied i have come to see you about a different business here is the letter the head of the police at new york gave me to you you see i am in search of two people from england by the aid of the police at new york i traced them and found that they had come on here nearly three weeks before i followed them and was wounded a few hours after my arrival here i am well enough to begin the search again and shall be very glad if you will send one of your officers with me to visit the hotels  the superintendent at once complied with his request and at the second hotel they visited he discovered that the people he sought had been staying there and had left on the evening of his arrival  they were booked on the boat to omaha the clerk said i know they have been getting a lot of things at the stores as they were going across the plains the evening before they were to start mr myrtle said they had changed their minds and were going on at once to baton rouge they hurried up but they were pretty late they took a carriage from here and the driver told me they only just caught the boat by a minute the bell was ringing when they got to the quay you wont catch them now the arkansas is a fast boat and i suppose they got on board her at baton rouge there is no boat going now for the next four or five days so they would have a good three weeks start of you  you dont happen to know where they bought their things captain hampton asked  they got a lot of things at j b nashs stores a good many came up here but i expect the heavy part went straight on board  thank you i dont think there is anything more to ask you we will go down to these stores he added to the policeman as he returned to the carriage i may learn something there that may be useful  his inquiries showed plainly enough that truscott really meant to cross the plains and that they were going to travel by waggon what harness did they buy he asked  for six horses at least by what i heard them say for four horses and two mules the two men were talking about it and they wanted bigger collars for the two wheelers because they would be mules  were there two men then as well as a girl  yes the three always came together one of them belonged to this city i knew his face though i dont know what his name was i take it he was a britisher though he had been long enough here to lose most of his accent he seemed rather to boss the show and the other bought the things he fixed on i allow he was a pretty smart fellow and was pretty well fixed up on prices we did not get very much out of that deal  what was he like  he was a strongbuilt sort of chap about forty i should say and looked rather a hard sort of cuss i dont know what his name was the other called him joe  thank you i daresay i shall be coming in to get an outfit for myself in a day or two i am thinking of going across the plains too  well i guess we can fix you up with everything you want squire but you dont look as if you was fit for a journey across the plains just yet it aint childs play i reckon it wants a pretty strong man to stand the racket  i shall have a fortnight to pick up on board the steamer captain hampton said i have just had a bout of illness but i am shaking it off and it will be at least three weeks before i am at omaha  we are going for a long journey jacob he said when he returned to the hotel  we have been a pretty goodish long un already captain  nothing to what we are going to set out on now jacob we have got a fortnight or three weeks on board a steamer and then we start across the plains  how long shall we be in crossing them sir  four or five months jacob  my eye the lad exclaimed them must be something like plains and what is there the other side of them  there is a country where they find gold jacob  what sovs the boy exclaimed  the stuff sovereigns are made of  but you aint going to look for that sir  no lad i am going after these people they were here that evening when we came in and as they started in a hurry halfanhour after we landed i cannot help thinking they saw me it seems they had another man with them when they were here and i expect they came here to join him i dont know whether he left with them my own opinion is he did not but when truscott saw me he hurried off at once to his hotel and started leaving the other man to prevent my following them probably he started by the boat in the morning after them believing the negro he had hired had done his work at any rate i have made up my mind to follow them i was determined to do so before but if i hadnt been this would have decided me they have got a long start but we will come up to them sooner or later  i should think so the boy said energetically and pay them out for it too my eye wont they be surprised when we drop upon them just as they are picking up gold but you aint fit to start yet he went on changing his voice you look very white sir i think you have been doing too much and it wont do for you to start to cross these here plains until you are strong it will just be aknocking yourself up and i dont suppose there aint no doctors living out there  that there are not jacob captain hampton laughed well we shall have three weeks quiet on board the steamer and by the time we land i hope i shall be as strong as ever i will keep quiet for the rest of the day tomorrow i shall have to see about taking our passage and getting ready for the start i know nothing about what we shall want yet  the next morning captain hampton took jacob with him down to the stores where he had been on the previous afternoon  i have made up my mind to go across the plains he said now what do i want i know absolutely nothing about it clothes i have got of all sortsi want nothing in that way i want to travel as light as possible so as to push on fast  can you shoot  yes i am a good shot and have a doublebarrelled gun and rifle with me  that will help you a good deal the game has been mostly shot or scared away along the line but there is some to be had and you see any meat you dont want you can swap for flour and other things with some of the emigrants as to your pushing on you might do that sometimes but not very often there are redskins all along the line and a man travelling by himself would have much trouble in getting through as a general thing folks go in parties of ten or twelve waggons often more and then they are too strong for the redskins to attack i do not think you could travel much faster than the ordinary not even if you had good horses the bullocks travel slow but they go a good many hours a day and camp at night where there is water  if you could ride all the way you might do two days journey in one sometimes but you must take some provision along with you you must take some flour and some bacon for you cant always reckon on game and tea and sugar and little odds and ends and then there are your clothes knocking about for four months and sleeping as you stand you want at least two suits besides what you have got on then there is your ammunition altogether go as light as you can you have got a lot of things to haul along with you if you aint afraid of roughing it i should say you could not do better than take a strong buggy  that is a fourwheeled vehicle i suppose  the man nodded  you can have it with springs or without springs make it easy but if you break one you are done  would it be strong enough to carry say six hundred weight  ay double that if need be but of course the lighter the better you would want a tarpaulin to cover the things up and you might make a shift to sleep under it if it is wet  no we will sleep under the waggon we will have hooks put along all round the bottom board and a stout canvas curtain with rings to hang down to the ground and peg down there  that will make a capital tent have it to open behind so that you can sit at the entrance and have a fire outside  can you get me such a vehicle and make a sailcloth curtain for me  i can do that the man said  about how much will it cost for a good hickory waggon without springs and without any particular finish  you would pay about a hundred and fifty dollars the tarpaulin to come well over it and the canvas arrangement might be forty dollars more though i cannot tell you exactly if you say two hundred dollars altogether you wont be far from the mark  very well you can do it how much flour shall i take  well seeing that you will do some shooting and swap some of the meat for flour i should say a hundred and fifty pounds ought to last the two of you fairly well  half an hour was spent in discussing the other items including a dozen of brandy for emergencies a small stock of medicines pickles sauces and other items mounting up to about four hundred pounds in weight to these were added some twenty pounds of ammunition  allowing fifty pounds for blankets and clothes we shall be well under five hundred captain hampton said and we shall get lighter as we go on  when you book your passage you can arrange for the buggy to be taken up said the storekeeper you might put all the things in it we shall put all the small items in boxes and then lash the tarpaulin well over everything they will travel safely enough and you will have no trouble about them till you get to the end of the journey now what about horses what are you going to do i reckon you will have to pay a mighty high price if you wait until you get to omaha  i shall want three horses a good one for my own riding and two sturdy animals for the cartthe boy will drive the cart could we get them taken up too  you can get anything taken up by paying for it i dont say as you wouldnt save money because you would a good bit if you were to drop off at some station a good way from any town and look round among the farmers and get what you want and go on by the next boatbut i suppose that would not suit you  not at all the great thing is to save time do you think that i could pick up three horses to suit me here  you can pick up anything you like here i will give you the names of halfadozen stablekeepers and if you dont find them all at one place you will at another but mind dont give the prices asked seeing you are a stranger they will put on about three times the price they will be ready to take  they are pretty well alike in that respect all over the world captain hampton laughed i have bought some horses in my time and i dont think they will take me in much still i am much obliged to you for your warning i dont think i should have been prepared to bid them only a third though i should i dare say have tried half  a third is enough to begin with anyhow the man said and i shouldnt rise much on that you have got five days before you start so you can take your time and i should say dont get town horses but critters fresh from the farms town horses get their legs knocked about and cant stand hard work and weather like those just brought in i aint sure you would not do better to take steamer and go twenty or thirty miles up or down the river you will be more likely to get an honest horse  it took captain hampton three days before he had purchased three animals to his liking but when he had done so he was well content with his bargains all of which he had picked up at farm houses a few miles from the city a store of grain sufficient for the passage was sent with them on board the boat and everything was in perfect readiness on the morning of the day when the steamer was to start up the mississippi   end of the second volume     new library novels  the one too many by e lynn linton 3 vols  in direst peril by david christie murray 3 vols  the tiger lily a
