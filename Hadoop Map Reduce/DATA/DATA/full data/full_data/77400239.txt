77400239	morning star  by h rider haggard     dedication  my dear budge  only a friendship extending over many years emboldened me an amateur to propose to dedicate a romance of old egypt to you one of the worlds masters of the language and lore of the great people who in these latter days arise from their holy tombs to instruct us in the secrets of history and faith  with doubt i submitted to you this story asking whether you wished to accept pages that could not i feared be free from error and with surprise in due course i read among other kind things your advice to me to leave it exactly as it is so i take you at your word although i can scarcely think that in paths so remote and difficult i have not sometimes gone astray  whatever may be the shortcomings therefore that your kindness has concealed from me since this tale was so fortunate as to please and interest you its first critic i offer it to you as an earnest of my respect for your learning and your labours  very sincerely yours  h rider haggard  ditchingham  to doctor wallis budge  keeper of egyptian and assyrian antiquities british museum     authors note  it may be thought that even in a story of old egypt to represent a ka or double as remaining in active occupation of a throne while the owner of the said double goes upon a long journey and achieves sundry adventures is in fact to take a liberty with doubles yet i believe that this is scarcely the case the ka or double which wiedermann aptly calls the personality within the person appears according to egyptian theory to have had an existence of its own it did not die when the body died for it was immortal and awaited the resurrection of that body with which henceforth it would be reunited and dwell eternally to quote wiedermann again the ka could live without the body but the body could not live without the ka      it was material in just the same was as the body itself also it would seem that in certain ways it was superior to and more powerful than the body since the egyptian monarchs are often represented as making offerings to their own kas as though these were gods again in the story of setna and the magic book translated by maspero and by mr flinders petrie in his egyptian tales the ka plays a very distinct part of its own thus the husband is buried at memphis and the wife in koptos yet the ka of the wife goes to live in her husbands tomb hundreds of miles away and converses with the prince who comes to steal the magic book  although i know no actual precedent for it in the case of a particularly powerful double such as was given in this romance to queen netertua by her spiritual father amen the greatest of the egyptian gods it seems therefore legitimate to suppose that in order to save her from the abomination of a forced marriage with her uncle and her fathers murderer the ka would be allowed to anticipate matters a little and to play the part recorded in these pages  it must not be understood however that the fact of marriage with an uncle would have shocked the egyptian mind since these people and especially their royal houses made a habit of wedding their own brothers and sisters as in this tale mermes wed his half sister asti  i may add that there is authority for the magic waxen image which the sorcerer kaku and his accomplice used to bewitch pharaoh in the days of rameses iii over three thousand years ago a plot was made to murder the king in pursuance of which such images were used gods of wax       for enfeebling the limbs of people which were great crimes of death the great abomination of the land also a certain magic roll was brought into play which enabled its user to employ the magic powers of the gods  still the end of these wizards was not encouraging to others for they were found guilty and obliged to take their own lives  but even if i am held to have stretched the prerogative of the ka or of the waxen image which by the way has survived almost to our own time and in west africa as a fetish is still pierced with pins or nails i can urge in excuse that i have tried so far as a modern may to reproduce something of the atmosphere and colour of old egypt as it has appeared to a traveller in that country and a student of its records if netertua never sat upon its throne at least another daughter of amen a mighty queen hatshepu wore the crown of the upper and the lower lands and sent her embassies to search out the mysteries of punt of romance also in high places there must have been abundance though the shortcut records of the religious texts of the priests do not trouble themselves with such matters  at any rate so believing in the hope that it may interest readers of today i have ventured to discover and present one such romance whereof the motive we may be sure is more ancient by far than the old egyptians namely the triumph of true love over great difficulties and dangers it is pleasant to dream that the gods are on the side of such lovers and deign for their sakes to work the miracles in which for thousands of years mankind has believed although the scientist tells us that they do not happen  how large a part marvel and magic of the most terrible and exalted kind played in the life of old egypt and of the nations with which she fought and traded we need go no further than the book of exodus to learn also all her history is full of it since among the egyptians it was an article of faith that the divinity which they worshipped under so many names and symbols made use of such mysterious means to influence or direct the affairs of men and bring about the accomplishment of its decrees  h r h     morning star  by h rider haggard     chapter i  the plot of abi  it was evening in egypt thousands of years ago when the prince abi governor of memphis and of great territories in the delta made fast his ship of state to a quay beneath the outermost walls of the mighty city of uast or thebes which we moderns know as luxor and karnac on the nile abi a large man very dark of skin for his mother was one of the hated hyksos barbarians who once had usurped the throne of egypt sat upon the deck of his ship and stared at the setting sun which for a few moments seemed to rest a round ball of fire upon the bare and rugged mountains that ring round the tombs of the kings  he was angry as the slavewomen who stood on either side fanning him could see well enough by the scowl on his coarse face and the fire in his large black eyes presently they felt it also for one of them staring at the temples and palaces of the wonderful city made glorious by the light of the setting sun that city of which she had heard so often touched his head with the feathers of her fan thereon as though glad of an excuse to express his illhumour abi sprang up and boxed her ears so heavily that the poor girl fell to the deck  awkward cat he cried do that again and you shall be flogged until your robe sticks to your back  pardon mighty lord she said beginning to weep it was an accident the wind caught my fan  so the rod shall catch your skin if you are not more careful merytra stop that snivelling and go send kaku the astrologer here go both i weary of the sight of your ugly faces  the girl rose and with her fellow slave ran swiftly to the ladder that led to the waist of the ship  he called me a cat merytra hissed through her white teeth to her companion well if so sekhet the catheaded is my godmother and she is the lady of vengeance  yes answered the other and he said that we were both uglywe whom every lord who comes near the court admires so much oh i wish a holy crocodile would eat him black pig  then why dont they buy us abi would sell his daughters much more his fanbearersat a price  because they hope to get us for nothing my dear and what is more if i can manage it one of them shall for i am tired of this life have your fling while you can i say who knows at which corner osiris lord of death is waiting  hush whispered merytra there is that knave of an astrologer and he looks cross too  then hand in hand they went to this lean and learned man and humbly bowed themselves before him  master of the stars said merytra we have a message for you no do not look at my cheek please the marks are not magical only those of the divine fingers of the glorious hand of the most exalted prince abi son of the pharaoh happily ruling in osiris etc etc etc of the right royal blood of egyptthat is on one side and on the other of a divine lady whom khem the spirit or ptah the creator thought fit to dip in a vat of black dye  hem said kaku glancing nervously over his shoulder then seeing that there was no one near he added you had better be careful what you say my dear the royal abi does not like to hear the colour of his late mother defined so closely but why did he slap your face  she told him  well he answered if i had been in his place i would rather have kissed it for it is pretty decidedly pretty and this learned man forgot himself so far as to wink at merytra  there sister said the girl i always told you that rough shells have sweet nuts inside of them thank you for your compliment master of learning will you tell us our fortune for nothing  yes yes he answered at least the fee i want will cost you nothing now stop this nonsense he added anxiously i gather that he is cross  i never saw him crosser kaku i am glad it is you who reads the stars not i listen  as he spoke an angry roar reached them from the high deck above  where is that accursed astrologer said the roar  there what did i tell you oh never mind the rest of the papers go at once your robe is full of rolls as it is  yes answered kaku as he ran to the ladder but the question is how will he like what is in the rolls  the gods be with you cried one of the girls after him you will need them all  and if you get back alive dont forget your promise about the fortunes said the other  a minute later this searcher of the heavens a tall hooknosed man was prostrating himself before abi in his pavilion on the upper deck so low that his syrianshaped cap fell from his bald head  why were you so long in coming asked abi  because your slaves could not find me royal son of the sun i was at work in my cabin  indeed i thought i heard them giggling with you down there what did you call me royal son of the sun that is pharaohs name have the stars shown you and he looked at him eagerly  no prince not exactly that i did not think it needful to search them on a matter which seems established more or less  more or less answered abi gloomily what do you mean by your more or less here am i at the turningpoint of my fortunes not knowing whether i am to be pharaoh of the upper and lower lands or only the petty lord of a city and a few provinces in the delta and you satisfy my hunger for the truth with an empty dish of more or less man what do you mean  if your majesty will be pleased to tell his servant exactly what you desire to know perhaps i may be able to answer the question replied kaku humbly  majesty well i desire to know by what warrant you call me majesty who am only prince of memphis did the stars give it to you have you obeyed me and asked them of the future  certainly certainly how could i disobey i observed them all last night and have been working out the results till this moment indeed they are not yet finished question and i will answer  you will answer yes but what will you answer not the truth i fancy because you are a coward though if anyone can read the truth it is you man he added fiercely if you dare to lie to me i will cut your head off and take it to pharaoh as a traitors and your body shall lie not in that fine tomb which you have made but in the belly of a crocodile whence there is no resurrection do you understand then let us come to the point look the sun sets there behind the tombs of kings where the departed pharaohs of egypt take their rest till the day of awakening it is a bad omen for me i know who wished to reach this city in the morning when ra was in the house of life the east and not in the house of death the west but that accursed wind sent by typhon held me back and i could not well let us begin at the end which must come after all tell me you reader of the heavens shall i sleep at last in that valley  i think so prince at least so says your planet look yonder it springs to life above you and he pointed to an orb that appeared at the topmost edge of the red glow of the sunset  you are keeping something back from me said abi searching kakus face with his fierce eyes shall i sleep in the tomb of pharaoh in my own everlasting house that i shall have made ready to receive me  son of ra i cannot say answered the astrologer divine one i will be frank with you though you be wrath yet will i tell you the truth as you command me an evil influence is at work in your house of life another star crosses and recrosses your path and though for a long time you seem to swallow it up yet at the last it eclipses youit and one that goes with it  what star asked abi hoarsely pharaohs  nay prince the star of amen  amen what amen  amen the god prince the mighty father of the gods  amen the god repeated abi in an awed voice how can a man fight against a god  say rather against two gods for with the star of amen goes the star of hathor queen of love not for many periods of thousands of years have they been together but now they draw near to each other and so will remain for all your life look and kaku pointed to the eastern horizon where a faint rosy glow still lingered reflected from the western sky  as they watched this glow melted and there in the pure heavens lying just where it met the distant land seeming to rest upon the land indeed appeared a bright and beautiful star and so close to it that to the eye they almost touched a twin star for a few minutes only were they seen then they vanished beneath the line of the horizon  the morning star of amen and with it the star of hathor said the astrologer  well fool what of it exclaimed abi they are far enough from my star moreover it is they that sink not i who ride higher every moment  aye prince but in a year to come they will certainly eclipse that star of yours prince amen and hathor are against you look i will show you their journeyings on this scroll and you shall see where they eat you up yonder yes yonder over the valley of dead kings though twenty years and more must go by ere then and take this for your comfort during those years you shine alone and he began to unfold a papyrus roll  abi snatched it from him crumpled it up and threw it in his face  you cheat he said do you think to frighten me with this nonsense about stars here is my star and he drew the short sword at his side and shook it over the head of the trembling kaku this sharp bronze is the star i follow and be careful lest it should eclipse you you father of lies  i have told the truth as i see it answered the poor astrologer with some dignity but if you wish o prince that in the future i should indeed prophesy pleasant things to you why it can be done easily enough moreover it seems to me that this horoscope of yours is not so evil seeing that it gives to you over twenty years of life and power more by far than most men can expectat your age if after that come troubles and the end what of it  that is so replied abi mollified it was my illtemper everything has gone cross today well a gold cup my own shall pay the price of it bear me no illwill i pray you learned scribe and above all tell me no falsehood as the message of the stars you serve it is the truth i seek the truth if only she may be seen and clasped i care not how illfavoured is her face  rejoicing at the turn which things had taken and especially at the promise of the priceless cup which he had long coveted kaku bowed obsequiously he picked up his crumpled roll and was about to retire when through the gloom of the falling night some men mounted upon asses were seen riding over the mud flats that border the nile at this spot towards that bank where the ship was moored  the captain of my guard said abi who saw the starlight gleam upon a bronze helmet who brings me pharaohs answer nay go not bide and hear it kaku and give us your counsel on it your true counsel  so the astrologer stood aside and waited till presently the captain appeared saluting  what says pharaoh my brother asked the prince  lord he says that he will receive you though as he did not send for you he thinks that you can scarcely come upon any necessary errand as he has heard long ago of your victory over the desertdwelling barbarians and does not want the offering of the salted heads of their officers which you bring to him  good said abi contemptuously the divine pharaoh was ever a woman in such matters as in others let him be thankful that he has generals who know how to make war and to cut off the heads of his enemies in defence of the kingdom we will wait upon him tomorrow  lord added the captain that is not all pharaohs message he says that it has been reported to him that you are accompanied by a guard of three hundred soldiers these soldiers he refuses to allow within the gates he directs that you shall appear before his majesty attended by five persons only  indeed answered abi with a scornful laugh does pharaoh fear then lest i should capture him and his armies and the great city with three hundred soldiers  no prince answered the captain bluntly but i think he fears lest you should kill him and declare yourself pharaoh as next in blood  ah said abi as next of blood then i suppose that there are still no children at the court  none o prince i saw ahura the royal wife the lady of the two lands that fairest of women and other lesser wives and beautiful slave girls without number but never a one of them had an infant on her breast or at her knee pharaoh remains childless  ah said abi again then he walked forward out of the pavilion whereof the curtains were drawn back and stood a while upon the prow of the vessel  by now night had fallen and the great moon rising from the earth as it were poured her flood of silver light over the desert the mountains the limitless city of thebes and the wide rippling bosom of the nile the pylons and obelisks glittering with copper and with gold towered to the tender sky in the window places of palaces and of ten thousand homes lamps shone like stars from gardens streets and the courts of temples floated the faint sound of singing and of music while on the great embattled walls the watchmen called the hour from post to post  it was a wondrous scene and the heart of abi swelled as he gazed upon it what wealth lay yonder and what power there was the glorious house of his brother pharaoh the god in human form who for all his godship had never a child to follow after him when he ascended to osiris as he who was sickly probably must do before so very long  yes but before then a miracle might happen in this way or in that a successor to the throne might be found and acknowledged for were not pharaoh and his house beloved by all the priests of amen and by the people and was not he abi feared and disliked because he was fierce and the hated savage blood flowed in his veins oh what evil god had put it in his fathers heart to give him a princess of the hyksos for a mother the hyksos whom the egyptians loathed when he had the fairest women of the world from whom to choose well it was done and could not be undone though because of it he might lose his heritage of the greatest throne in all the earth also was it not to this fierce hyksos blood that he owed his strength and vigour  why should he wait why should he not set his fortune on a cast he had three hundred soldiers with him picked men and brave children of the sea and the desert sworn to his house and interests it was a time of festival those gates were illguarded why should he not force them at the dead of night make his way to the palace cause pharaoh to be gathered to his fathers and at the dawn discover himself seated upon pharaohs throne at the thought of it abis heart leapt in his breast his wide nostrils spread themselves and he erected his strong head as though already he felt upon it the weight of the double crown then he turned and walked back to the pavilion  i am minded to strike a blow he said say now my officer would you and the soldiers follow me into the heart of yonder city tonight to win a throneor a grave if it were the first you should be the general of all my army and you astrologer should become vizier yes after pharaoh you two should be the greatest men in all the land  they looked at him and gasped  a venturesome deed prince said the captain at length yet with such a prize to win i think that i would dare it though for the soldiers i cannot speak first they must be told what is on foot and out of so many how know we that the heart of one or more would not fail a word from a traitor and before this time tomorrow the embalmers or the jackals would be busy  abi heard and looked from him to his companion  prince said kaku put such thoughts from you bury them deep let them rise no more in the heavens i read something of this business but then i did not understand but now i see the black depths of hell opening beneath our feet yes hell would be our home if we dared to lift hand against the divine person of the pharaoh i say that the gods themselves would fight against us let it be prince let it be and you shall have many years of rule who if you strike now will win nothing but a crown of shame a nameless grave and the everlasting torment of the damned  as he spoke abi considered the mans face and saw that all craft had left it this was no charlatan that spoke to him but one in earnest who believed what he said  so be it he answered i accept your judgment and will wait upon my fortune moreover you are both right the thing is too dangerous and evil often falls on the heads of those who shoot arrows at a god especially if they have not enough arrows let pharaoh live on while i make ready perhaps tomorrow i may work upon him to name me his heir  the astrologer sighed in relief nor did the captain seem disappointed  my head feels firmer on my shoulders than it did just now he said and doubtless there are times when wisdom is better than valour sleep well prince pharaoh will receive you tomorrow two hours after sunrise have we your leave to retire  if i were wise said abi fingering the hilt of his sword as he spoke you would both of you retire for ever who know all the secret of my heart and with a whisper could bring doom upon me  now the pair looked at each other with frightened eyes and like his master the captain began to play with his sword  life is sweet to all men prince he said significantly and we have never given you cause to doubt us  no answered abi had it been otherwise i should have struck first and spoken afterwards only you must swear by the oath which may not be broken that in life or death no word of this shall pass your lips  so they swore both of them by the holy name of osiris the judge and the redeemer  captain said abi you have served me well your pay is doubled and i confirm the promise that i made to youshould i ever rule yonder you shall be my general  while the soldier bowed his thanks the prince said to kaku  master of the stars my gold cup is yours is there aught else of mine that you desire  that slave answered the learned man merytra whose ears you boxed just now  how do you know that i boxed her ears asked abi quickly did the stars tell you that also well i am tired of the sly hussytake her soon i think she will box yours  but when kaku sought merytra to tell her the glad tidings that she was his he could not find her  merytra had disappeared    chapter ii  the promise of the god  it was morning at thebes and the great city glowed in the rays of the newrisen sun in a royal barge sat abi the prince splendidly apparelled and with him kaku his astrologer his captain of the guard and three other of his officers while in a second barge followed slaves who escorted two chiefs and some fair women captured in war also the chests of salted heads and hands offerings to pharaoh  the whiterobed rowers bent to their oars and the swift boat shot forward up the nile through a double line of ships of war all of them crowded with soldiers abi looked at these ships which pharaoh had gathered there to meet him and thought to himself that kaku had given wise counsel when he prayed him to attempt no rash deed for against such surprises clearly pharaoh was well prepared he thought it again when on reaching the quay of cut stones he saw foot and horsemen marshalled there in companies and squadrons and on the walls above hundreds of other men all armed for now he saw what would have happened to him if with his little desperate band he had tried to pierce that iron ring of watching soldiers  at the steps generals met him in their mail and priests in their full robes bowing and doing him honour thus royally escorted abi passed through the open gates and the pylons of the splendid temple dedicated to the trinity of thebes the house of amen in the southern apt where gay banners fluttered from the pointed masts up the long street bordered with tall houses set in their gardens till he came to the palace wall here more guards rolled back the brazen gates which in his folly of a few hours gone he had thought that he could force and through the avenues of blooming trees he was led to the great pillared hall of audience  after the brightness without that hall seemed almost dark only a ray of sunshine flowing from an unshuttered space in the clerestory above fell full on the end of it and revealed the crowned pharaoh and his queen seated in state upon their thrones of ivory and gold gathered round and about him also were scribes and councillors and captains and beyond these other queens in their carved chairs and attended each of them by beautiful women of the household in their gala dress moreover behind the thrones and at intervals between the columns stood the famous nubian guard of two hundred men the servants of the body of pharaoh as they were called each of them chosen for faithfulness and courage  the centre of all this magnificence was pharaoh on him the sunlight beat to him every eye was turned and where his glance fell there heads bowed and knees were bent a small thin man of about forty years of age with a puckered kindly and anxious face and a brow that seemed to sink beneath the weight of the double crown that save for its royal snakecrest of hollow gold was after all but of linen a man with thin nervous hands which played amongst the embroideries of his golden robesuch was pharaoh the mightiest monarch in the world the ruler whom millions that had never seen him worshipped as a god  abi the burly framed thicklipped darkskinned roundeyed abi born of the same father stared at him with wonderment for years had passed since last they met and in the palace when they were children a gulf had been set between the offspring of a royal mother and the child of a hyksos concubine taken into the household for reasons of state in his vigour and the might of his manhood he stared at this weakling the son of a brother and a sister and the grandson of a brother and a sister yet there was something in that gentle eye an essence of inherited royalty before which his rude nature bowed the body might be contemptible but within it dwelt the proud spirit of the descendant of a hundred kings  abi advanced to the steps of the throne and knelt there till after a little pause pharaoh stretched out the sceptre in his hand for him to kiss then he spoke in his light quick voice  welcome prince and my brother he said we quarrelled long ago did we not and many years have passed since we met but time heals all wounds andwelcome son of my father i need not ask if you are well and he glanced enviously at the greatframed man who knelt before him  hail to your divine majesty answered abi in his deep voice health and strength be with you holder of the scourge of osiris wearer of the feathers of amen mortal crowned with the glory of ra  i thank you prince answered pharaoh gently and that health and strength i need who fear that i shall only find them when i have yielded up the scourge of osiris whereof you speak to him who lent it me but enough of myself let us to business afterwards we will talk of such matters together why have you left your government at memphis without leave asked to visit me here in my city of the gates  be not wrath with me answered abi humbly a while ago in obedience to your divine command i attacked the barbarians who threatened your dominions in the desert like menthu god of war i fell upon them i took them by surprise i smote them thousands of them bit the dust before me two of their kings i captured with their womenthey wait without to be slain by your majesty i bring with me the heads of a hundred of their captains and the hands of five hundred of their soldiers in earnest of the truth of my word let them be spread out before you i report to your divine majesty that those barbarians are no more that for a generation at least i have made the land safe to your uttermost dominions in the north suffer that the heads and the hands be brought in and counted out before your majesty that the smell of them may rise like incense to your divine nostrils  no no said pharaoh my officers shall count them without for i love not such sights of death and i take your word for the number what payment do you ask for this service my brother for with great gifts would i reward you who have done so well for me and egypt  before he answered abi looked at the beautiful queen ahura who sat at pharaohs side and at the other royal consorts and women  your majesty he said i see here many wives and ladies but royal children i do not see grantfor doubtless they are in their own chambersgrant o pharaoh that they may be led hither that my eyes may feed upon their loveliness and that i may tell of them each of them to their cousins who await me at memphis  at these words a flush as of shame spread itself over the lovely face of ahura the royal wife the lady of the two lands while the women turned their heads away whispering to each other bitterly for the insult hurt them only pharaoh set his pale face and answered with dignity  prince abi to affront those whom the gods have smitten be they kings or peasants is an unworthy deed which the gods will not forget you know well that i have no children why then do you ask me to show you their loveliness  i had heard rumours o pharaoh answered the prince no more indeed i did not believe them for where there are so many wives i was certain that there would be some mothers therefore i asked to be sure before i proffered a petition which now i will make to you not for my own sake but for egypts and yours o pharaoh have i your leave to speak here in public  speak on said pharaoh sternly let aught that is for the welfare of egypt be heard by egypt  your majesty has told me replied abi bowing that the gods being wrath have denied you children not so much as one girl of your blood have they given to you to fill your throne after you when in due season it pleases you to depart to osiris were it otherwise were there even but a single womanchild of your divine race i would say nothing i would be silent as the grave but so it is and though your queens be fair and many so it would seem that it must remain since the ears of the gods having been deaf to your pleadings for so long although you have built them glorious temples and made them offerings without count will scarcely now be opened even amen your father amen whose name you bear will perform no miracle for you o pharaoh who are so great that he has decreed that you shall shine alone like the full moon at night not sharing your glory with a single star  now ahura the queen who all this while had been listening intently spoke for the first time in a quick angry voice saying  how know you that prince of memphis sometimes the gods relent and that which they have withheld for a space they give my lord lives and i live and a child of his may yet fill the throne of egypt  it may be so o queen said abi bowing and for my part i pray that it will be so for who am i that i should know the purpose of the kings of heaven if but one girl be born of you and pharaoh then i take back my words and give to you that title which for many years has been written falsely upon your thrones and monuments the title of royal mother  now ahura would have answered again for this sneering taunt stung her to the quick but pharaoh laid his hand upon her knee and said  continue prince and brother we have heard from you that which we already know too wellthat i am childless tell us what we do not know the desire of your heart which lies hid beneath all these words  pharaoh it is thisi am of your holy blood sprung of the same divine father  but of a mother who was not divine broke in ahura of a mother taken from a race that has brought many a curse upon khem as any mirror will show you prince of memphis  pharaoh went on abi without heeding her you grow weak heaven desires you the earth melts beneath you in the north and in the south many dangers threaten egypt should you die suddenly without an heir barbarians will flow in from the north and from the south and the great ones of the land will struggle for your place pharaoh i am a warrior i am built strong my children are many my house is built upon a rock the army trusts me the millions of the people love me take me then to rule with you and in the hearing of all the earth name me and my sons as your successors so that our royal race may continue for generation after generation so shall you end your days in peace and hope i have spoken  now as the meaning of this bold request sank into their hearts all the court there gathered gasped and whispered while the queen ahura in her anger crushed the lotus flower which she held in her hand and cast it to the floor only pharaoh sat still and silent his head bent and his eyes shut as though in prayer for a minute or more he sat thus and when he lifted his pale pure face there was a smile upon it  abi my brother he said in his gentle voice listen to me there are those who filled this throne before me who on hearing such words would have pointed to you with their sceptres whereon abi those lips of yours would have grown still for ever and you and your name and the names of all your house would have been blotted out by death but abi you were ever bold and i forgive you for laying open the thoughts of your heart to me still abi you have not told us all of them you have not told us for instance he went on slowly and in the midst of an intense silence that but last night you debated whether it would not be possible with that guard of yours to break into my palace and put me to the sword and name yourself pharaohby right of blood abi yes by right of bloodmy blood shed by you my brother  as these words left the royal lips a tumult arose in the hall the women and the great officers sprang up the captains stepped forward drawing their swords to avenge so horrible a sacrilege but pharaoh waved his sceptre and they were still only abi cried in a great voice  who has dared to whisper a lie so monstrous and he glared first at kaku and then at the captain of his guard who stood behind him and choked in wrath or fear or both  suspect not your officers prince went on the pharaoh still smiling for on my royal word they are innocent yet abi a pavilion set upon the deck of a ship is no good place to plot the death of kings pharaoh has many spies also at times the gods to whom as you say he is so near whisper tidings to him in his sleep suspect not your officers abi although i think that to yonder master of the stars who stands behind you i should be grateful since had you attempted to execute this madness but for him i might have been forced to kill you abi as one kills a snake that creeps beneath his mat astrologer you shall have a gift from me for you are a wise man it may take the place perhaps of one that you have lost was it not a certain woman slave whom your master gave to you last nightafter he had punished her for no fault  kaku prostrated himself before the glory of pharaoh understanding at last that it was the lost girl merytra who had overheard and betrayed them but heeding him no more his majesty went on  abi prince and brother i forgive you a deed that you purposed but did not attempt may the gods and the spirits of our fathers forgive you also if they will now as to your demand you are my only living brother and therefore i will weigh it perchance if i should die without issue although you are not all royal although there flows in your veins a blood that egypt hates although you could plot the murder of your lord and king it may be well that when i am gone you should fill my place for you are brave and of the ancient race on one side if baseborn on the other but i am not yet dead and children may still come to me abi will you be a prisoner until osiris calls me or will you swear an oath  i will swear an oath answered the prince hoarsely for he knew his shame and danger  then kneel here and by the dreadful name swear that you will lift no hand and plot no plot against me swear that if a child male or female should be given to me you will serve such a child truly as your lord and lawful pharaoh in the presence of all this company swear knowing that if you break the oath in letter or in spirit then all the gods of egypt shall pour their curse upon your head in life and in death shall give you over to the everlasting torments of the damned  so having little choice abi swore by the name and kissed the sceptre in token of his oath    it was night dark and solemn was the innermost shrine of the vast temple the house of amen in the northern apt which we call karnak the very holy of holies where fashioned of stone and with the feathered crown upon his head stood the statue of amenra father of the gods here where none but the highpriest and the royalties of egypt might enter pharaoh and his wife ahura wrapped in brown cloaks like common folk knelt at the feet of the god and prayed with tears and supplications did they pray that a child might be given to them  there in the sacred place lit only by a single lamp which burned from age to age they told the story of their grief whilst high above them the cold calm countenance of the god seemed to stare through the gloom as for a thousand years in joy or sorrow it had stared at those that went before them they told of the mocking words of abi who had demanded to see their children the children that were not they told of their terror of the people who demanded that an heir should be declared they told of the doom that threatened their ancient house which from pharaoh to pharaoh all of one blood for generations had worshipped in this place they promised gifts and offerings stately temples and wide lands if only their desire might be fulfilled  let me no more be made a mock among men cried the beautiful queen beating her forehead upon the stone feet of the god let me bear a child to fill the seat of my lord the king and then if thou wilt take my life in payment  but the god made no answer and wearied out at length they rose and departed at the door of the sanctuary they found the highpriest awaiting them a wizened aged man  the god gave no sign o highpriest said pharaoh sadly no voice spoke to us  the old priest looked at the weeping queen and a light of pity crept into his eyes  to me watching without he said a voice seemed to speak though what it said i may not reveal go to your palace now o pharaoh and o queen ahura and take your rest side by side i think that in your sleep a sign will come to you for amen is pitiful and loves his children who love him according to that sign so speak to the prince abi speak without fear or doubt since for good or ill it shall be fulfilled  then like shadows hand in hand this royal pair glided down the vast pillared halls till at the pylon gates which were opened for them they found their litters and were borne along the great avenue of ramheaded sphinxes back to a secret door in the palace wall    it was past midnight deep darkness and heavy silence lay upon thebes broken only by dogs howling at the stars and the occasional challenge of soldiers on the walls side by side in their golden bed the wearied pharaoh and his queen slept heavily presently ahura woke she started up in the bed she stared at the darkness about her with frightened eyes she stretched out her hand and clasping pharaoh by the arm whispered in a thrilling voice  awake awake i have that which i must tell you  pharaoh roused himself for there was something in ahuras voice which swept away the veils of sleep  what has chanced ahura he asked  o pharaoh i have dreamed a dream if indeed it were but a dream it seemed to me that the darkness opened and that standing in the darkness i saw a glory which had neither shape nor form yet a voice spoke from the glory a low sweet voice queen ahura my daughter it said i am that spirit to whom thou and thy husband did pray this night in the sanctuary of my temple it seemed to both of you that your prayers remained unheard yet it was not so as my priest knew well queen ahura thou and pharaoh thy husband have put your trust in me these many years and not in vain a daughter shall be given to thee and pharaoh and my spirit shall be in that child she shall be beautiful and glorious as no woman was before her for i clothe her with health and power and wisdom she shall rule over the northern and the southern lands yea for many years the double crown shall rest upon her brow and no king that went before her and no king that follows after her shall be more great in egypt troubles and dangers shall threaten her but the spirit that i give to her shall protect her in them all and she shall tread her enemy beneath her feet a royal lover shall come to her also and she shall rejoice in his love and from it shall spring many kings and princes netertua morning star shall be her name and highpriestess of amenno lessshall be her office for she is my child whom i have taken from heaven and sent down to earth the child that i have given to pharaoh and to thee and i love her and appoint the good goddesses to be her companions and command osiris to receive her at the last  behold in token of these things i lay my symbol on thy breast and on her breast also shall that symbol be when i lift it from thee and thou dost open thy eyes then awaken pharaoh at thy side and let these my words be written in a roll so that none of them are forgotten  then o pharaoh went on ahura from the glory there came forth a hand and in the hand was the symbol of life shining as though with fire and the hand laid it upon my breast and it burned me as though with fire and i awoke and lo darkness was all about me nothing but darkness and at my side i heard you sleeping  now when pharaoh had listened to this dream he kissed the queen and blessed her because of its good omen and clapped his hands to summon the women of honour who slept without they ran in bearing lights and by the lights he saw that beneath the throat of the queen upon her fair skin appeared a red mark and the shape of it was the shape of the sign of life yes there was the loop and beneath the loop the cross  then pharaoh commanded that the chief of his scribes should come to him with papyrus and writing tools and that the highpriest of amen should be brought swiftly from the temple so the scribe came to the bedchamber of the king and in the presence of the highpriest all the words of amen were written down not one of them was omitted and pharaoh and the queen signed the roll and the highpriest witnessed it and copies having been made bore it away to hide it in the secret treasury of amen but the mark of the cross of life remained upon the breast of the queen ahura till the day that she died    now in the morning pharaoh summoned his court and commanded that the prince abi should be brought before him so the prince came and pharaoh addressed him kindly  son of my father he said i have considered your request that i should take you to rule with me on the throne of egypt and name you and your sons to be pharaohs after me and it is refused know that it has been revealed to me and to the royal wife ahura by the greatest of the gods that a daughter shall be born to us in due season who shall be called morning star of amen and that she and her seed shall be pharaohs after me therefore rejoice with us and return to your government prince abi and be happy in our love and in the goods and greatness that the gods have given you  now abi shook with anger for he thought that all this tale was a trick and a snare but knowing that his peril was great there in the hand of pharaoh he answered only that when this morning star arose his star should do it reverence though as the words passed his lips he remembered the prophecy of his astrologer kaku that the morning star of amen should blot out that star of his  you think that i speak falsely prince abi yes that i stain my lips with lies said pharaoh with indignation well i forgive you this also go hence and await the issue and know by this sign that truth is in my heart when the princess netertua is born upon her breast shall be seen the symbol of the sign of life depart now lest i grow angry the gifts i have promised shall follow you to memphis  so abi returned to the whitewalled city of memphis and sat there sullenly putting it about that a plot was on foot to deprive him of his heritage but kaku shook his head saying in secret that the star netertua would arise for so it was decreed by amen father of the gods    chapter iii  rames the princess and the crocodile  at the appointed time to ahura the royal wife was born a child a girl with a fresh and lovely face and waving hair and eyes that from the first were blue like the summer sky at even also on her breast was a mole of the length of a finger nail which mole was shaped like the holy sign of life  now pharaoh and his house and the priests in every temple and indeed all egypt went mad with joy though there were many who in secret mourned over the sex of the infant whispering that a man and not a woman should wear the double crown but in public they said nothing since the story of this child had gone abroad and folk declared that it was sent by the gods and divine and that the goddesses isis nepthys and hathor with khemu the maker of mankind were seen in the birth chamber glowing like gold  also pharaoh issued a decree that wherever the name of the queen ahura was graven in all the land to it should be added the title by the will of amen mother of his morning star and that a new hall should be built in the temple of amen in the northern apt and all about it carved the story of the coming of prince abi and of the vision of the queen  but ahura never lived to see this glorious place since from the hour of her daughters birth she began to sink on the fourteenth day the day of purification she bade the nurse bring the beautiful babe and gazed at it long and blessed it and spoke with the ka or double of the child which she said she saw lying on her arm beside it bidding that ka protect it well through the dangers of life and death until the hour of resurrection then she said that she heard amen calling to her to pay the price which she had promised for the gift of the divine child the price of her own life and smiled upon pharaoh her husband and died happily with a radiant face  now joy was turned to mourning and during all the days of embalming egypt wept for ahura until at length the time came when her body was rowed across the nile to the splendid tomb which she had made ready in the valley of the queens causing masons and artists to labour at it without cease for ahura knew from the day of her vision that she was doomed to die and remembered that the tombs of the dead remain as the live hands leave them since few waste gold and toil upon the eternal house of one who is dead  so ahura was buried with great pomp and all her jewels and pharaoh who mourned her truly made splendid offerings in the chapel of her tomb and having laid in the mouth of it the funeral boat in which she was borne across the nile he built it up for ever and poured sand over the rock so that none should find its place until the day of awakening  meanwhile the infant grew and flourished and when it was six months old was taken to the college of the priestesses of amen there to be reared and taught    now on the day of the birth of the princess netertua there happened another birth with which our story has to do the captain of the guard of the temple of amen was one mermes who had married his own halfsister asti the enchantress as was well known this mermes was by right and true descent the last of that house of pharaohs which had filled the throne of egypt until their line was cast down generations before by the dynasty that now ruled the land whereof the reigning pharaoh and his daughter netertua alone remained a long while past in the early days of his reign his council has whispered in pharaohs ear that he should kill mermes and his sister lest a day should come when they rebelled against him proclaiming that they did so by right of blood but pharaoh who was gentle and hated murder instead of slaying mermes sent for him and told him all  then mermes a noblelooking man as became the stock from which he sprang prostrated himself and said  o pharaoh why should you kill me it has pleased the gods to debase my house and to set up yours have i ever lifted up my heel against you because my forefathers were kings or plotted with the discontent to overthrow you see i am satisfied with my station which is that of a noble and a soldier in your army therefore let me and my halfsister the wise lady asti whom i purpose to marry dwell on in peace as your true and humble servants dip not your hands in our innocent blood o pharaoh lest the gods send a curse upon you and your house and our ghosts come back from the grave to haunt you  when pharaoh heard these words his heart was moved in him and he stretched out his sceptre for mermes to kiss thereby granting to him life and protection  mermes he said you are an honourable man and my equal in blood if not in place for their own purposes the gods raise up one and cast down another that at last their ends may be fulfilled i believe that you will work no harm against me and mine and therefore i will work no harm against you and your sister asti mistress of magic rather shall you be my friend and counsellor  then pharaoh offered high rank and office to him but mermes would not take them answering that if he did envy would be stirred up against him and in this way or that bring him to his death since tall trees are the first to fall so in the end pharaoh made mermes captain of the guard of amen and gave him land and houses enough to enable him to live as a noble of good estate but no more also he became a friend of pharaoh and one of his inner council to whose voice he always listened for mermes was a truehearted man  afterwards mermes married asti but like pharaoh for a long while he remained childless since he took no other wives on the day of the birth of the princess tua the morning star of amen however asti bore a son a royallooking child of great strength and beauty and very fair in colour as tradition said that the kings of his race had been before him but with black and shining eyes  see said the midwife here is a head shaped to wear a crown  whereon asti his mother forgetting her caution in her joy or perhaps inspired by the gods for from her childhood she was a prophetess answered  yes and i think that this head and a crown will come close together and she kissed him and named him rames after her royal forefather the founder of their line  as it chanced a spy overheard this saying and reported it to the council and the council urged pharaoh to cause the boy to be put away as they had urged in the case of his father mermes because of the words of omen that asti had spoken and because she had given her son a royal name naming him after the majesty of ra as though he were indeed the child of a king but pharaoh would not asking with his soft smile whether they wished him to baptise his daughter in the blood of another infant who drew his first breath upon the same day and adding  ra sheds his glory upon all and this highborn boy may live to be a friend in need to her whom amen has given to egypt let things befall as the gods decree who am i that i should make myself a god and destroy a life that they have fashioned  so the boy rames lived and throve and mermes and asti when they came to hear of these things thanked pharaoh and blessed him  now the house of mermes as captain of the guard was within the wall of the great temple of amen near to the palace of the priestesses of amen where the princess netertua was nurtured thus it came about that when the queen ahura died the lady asti was named as nurse to the princess since pharaoh said that she should drink no milk save that of one in whose veins ran royal blood so asti was tuas foster mother and night by night she slept in her arms together with her own son rames afterwards too when they were weaned the babes were taught to walk and speak together and later as children they became playmates  thus from the first these two loved each other as brother and sister love when they are twins but although the boy was bold and brave this little princess always had the mastery of him not because she was a princess and heir to the throne of egyptfor all the high titles they gave her fell idly on her ears nor did she think anything of the bowings of courtiers and of priestsbut from some strength within herself she it was that set the games they played and when she talked he was obliged to listen for although she was so sound and healthy this tua differed from other children  thus she had what she called her silent hours when she would suffer no one to come near her not her ladies or her fostermother asti herself nor even rames then followed by the women at a distance she would wander among the great columns of the temple and study the sculptures on the walls and since all places were open to her pharaohs child enter the sanctuaries and stare at the gods that sat in them fashioned in granite and in alabaster this she would do even in the solemn moonlight when mortals were afraid to approach these sacred shrines and come thence unconcerned and smiling  what do you see there o morning star asked little rames of her once they are dull things those stone gods that have never moved since the beginning of the world also they frighten me especially when ra is set  they are not dull and they do not frighten me answered tua they talk to me and although i cannot understand all they say i am happy with them  talk he said contemptuously how can stones talk  i do not know i think it is their spirits that talk telling me stories which happened before i was born and that shall happen after i am dead yes and after they seem to be dead now be silenti say that they talk to meit is enough  for me it would be more than enough said the boy but then i am not called child of amen who only worship menthu god of war    when rames was seven years of age every morning he was taken to school in the temple where the priests taught him to write with pens of reed upon tablets of wood and told him more about the gods of egypt than he ever wanted to hear again during these hours except when she was being instructed by the great ladies of the court or by highpriestesses tua was left solitary since by the command of pharaoh no other children were allowed to play with her perhaps because there were none in the temple of her age whose birth was noble  once when he came back from his school in the evening rames asked her if she had not been lonely without him she answered no as she had another companion  who is it he asked jealously show me and i will fight him  no one that you can see rames she replied only my own ka  your ka i have heard of kas but i never saw one what is it like  just like me except that it throws no shadow and only comes when i am quite by myself and then although i hear it often i see it rarely for it is mixed up with the light  i dont believe in kas exclaimed rames scornfully you make them up out of your head  a little while after this talk something happened that caused rames to change his mind about kas or at any rate the ka of tua in a hidden court of the temple was a deep pool of water with cemented sides where it was said lived a sacred crocodile an enormous beast that had dwelt there for hundreds of years rames and tua having heard of this crocodile often talked of it and longed to see it but could not for there was a high wall round the tank and in it a door of copper that was kept locked except when once in every eight days the priests took in food to the crocodileliving goats and sheep and sometimes a calf none of which ever came back again  now one day rames watching them return saw the priest who was called guardian of the door put his hand behind him to thrust the key with which he had just locked the door into his wallet and missing the mouth of the wallet let it fall upon the sand then go upon his way knowing nothing of what he had done  when he had gone in a great hurry for he was a fat old priest and the dinner hour was at hand rames pounced upon the key and hid it in his robe then he sought out the princess and said  morning star this evening when i come back from school and am allowed to play with you we can look at the wonderful beast in the tank for look i have the key which that fat priest will not search for till seven days are gone by before which i can take it to him saying that i found it in the sand or perhaps put it back into his wallet  when she heard this tuas eyes shone since above all things she desired to see this holy monster but in the evening when the boy came running to her eagerlyfor he had thought of nothing but the crocodile all day and had bought a pigeon from a schoolfellow with which to feed the brutehe found tua in a different mood  i dont think that we will go to see the holy crocodile rames she said looking at him thoughtfully  why not he asked amazed there is no one about and i have put fat upon the key so that it will make no noise  because my ka has been with me rames and told me that it is a bad act and if we do trouble will come to us  oh may the fiend set take your ka replied the lad in a rage show it to me and i will talk with it  i cannot rames for it is me moreover if set took it he would take me also and you are wicked to wish such a thing  now the boy began to cry with vexation sobbing out that she was not to be trusted and that he had paid away his bronze knife which pharaoh had given him when last he visited the temple for a pigeon to tempt the beast to the top of the water so that they might see it although the knife was worth many pigeons and pharaoh would be angry if he heard that he had parted with it  why should we take the life of a poor pigeon to please ourselves asked tua softening a little at the sight of his grief  its taken already he answered it fluttered so that i had to sit on it to hide it from the priest and when he had gone it was dead look and he opened the linen bag he held and showed her the dove cold and stiff  as you did not mean to kill it that makes a difference said tua judicially well perhaps my ka did not mean that we should not have one peep and it is a pity to waste the poor pigeon which then will have died for nothing  rames agreed that it would be the greatest of pities so the two children slipped away through the trees of the garden into the shadow of the wall along which they crept till they came to the bronze door then guiltily enough rames put the great key into the lock and with the help of a piece of wood which he had also made ready that he set in the ring of the key to act as a lever the two of them turning together shot back the heavy bolts  taking out the key lest it should betray them they opened the door a little and squeezed themselves through into the forbidden place no sooner had they done so than almost they wished themselves back again for there was something about the spot that frightened them to say nothing of the horrible smell which made tua feel ill it was a great tank with a little artificial island in its centre full of slimy water that looked almost black because of the shadow of the high walls and round it ran a narrow stone path at one spot in this path however where grew some danklooking trees and bushes was a slope also of stone and on the slope with its prow resting in the water a little boat and in the boat oars but of the crocodile there was nothing to be seen  it is asleep somewhere whispered tua let us go away i do not like this stench  stench answered rames i smell nothing except the lilies on the water let us wake it up it would be silly to go now surely you are not afraid o star  oh no i am not afraid answered tua proudly only wake it up quickly please  what rames did not add was that it would be impossible to retreat as the door had closed behind them and there was no keyhole on its inner side  so they walked round the tank but wherever it might lurk the sleeping crocodile refused to wake  let us get into the boat and look for it suggested rames perhaps it is hiding on the island  so he led her to the stone slope where to her horror tua saw the remains of the crocodiles last meal a sight that caused her to forget her doubts and jump into the boat very quickly then rames gave it a push and sprang in after her so that they found themselves floating on the water now standing in the bow the boy took an oar and paddled round the island but still there were no signs of the crocodile  i dont believe it is here at all he said recovering his courage  you might try the pigeon suggested tua who now that there was less smell felt her curiosity returning  this was a good thought upon which rames acted at once taking the dead bird from the bag he spread out its wings to make it look as though it were alive and threw it into the water exclaiming arise o holy crocodile  then with fearful suddenness whence they knew not that crocodile arose an awful scaly head appeared with dull eyes and countless flashing fangs and behind the head cubit upon cubit of monstrous form the fangs closed upon the pigeon and everything vanished  that was the holy crocodile said rames abstractedly as he stared at the boiling waters which has lived here during the reigns of eight pharaohs and perhaps longer now we have seen it  yes answered tua and i never want to see it again get me away quick or i will tell your father  thus adjured the boy nothing loth seized his oar when suddenly the ancient crocodile having swallowed the dove thrust up its snout immediately beneath them and began to follow the boat now tua screamed aloud and said something about her ka  tell it to keep off the crocodile shouted rames as he worked the oar furiously nothing can hurt a ka  but the crocodile would not be kept off on the contrary it thrust its grey snout and one of its claws over the stern of the boat in such a fashion that rames could no longer work the oar dragging it almost under water and snapped with its horrible jaws  oh it is coming in we are going to be eaten cried tua  at that moment the boat touched the landingplace and swung round so that its bow where tua was struck the head of the crocodile which seemed to infuriate the beast at least it hurled itself upon the boat causing the fore part to heel over fill with water and begin to sink then the little lad rames showed the courage that was in him shouting to tua  get on shore get on shore he plunged past her and smote the huge reptile upon the head with the blade of his oar it opened its hideous mouth and he thrust the oar into it and held on  leave go cried tua as she scrambled to land  but rames would not leave go for in his brave little heart he thought that if he did the crocodile would follow tua and eat her so he clung to the handle till it was wrenched from him indeed he did more for seeing that the crocodile had bitten the wooden blade in two and having dropped it was still advancing towards the slope where it was accustomed to be fed he leapt into the water and struck it in the eye with his little fist feeling the pain of the blow the monster snapped at him and catching him by the hand began to sink back into deep water dragging the lad after it  rames said nothing but tua who already was at the head of the stage looked round and saw the agony on his face  help me amen she cried and flying back grasped rames by his left arm just as he was falling over then set her heels in a crack of the rock and held on for one moment she was dragged forward till she thought that she must fall upon her face and be drowned or eaten with rames but the next something yielded and she and the boy tumbled in a heap upon the stones they rose and staggered together to the terrace as they went tua saw that rames was looking at his right hand curiously also that it was covered with blood and that the little finger was torn off it then she remembered nothing further except a sound of shouts and of heavy hammering at the copper door  when she recovered it was to find herself in the house of mermes with the lady asti bending over her and weeping  why do you weep nurse she asked seeing that i am safe  i weep for my son princess she answered between her sobs  is he dead of his wounds then asti  no o morning star he lies sick in his chamber but soon pharaoh will kill him because he led her who will be queen of egypt into great danger of her life  not so said tua springing up for he saved my life  as she spoke the door opened and in came pharaoh himself who had been summoned hastily from the palace his face was white and he shook with fear for it had been reported to him that his only child was drowned when he saw that she lived and was not even hurt he could not contain his joy but casting his arms about her sank to his knees giving thanks to the gods and the guardian spirits she kissed him and studying his face with her wise eyes asked why he was so much afraid  because i thought you had been killed my daughter  why did you think that o my father seeing that the great god amen before i was born promised to protect me always though it is true that had it not been for rames  now at the mention of this name pharaoh was filled with rage  speak not of that wicked lad he exclaimed now or ever more for he shall be scourged till he dies  my father answered tua springing up forget those words for if rames dies i will die also it is i who am to blame not he for my ka warned me not to look upon the beast but to rames no ka spoke moreover when that evil god would have eaten me it was rames who fought with it and offered himself to its jaws in my place listen my father while i tell you all the story  so pharaoh listened and when it was done he sent for rames presently the boy was carried in for he had lost so much blood that he could not walk and was placed upon a stool before him  slay me now o pharaoh he said in a weak voice for i have sinned moreover i shall die happy since my spirit gave me strength to beat off the evil beast from the princess whom i led into trouble  truly you have done wickedly said pharaoh shaking his head at him and therefore perhaps you will lose your hand and even your life yet child you have a royal heart who first saved your playmate and then even in my presence take all the blame upon yourself therefore i forgive you son of mermes moreover i see that i was wise not to listen to those who counselled that you should be put away at birth and bending over the boy pharaoh kissed him on the brow  also he gave orders that the greatest physicians in the land should attend upon him and purge the poison of the crocodiles teeth from his body and when he recoveredwhich save for the loss of the little finger of his right hand he did completelyhe sent him a sword with a handle of gold fashioned to the shape of a crocodile in place of the knife which he had paid away for the pigeon bidding him use it bravely all his life in defence of her who would be his queen further although he was still so young he gave to him the high title of count in earnest of his love and favour and with it a name that meant defender of the royal lady  after he had gone asti the prophetess looked at the sword which pharaoh had given to her son  i see royal blood on it she said and handed it back to rames    but rames and tua were no more allowed to play together alone for always after this the princess was accompanied by women of honour and an armed guard also within a year or two the boy was placed in charge of a general to be brought up as a soldier a trade that he liked well enough so that from this time forward he and netertua met but seldom still there was a bond between them which could not be broken by absence for already they loved each other and every night and morning when tua made her petitions to amen after praying for pharaoh her father and for the spirit of her royal mother ahura she prayed for rames and that they might meet soon for the months when her eyes did not fall upon his face were wearisome to tua    chapter iv  the summoning of amen  the years went by and the princess netertua who was called morning star of amen came at length to womanhood and went through the ceremonies of purification in all egypt there was no maiden so wise and spirited or so lovely tall and slender was her shape blue as the sea were her eyes rosy like the dawn were her cheeks and when she did not wear it in a net of gold her black and curling hair fell almost to her waist also she was very learned for priests and priestesses taught her all things that she ought to know together with the arts of playing on the harp and of singing and dancing while her own excellent spirit that ka which amen had given her instructed her in a deeper wisdom which she gathered unconsciously in sleep and waking dreams as the slumbering earth gathers dew at night  moreover her father the wise old pharaoh opened to her the craft of statesmanship by help of which she might govern men and overthrow her enemies indeed he did more for when her education was finished he joined her with him in the government of egypt saying  i who always lacked bodily strength grow aged and feeble this mighty crown is too heavy for me to bear alone daughter you must share its weight  so the young netertua became a queen and great was the ceremony of her coronation the high priests and priestesses clothed in the robes and symbols of their gods and goddesses addressed speeches to her and blessed her in their names giving her every good gift and promising to her eternal life princes and nobles made her offerings foreign chiefs and kings bowed before her by their ambassadors the counts and headmen of the two lands swore allegiance to her and finally in the presence of all the court pharaoh himself set the double crown upon her brow and gave her her thronenames of glorious in ra and hathor strong in beauty  so for a while tua sat splendid on her golden seat while the people adored her but in that triumphant hour her eyes searched for one face only that of the tall and gallant captain rames her fosterbrother and for a moment rested there content yes their eyes met those of the newcrowned empress on her throne and of the youthful noble in the throng below short was the greeting for next instant she looked away yet more full of meaning than whole days of speech  the queen does not forget what the child remembered the goddess is still a woman it seemed to say and so sweet was that message that rames staggered from the court like one stricken by the sun    night came at last and having dismissed her secretaries scribes and tirewomen the weary girl now clad in simple white sat in her chamber alone she thought of all the splendours through which she had passed she thought of the glories of her imperial state of the power that she wielded and of the proud future which stretched before her feet but most of all she thought of the face of the young count rames the playmate of her childhood the man she loved and wondered ah how she wondered if with all her power she could ever draw him to her side if not of what use was this rule over millions this dominion of her world they called her a goddess and in truth at times she believed that she was halfdivine but if so why did her heart ache like that of any common maid  moreover was she really set above the misfortunes of her race could a throne however bright with gold lift her above the sorrows of human kind she desired to learn the truth the very truth her mind was urgent it drove her on to search out things to come to stand face to face with them even if they were evil well she believed she had the strength although as yet she had never called it to her aid  also this thing could not be done alone tua thought a while then going to the door of her chamber she bade a woman who waited without summon to her the lady asti priestess of amen interpreter of heaven presently asti came for now as always she was in attendance upon the newcrowned queen a tall and noblelooking woman with finecut features and black hair that although she was fifty years of age still showed no trace of grey  i was in the sanctuary when your majesty summoned me she said pointing to the sacred robe she wore let your majesty pardon me therefore if i have been long in coming and she bowed low before her  but the queen lifted her up and kissed her saying  i am weary of those high titles whereof i have heard more than enough today call me tua o my mother for so you have ever been to me from whose breast i drew the milk of life  what ails you my child asked asti was the crown too heavy for this young head of yours she added stretching out her delicate hand and stroking the black and curling hair  aye mother the weight of it seemed to crush me with its gems and gold i am weary and yet i cannot sleep tell me why did pharaoh summon that council after the feast mermes was one of them so you must know and why was not i who henceforth rule with pharaoh present with him  would you learn said asti with a little smile well as queen you have the right it was because they discussed the matter of your marriage  for a moment a light shone upon tuas face then she asked anxiously  my marriage and with whom  oh many names were mentioned child since she who rules egypt does not lack for suitors  tell me them quick asti  so she told them there were seven in all the prince of kesh the sons of foreign kings great nobles and a general of the army who claimed descent from a former pharaoh  as each name fell from astis lips tua waved her hand saying scornful words such as i know him not too old fat and hideous a foreign dog who spits upon our gods and so forth adding at last  go on  that is all lady no other name was mentioned and the council adjourned to consider these  no other name  do you then miss one perchance tua  she made no answer only her lips seemed to shape themselves to a certain sound that they did not utter the two women looked each other in the eyes then asti shook her head  it may not be she whispered for many reasons and amongst them that by the solemn decree of long ago whereof i have told you our blood is barred for ever from the throne none would dare to break it not even the pharaoh himself you would bring my son to his death tua which such another look as you gave him in yonder hall would surely do  no she answered slowly i would not bring him to his death but to life and honour andlove and one day i shall be pharaoh only asti if you betray me to him i swear that i will bring you to your death although you are so dear  i shall not betray you answered the priestess smiling again in truth most beautiful i do not think there is any need even if i would say now why did a certain captain turn faint and leave the hall today when your eyes chanced to fall on him  the heat suggested tua colouring  yes it was hot but he is stronger than most men and had borne it longlike others still there are fires  because he was afraid of my majesty broke in tua hurriedly you know i looked very royal there mother  yes doubtless fear moved himor some other passion yet beloved put that thought from your heart as i do when you are pharaoh you will learn that a monarch is a slave to the people and to the law breathe but his name in love and never will you see him more till you meet before osiris  tua hid her eyes in her hands for a moment then she glanced up and there was another look upon her face a strange new look  when i am pharaoh she answered there are certain matters in which i will be my own law and if the people do not like it they may find another pharaoh  asti started at her words and a light of joy shone in her deep eyes  truly your heart is high she said but oh if you love meand anotherbury that thought bury it deep or he will never live to see you placed alone upon the golden seat know lady that already from hour to hour i fear for himlest he should drink a poisoned cup lest at night he should chance to stumble against a spear lest an arrowshot in sportshould fall against his throat and none know whence it came  tua clenched her hands  if so there should be such vengeance as egypt has not heard of since mena ruled  of what use is vengeance child when the heart is empty and the tomb is sealed  again tua thought then she said  there are other gods besides osiris now what do men call me mother nay not my royal names  they call you morning star of amen they call you daughter of amen  is that story true asti the magician  aye at least your mother dreamed the dream for she told it to me and i have read its record who am a priestess of amen  then this high god should love me should he not he should hear my prayers and give me powerhe should protect those who are dear to me mother they say that you the mistress of secret things can open the ears of the gods and cause their mouths to speak mother i command you as your queen call up my father amen before me so that i may talk with him for i have words to which he must listen  are you not afraid asked asti looking at her curiously he is the greatest of all the gods and to summon him lightly is a sacrilege  should a daughter fear her father answered tua  when the divine queen your mother and pharaoh knelt before him in his shrine praying that a child might be given to them amen did not deign to appear to them save afterwards in a dream will you dare more than they lie down and dream o star of the morning  nay i trust no dreams which change like summer clouds and pass as soon answered the girl boldly if the god is my father in the spirit or the flesh i know not which let him appear before me face to face i ask his wisdom for myself and his favour for another call him if you have the power asti call him even if he slay me better that i should die than  hush said asti laying her hand upon her lips speak not that name well i have some skill and for your sakeand anothersi will try but not here perchance he may listen perchance not or perchance if he comes you and i must pay the price put on your robes now o queen and over them this veil and follow meif you dare    along narrow passages they crept and down many a secretstair till at length they came to a door at the foot of a long slope of rock this door asti unlocked and thrust open then when they had entered relocked it behind them  what is this place whispered tua  the burial crypt of the high priestesses of amen where it is said that the god watches none have entered it for hard on thirty years see here in the dust run the footsteps of those who bore the last priestess to her rest  she held up her lamp and by the light of it tua saw that they were in a great cave painted with figures of the gods which had on either side of it recesses in each of these was set a coffin with a gilded face and behind it an alabaster statue of her who lay therein and in front of it a table of offerings at the head of the crypt stood a small altar of black stone for the rest the place was empty  asti led tua to a step in front of the altar and bidding her kneel departed with the lamp which she hid away in some side chapel so that now the darkness was intense presently through the utter silence tua heard her creep back towards her for although she walked so softly the dust seemed to cry beneath her feet and her every footstep echoed round the vaulted walls moreover a glow came from her the glow of her life in that place of death she passed tua and knelt by the altar and the echo of her movements died away only it seemed to tua that from each of the tombs to the right and to the left rose the ka of her who was buried there and drew near to watch and listen she could not see them she could not hear them yet she knew that they were there and was able to count their numberthirty and two in allwhile within herself rose a picture of them each differing from the other but all white expectant solemn  now tua heard asti murmuring secret invocations that she did not understand in that place and silence they sounded weird and dreadful and as she hearkened to them for the first time fear crept over her kneeling there upon her knees she bent her head almost to the dust and put up prayers to amen that he might be pleased to hear her and to satisfy the longings of her heart she prayed and prayed till she grew faint and weary while always asti uttered her invocations but no answer came no deity appeared no voice spoke at length asti rose and coming to her whispered in her ear  let us depart ere the watching spirits whose rest we have broken grow wrath with us the god has shut his ears  so tua rose clinging to asti for now she knew not why her fear grew and deepened for a moment she stood upon her feet then sank to her knees again for there at the far end of the great tomb near to the door by which they had entered appeared a glow upon the darkness slowly it took form the form of a woman clad in the royal robes of egypt and bearing in its hand a sceptre the figure of light advanced towards them so that presently they saw its face tua did not know the face though it seemed to her to be like her own but asti knew it and at the sight sank to the ground  now the figure stood in front of them a thing of light framed in the thick darkness and now in a sweet low voice it spoke  hail queen of egypt it said hail netertua daughter of amen art thou afraid to look on the spirit of her who bore thee thou that didst dare to summon the father of the gods to do thy bidding  i am afraid answered tua shaking in all her limbs  and thou asti the magician art thou afraid also who but now wast bold enough to cry to amenracome from thy high heaven and make answer  it is even so o queen ahura murmured asti  woman went on the voice thy sin is great and great is the sin of this royal one at thy side had amen hearkened how would the two of you have stood before his glory who at the sight of this shape of mine that once was mortal like yourselves crouch choking to the earth i tell you both that had the god arisen as in your wickedness ye willed there where ye knelt there ye would have died but he who knows all is merciful and in his place has sent me his messenger that ye may live to look upon tomorrows sun  let amen pardon us gasped tua it was my sin o mother for i commanded asti and she obeyed me on me be the blame not on her for i am torn with doubts and fears for myself and for another i would know the future  why o queen netertua why wouldst thou know the future if hell yawns beneath thy feet why wouldst thou peep through its golden doors before the time the future is hid from mortals because could they pierce its veil it would crush them with its terrors if all the woes of life and death lay open the gaze who would dare to live and whooh who could dare to die  then woes await me o thou who wast my mother  how can it be otherwise light and darkness make the day joy and sorrow make the life thou art human be content  divine also o ahura if all tales be true  then pay for thy divinity in tears and be satisfied content is the guerdon of the beast but gods are wafted upwards on the wings of pain how can that gold be pure which has not known the fire  thou tellest me nothing wailed tua and it is not for myself i ask i am fair i am amens daughter and splendid is my heritage yet o dweller in osiris thou who once didst fill the place i hold today i tell thee that i would pay away this pomp could i but be sure that i shall not live loveless that i shall not be given as a chattel to one whom i hate that onewhom i do not hatewill live to call mewife great dangers threaten himand me amen is mighty he is the potter that moulds the clay of men if i be his child if his spirit is breathed into me oh let him help me now  let thine own faith help thee are not the words of amen which he spake concerning thee written down study them and ask no more love is an arrow that does not miss its mark it is the immortal fire from on high which winds and waters cannot quench therefore love on thou shalt not love in vain queen and daughter fare thee well awhile  nay nay one word immortal i thank thee thou messenger of the gods but when these troubles come upon meand another when the sea of dangers closes oer our heads when shame is near and i am lonely as well may chance then to whom shall i turn for succour  then thou hast one within thee who is strong to aid it was given to thee at thy birth o star of amen and asti can call it forth come hither thou asti and swiftly for i must be gone and first i would speak with thee  asti crept forward and the glowing shape in the royal robe bent over her so that the light of it shone upon her face it bent over her and seemed to whisper in her ear then it held out its hands towards tua as though in blessing and instantly was not    once more the two women stood in tuas chamber pale and shaken they looked into each others eyes  you have had your will queen said asti for if amen did not come he sent a messenger and a royal one  interpret me this vision answered tua for to me at any rate that spirit said little  nay it said much it said that love fails not of its reward and what more went you out to seek  then i am glad exclaimed tua joyfully  be not too glad queen for tonight we have sinned both of us who dared to summon amen from his throne and sin also fails not of its reward blood is the price of that oracle  whose blood asti ours  nay worse that of those who are dear to us troubles arise in egypt queen  you will not leave me when they break asti  i may not if i would the fates have bound us together till the end and that i think is far away i am yours as once you were mine when you lay upon my breast but bid me no more to summon amen from his throne    chapter v  how rames fought the prince of kesh  now for a whole moon there were great festivals in thebes and in all of these netertua glorious in ra hathor strong in beauty morning star of amen must take her part as newcrowned queen of egypt feast followed feast and at each of them one of the suitors of her hand was the guest of honour  then after it was done pharaoh her father and his councillors would wait upon her and ask if this man was pleasing to her being wise tua would give no direct answer only of most of them she was rid in this way  she demanded that the writing of the dream of her mother ahura should be brought and read before her and when it had been read she pointed out that amen promised to her a royal lover and that these chiefs and generals were not royal therefore it was not of them that amen spoke nor did she dare to turn her eyes on one whom the god had forbidden to her  of others who declared that they were kings but who being unable to leave their countries were represented by ambassadors she said that not having seen them she could say nothing when they appeared at the court of egypt she would consider them  so at length only one suitor was left the man whom she knew well pharaoh and his councillors desired that she should take as husband this was amathel the prince of kesh whose father an aged king ruled at napata a great city far to the south situated in a land that was called an island because the river nile embraced it in its two arms it was said that after egypt this country was the richest in the whole world for there gold was so plentiful that men thought it of less value than copper and iron also there were mines in which beautiful stones were found and the soil grew corn in abundance  moreover once in the far past a race of pharaohs sprung from this city of napata had sat on the throne of egypt until at length the people of egypt headed by the priests had risen and overthrown them because they were foreigners and had introduced nubian customs into the land therefore it was decreed by an unalterable law that none of their race should ever again wear the double crown of the descendants of these pharaohs rames tuas playmate was the last lawful child  but although the egyptians had cast them down at heart they always grieved over the rich territory of napata which was lost to them for when those pharaohs fell kesh declared itself independent and set up another dynasty to rule over it of which dynasty amathel prince of kesh was the heir  therefore they hoped that it might come back to them by marriage between amathel and the young queen netertua ever since she was born the great lords and councillors of egypt yes and pharaoh himself seeing that he had no son to whom he might marry her after the fashion of the country had been working to this end it was by secret treaty that the prince amathel was present at the crowning of the queen of whose hand he had been assured on the sole condition that he came to dwell with her at thebes it is true that there were other suitors but these as all of them knew well were but pawns in a game played to amuse the people  the king destined to take the great queen captive was amathel and no other tua knew it for had not asti told her and was it not because of her fear of this man and her love for rames that she had dared to commit the sacrilege of attempting to summon amen from the skies still as yet the pharaoh had not spoken to her of amathel nor had she met him it was said that he had been present at her crowning in disguise for this proud prince gave out that were she ten times queen of egypt he would not pledge himself to wed as his royal wife one who was displeasing to him and that therefore he must see her before he pressed his suit  now that he had seen her in her loveliness and glory he announced that he was well satisfied which was but half the truth for in fact she had set all his southern blood on fire and there was nothing that he desired more than to call her wife  on the night which had been appointed for amathel to meet his destined bride a feast had been prepared richer by far than any that went before tua feigning ignorance on entering the great unroofed hall lit with hundreds of torches down all its length and seeing the multitudes at the tables asked of the pharaoh her father who was the guest that he would welcome with such magnificence which seemed worthy of a god rather than of a man  my daughter answered the old monarch nervously it is none other than the prince of kesh who in his own country they worship as divine as we are worshipped here in egypt and who in truth is or will be one of the greatest of kings  kesh she answered i thought that we claimed sovereignty over that land  once it was ours daughter said her father with a sigh or rather the kings of kesh were also kings of egypt but their dynasty fell before my greatgreatgrandfather was called to the throne and now but three of their blood are left mermes captain of the guard of amen asti the seer and priestess his wife your fostermother and waiting lady and the young count rames a soldier in our army who was your playmate and as you may remember saved you from the sacred crocodile  yes i remember said tua but then why is not mermes king of kesh  because the people of the city of napata raised up another house to rule over them of whom amathel is the heir  a usurping heir surely my father if there be anything in blood  say not that tua replied pharaoh sharply for then mermes should be pharaoh in our place also  tua made no reply only as they took their seats in the golden chairs at the head of the hall she asked carelessly  is this prince of kesh also a suitor for my hand o pharaoh  what else should he be my daughter did you not know it be gracious to him now since it is decreed that you shall take him as a husband hush answer not he comes  as he spoke a sound of wild music arose and at the far end of the great hall appeared a band of players gorgeously attired who blew horns made from small tusks of the elephant clashed brazen cymbals and beat gilded drums these advanced a little way up the hall and stood there playing while after them marched a bodyguard of twenty gigantic nubian soldiers who carried broadbladed spears with shields of hippopotamus hide curiously worked and were clothed in tunics and caps of leopardskin  next appeared the prince of kesh himself a short stout broadshouldered young man thickfeatured heavyfaced and having large rolling eyes he was clad in festal garments and hung about with heavy chains of gold fastened with clasps of glittering stones while from his crisp black hair rose a tall plume of nodding ostrich feathers fan bearers walked beside him and the train of his long cloak was borne by two black and hideous dwarfs fullgrown men but no taller than a child of eight  with one swift glance while he was yet far away tua studied the man from head to foot and hated him as she had never hated anyone before then she looked over his head as from her raised seat upon the dais she was able to do and saw that behind him came a second guard of picked egyptian soldiers and that in command of them simply clad in his scaled armour of bronze and wearing upon his thigh the goldenhandled sword that pharaoh had given him was none other than the young count rames her playmate and fosterbrother the man whom her heart loved at the sight of his tall and noble form and finecut face rising above the coarse squat figure of the ethiopian prince tua blushed rosy red but pharaoh noting it only thought as others did that it was because now for the first time her eyes fell upon him who would be her husband  why tua wondered was rames chosen to attend upon the prince amathel at once the answer rose in her mind doubtless it had been done to gratify the pride of amathel not by pharaoh who would know nothing of such matters but by some bribed councillor or steward of the household rames was of more ancient blood than amathel and by right should be the king of kesh as he should also be pharaoh of egypt therefore to humble him he was set to wait upon amathel  moreover it was guessed that the young queen looked kindly upon this count rames with whom she had been nursed and who like herself was beautiful to behold therefore to abase him in her eyes he had been commanded to appear walking in the train of amathel and given charge over his sacred person at the feast  in a moment tua understood it all and made a vow before her father amen that soon or late those who had planned this outrage should pay its price nor did she forget that promise in the after days  now the prince had mounted the dais and was bowing low to pharaoh and to her and they must rise and bow in answer then pharaoh welcomed him to egypt in few wellchosen words giving him all his titles and speaking meaningly of the ancient ties which had linked their kingdoms ties which he prayed might yet draw them close again  he ceased and looked at tua who as queen had also a speech to deliver that had been given to her in writing although she remembered this well enough for the roll lay beside her never a word would she read but turned round and bade one of her waitingladies bring her a fan  so after a pause that seemed somewhat long amathel delivered his answer that was learned by rote for it replied to gentle words from the lips of the divine queen that made his heart to flower like the desert after rain not one of which had she spoken thereon tua looking over the top of her fan saw rames smile grimly while unable to restrain themselves some of the great personages at the feast broke out laughing and bowed down their heads to hide their merriment  with an angry scowl the prince turned and commanded that the gifts should be brought now slaves advanced bearing cups of worked gold elephants and other beasts fashioned in gold and golden vases full of incense which he presented to pharaoh on behalf of his father the king of kesh and himself saying boastfully that in his country such things were common and that he would have brought more of them had it not been for their weight  when pharaoh had thanked him answering gently that egypt too was not poor as he hoped that he would find upon the morrow the prince on his own behalf alone offered to the queen other presents among them pectorals and necklaces without price fashioned of amethysts and sapphires also because she was known to be the first of musicians and the sweetestvoiced lady in the landfor these were the greatest of the gifts that tua had from amenhe gave to her a wonderfully worked harp of ivory with golden strings the frame of the harp being fashioned to the shape of a woman and two black female slaves laden with ornaments who were said to be the best singers in the southern land  now pharaoh whispered to tua to put on one of the necklaces but she would not saying that the colour of the stones did not match her white robe and the blue lotus flowers which she wore instead she thanked amathel coldly but courteously and without looking at his gifts told the royal nurse asti who stood behind her to bear them away and to place them at a distance as the perfumes that had been poured over them oppressed her only as though by an afterthought she bade them leave the ivory harp  thus inauspiciously enough the feast began at it amathel drank much of the sweet wine of asi or cyprus commanding rames who stood behind him to fill his cup again and again though whether he did this because he was nearest to him or to lower him to the rank of a butler tua did not know at least having no choice rames obeyed though cupfilling was no fitting task for a count of egypt and an officer of pharaohs guard  when the waiting women clad in net worked with spangles of gold had borne away the meats conjurers appeared who did wonderful feats amongst other things causing a likeness of queen netertua wearing her royal robes and having a star upon her brow to arise out of a vase  then as they had arranged they strove to do the same for the prince amathel but asti who had more magic than all of them watching behind tuas chair put out her strength and threw a spell upon them  behold instead of the form of the prince which these conjurers summoned loudly and by name there appeared out of the vase a monkey wearing a crown and feathers that yet resembled him somewhat which black and hideous ape stood there for a while seeming to gibber at them then fell down and vanished away  now some of the audience laughed and some were silent but pharaoh not knowing whether this were a plot or an evil omen from the gods frowned and looked anxiously at his guest as it chanced however the prince fired with wine was so engaged in staring at the loveliness of tua that he took no note of the thing while the queen looked upwards and seemed to see nothing as for the conjurers they fled from the hall fearing for their lives and wondering what strong spirit had entered into the vase and spoilt the trick which they had prepared  as they went singers and dancing women hurriedly took their place till tua wearying of the stare of amathel waved her hand and said that she wished to hear those two nubian slaves whose voices were said to be so wonderful so they were brought forward with their harps and having prostrated themselves began to play and sing very sweetly nubian songs melancholy and wild whereof few could understand the meaning so well did they sing indeed that when they had done netertua said  you have pleased me much and in payment i give you a royal gift i give you your freedom and appoint that henceforth you shall sing before the court if you think fit to stay here not as slaves but for hire  then the two women prostrated themselves again before her majesty and blessed her for they knew that they could earn wealth by their gift and the rich courtiers taking the queens cue flung rings and ornaments to them so that in a minute they got more gold than ever they had dreamed of who were but kidnapped slaves but prince amathel grew angry and said  some might have been pleased to keep the priceless gift of the best singers in the world  do you say that these sweetvoiced women are the best singers in the world o prince asked tua speaking to him for the first time now if you will be pleased to listen you provoke me to make trial of my own small skill that i may learn how far i fall short of the best singers in the world  then she lifted up the ivory harp with the strings of gold and swept her fingers over it trying its notes and adjusting them with the agate screws looking at amathel all the while with a challenge in her lovely eyes  nay nay my daughter said pharaoh it is scarcely fitting that a queen of egypt should sing before all this noble company  why not my father she asked tonight we all do honour to the heir of his majesty of kesh pharaoh receives him pharaohs daughter accepts his gifts the highest in the land surround him then she paused and added slowly one of blood more ancient than his own waits on him as cupbearer one whose race built up the throne his father fills and she pointed to rames who stood near by holding the vase of wine why then should not egypts queen seek to please our royal guest as best she maysince she has no other gift to give him  then in the dead silence which followed this bold speech whereof none could mistake the meaning netertua morning star of amen rose from her seat pressing the ivory harp against her young breast she bent over it her head crowned with the crown of upper egypt whereon glistened the royal uræus a snake about to strike and swept the welltuned strings  such magic was in her touch that instantly all else was forgotten even the pharaoh leaned back in his golden chair to listen softly she struck at first then by slow degrees ever louder till the music of the harp rang through the pillared hall now at length she lifted up her heavenly voice and began to sing in a strain so wild and sweet that it seemed to pierce to the watching stars  it was a sad and ancient lovetale that she sang which told how a priestess of hathor of high degree loved and was beloved by a simple scribe whom she might not wed it told how the scribe maddened by his passion crept at night into the very sanctuary of the temple hoping to find her there and for his sacrilege was slain by the angry goddess it told how the beautiful priestess coming alone to make prayer in the sanctuary for strength to resist her love stumbled over the lovers corpse and knowing it died of grief it told how hathor goddess of love melted by the piteous sight breathed back life into their nostrils and since they might not remain upon earth wafted them to the underworld where they awoke and embraced and dwell on for ever and for aye triumphant and rejoicing  all had heard this old old story but none had ever heard it so divinely sung as tuas pure and lovely voice floated over them the listeners seemed to see that lover daring all in his desire creep into the solemn sanctuary of the temple they saw hathor appear in her wrath and smite him cold in death they saw the beauteous priestess with her lamp and heard her wail her life away upon her darlings corpse saw too the dead borne by spirits over the borders of the world  then came that last burst of music thrilling and divine and its rich passionate notes seemed to open the heavens to their sight there in the deep sky they perceived the awakening of the lovers and their embrace of perfect joy and when a glory hid them heard the victorious chant of the priestess of love sighing itself away faint and ever fainter till at length its last distant echoes died in the utter silence of the place of souls  tua ceased her music resting her still quivering harp upon the board she sank back in her chair of state outworn trembling while in her pale face the blue eyes shone like stars there was stillness in the hall the spell of that magical voice lay on the listeners none applauded it seemed even that none dared to move for men remembered that this wonderful young queen was said to be daughter of amen master of the world and thought that it had been given to them to hearken not to a royal maiden but to a goddess of the skies  quiet they sat as though sleep had smitten them only every man of their number stared at the sweet pale face and at those radiant eyes drunk with passion and with wine amathel prince of kesh leaned his heavy head upon his hand and stared like the rest but those eyes did not stay on him had he been a stone they could not have noted him less they passed over him seeking something beyond  slowly he turned to see what it might be at which the morning star of amen gazed and perceived that the young captain who waited on him he who was said to be of a race more ancient and purer than his own he whose house had reigned in the southern land when his ancestors were but traffickers in gold was also gazing at this royal singer yes he bent forward to gaze as though a spell drew him a spell or the eyes of the queen and there was that upon his face which even a drunken nubian could not fail to understand  in the hands of rames was the tall golden vase of wine and as amathel thrust back his chair its topmost ivory bar struck the foot of the vase and tilted it so that the red wine poured in a torrent over the princes head and gorgeous robes staining him from his crest of plumes to his feet as though with blood up sprang the prince of kesh roaring with fury  dogdescended slave he shouted hogheaded brother of swine is it thus that you wait upon my royalty and with the cup in his hand he smote rames on the face then drew the sword at his side to kill him  but rames also wore a sword that sword hafted with the golden crocodile which pharaoh had given him long agothat sword which asti the foresighted had seen red with royal blood with a wild low cry he snatched it from its sheath and to avoid the blow that amathel struck at him before he could guard himself sprang backwards from the dais to the open space in the hall that had been left clear for the dancers after him leapt amathel calling him coward and next instant the pillars echoed not with tuas music but with the stern ringing of bronze upon bronze  now in their fear and amaze men looked up to pharaoh waiting his word but pharaoh overcome by the horror of the scene appeared to have swooned at least he lay back in his chair with his eyes shut like one asleep then they looked to the queen but tua made no sign only with parted lips and heaving breast watched watched and waited for the end  as for rames he forgot everything save that he a soldier and a noble of royal race had been struck across the mouth by a black nubian who called himself a prince his blood boiled up in him and through a red haze as it were he saw tuas glorious eyes beckoning him on to a victory he saw and sprang as springs the lion of the desert sprang straight at the throat of amathel the blow went high an ostrich plume floated to the groundno more and amathel was a sturdy fighter and had the strength of madness moreover his was the longer weapon it fell upon the scales of armour of rames and beat him back it fell again on his shoulder and struck him to his knee it fell a third time and glancing from the mail wounded him in the thigh so that the blood flowed now a soldier of pharaohs guard shouted to encourage his captain and the nubians shouted back crying to their prince to slit the hogs throat  then rames seemed to awake he leapt from his knees he smote and the blow went home though the iron which the nubian wore beneath his robe stayed it he smote again more fiercely and now it was the blood of amathel that flowed then bending almost to the ground before the answering stroke he leapt and thrust with all the strength of young limbs trained to war he thrust and behold between the broad shoulders of amathel pierced from breast to back appeared the point of the egyptians sword for a moment the prince stood still then he fell backwards heavily and lay dead  now with a shout of rage the giants of the nubian guard rushed at rames to avenge their masters death so that he must fly backwards before their spears backwards into the ranks of the pharaohs guard in a flash the nubians were on them also and how none could tell a fearful fray began for these soldiers hated each other as their fathers had done before them and there were none who could come between them since at this feast no man bore weapons save the guards fierce was the battle but the nubians lacked a captain while rames led veterans of thebes picked for their valour  the giants began to give here and there they fell till at length but three of them were left upon their feet who threw down their arms and cried for mercy then it was for the first time that rames understood what he had done with bent head his red sword in his hand he climbed the dais and knelt before the throne of pharaoh saying  i have avenged my honour and the honour of egypt slay me o pharaoh  but pharaoh made no answer for his swoon still held him  then rames turned to tua and said  pharaoh sleeps but in your hand is the sceptre slay me o queen  now tua who all this while had watched like one frozen into stone seemed to thaw to life again her danger was past she could never be forced to wed that coarse blacksouled nubian for rames had killed him yonder he lay dead in all his finery with his hideous giants about him like fallen trees and oh in her rebellious human heart she blessed rames for the deed  but as she who was trained in statecraft knew well enough if he had escaped the sword of prince amathel it was but to fall into a peril from which there seemed to be no escape this dead prince was the heir of a great king of a king so great that for a century egypt had dared to make no war upon his country for it was far away wellfortified and hard to come at across deserts and through savage tribes moreover the man had been slain at a feast in pharaohs court and by an officer of pharaohs guard which afterwards had killed his escort under the eyes of egypts monarchs the hand of one of whom he sought in marriage such a deed must mean a bitter war for egypt and to those who struck the blowdeath as rames himself knew well  tua looked at him kneeling before her and her heart ached fiercely despairingly she thought throwing her soul afar to seek out wisdom and a way of escape for rames presently in the blackness of her mind there arose a plan and as ever was her fashion she acted swiftly lifting her head she commanded that the doors should be locked and guarded so that none might go in or out and that those physicians who were amongst the company should attend to the wounded and to pharaoh who was ill then she called the high council of the kingdom all of whom were gathered there about her and spoke in a cold calm voice while the company flocked round to listen  lords and people she said the gods for their own purposes have suffered a fearful thing to come to pass egypts guest and his guard have been slain before egypts kings yes at their feast and in their very presence and it will be said far and wide that this has been done by treachery yet you know well as i do that it was no treachery but a mischance the divine prince who is dead as all of you saw grew drunken after the fashion of his people and in his drunkenness he struck a highborn man a count of egypt and an officer of pharaoh who to do him greater honour was set to wait upon him calling him by vile names and drew his sword upon him to kill him am i right did you see and hear these things  aye answered the council and the audience  then went on tua this officer forgetting all save his outraged honour dared to fight for his life even against the prince of kesh and being the better man slew him afterwards the servants of the prince of kesh attacked him and pharaohs guard and were conquered and the most of them killed since none here had arms wherewith to part them have i spoken truth  yea o queen they answered again by their spokesman rames and the royal guard have little blame in the matter and from the rest of them rose a murmur of assent  now went on tua with gathering confidence for she felt that all saw with her eyes to add to our woes pharaoh my father has been smitten by the gods he sleeps he cannot speak i know not whether he will live or die and therefore it would seem that i the dulycrowned queen of egypt must act for him as was provided in such a case since the matter is very urgent and may not be delayed is it your will she added addressing the council that i should so act as the gods may show me how to do  it is right and fitting answered the vizier the kings companion on behalf of all of them  then priests lords and people continued the queen what course shall we take in this sore strait speaking with the voice of all of you and on your behalf i can command that the count rames and all those other chosen men whom pharaoh loves who fought with him shall be slain forthwith this indeed she added slowly i should wish to do since although rames had suffered intolerable insult such as no highborn man can be asked to bear even from a prince and he and all of them were but fighting to save their lives and to show the nubians that we are not cowards here in egypt without doubt they have conquered and slain the heir of kesh and his black giants who were our guests and for this deed their lives are forfeit  she paused watching while although here and there a voice answered yes or they must die from the rest arose a murmur of dissent for in their hearts the company were on the side of rames and pharaohs guards moreover they were proud of the young captains skill and courage and glad that the nubians whom they hated with an ancient hate had been defeated by the lesser men of egypt some of whom were their friends or relatives  now while they argued among themselves tua rose from her chair and went to look at pharaoh whom the physicians were attending chafing his hands and pouring water on his brow presently she returned with tears standing in her beautiful eyes for she loved her father and said in a heavy voice  alas pharaoh is very ill set the evil has smitten him and it is hard my people that he perchance may be taken from us and we must bear such woe because of the ill behaviour of a royal foreigner for i cannot forget that it was he who caused this tumult  the audience agreed that it was very hard and looked angrily at the surviving nubians but tua conquering herself continued  we must bear the blows that the fates rain on us nor suffer our private grief to dull the sword of justice now as i have said even though we love them as our brothers or our husbands yet the count rames and his brave comrades should perish by a death of shame such a death as little befits the flower of pharaohs guard  again she paused then went on in the midst of an intense silence for even the physicians ceased from their work to hearken to her decree as supreme judge of egypt  and yet and yet my people even as i was about to pass sentence upon them uttering the doom that may not be recalled some guardian spirit of our land sent a thought into my heart on which i think it right to take your judgment if we destroy these men as i desire to destroy them will they not say in the southern country and in all the nations around that first they had been told to murder the prince of kesh and his escort and then were themselves executed to cover up our crime will it not be believed that there is blood upon the hands of pharaoh and of egypt the blood of a royal guest who it is well known was welcomed here with love and joy that he mightoh forgive me i am but a maiden i cannot say it nay pity me not and answer not till i have set out all the case as best i may which i fear me is but ill it is certain that this will be saidaye and believed and we of egypt all called traitors and that these men who after all however evil has been their deed are brave and upright will be written in all the books of all the lands as common murderers and go down to osiris with that ill name branded on their brows yes and their shame will cling to the pure hands of pharaoh and his councillors  now at this picture the people murmured and some of the noble women there began to weep outright  but proceeded tua with her pleading voice how if we were to take another course how if we commanded this count rames and his companions to journey with an escort such as befits the majesty of pharaoh to the far city of napata and there to lay before the great king of that land by writings and the mouths of witnesses all the sad story of the death of his only son how if we sent letters to this majesty of kesh saying thou hast heard our tale thou knowest all our woe now judge if thou art noblehearted and it pleases thee to acquit these men acquit them and we will praise thee but if thou art wroth and stern and it pleases thee to condemn these men condemn them and send them back to us for punishment that punishment which thou dost decree is that plan good my people can his majesty of kesh complain if he is made judge in his own cause can the kings and captains of other lands then declare that in egypt we work murder on our guests tell me who have so little wisdom if this plan is good as i dare to say to you it seems to me  now with one voice the council and all the guests and especially the guards themselves who were on their trial save rames who still knelt in silence before the queen cried out that it was very good yes they clapped their hands and shouted vowing to each other that this young queen of theirs was the spirit of wisdom come to earth and that her excellent person was filled with the soul of a god  but she frowned at their praises and holding up her sceptre sternly commanded silence  such is your decree o my council she cried and the decree of all you here present who are the noblest of my people and i as i am bound by my oath of crowning proclaim and ratify it i netertua who am named star and daughter of amen who am named glorious in ra who am named hathor strong in beauty who am crowned queen of the upper and the lower land i proclaimwrite it down o scribes and let it be registered this night that the decree may stand while the world enduresthat two thousand of the choicest troops of egypt shall sail up nile forthwith for kesh and that in command of them so that all may know his crime shall go the young count rames and with him those others who also did the deed of blood  now at this announcement which sounded more like promotion than disgrace some started and rames looked up quivering in all his limbs  i proclaim went on tua quickly that when they are come to napata they shall kneel before its king and submit themselves to the judgment of his majesty and having been judged shall return and report to us the judgment of his majesty that it may be carried out as his majesty of kesh shall appoint let the troops and the ships be made ready this very night and meanwhile save when he appears before us to take his orders as general in token of our wrath we banish the count rames from our court and presence and place his companions under guard  so spoke tua and the royal decree having been written down swiftly and read aloud she sealed and signed with her signmanual as queen that it might not be changed or altered and commanded that copies of it should be sent to all the governors of the nomes of egypt and a duplicate prepared and despatched with this royal embassy for so she named it to be delivered to the king of kesh with the letters of condolence and the presents of ceremony and the body of amathel the prince of kesh now divine in osiris  then at length the doors were thrown open and the company dispersed rames and the guard being led away by the council and placed in safe keeping also pharaoh still senseless but breathing quietly was carried to his bed and the dead were taken to the embalmers whilst tua so weary that she could scarcely walk departed to her chambers leaning on the shoulder of the royal nurse asti the mother of rames    chapter vi  the oath of rames and of tua  still robed tua lay upon a couch for she would not seek her bed while asti stood near to her a dark commanding figure  your majesty has done strange things tonight said asti in her quiet voice  tua turned her head and looked at her then answered  very strange nurse you see the gods and that troublesome son of yours and pharaohs sudden sickness threw the strings of fate into my hand andi pulled them i always had a fancy for the pulling of strings but the chance never came my way before  it seems to me that for a beginner your majesty pulled somewhat hard said asti drily  yes nurse so hard that i think i have pulled your son off the scaffold into a place of some honour if he knows how to stay there though it was the council and the lords and the ladies who thought that they pulled you see one must commence as one means to go on  your majesty is very clever you will make a great queenif you do not overpull yourself  not half so clever as you were asti when you made that monkey come out of the vase answered tua laughing somewhat hysterically oh do not look innocent i know it was your magic for i could feel it passing over my head how did you do it asti  if your majesty will tell me how you made the lords of egypt consent to the sending of an armed expedition to napata under the command of a lad a mere captain who had just killed its heirapparent before their eyes which decree if i know anything of rames will mean a war between kesh and egypt i will tell you how i made the monkey come out of the vase  then i shall never learn nurse for i cant because i dont know it came into my mind as music comes into my throat that is all rames should have been beheaded at once shouldnt he for not letting that black boar tusk him do you think he poured the wine over amathels head on purpose and again she laughed  yes i suppose that he should have been killed as he would have been if your majesty had not chanced to be so fond  talking of wine broke in tua give me a cup of it the divine prince of kesh who was to have been my husbanddid you understand asti that they really meant to make that black barbarian my husbandi say that the divine prince who now sups with osiris drank so much that i could not touch a drop and i am tired and thirsty and have still some things to do tonight  asti went to a table where stood a flagon of wine wreathed in vine leaves and by it cups of glass and filling one of them brought it to tua  heres to the memory of the divine prince and may he have left the table of osiris before i come there and heres to the hand that sent him thither said tua recklessly then she drained the wine every drop of it and threw the cup to the marble floor where it shattered into bits  what god has entered into your majesty tonight asked asti quietly  one that knows his own mind i think replied tua there i feel strong again i go to visit pharaoh come with me asti  when tua arrived at the bedside of pharaoh she found that the worst of the danger was over fearing for his life the physicians had bled him and now the fit had passed away and his eyes were open although he was unable to speak and did not know her or anyone she asked whether he would live or die and was told that he would live or so his doctors believed but that for a long while he must lie quite quiet seeing as few people as possible and above all being troubled with no business since if he were wearied or excited the fit would certainly return and kill him so rejoicing at this news which was better than she had expected tua kissed her father and left him  now will your majesty go to bed asked asti when she had returned to her own apartments  by no means answered tua i wear pharaohs shoes and have much business left to do tonight summon mermes your husband  so mermes came and stood before her he was still what he had been in the old days when tua played as an infant in his house stern noblelooking and of few words but now his hair had grown white and his face was drawn with grief both for the sake of rames whose hot blood had brought him into so much danger and because pharaoh who was his friend lay between life and death  tua looked at him and loved him more than ever for now that he was troubled some new likeness to rames appeared upon his face which she had never seen before  take heart noble mermes she said gently they say that pharaoh stays with us yet a while  i thank amen he answered for had he died his blood would have been upon the hands of my house  not so mermes it would have been upon the hands of the gods you spring from a royal line say what would you have thought of your son if after being struck by that fat nubian he had cowered at his feet and prayed for his life like any slave  mermes flushed and smiled a little then said  the question is ratherwhat would you have thought o queen  i answered tua well as a queen i should have praised him much since then egypt would have been spared great trouble but as a woman and a friend i should never have spoken to him again honour is more than life mermes  certainly honour is more than life replied mermes staring at the ceiling perhaps to hide the look upon his face and for a little while rames seems to be in the way of it but those who are set high have far to fall o queen andforgive mehe is my only child now when pharaoh recovers  rames will be far away broke in tua go bring him here at once and with him the vizier and the chief scribe of the council take this ring it will open all doors and she drew the signet from her finger and handed it to him  at this hour your majesty said mermes in a doubtful voice  have i not spoken she answered impatiently when the welfare of egypt is at stake i do not sleep  so mermes bowed and went and while he was gone tua caused asti to smooth her hair and change her robe and ornaments for others which although she did not say so she thought became her better then she sat her down in a chair of state in her chamber of audience and waited while asti stood beside her asking no questions but wondering  at length the doors were opened and through them appeared mermes and the vizier and the chief of the scribes both of them trying to hide their yawns for they had been summoned from their beds who were not wont to do state business at such hours after them limped rames for his wound had grown stiff who looked bewildered but otherwise just as he had left the feast  now without waiting for the greetings of ceremony tua began to question the vizier as to what steps had been taken in furtherance of her decrees and when he assured her that the business was on foot went into its every detail with him as to the ships and the officers and the provisioning of the men and so forth next she set herself to dictate despatches to the captains and barons who held the fortresses on the upper nile communicating to them pharaohs orders on this matter and the commission of rames whereby he whose hands had done the ill was put in command of the great embassy that went to make amends  these being finished she sent away the scribe to spend the rest of the night in writing them in duplicate bidding him bring them to her in the early morning to be sealed next addressing rames she commanded him to start on the morrow with those troops which were ready to takensit above the first cataract of the nile which was the frontier fortress of egypt and there wait until the remainder of the soldiers joined them bearing with them her presents to the king of kesh and the embalmed body of the prince amathel  rames bowed and said that her orders should be obeyed and the audience being finished still bowing and supported by mermes began to walk backwards towards the door his eyes fixed upon the face of tua who sat with bent head clasping the arms of her chair like one in difficulty and doubt when he had gone a few steps she seemed to come to some determination for with an effort she raised herself and said  return count rames i have a message to give you for the king of kesh who unhappy man has lost his son and heir and it is one that no other ears must hear leave me a while with this captain o mermes and asti and see that none listen to our talk presently i will summon you to conduct him away  they hesitated for this thing seemed strange then noting the look she gave them departed through the doors behind the royal seat  now rames and the queen were left alone in that great lighted chamber with bent head and folded arms he stood before her while she looked at him intently yet seemed to find no words to say at length she spoke in a sweet low voice  it is many years since we were playmates in the courts of the temple yonder and since then we have never been alone together have we rames  no great lady answered rames for you were born to be a queen and i am but a humble soldier who cannot hope to consort with queens  who cannot hope would you wish to then if you could  o queen answered rames biting his lips why does it please you to make a mock of me  it does not please me to do any such thing for by my father amen rames i wish that we were children once more for those were happy days before they separated us and set you to soldiering and me to statecraft  you have learnt your part well star of the morning said rames glancing at her quickly  not better than you playmate rames if i may judge from your swordplay this night so it seems that we both of us are in the way of becoming masters of our trades  what am i to say to your majesty you have saved my life when it was forfeit  as once you saved mine when it was forfeit and at greater risk look at your hand it will remind you it was but tit for tat and friend rames this day i came near to being eaten by a worse crocodile than that which dwells in the pool yonder  i guessed as much queen and the thought made me mad had it not been for that i should only have thrown him down now that crocodile will eat no more maidens  no answered tua rubbing her chin he has gone to be eaten by set devourer of souls has he not but i think there may be trouble between egypt and kesh and what pharaoh will say when he recovers i am sure i do not know may the gods protect me from his wrath  tell me if it pleases your majesty what is my fate i have been named general of this expedition over the heads of many i who am but a captain and a young man and an evildoer am i to be killed on the journey or am i to be executed by the king of kesh  if any kill you on the journey rames they shall render me an account be it the gods themselves and as for the vengeance of the king of keshwell you will have two thousand picked men with you and the means to gather more as you go listen now for this is not in the decree or in the letters she added bending towards him and whispering egypt has spies in kesh and being industrious i have read their reports the people there hate the upstart race that rules them and the king who alone is left now that amathel is dead is old and halfwitted for all that family drink too much so if the worst comes to the worst do you think that you need be killed you she added meaningly who if the house of amathel were not would by descent be king of kesh as if i and my house were not you might be pharaoh of egypt  rames studied the floor for a little then looked up and asked  what shall i do  it seems that is for you to find out replied tua in her turn studying the ceiling were i in your place i think that if driven to it i should know what to do one thing however i should not do whatever may be the judgment of the divine king of kesh upon you and that can easily be guessed i should not return to egypt with my escort until i was quite sure of my welcome no i think that i should stop in napata which i am told is a rich and pleasant city and try to put its affairs in order trusting that egypt to which it once belonged would in the end forgive me for so doing  i understand said rames that whatever happens i alone am to blame  good and of course there are no witnesses to this talk of ours have you also been taking lessons in statecraft in your spare hours rames much as i have tried to learn something of the art of war  rames made no answer only these two strange conspirators looked at each other and smiled  your majesty is weary i must leave your majesty he said presently  you must be wearier than i am rames with that wound which i think has not been dressed although it is true that we have both fought tonight rames you are going on a far journey i wonder if we shall ever meet again  i do not know he answered with a groan but for my sake it is better that we should not o morning star why did you save me this night who would have been glad to die did not that ka of yours tell you that i should have been glad to die or my mother who is a magician  i have seen nothing of my ka rames since we played together in the templeah those were happy days were they not and your mother is a discreet lady who does not talk to me about you except to warn me not to show you any favour lest others should be jealous and murder you shall you then be sorry if we do not meet again scarcely i suppose since you seem so anxious to die and be rid of me and all things that we know  now rames pressed his hand upon his heart as though to still its beating and looked round him in despair for indeed that heart of his felt as though it must burst  tua he gasped desperately can you for a minute forget that you are queen of the upper and the lower land who perhaps will soon be pharaoh the mightiest monarch in the world and remember only that you are a woman and as a woman hear a secret and keep it close  we have been talking secrets rames as we used to do you remember long ago and you will not tell mine which deal with the state why then should i tell yours but be short it grows late or rather early and as you know we shall not meet again  good he answered queen netertua i your subject dare to love you  what of that rames i have millions of subjects who all profess to love me  he waved his hand angrily and went on  i dare to love you as a man loves a woman not as a subject loves a queen  ah she answered in a new and broken voice that is different is it not well all women love to be loved though some are queens and some are peasants so why should i be angry rames now as in past days i thank you for your love  it is not enough he said what is the use of giving love love should be lent love is an usurer that asks high interest nay not the interest only but the capital and the interest to boot oh star what happens to the man who is so mad as to love the queen of egypt  tua considered this problem as though it were a riddle to which she was seeking an answer  who knows she replied at length in a low voice perhaps it costs him his life or perhapsperhaps he marries her and becomes pharaoh of egypt much might depend on whether the queen chanced to care about such a man  now rames shook like a reed in the evening wind and he looked at her with glowing eyes  tua he whispered can it be possibledo you mean that i am welcome to you or are you but drawing me to shame and ruin  she made no answer to him in words only with a certain grave deliberation laid down the little ivory sceptre that she held and suffering her troubled eyes to rest upon his eyes bent forward and stretched out her arms towards him  yes rames she murmured into his ear a minute later i am drawing you to whatever may be found upon this breast of mine love or majesty or shame or ruin or the death of one or both of us or all of them together are you content to take the chances of this high game rames  ask it not tua you know you know  she kissed him on the lips and all her heart and all her youth were in that kiss then gently enough she pushed him from her saying  stand there i would speak with you and as i have said the time is short hearken to me rames you are right i know as i have always known and as you would have known also had you been less foolish than you are you love me and i love you for so it was decreed where souls are made and so it has been from the beginning and so it shall be to the end you a gentleman of egypt love the queen of egypt and she is yours and no other mans such is the decree of him who caused us to be born upon the same day and to be nursed upon the same kind breast well after all why not if love brings death upon us as well may chance at least the love will remain which is worth it all and beyond death there is something  only this tua i seek the woman not a throne and alas through me you may be torn from your high place  the throne goes with the woman rames they cannot be separated but say something comes over me if that happened if i were an outcast a wanderer with nothing save this shape and soul of mine and it were you that sat upon a throne would you still love me rames  why ask such questions he replied indignantly moreover your talk is childish what throne can i ever sit on  a change fell upon her at his words she ceased to be the melting passionate woman and became once more the strong farseeing queen  rames she said you understand why although it tears my heart i am sending you so far away and into so many dangers do you not it is to save your life for after what has chanced tonight in this fashion or in that here you would certainly die as had it not been for that plan of mine you must have died two hours ago there are many who hate you rames and pharaoh may recover as i pray the gods he will and override my will for you have slain his guest who was brought here to marry me  i understand all of these things queen  then awake rames look to the future and understand that also if as i think you have the wit i am sending you with a strong escort am i not well that king of kesh is old and feeble and you have a claim upon his crown take it man and set it on your head and as king of kesh ask the hand of egypts queen in marriage then who would say you naynot egypts queen i think or the people of egypt who hunger for the rich southern land which they have lost  so she spoke and as these high words passed her lips she looked so splendid and so royal that dazzled by the greatness of her majesty rames bowed himself before her as before the presence of a god then aware that she was trying him in the balance of her judgment he straightened himself and spoke to her as prince speaks to prince  star of amen he said it is true that though here we are but your humble subjects the blood of my father and of myself is as high as yours and perhaps more ancient and it is true that now yonder amathel is dead after my father in virtue of those who went before us i have more right than any other to the inheritance of kesh queen i hear your words i will take it if i can not for its own sake but to win you and if i fail you will know that i died doing my best queen we part and this is a far journey perhaps we may never meet again at the best we must be separated for long queen you have honoured me with your love and therefore i ask a promise of you not as a woman only but as queen i ask that however strait may be the circumstances whatever reasons of state may push you on while i live you will take no other man to husbandno not even if he offers you half the world in dower  i give it she answered if you should learn that i am wed to any man upon the earth then spit upon my name as a woman and as queen cast me off and overthrow me if you can deal with me rames as in such a case i will deal with you only be sure of your tidings ere you believe them now there is nothing more to say farewell to you rames till we meet again beneath or beyond the sun our royal pact is made come seal it and begone  she rose and stretched out her sceptre to him which he kissed as her faithful subject next with a swift movement she lifted the golden uræus circlet from her brow and for a moment set it on his head crowning him her king and while it rested there she the queen of egypt bent the knee before him and did him homage then she cast down crown and sceptre and as woman fell upon her lovers breast while the bright rays of morning flowing suddenly through the eastern windowplace of that splendid hall struck upon them both clothing them in a robe of glory and of flame  soon very soon it was done and tua seated there in light watched rames depart into the outer shadow wondering when and how she would see him come again for her heart was heavy within her and even in this hour of triumphant love she greatly feared the future and its gifts    chapter vii  tua comes to memphis  so that day rames departed for takensit with what ships and men could be got together in such haste there at the frontier post he waited till the rest of the soldiers should join him bringing with them the hastily embalmed body of prince amathel whom he had slain and the royal gifts to the king of kesh then without a moments delay he sailed southwards with his little army on the long journey fearing lest if he tarried orders might come to him to return to thebes also he desired to reach napata before the heavy news of the death of the kings son and without warning of the approach of egypts embassy  with tua he had no more speech although as his galley was rowed under the walls of the palace at a window of the royal apartments he saw a white draped figure that watched them go by it was standing in the shadow so that he could not recognise the face but his heart told him that this was none other than the queen herself who appeared there to bid him farewell  so rames rose from the chair in which he was seated on account of the hurt to his leg and saluted with his sword and ordered the crew to do likewise by lifting up their oars then the slender figure bowed in answer and he went on to fulfil his destiny leaving netertua morning star of amen to fulfil hers  before he sailed however mermes his father and asti his mother visited him in a place apart  you were born under a strange star my son said mermes and i know not whither it will lead you who pray that it may not be a meteor which blazes suddenly in the heavens and disappears to return no more all the people talk of the favour the queen has shown you who instead of ordering you to be executed for the deed you did which robbed her of a royal husband has set you in command of an army you a mere youth and received you in secret audience an honour granted to very few fate that has passed me by gives the dice to your young hand but how the cast will fall i know not nor shall i live to see or so i believe  speak no such evilomened words my father answered rames tenderly for these two loved each other to me it seems more likely that it is i who shall not live for this is a strange and desperate venture upon which i go to tell to a great king the news of the death of his only son at my own hand mother you are versed in the books of wisdom and can see that which is hidden to our eyes have you no word of comfort for us  my son answered asti i have searched the future but with all my skill it will open little of its secrets to my sight yet i have learned something great fortunes lie before you and i believe that you and i shall meet again but to your beloved father bid farewell  at these words rames turned his head aside to hide his tears but mermes bade him not to grieve saying  great is the mystery of our fates my son some there be who tell us that we are but bubbles born of the stream to be swallowed up by the stream clouds born of the sky to be swallowed up by the sky the offspring of chance like the beasts and the birds gnats that dance for an hour in the sunlight and are gone but i believe it not who hold that the gods clothe us with this robe of flesh for their own purpose and that the spirit within us has been from the beginning and eternally will be therefore i love not life and fear not death knowing that these are but doors leading to the immortal house that is prepared for us the royal blood you have came to you from your mother and myself but that our lots should have been humble while yours mayhap will be splendid does not move me to envy who perchance have been that you may be you go forth to fulfil your fortunes which i believe are great i bide here to fulfil mine which lead me to the tomb i shall never see you in your power if power comes to you nor will your triumphant footsteps stir my sleep  yet rames remember that though you tread on cloth of gold and the bowed necks of your enemies though love be your companion and diadems your crown though flatteries float about you like incense in a shrine till at length you deem yourself a god those footsteps of yours still lead to that same dark tomb and through it on to judgment be great if you can but be good as well as great take no mans life because you have the strength and hate him wrong no woman because she is defenceless or can be bought remember that the beggar child playing in the sand may have a destiny more high than yours when all the earthly count is reckoned remember that you share the air you breathe with the cattle and the worm go your road rejoicing in your beauty and your youth and the good gifts that are given you but know rames that at the end of it i who wait in the shadow of osiris i your father shall ask an account thereof and that beyond me stand the gods of justice to test the web that you have woven now rames my son my blessing and the blessing of him who shaped us be with you and farewell  then mermes kissed him on the brow and turning left the room nor did they ever meet again  but asti stayed awhile and coming to him presently looked rames in the eyes and said  mourn not separations are no new thing death is no new thing all these sorrows have been on the earth for millions of years and for millions of years yet shall be live out your life rejoicing if the days be good content if they be but ill regretting nothing save your sins fearing nothing expecting nothing since all things are appointed and cannot be changed  i hear he answered humbly and i will not forget whether i succeed or fail you shall not be ashamed for me  now his mother turned to go also but paused and said  i have a gift for you rames from one whose name may not be spoken  give it to me he said eagerly i feared that it was all but a dream  oh replied asti scanning his face so there was a dream was there did it fall upon you last night when the daughter of amen my fosterchild instructed you in secret  the gift said rames stretching out his hand  then smiling in her quiet fashion his mother drew from the bosom of her robe some object that was wrapped in linen and touching her forehead with the royal seal that fastened it gave it to rames with trembling fingers he broke the seal and there within the linen lay a ring which for some years as rames knew tua had worn upon the first finger of her right hand it was massive and of plain gold and upon the bezel of it was cut the symbol of the sun on either side of which knelt a man and a woman crowned with the double crown of egypt and holding in their right hands the looped sign of life which they stretched up towards the glory of the sun  do you know who wore that ring in long past days asked asti of rames who pressed it to his lips  he shook his head who remembered only that tua had worn it  it was your forefather and mine rames the last of the royal rulers of our line who reigned over egypt and also over the land of kesh a while ago the embalmers reclothed his divine body in the tomb and the princess who was present there with your father and myself drew this ring off his dead hand and offered it to mermes who would not take it seeing that it is a royal signet so she wore it herself and now for her own reasons she sends it to you perhaps to give you authority in kesh where that mighty seal is known  i thank the queen he murmured i shall wear it always  then let it be on your breast till you have passed the frontier lest some should ask questions that you find it hard to answer my son she went on quickly you dare to love this queen of ours  in truth i do mother did not you who know everything know that also it is your fault who brought us up together  nay my son the fault of the gods who have so decreed butdoes she love you  you are always with her mother ask her yourself if you need to ask at least she has sent me her own ring oh mother mother guard her night and day for if harm comes to her then i die mother queens cannot give themselves where they will as other women can it is policy that thrusts their husbands on them keep her unwed mother though it should cost her her throne still i say let her not be cast into the arms of one she hates protect her in her trial if such should come and if strength fails and the gods desert her then hide her in the web of the magic that you have and preserve her undefiled for so shall i bless your name for ever  you fly at a rare bird rames and there are many stronger hawks about besides that one you slew yes royal eagles who may strike down the pair of you yet i will do my best who have long foreseen this hour and who pray that before my eyes shut in death they may yet behold you seated on the throne of your forefathers crowned with power and with such love and beauty as have never yet been given to man now hide that ring upon your heart and your secret in it as i shall lest you should return no more to egypt moreover follow your royal star and no other whatever counsel she may have given you follow it also stirring not to right or left for i say that in that maiden breast of hers there dwells the wisdom of the gods  then holding up her hands over his head as though in blessing asti too turned and left him    so rames went and was no more seen and by degrees the talk as to the matter of his victory over the prince of kesh and as to his appointment by the whim of the maiden queen to command the splendid embassy of atonement which she had despatched to the old king the dead mans father died away for lack of anything to feed on  tua kept her counsel well nor was aught known of that midnight interview with the young count her general moreover napata was far away so far that starting at the season when it did the embassy could scarce return till two years had gone by if ever it did return also few believed that whoever came back rames would be one of them since it was said openly that so soon as he was beyond the frontiers of egypt the soldiers had orders to kill him and take on his body as a peaceoffering  indeed all praised the wit and wisdom of the queen who by this politic device had rid herself of a troublesome business with as little scandal as possible and avoided staining her own hands in the blood of a fosterbrother had she ordered his death forthwith they said it would have been supposed also that she had put him away because he was of a royal race one who in the future might prove a rival or at least cause some rebellion  meanwhile greater questions filled the mouths of men would pharaoh die and leave netertua the young and lovely to hold his throne and if so what would happen it was a thousand years since a woman had reigned in egypt and none had reigned who were not wed therefore it seemed necessary that a husband should be found for her as soon as might be  but pharaoh did not die on the contrary though very slowly he recovered and was stronger than he had been for years for the fit that struck him down seemed to have cleared his blood for some three months he lay helpless as a child amusing himself as a child does with little things and talking of children whom he had known in his youth or when some of these chanced to visit him as old men asking them to play with him with tops or balls  then one day came a change and rising from his bed he commanded the presence of his councillors and when they came inquired of them what had happened and why he could remember nothing since the feast  they put him off with soft words and soon he grew weary and dismissed them but after they had gone and he had eaten he sent for mermes the captain of the guard of amen and his friend and questioned him  the last thing i remember he said was seeing the drunken prince of kesh fighting with your son that handsome fieryeyed count rames whom some fool or enemy had set to wait upon him at table it was a dogs trick mermes for after all your blood is purer and more ancient than that of the present kings of kesh well the horror of the sight of my royal guest the suitor for my daughters hand fighting with an officer of my own guard at my own board struck me as a butcher strikes an ox and after it all was blackness what chanced mermes  this pharaoh my son killed amathel in fair fight then those black nubian giants in their fury attacked your guard but led by rames the egyptians though they were the lesser men overcame them and slew most of them i am an old soldier but never have i seen a finer fray  a finer fray a finer fray gasped pharaoh why this will mean a war between kesh and egypt and then did the council order rames to be executed as you must admit he deserved although you are his father  not so o pharaoh moreover i admit nothing though had he played a cowards part before all the lords of egypt gladly would i have slain him with my own hand  ah said pharaoh there speaks the soldier and the parent well i understand he was affronted was he not by that bedizened black man were i in your place i should say as much butwhat happened  your majesty having become unconscious explained mermes her majesty the queen netertua glorious in ra took command of affairs according to her oath of crowning she has sent an embassy of atonement of two thousand picked soldiers to the king of kesh bearing with them the embalmed body of the divine amathel and many royal gifts  that is good enough in its way said pharaoh but why two thousand men whereof the cost will be very great when a score would have sufficed it is an army not an embassy and when my royal brother of kesh sees it advancing bearing with it the illomened gift of his only sons body he may take alarm  mermes respectfully agreed that he might do so  what general is in command of this embassy as it pleases you to call it  the count rames my son is in command your majesty  now weak as he was still pharaoh nearly leapt from his chair  rames that young cutthroat who killed the prince rames who is the last of the old rightful dynasty of kesh rames a mere captain in command of two thousand of my veterans oh i must still be mad who gave him the command  the queen netertua star of amen she gave him the command o pharaoh immediately after the fray in the hall she uttered her decree and caused it to be recorded in the usual fashion  send for the queen said pharaoh with a groan  so tua was summoned and presently swept in gloriously arrayed and on seeing her father sitting up and well ran to him and embraced him and for a long time refused to listen to his talk of matters of state at length however he made her sit by him still holding his hand and asked her why in the name of amen she had sent that handsome young firebrand rames in command of the expedition to kesh then she answered very sweetly that she would tell him and tell him she did at such length that before she had finished pharaoh whose strength as yet was small had fallen into a doze  now you understand she said as he woke up with a start the responsibility was thrust upon me and i had to act as i thought best to have slain this young rames would have been impossible for all hearts were with him  but surely daughter you might have got him out of the way  my father that is what i have done i have sent him to napata which is very much out of the waymany months journey i am told  but what will happen tua either the king of kesh will kill him and my two thousand soldiers or perhaps he will kill the king of kesh as he killed his son and seize the throne which his own forefathers held for generations have you thought of that  yes my father i thought of it and if this last should happen through no fault of ours would egypt weep think you  now pharaoh stared at tua and tua looked back at pharaoh and smiled  i perceive daughter he said slowly that in you are the makings of a great queen for within the silken scabbard of a womans folly i see the statesmans sword of bronze only run not too fast lest you should fall upon that sword and it should pierce you  now tua who had heard such words before from asti smiled again but made no answer  you need a husband to hold you back went on pharaoh some great man whom you can love and respect  find me such a man my father and i will wed him gladly answered tua in a sweet voice only she added i know not where he may be sought now that the divine amathel is dead at the hand of the count rames our general and ambassador to kesh  so when he grew stronger pharaoh renewed his search for a husband meet to marry the queen of egypt now as before suitors were not lacking indeed his ambassadors and councillors sent in their names by twos and threes but always when they were submitted to her tua found something against everyone of them till at last it was said that she must be destined for a god since no mere mortal would serve her turn but when this was reported to her tua only answered with a smile that she was destined to that royal lover of whom amen had spoken to her mother in a dream not to a god but to the chosen of the god and that when she saw him she felt sure she would know him at once and love him much  after some months had gone by pharaoh quite weary of this play asked the advice of his council they suggested to him that he should journey through the great cities of egypt both because the change might completely reestablish his divine health and in the hope that on her travels the queen netertua would meet someone of royal blood with whom she could fall in love for by now it was evident to all of them that unless she did fall in love she would not marry  so that very night pharaoh asked his daughter if she would undertake such a journey  she answered that nothing would please her better as she wearied of thebes and desired to see the other great cities of the land to make herself known to those who dwell in them and in each to be proclaimed as its future ruler also she wished to look upon the ocean whereof she had heard that it was so big that all the waters of the nile flowing into it day and night made no difference to its volume  thus then began that pilgrimage which afterwards tua recorded in the history of her reign on the walls of the wonderful temples that she built her own wish was that they should sail south to the frontiers of egypt since there she hoped that she might hear some tidings of rames and his expedition whereof latterly no certain word had come this project however was overruled because in the south there were no great towns also the inhabitants of the bordering desert were turbulent and might choose that moment to attack  so in the end they went down and not up the nile tarrying for a while at every great city and especially at atbu the holy place where the head of osiris is buried and tens of thousands of the great men of egypt have their tombs here tua was crowned afresh in the very shrine of osiris amidst the rejoicings of the people  then they sailed away to on the city of the sun and thence to make offerings at the great pyramids which were built by some of the early kings who had ruled egypt to serve them as their tombs  netertua entered the pyramids to look upon the bodies of these pharaohs who had been dead for thousands of years and whose deeds were all forgotten though her father would not accompany her there because the ways were so steep that he did not dare to tread them afterwards with asti and a small guard of the arab chiefs of the desert she mounted a dromedary and rode round them in the moonlight hoping that she would meet the ghosts of those kings and that they would talk with her as the ghost of her mother had done but she saw no ghosts nor would asti try to summon them from their sleep although tua prayed her to do so  leave them alone said asti as they paused in the shadow of the greatest of the pyramids and stared at its shining face engraved from base to summit with many a mystic writing  leave them alone lest they should be angry as amen was and tell your majesty things which you do not wish to hear contemplate their mighty works such as no monarch can build today and suffer them to rest therein undisturbed by weaker folk  do you call these mighty works asked tua contemptuously for she was angry because asti would not try to raise the dead what are they after all but so many stones put together by the labour of men to satisfy their own vanity and of those who built them what story remains there is none at all save some vain legends now if i live i will rear a greater monument for history shall tell of me till time be dead  perhaps netertua if you live and the gods will it though for my part i think that these old stones will survive the story of most deeds    on the morrow of this visit to the pyramids pharaoh and the queen his daughter made their state entry into the great whitewalled city of memphis where they were royally received by pharaohs brother the prince abi who was still the ruler of all this town and district as it chanced these two had not met since abi many years before came to thebes asking a share in the government of egypt and to be nominated as successor to the throne  like every other lord and prince he had been invited to be present at the great ceremony of the crowning of netertua but at the last moment sent his excuses saying that he was ill which seemed to be true at any rate the spies reported that he was confined to his bed though whether sickness or his own will took him thither at this moment there was nothing to show at the time pharaoh and his council wondered a little that he had made no proposal for the marriage of one of his sons of whom he had four to their royal cousin netertua but decided that he had not done so because he was sure that it would not be accepted for the rest during all this period abi had kept quiet in his own government which he ruled well and strongly remitting his taxes to thebes at the proper time with a ceremonial letter of homage and even increasing the amount of them  so it came about that pharaoh who by nature was kindly and unsuspicious had long ago put away all mistrust of his brother whose ambitions he was sure had come to an end with the birth of an heiress to the throne  yet when escorted only by five hundred of his guard for this was a peaceful visit pharaoh rode into the mighty city and saw how impregnable were its walls and how strong its gates saw also that the streets were lined with thousands of wellarmed troops doubts which he dismissed as unworthy did creep into his heart but if he said nothing of them tua who rode in the chariot with him was not so silent  my father she said in a low voice while the crowds shouted their welcome for they were alone in the chariot the horses of which were led this uncle of mine keeps a great state in memphis  yes daughter why should he not he is its governor  a stranger who did not know the truth might think he was its king my father and to be plain if i were pharaoh and had chosen to enter here it would have been with a larger force  we can go away when we like tua said pharaoh uneasily  you mean my father that we can go away when it pleases the prince your brother to open those great bronze gates that i heard clash behind usthen and not before  at this moment their talk came to an end for the chariot was stayed at the steps of the great hall where abi waited to receive his royal guests he stood at the head of the steps a huge coarse vigorous man of about sixty years of age on whose fat swarthy face there was still oddly enough some resemblance to the delicate refinedfeatured pharaoh  tua summed him up in a single glance and instantly hated him even more than she had hated amathel prince of kesh also she who had not feared the emptyheaded drunken amathel was penetrated with a strange terror of this man whom she felt to be strong and intelligent and whose great greedy eyes rested on her beauty as though they could not tear themselves away  now they were ascending the steps and now prince abi was welcoming them to his humble house giving them their throne names and saying how rejoiced he was to see them his sovereigns within the walls of memphis while all the time he stared at tua  pharaoh who was tired made no reply but the young queen staring back at him answered  we thank you for your greeting but then my uncle abi why did you not meet us outside the gates of memphis where we expected to find its governor waiting to deliver up the keys of pharaohs city to the officers of pharaoh  now abi who had thought to see some shrinking child clothed in the emblems of a queen looked astonished at this tall and royal maiden who had so sharp a tongue and found no words to answer her so she swept past him and commanded to be shown where she should lodge in memphis  they led her to its greatest palace that had been prepared for pharaoh and herself a place surrounded by palm groves in the midst of the city but having studied it with her quick eyes she said that it did not please her so search was made elsewhere and in the end she chose another smaller palace that once had been a temple of sekhet the tigerheaded goddess of vengeance and of chastity whereof the pylon towers fronted on the nile which at its flood washed against them indeed they were now part of the wall of memphis for the great unused gateway between them had been built up with huge blocks of stone  surrounding this palace and outside its courts lay the old gardens of the temple where the priests of sekhet used to wander enclosed within a lofty limestone wall here saying that the air from the river would be more healthy for him tua persuaded pharaoh to establish himself and his court and to encamp the guards under the command of his friend mermes in the outer colonnades and gardens  when it was pointed out to the queen that owing to the lack of dwellingrooms none which were fitting were left for her to occupy she replied that this mattered nothing since in the old pylon tower were two small chambers hollowed in the thickness of its walls which were very pleasing to her because of the prospect of the nile and the wide flat lands and the distant pyramids commanded from the lofty roof and windowplaces so these chambers in which none had dwelt for generations were hastily cleaned out and furnished and in them tua and asti her fostermother took up their abode    chapter viii  the magic image  that night pharaoh and tua rested in privacy with those members of the court whom they had brought with them but on the morrow began a round of festivals such as history scarcely told of in egypt indeed the feast with which it opened was more splendid than any tua had seen at thebes even at the time of her crowning or on that day of blood and happiness when amathel and his nubian guards were slain and she and rames declared their love at this feast pharaoh and the young queen sat in chairs of gold while the prince abi was placed on her right hand and not on that of pharaoh as he should have been as host and subject  i am too much honoured said tua looking at him sideways why do you not sit by pharaoh my uncle  who am i that i should take the seat of honour when my sovereigns come to visit me answered abi bowing his great head let it be reserved for the highpriest of osiris that holy one whom after ptah we worship here above all other deities for he is clothed with the majesty of the god of death  of death said tua is that why you put him by my father  indeed not replied abi spreading out his hands though if a choice must be made i would rather that he sat near one who is old and must soon be called the everliving than at the side of the loveliest queen that egypt has ever seen to whom it is said that amen himself has sworn a long life and again he bowed  you mean that you think pharaoh will soon die nay deny it not prince abi i can read your thoughts and they are illomened said tua sharply and turning her head away began to watch those about her  soon she noticed that behind abi amongst his other officers stood a tall grizzled man clad in the robes and cap of an astrologer who appeared to be studying everything and especially pharaoh and herself for whenever she looked round it was to find his quick black eyes fixed upon her  who is that man she whispered presently to asti who waited on her  the famous astrologer kaku queen i have seen him before when he visited thebes with the prince before your birth i will tell you of him afterwards watch him well  so tua watched and discovered several things among them that kaku observed everything that she and pharaoh did what they ate to whom they spoke and any words which fell from their lips such as those that she had uttered about the god osiris all of these he noted down from time to time on his waxen tablets doubtless that he might make use of them afterwards in his interpretation of the omens of the future  now among the ladies of the court who fanned pharaoh and waited on him was that dancing girl of abis who many years before had betrayed him at thebes merytra lady of the footstool now a woman of middle age but still beautiful of whom although tua disliked her pharaoh was fond because she was clever and witty of speech and amused him for this reason in spite of her history he had advanced her to wealth and honour and kept her about his person as a companion of his lighter hours something in this womans manner attracted tuas attention for continually she looked at the astrologer kaku who suddenly awoke to her presence and smiled as though he recognised an old friend then when it was the turn of another to take her place behind pharaoh merytra drew alongside of kaku and under shelter of her broad fan spoke to him quickly as though she were making some arrangement with him and he nodded in assent after which they separated again  the feast wore on its weary course till at length the doors opened and slaves appeared bearing the mummy of a dead man which they set upon its feet in the centre of the hall whereon a toastmaster cried  drink and be merry all ye great ones of the earth who know not how soon ye shall come to this last lowly state  now this bringing in of the mummy was a very ancient rite but one that had fallen into general disuse so that as it chanced tua who had never seen it practised before looked on it with curiosity not unmingled with disgust  why is a dead king dragged from his sepulchre back into the world of life my uncle she asked pointing to the royal emblems with which the corpse was clothed  it is no king your majesty answered abi but only the bones of some humble person or perhaps a block of wood that wears the uræus and carries the sceptre in honour of pharaoh our chief guest  now tua frowned and pharaoh who had overheard the talk said smiling sadly  a somewhat poor compliment my brother to one who like myself is old and sickly and not far from his eternal habitation yet why should i grumble at it who need no such reminder of that which awaits me and all of us and he leaned back in his chair and sighed while tua looked at him anxiously  then abi ordered the mummy to be removed declaring with many apologies that it had been brought there only because such was the ancient custom of memphis which unlike thebes did not change its fashions he added that this same body or figure for he knew not which it was having never troubled to inquire had been looked upon by at least thirty pharaohs all as dead as it today since it was the same that was used at the royal feasts before long ago the seat of government was moved to thebes  if so broke in tua who was angry it is time that it should be buried if flesh and bone or burned if wood but pharaoh is wearied have we your leave to depart my uncle  without answering abi rose as she thought to dismiss the company but it was not so for he raised a great golden cup of wine and said  before we part my guests let memphis drink a welcome to the mighty lord of the two lands who for the first time in his long and glorious reign honours it with his presence here today as he said to me but now my royal brother is weak and aged with sickness nor can we hope that once his visit is ended he will return again to the whitewalled city but as it chances the gods have given him a boon which they denied for long the lovely daughter who shares his throne and who as we believe and pray will reign after him when it pleases him to ascend into the kingdom of osiris yet my friends it is evil that the safe and lawful government of egypt should hang on one frail life therefore this is the toast to which i drinkthat the queen netertua morning star of amen hathor strong in beauty who has rejected so many suitors may before she departs from among us find one to her liking some husband of royal blood skilled in the art of rule whose strength and knowledge may serve to support her womans weakness and inexperience in that sad hour when she finds herself alone  now the audience who well understood the inner meaning and objects of this speech rose and cheered furiously as they had been schooled to do emptying their cups to pharaoh and to tua and shouting  we know the man take him glorious queen take him daughter of amen and reign for ever  what do they mean muttered pharaoh i do not understand thank them my daughter my voice is weak and let us begone  so tua rose when at length there was silence and looking round her with flashing eyes said in her clear voice that reached the furthest recesses of the hall  the pharaoh my father and i the queen of the upper and the lower lands return thanks to you our people of this city for your loyal greetings but as for the words that the prince abi has spoken we understand them not my prayer is that the pharaoh may still reign in glory for many years but if he departs and i remain learn o people that you have naught to fear from the weakness and inexperience of your queen learn also that she seeks no husband nor when she seeks will she ever find one within the walls of memphis rest you well o people and you my uncle abi as now with your good leave we will do also  then turning she took her father by the hand and went without more words leaving abi staring at his guests while his guests stared back at him  when tua had reached the pylon tower where she lodged and her ladies had unrobed her and gone she called asti to her from the adjoining chamber and said  you are wise my nurse tell me what did abi mean  if your majesty cannot guess then you are duller than i thought answered asti in her quick dry fashion adding however i will try to translate the prince abi your noble uncle means that he has trapped you here and that you shall not leave these walls save as his wife  now fury took hold of tua  how dare he speak such words she gasped springing to her feet i the wife of that old riverhog my fathers brother who might be my grandfather that hideous ancient lump of wickedness who boasts that he has a hundred sons and daughters i the queen of egypt whose birth was decreed by amen ihow dare you and she ceased choking in her wrath  the question ishow he dares queen still that is his plot which he will carry through if he is able i suspected it from the first and that is why i always opposed this visit to memphis but you will remember that you bade me be silent saying that you had determined to see the most ancient city in egypt  you should not have been silent you should have said what was in your mind even if i ordered you from my presence neither abi nor any of his sons proposed for my hand when the others did therefore i suspected nothing  after the fashion of women who have already given their hearts queen and forget that they have other things to givea kingdom for instance the snake does not roar like the lion yet it is more to be feared  once i am out of this place it is the snake that shall have cause to fear asti for i will break its back and throw it writhing to the kites nurse we must leave memphis  that is not easy queen since some ceremony is planned for each of the next eight days if pharaoh were to go away without attending them he would anger all the people of the north which he has not visited since he was crowned  then let them be angered pharaoh can do as he wills  yes queen at least that is the saying but do you think that pharaoh wishes to bring about a civil war and risk his crown and yours listen abi is very strong and under his command he has a greater army than pharaoh can muster in these times of peace for in addition to his trained troops all the thousands of the bedouin tribes of the desert look on him as lord and at his word will fall on the wealth of egypt like famished vultures on a fatted ox moreover here you have but a guard of five hundred men whereas abis regiments summoned to do you honour and his ships of war block the river and the southern road how then will you leave memphis without his good leave how will you even send messengers to summon aid which could not reach you under fifty days  now when she saw the greatness of the danger tua grew quite calm and answered  you have done wrong asti if you foresaw all these things of which i never thought you should have warned pharaoh and his council  queen i did warn them and mermes warned them also but they would not listen saying that they were but the idle dreams of one who strives to peep into the future and sees false pictures there more pharaoh sent for me himself and whilst thanking me and mermes my husband told me that he had inquired into the matter and found no cause to distrust abi or those under his command moreover he forbade me to speak to your majesty about it lest being but young and a woman you might be frightened and your pleasure spoilt  who was his counsellor asked tua  a strange one i think queen you know his waitingwoman merytra she of whom he is so fond and who stood behind him with a fan this night  aye i know her replied tua with emphasis she was ever whispering with that tall astrologer at the feast but does pharaoh take counsel with waitingladies of his private household  with this waitinglady it seems queen perhaps you have not heard all her story in the year before your birth merytra came up the nile with abi she was then quite young and very pretty one of abis women it seems that the prince struck her for some fault and being clever she determined to be revenged upon him soon she got her chance for she heard abi disclose to the astrologer kaku that same man whom you saw tonight talking with her a plan that he had made to murder pharaoh and declare himself king from which kaku dissuaded him having this secret and being bold she fled at once from the ship of abi and that night told pharaoh everything but he forgave abi and sent him home again with honour who should have slain him for his treason only merytra remained in the court and from that time forward pharaoh who trusted her and was caught by her wit and beauty made it a habit to send for her when he wished to have news of memphis where she was born because she seemed always to know even the most secret things that were passing in that city moreover often her information proved true  that is not to be wondered at nurse seeing that doubtless it came from this kaku abis astrologer and magician  no queen it is not to be wondered at especially as she paid back secret for secret well i believe that after i had warned pharaoh of what i knew never mind how he sent for merytra who laughed the tale to scorn and told him that abi his brother had long ago abandoned all ambitions being well content with his great place and power which one of his sons would inherit after him she told him also that the troops were but assembled to do the greater honour to your majesties who had no more loyal or loving subject than the prince abi whom for her part she hated with good cause as she loved pharaoh and his housewith good cause if there were any danger she asked would she dare to put herself within the reach of abi the man that she had once betrayed because her heart was pure and true and she was faithful to her king so pharaoh believed her and i obeyed the orders of pharaoh knowing that if i did not do so he would grow angry and perhaps separate me from you my beloved queen and fosterling which now that rames has gone would i think have meant my death yet i fear that i have erred  yes i fear also that you have erred asti but everything is forgiven to those who err through love answered tua kindly and kissing her oh my father pharaoh what god fashioned you so weak that an evil spirit in a womans shape can play the rudder to your policy leave me now asti for i must sleep and call on amen to aid his daughter the snare is strong and cunning but perchance in my dreams he will show me how it may be broke    that night when the feast was ended merytra pharaohs favoured waitingmaid did not return with the rest of the royal retinue to the temple where he lodged as they went from the hall in state she whispered a few words into the ear of the chief butler of the household who knowing that she had the royal pass to come in and out as she would answered that the gate should be opened to her and let her go  so covering her head with a dark cloak merytra slipped behind a certain statue in the antehall and waited till presently a tall figure also wrapped in a dark cloak appeared and beckoned to her she followed it down sundry passages and up a narrow stair that seemed almost endless until at length the figure unlocked a massive door and when they had passed it locked it again behind them  now merytra found herself in a very richly furnished room lit by hanginglamps that evidently was the abode of one who watched the stars and practised magic for all about were strangelooking brazen instruments and rolls of papyrus covered with mysterious signs and suspended above the table a splendid divining ball of crystal merytra sank into a chair throwing off her dark cloak  of a truth friend kaku she said so soon as she had got her breath you dwell very near the gods  yes dear merytra he answered with a dry chuckle i keep a kind of halfway house to heaven perched here in my solitude i see and make note of what goes on above and he pointed to the skies and retail the information or as much of it as i think fit to the groundlings below  at a price i suppose kaku  most certainly at a price and i may add a good price no one thinks much of the physician who charges low fees well you have managed to get here and after all these years i am glad to see you again looking almost as young and pretty as ever tell me your secret of eternal youth dear merytra  merytra who was vain smiled at this artful flattery although in truth it was well deserved for at an age when many egyptians are old she remained fresh and fair  an excellent conscience she answered a good appetite and the virtuous quiet life which is the lot of the ladies of pharaohs courtthere you have the secret kaku i fear that you keep too late hours and that is why you grow white and withered like a mummynot but that you look handsome enough in those long robes of yours she added to gild the pill  it is my labours he replied making a wry face for he too was vain my labours for the good of others also indigestion and the draughts in this accursed tower where i sit staring at the stars which give me rheumatism i have got both of them now and must take some medicine and filling two goblets from a flask he handed her one of them saying drink it you dont get wine like that in thebes  it is very good said merytra when she had drunk but heavy if i took much of that i think i should have rheumatism too now tell me old friend am i safe in this place no not from pharaoh he trusts me and lets me go where i will upon his businessbut from his royal brother he used to have a long memory and from the look of him i do not think that his temper has improved you may remember a certain slap in the face and how i paid him back for it  he never knew it was you merytra being a mass of selfconceit he thought that you ran away because he had banished you from his royal presence and presented youto me  oh he thought that did he what a vain fool  it was a very dirty trick you played me merytra went on kaku with indignation for the rich wine coursing through his blood revived the sting of his loss you know how fond i always was of you and indeed am still he added gazing at her admiringly  i felt that i was not worthy of so learned and distinguished a man she replied looking at him with her dark eyes i should only have hampered your life dear kaku so i went into the household of that poor creature pharaoh insteadpharaohs nunnery we call it but you will not explain the facts to abi will you  no i think not merytra if we continue to get on as well as we do at present but now you are rested so let us come to business for otherwise you will have to stop here all night and pharaoh would be angry  oh to set with pharaoh though it is true that he is a good paymaster and knows the value of a clever woman now what is this business  the old astrologers face grew hard and cunning going to the door he made sure that it was locked and drew a curtain over it then he took a stool and sat himself down in front of merytra in such a position that the light fell on her face while his own remained in shadow  a big business merytra and by the gods i do not know that i should trust you with it you tricked me once you have tricked pharaoh for years how do i know that you will not play the same game once more and earn me an order to cut my own throat and so lose life and soul together  if you think that kaku perhaps you will unlock the door and give me an escort home for we are only wasting time  i dont know what to think for you are as cunning as you are beautiful listen woman he continued in a savage whisper and clasping her by the wrist if you are false i tell you that you shall die horribly for if the knife and poison fail i am no charlatan i have arts i can make you turn loathsome to the sight and waste away i can haunt you at nights so that you may never sleep a wink save in full sunshine and i will do it all and more if i die merytra we go together now will you swear to be true will you swear it by the oath of oaths  the spy looked about her she knew kakus power which was famous throughout egypt and that it was said to be of the most evil sort and she feared him  it seems that this is a dangerous affair she replied uneasily and i think that i can guess your aim now if i help you kaku what am i to get  me he answered  i am flattered but what else  after pharaoh the greatest place and the most power in egypt as the wife of pharaohs vizier  the wife doubtless from what i have heard of you kaku there would be other wives to share these honours  no other wifeupon the oath none merytra  she thought a moment looking at the wizened but powerfulfaced old magician then answered  i will take the oath and keep my share of it see that you keep yours kaku or it will be the worse for you for women have their own evil power  i know it merytra and from the beginning the wise have held that the spirit dwells not in the heart or brain or liver but in the female tongue now stand up  she obeyed and from some hidden place in the wall kaku produced a book or rather a roll of magical writings that was encased in iron the metal of the evil god typhon  there is no other such book as this he said for it was written by the greatest of wizards who lived before mena when the godkings ruled in egypt and i myself took it from among his bones a terrible task for his ka rose up in the grave and threatened me he who can read in that book as i can has much strength and let him beware who breaks an oath taken on that book now press it to your heart merytra and swear after me  then he repeated a very terrible oath for should it be violated it consigned the swearer to shame sickness and misfortune in this world and to everlasting torments in the next at the claws and fangs of beastheaded demons who dwell in the darkness beyond the sun appointing by name those beings who should work the torments and summoning them as witnesses to the bond  merytra listened then said  you have left out your part of the oath friend namely that you promise that i shall be the only wife of pharaohs vizier and hold equal power with him  i forgot said kaku and added the words  then they both swore touching their brows with the book and as she looked up again merytra saw a strange flamelike light pulse in the crystal globe that hung above her head which became presently infiltrated with crimson flowing through it as blood might flow from a wound till it glowed dull red out of which redness a great eye watched her then the eye vanished and the blood vanished and in place of them queen netertua sat in glory on her throne while the nations worshipped her and by her side sat a man in royal robes whose face was hidden in a cloud  what do you see asked kaku following her gaze to the crystal  she told him and he pondered a while then answered doubtfully  i think it is a good omen the royal consort sits beside her only why was his face hidden  i am sure i do not know answered merytra i think that strong red wine of yours was doctored and has got into my head but come we have sworn this oath which i dare say will work in more ways than we guess for such accursed swords have two edges to them now out with the plot and throw a cloth over that crystal for i want to see no more pictures  it seems a pity since you have such a gift of vision replied kaku in the same dubious voice yet he obeyed tying up the shining ball in a piece of mummy wrapping which he used in his spells  now he said i will be brief my fat master abi means to be pharaoh of egypt and it seems that the best way to do so is by climbing into his nieces throne where most men would like to sit  you mean by marrying her kaku  of course what else he who marries the queen rules in right of the queen  indeed do you know anything of netertua  as much as any other man knows but what do you mean  i mean that i shall be sorry for the husband who marries her against her will however beautiful and highplaced she may be i tell you that woman is a flame she has more strength in her than all the magicians in egypt yourself among them they say she is a daughter of amen and i believe it i believe that the god dwells in her and woe be to him whom she may chance to hate if he comes to her as a husband  that is abis business is it not our business merytra is to get him there now we may take it this will not be with her consent  certainly not kaku she answered the gossip goes that she is in love with young count rames who fought and killed the prince of kesh before her eyes and now has gone to make amends to the king his father at the head of an army  that may be true merytra why not he is her fosterbrother and of royal blood bold too and handsome they say well queens have no business to be in love that is the privilege of humbler folk like you and me merytra say is she suspiciousabout prince abi i mean  i do not know but asti her nurse and favourite lady the wife of mermes and mother of rames is suspicious enough she is a greater magician than you are kaku and if she could have had her way pharaoh would never have set foot in memphis but i got your letter and overpersuaded him the poor fool you see he thinks me faithful to his house and that is why i am allowed to be here tonight to collect information  ah well what asti knows the queen will know and she is stronger than pharaoh and notwithstanding all abis ships and soldiers may break away from memphis and make war upon him so it comes to thispharaoh must stay here for his daughter will not desert him  how will you make him stay here kaku not by and she glanced towards the shrouded crystal  nay no blood if it can be helped he must not even seem to be a prisoner it is too dangerous but there are other ways  what ways poison  too dangerous again now if he fell sick and he has been sick before and could not stir it would give us time to bring about the marriage would it not oh i know that he is well at presentfor him but look here merytra i have something to show you  then going to a chest kaku took from it a plain box of cedar wood which was shaped like a mummy case and lifting off its lid revealed within it a waxen figure of the length of a hand this figure was beautifully fashioned to the living likeness of pharaoh and crowned with the double crown of egypt  what is it asked merytra shrinking back an ushapti to be placed in his tomb  no woman a magic ka fashioned with many a spell out of yonder ancient roll that can bring him to the tomb if it be rightly used as you shall use it  i she exclaimed starting how  thus you as one of pharaohs favourite ladies have charge of the chamber where he sleeps now you must make shift to enter there alone and lay this figure in his bed that the breath of pharaoh may enter into it then take it from the bed and say these words figure figure i command thee by the power within thee and in the name of the lord if ill that as thy limbs waste so shall the limbs of him in whose likeness thou art fashioned waste also having spoken thus hold the legs of the image over the flame of a lamp until it be half melted and convey the rest of it away to your own sleepingplace and hide it there so it shall come about that during that night the nerves and muscles in the legs of pharaoh will wither and grow useless to him and he be paralysed and unable to stir afterwards if it be needful i will tell you more  now bold though she was merytra grew afraid  i cannot do it she said it is black sorcery against one who is a god and will bring my soul to hell find some other instrument or place the waxen imp in the bed of pharaoh yourself kaku  the face of the magician grew fierce and cruel  come with me merytra he said and taking her by the wrist he led her to the open windowplace whence he observed the stars  so giddy was the height at the top of this lofty tower that the houses beneath looked small and far away and the sky quite near  behold memphis and the nile and the wide lands of egypt gleaming in the moonlight and the pyramids of the ancient kings you wish to rule over all these like myselfdo you not merytraand if you obey me you shall do so  and if i do not obey  then i will throw my spell upon you and your senses shall leave you and you shall fall headlong to that white line which is a street and before tomorrow morning the dogs will have picked your broken bones so that none can know you for you have heard too much to go hence alive unless it be to do my bidding oh no think not to say i will and afterwards deceive me for that image which you take with you is my servant and will keep watch on you and make report to me and to the god its master now choose  i will obey said merytra faintly and as she spoke she thought that she heard a laugh in the air outside the window  good now hide the box beneath your cloak and drop it not for if so that which is within will call aloud after you and they will kill you for a sorceress unless my word come to you lay the figure in pharaohs bed tomorrow evening and at the hour of moonrise hold its limbs in the flame in your own chamber and hide it away and afterwards bring it back to me that i may enchant it afresh if there be any need now come and i will guard you to the gates of the old temple of sekhet where pharaoh dwells    chapter ix  the doom of pharaoh  on the morrow when the lady asti came to dress the queen for that days ceremony she asked her if amen had given her the wisdom that she sought  not so answered the young queen all he gave me was very bad dreams and in every one of them was mixed up that waiting woman of my father merytra of whom you spoke to me if i believed in omens i should say that she was about to bring some evil upon our house  it may well be so queen answered asti and in that case i think that she is at the work at any rate watching from the little window of my room by the light of the moon i saw her return across the temple court at midnight moreover it seemed to me that she was carrying something beneath her robe  whence did she return  from the city i suppose she has pharaohs pass and can go in and out when she will i have caused mermes to question the officer of the guard and he says that she came to the gate accompanied by a tall man wrapped in a dark cloak who spoke with her earnestly and left her from this description i think it must have been the astrologer kaku with whom she was talking at the feast  that is bad news nurse what else have you to tell  only this queen the gates are guarded more closely even than we thought i tried to send out a man to thebes this morning with a message on my own accountnever mind what it wasand the sentries turned him back  by the gods exclaimed tua before i have reigned a year every gate in memphis shall be melted down for cooking vessels and i will set their captains to work in the desert mines nay such threats are foolishness ill not threaten ill strike when the time comes but that is not yet can i speak with the pharaoh  no queen he is up already giving audience to the nobles of memphis and trying cases from the lower land with his counsellors until it is time to start for this ceremony of the laying of the foundationstone of the temple whither you accompany him in state also it is as wellby tonight we may learn more come let me set the crown upon your head that these dogs of memphis may know their mistress    the ceremony proved very wearisome first there was the long chariot ride through the crowded shouting streets pharaoh and abi going in the first chariot and tua attended by abis eldest daughter a roundeyed lady much older than herself in the second next came the office of the priests of amen over which netertua as daughter of amen and highpriestess must preside to dedicate the temple to the glory of the god then the foundation deposit of little vases of offerings and models of workmens tools and a ring drawn from pharaohs hand engraved with his royal name were blessed and set by the masons in hollows prepared for them and the two great cornerstones let down hiding them for ever and declared respectively by pharaoh and by netertua morning star of amen joint sovereign of egypt to be well and truly laid  afterwards architects those who drew the line exhibited plans of the temple and received gifts from pharaoh and when these things were done came the midday feast and speeches  at length all was over and the great procession returned by another route to the temple of sekhet where pharaoh lodged a very tedious journey in the hot sun since it involved a circuit of the endless walls of memphis with stoppages before all the temples of the gods at each of which pharaoh must make offerings nor weary as he was might he rest for in the outer court of the old shrine thrones had been set up and seated on them he and tua must hear petitions till sunset and give judgment or postpone them for further consideration  at last there came to an end but as pharaoh tired out rose from his throne abi his brother who all this time had not left them said that he also had a private petition to prefer so they went into an inner court that had been a sanctuary and sat down again there being present besides the scribes only pharaoh the queen some councillors mermes captain of the guard and certain women of the royal household among them asti the queens nurse and merytra pharaohs favourite attendant with abi were his astrologer kaku his two eldest sons and a few of the great officers of his government also the highpriests of the temples of memphis and three powerful chiefs of the desert tribes  what is your prayer my brother asked pharaoh as soon as the doors were closed  a great one your majesties answered the prince prostrating himself which for the good of egypt and for your own good and for my good who reverence you as a loyal subject i pray that you will be pleased to grant then he drew himself up and said slowly i am here to ask the hand of the glorious queen netertua daughter of amen in marriage  now pharaoh stared at him while tua who knew well what was coming turned her head aside and asked a councillor who stood near if in the history of the land any queen of egypt had ever married her uncle  the councillor who was noted for his historical studies answered that at the moment he could recall no such case  then said tua coolly and still addressing him it seems that it would be scarcely wise to create a precedent which other poor young women of the royal race might be called upon to follow  pharaoh caught something of the words though abi did not for they were spoken in a low voice and bethought him of a way out of his difficulty  the queen netertua sits at my side and is coregent with me of this kingdom her mind is my mind and what she approves it is probable i shall approve prefer your request to her he said  so abi turned to the queen and laying his hands upon his heart bowed ogled and began  a burning love of your most excellent majesty moves me  i pray you my uncle interrupted tua correct your words which should begin a burning love of your most excellent majestys throne and power move me and so on  now abi frowned while everyone else smiled not excepting pharaoh and the astrologer kaku again he began his speech but so confusedly that presently tua stopped him for the second time saying  i am not deaf most noble prince my uncle i heard the words you used to pharaoh and even understood their import in fact i have already consulted our councillor here a learned master of the law as to the legality of such an alliance as you propose and he gives his judgment against it  now abi glared at the councillor a humble dusty old man who spent all his life among rolls and chronicles  may it please your majesty this lawyer exclaimed in a thin agitated voice i only said there was no record of such a marriage that i can remember though once i think a queen adopted a nephew who afterwards became pharaoh  it is the same thing friend replied tua sweetly for that of which there is no record in the long history of egypt must of necessity be illegal still if my uncle here wishes to adopt me i thank him though his lawful heirs may not and the matter is one that can be considered  now guessing that he was being played with abi grew angry  i have put a plain question to your majesty he said and perhaps i am worthy of a plain answer as all men know o queen it is time that you should be wed and i offer myself as your husband it is true that i am somewhat older than you are  in what year was the prince abi born the same as yourself did you say asked tua in an audible aside of the aged and learned councillor who thereon vanished behind the throne and was seen no more  but went on abi taking no notice of this interruption on the other hand i have much to offer i rule here your majesties who am also of the royal blood and there is some disaffection in the north especially among the great bedouin tribes of the desert who watch the frontier of the kingdom now if this alliance comes about and in days to be i sit upon the double throne as kingconsort of egypt they will be loyal and north and south will be united more closely than they ever were before whereas if it does not come about here kaku pretending to brush a fly from his face caught his hand in abis robe a signal at which his master paused  go on my uncle i pray you said tua if it does not come about what then  then queen there may be trouble nay leave me alone magician i will speak the truth chance what may pharaoh you have reigned for many years yes forty times has the nile overflowed its banks since we laid our divine father in the tomb now during all those years but one child has been born to you and that after i came to thebes to pray you to name me as your heir know pharaoh that there are many who find this strange and wonder whether this beautiful queen who is called daughter of amen and resembles you so little in body or in mind sits rightfully on the throne of egypt if i marry her these questionings will cease if i do not marry her the whisperings of men may grow to a wind that will blow the crown from off her head  now a grasp of fear and wonder rose from all who heard this bold and treasonable speech and tua reddening to the eyes bent forward as though to answer but before ever a word had passed her lips pharaoh sprang from his seat transformed with rage all his patient gentleness was gone and he looked so fierce and royal that everyone present there even abi himself quailed before him  is it for this that i have borne with you for so long my brother he cried rending at his robes is it for this that i spared you years ago in thebes when your life was forfeit for your treachery is it for this that i have suffered you to rise to great honour and to rule here almost as a king in my city of memphis was it not enough that i should sit quiet while you an old man the son of our fathers barbarian slave the looseliving despot dare to ask for the pure hand of egypts queen in marriage you her uncle who might well be her grandfather also must i also hear your foul mouth beslime her royal birth and the honour of her divine mother and spit sneers at amen father of the gods well amen shall deal with you when you come to the doors of his eternal house but here on earth i am his son and servant mermes call my guards and arrest this man and hold him safe at thebes whither we depart tomorrow he shall be judged according to our law  now mermes blew a shrill call on the silver whistle that hung about his neck and springing forward seized the prince by the arm abi drew his sword to cut him down and at the sight of the blade all who were with him rushed to the door to escape sweeping before them certain of pharaohs ladies among them the waitingwoman merytra but before ever they could pass it the guards who had heard the signal of mermes ran in with lifted spears driving them back again leaping upon abi they tore the sword from his hand and threw him to the ground huddling the rest together like frightened sheep  bind this traitor and keep him safe for tomorrow he accompanies us to thebes said pharaoh  what of his sons and those with him your majesty asked the officer of the guard  let them go answered pharaoh wearily for they have not sinned against us let them go and take warning from their masters fate  now as it chanced in the confusion merytra had been pushed against kaku  hearken whispered the astrologer into the womans ear do as i bid you last night and all will yet be well do it or die do you hear me  i hear and i will obey answered merytra in the same low voice  then they were separated for the guards took kaku by the arm and thrust him out of the temple together with the sons of abi  an hour later mermes and asti stood before pharaoh and prayed him that he would depart from memphis that very night saying that such was the counsel also of the queen and of his officers but pharaoh was tired out and would not listen  tomorrow when i have slept will be time enough he answered moreover shall i fly from my own city like a thief when naught is ready for our journey why do you press me to such a cowards act he added peevishly  for this reason your majesty answered mermes we are sure there is a plot to keep you here this afternoon you could not have gone had you tried but tonight abi being a prisoner his people are dismayed and having no leader will open the gates by tomorrow one may be found and they will be doublebarred and guarded  what asked the king scornfully do you mean that i am a prisoner also and here in egypt which i rule nay good friends at pharaohs word those gates will open or if they do not i will pull down memphis stone by stone and drive out its people to share their caves with jackals do they think because i am kind and gentle that i cannot lift the sword if there be need have they forgotten how i smote those rebels in my youth and gave their cities to the flames and set my yoke on syria that aided them we march tomorrow and not before i have spoken  now mermes bowed and turned to go since when those words had passed pharaohs lips it was not lawful to answer them yet asti dared to do so  o pharaoh she said be not wrath with your servant pharaoh as you know i have skill in divination the spirits of the dead whisper at times in my ears of things that are to be it seemed to me just now when having left the presence of the queen my fosterchild i stood a while alone in the darkness that the divine majesty of the great lady the royal wife ahura who was my friend and mistress stood beside me and said  go asti to pharaoh and say to pharaoh that great danger threatens him and our royal daughter say to himfly from memphis lest there he should be prepared for burial and the star of amen hidden by a cloud of shame bid him beware of one about his throne and of that evil magician with whom she made a pact last night  now pharaoh looked at asti and said  o dreamer of dreams interpret your own dream who is she about my throne of whom i should beware and who is the magician with whom she made a pact  the divine queen did not tell me pharaoh answered asti stubbornly but my own skill tells me she is merytra your favourite and the magician is kaku whom she visited last night  what exclaimed pharaoh laughing that longlegged old astrologer with the painted cap who ran so fast when his master was taken why he is nothing but a spy who has been in my pay for years a charlatan who pretends to knowledge that he may win the secrets of his prince and merytra too merytra who in bygone times warned me of this abis foolish plot asti you are highborn and wise one whom i love and honour much as does the queen my daughter but you can still be jealous as i have noted long asti be not deceived it was jealousy of merytra that whispered in your ears not the spirit of the divine ahura now go and take your terrors with you for this dark conspirator merytra waits in my chamber to unrobe me and talk me to sleep with her pleasant jests and gossip  pharaoh has spoken i go said asti in her quiet voice may pharaohs rest be sweet and his awaking happy    that night tua could not sleep whenever she shut her eyes visions rose before her mind terrifying fantastic visions in all of which the fat and hideous abi played a part thus she saw again the scene at her fathers fatal feast to the priest of kesh when asti by her magic had caused the likeness of a monkey to come from the jugglers vase only now it was abi who emerged from the vase a terrible abi with a red sword in his hand and pharaohs crown upon his head he leapt from the mouth of the vase he devoured her with his greedy eyes with stealthy steps he came to seize her and she could not stir an inch something held her fast upon her throne  she could bear it no moreshe opened her eyes stared at the darkness and out of the darkness came voices telling of death and war she thrust her fingers into her ears and tried to fix her thoughts on rames that brighteyed lightfooted lover of hers whom she so longed to see again without whom she was so lonely and undefended  where was rames she wondered what fate had overtaken him something in her seemed to answerdeath oh if rames were dead what should she do of what use was it to be queen of egypt the first woman in the world if rames were dead  loneliness insufferable loneliness seemed to get a hold of her she slipped from her bed and through the doorway of her little pylon chamber now she was upon the narrow stair and in face of her was that other chamber where asti slept someone was talking with her perhaps mermes was with his wife and if so she could not enter no it was astis voice and listening she could hear her murmuring prayers or invocations in solemn tones she pushed open the door and entered a little lamp burned in the room and by its feeble light she saw the whiterobed asti whose long hair fell about her standing with upturned eyes and arms outstretched to heaven suddenly asti saw her also though but dimly for she stood in the dense shadow and knew her not  advance o thou ghost and declare thyself for never was thy help more needed she said  it is no ghost but i said tua what dealings are these that you have with ghosts at this deadest hour of the night asti do not enough terrors encompass us that you must needs call on your familiar spirits to add to them  i call on the spirits to save us from them queen for like you i think that we are set in the midst of perils this night is full of sorcery i scent it in the air and strive to match spell with spell but why do you not sleep  i cannot asti i cannot fear has got hold of me oh i would that we had never come to this hateful memphis or set eyes upon its illomened lord that foul brute who seeks to make a wife of me  be not afraid lady said asti throwing her arms about tuas slight and quivering form tomorrow morning we march i have it from pharaoh and already the guard make preparations while as for the accursed abi he is in prison  there is no prison that will hold him asti save the grave oh why did not my father command him to be slain as i would have done then at least we should be free of him and he could never marry me  because it was otherwise decreed o netertua and pharaoh must fulfil his fate and ours for though he is so gentle none can turn him  as she spoke the words somewhere far beneath them arose a cry a voice of one in dread or woe and with it the sound of feet upon the stairs  what passes said asti leaping to the door  pharaoh is dead or dying answered the terrified voice without let her majesty come to pharaoh  they threw on their garments they ran down the narrow stair and across the halls till they came to the chamber of pharaoh there upon his bed he lay and about him were the physicians of his court he was speechless but his eyes were open and he knew his daughter for raising his hand feebly he beckoned to her and pointed at his feet  what is it man she asked of the head physician who by way of answer lifted the linen on the bed and showed her pharaohs legs and feet white and withered as though with fire  what sickness is this asked tua again  we know not o queen answered the physician for in all our lives we have never seen its like the flesh is suddenly wasted and the limbs are paralysed  but i know broke in asti this is not sickness it is sorcery pharaoh has been smitten by some foul spell of the prince abi or of his wizards say who was with him last  it seems that the lady of the footstool merytra sang him to sleep as was her custom answered the physician and left him about two hours ago so say the guard when i came in to see how his majesty rested but now i found him thus  now tua lifted up her head and spoke saying  my divine father is helpless and therefore again i rule alone in egypt hear me and obey let the prince abi be brought from his prison to the inner hall for i would question him at once let the waitingwoman merytra be brought also under guard with drawn swords  the officer of the watch bowed and departed to do the bidding of her majesty while others went to light the hall  soon he returned to an outer chamber whither tua had withdrawn herself while the physicians examined pharaoh  o queen he said with a frightened face be not wrath but the prince abi has gone he has escaped out of his prison and the waitingwoman merytra is gone also  how came this about asked tua in a cold voice  o queen the small gate was open for people passed in and out of it continually making preparation for tomorrows march it seems that about an hour ago the lady merytra came to the gate and showed pharaohs signet to the officer saying that she was on pharaohs business with her went a fat man dressed in the robe of a master of camels that in the darkness the officer thought was a certain arab of the desert who has been to and fro about the camels it is believed that this man was none other than the prince abi dressed in the arabs robe and that he escaped from his cell by some secret passage which was known to him a passage of the old priests the arab whose robes he wore cannot be found but perhaps he is asleep in some corner  bar the gates said tua and let none pass in or out asti take men with you and go search the room where merytra slept perchance she has returned again  so asti went and a while after reappeared carrying something enveloped in a cloth  merytra has gone o queen she said in an ominous voice leaving this behind hidden beneath her bed and she placed the object on a table  what is it the mummy of a child asked tua shrinking back  nay queen the image of a man  then throwing aside the cloth asti revealed the waxen figure shaped to the exact likeness of pharaoh or rather what remained of it for the legs were molten and twisted and in them could be seen the bones of ivory and the sinews of thin wire about which they had been moulded also beneath the chin where the tongue would be sharp thorns had been thrust up to the root of the mouth the thing was lifelike and horrible and as it was so was the dumb and stricken pharaoh on his bed  netertua hid her eyes for a while and leaned against the wall then she drew herself up and said  call the physicians and the members of the council and those who can be spared of the officers of the guard that everyone of them may see and bear witness to the hideous crime which has been worked against pharaoh by his brother the prince abi and the wizard kaku and their accomplice the woman merytra  so they were called and came and when they saw the dreadful thing lying in its waxen whiteness before them they wailed and cursed those who had wrought this abominable sorcery  curse them not said netertua who are already accursed and given over to the devourer of souls when their time shall come make a record of this deed o scribes and do it swiftly  so the scribes wrote the matter down and the queen and others who were present signed the writings as witnesses then netertua commanded that they should take the image and destroy it before it worked more evil and a priest of osiris who was present seized it and departed  but netertua went to pharaohs room and knelt by his bed watching him for he seemed to be asleep presently he awoke and looked round him wildly moving his lips for a while he could not speak then of a sudden his voice burst from him in a hoarse unnatural cry  they have bewitched me i burn i burn he screamed rolling himself to and fro upon the bed avenge me my daughter and fear nothing for the gods are about you i see their awful eyes oh i burn i burn  then his head fell back and the peace of death descended on his tortured brow  tua kissed his dead brow and knelt at his side in prayer after a little while she rose and said  it has pleased pharaoh the just and perfect to depart to his everlasting habitation in osiris make it known that this god is dead and that i rule alone in egypt send hither the priest of osiris that he may repeat the ritual of departing and you physicians do your office  so the priest came but at the door asti caught him by the hand and asked  how did you destroy the image of wax  i burned it upon the altar in the old sanctuary of this temple he answered  o fool said asti you should have buried it know that with the enchanted thing you have burned away the life of pharaoh also  then that priest fell swooning to the ground and another had to be summoned to utter the ritual of departing    chapter x  the coming of the ka  now it was morning and while the physicians embalmed the body of pharaoh as best they could tua consulted with her officers long and earnest was that council for all of them felt that their danger was very great abi had escaped and if he were retaken none knew better than he that his death and that of all his house would be the reward of his crimes and sorceries which could only be covered up in one wayby marriage with the queen of egypt moreover he had thousands of soldiers in the city and around it all of them sworn to his service whereas the royal guard was but five companies each of a hundred men trapped in a snare of streets and stone  one of them suggested that they should break a way through the wall of the temple and escape to the royal barges that lay moored on the nile beneath them and this plan was approved but when they went to set about the work it was seen that these barges had been seized and were already sailing away up the river so but two alternatives remainedto bide within the fortifications of the old temple and send out messengers for help or to march through the city boldly break down the gates if these were shut against them seize boats and sail up the nile for some loyal town or if that could not be done to take their chance in the open lands  now some favoured one scheme and some the other so that at last the decision was left with her majesty she thought awhile then said  here i will not stay to be starved out as we must ere ever an army could be gathered to rescue us and be given into the power of that vile and wicked man the murderer of the good god my father better that i should die fighting in the streets for then at least i shall pass undefiled to join him in his eternal habitation beyond the sun we march at midnight  so they bowed beneath her word and made ready while the women of his household raised a deathwail for pharaoh and criers standing on the high towers proclaimed the accession of netertua morningstar of amen glorious in ra hathor strong in beauty as sole lord and sovereign of the north and south and of egypts subject lands again and again they proclaimed it and of the multitudes who listened some cheered but the most remained silent fearing the vengeance of their prince whom the heralds summoned to do homage but who made no sign  night came at last at a signal the gates were opened and through them borne upon the shoulders of his councillors preceded by a small body of guards and followed by his women and household went the remains of pharaoh in a coffin roughly fashioned from the sycamore timbers of the temple with solemn step and slow they went as though they feared no harm the priests and singers chanting some ancient funeral hymn next followed the baggage bearers and after these the royal bodyguard in the midst of whom the queen clad in mail as a man rode in a chariot and with her the waitinglady asti wife of mermes  at first all went well for the great square in front of the temple was empty the procession of the body of pharaoh passed it and vanished down the street that led to the main gate a mile away now the guard formed into line to enter this street also when suddenly barring the mouth of it appeared great companies of men who had been hidden in other streets  a voice cried halt and while the guards reshaped themselves into a square about the person of the queen an embassy of officers among whom were recognised the four lawful sons of abi advanced and demanded in the princes name that her majesty should be given over to them saying that she would be treated with all honour and that those who accompanied her might go free  answer that the queen of egypt does not yield herself into the hands of rebels and of murderers then fall on them and slay them all cried netertua when mermes her captain had given her this message  so he went forward and returned the answer and next moment a flight of arrows from the queens guard laid low the four sons of abi and most of those who were with them  then the fight began one of the fiercest that had been known in egypt for many a generation the royal regiment it is true was but small but they were picked men and mad with despair and rage moreover tua the queen played no womans part that night for when these charged striving to cut a path through the opposing hosts she charged with them and by the moonlight was seen standing like an angry goddess in her chariot and loosing arrows from her bow also no hurt came to her or those with her or even to the horses that drew her it was as though she were protected by some unseen strength that caught the sword cuts and turned aside the points of spears  yet it availed not for the men of abi were a multitude and the royal guard but very few slowly an everlessening band they were pressed back first to the walls of the old temple of sekhet and then within its outer court now all who were left of them not fifty men under the command of mermes strove to hold the gate desperately they fought and one by one went down to death beneath the rain of spears  tua had dismounted from her chariot and leaning on her bow for all her arrows were spent watched the fray with asti at her side with a yell the troops of abi rushed through the gate killing as they came now surrounded by all who remained to her not a dozen men they were driven back through the inner courts through the halls to the pylon stairs  here the last stand was made step by step they held the stairs till at length there were left upon their feet only tua asti and mermes her husband who was sorely wounded in many places at the little landing between the rooms of the queen and asti while the assailants paused a moment the captain mermes mad with grief and pain turned and kissed his wife next he bowed before the queen saying  what a man may do i have done to save your majesty now i go to make report to pharaoh leaving you in charge of amen who shall protect you and to rames my son the heritage of vengeance farewell o daughter of amen till i see your star rise in the darkness of the underworld and to you beloved wife farewell  then uttering the warcry of his fathers those pharaohs who once had ruled in egypt the tall and noble mermes grasped his sword in both his hands and rushed upon the advancing foe slaying and slaying until he himself was slain  come with me o wife of a royal hero said tua to asti who had covered her eyes with her hand and was leaning against the wall  widow not wife queen did you not see his spirit pass  then tua led her up more steps to the top of the pylon tower where asti sank down moaning in her misery tua walked to the outermost edge of the tower and stood there waiting the end it was the moment of dawn on the eastern horizon the red rim of the sun arose out of the desert in a clear sky there upon that lofty pinnacle clad in shining mail and wearing a helm shaped like the crown of lower egypt tua stood in its glorious rays that turned her to a figure of fire set above a world of shadow the thousands of the people watching from the streets below and from boats upon the nile saw her and raised a shout of wonder and of adoration  the daughter of amenra they cried behold her clad in the glory of the god  soldiers crept up the stairs to the pylon roof and saw her also while now that the fray was ended with them came the prince abi  seize her he panted for the stairs were steep and robbed him of his breath  but the soldiers looked and shrank back before the majesty of egypt wrapped in her robe of light  we fear they answered the ghost of pharaoh stands before her  then netertua spoke saying  abi once a prince of egypt and hereditary lord of memphis but now an outcast murderer black with the blood of your king and of many a loyal man hear me the anointed queen of egypt hear me o man upon whom i decree the judgment of the first and second death come but one step near to my majesty and before your eyes and the eyes of all the multitude who watch i hurl myself from this hideous place into the waters of the nile yet ere i go to join dead pharaoh and side by side with him to lay our plaint against you before the eternal gods listen to our curse upon you from this day forward a snake shall prey upon your vitals gnawing upwards to your heart the spirits of pharaoh and of all his servants whom you have slain shall haunt your sleep never shall you know one more hour of happy rest through life henceforth you shall fly from a shadow and if you climb a throne it shall be such a one as that on which i stand encircled with the perilous depths of darkness thence you shall fall at last dying by a death of shame and the evil gods shall seize upon you o traitor and drag you to the maw of the eaterup of souls and therein you shall vanish for ever for aye you and all your house and all those who cling to you thus saith netertua speaking with the voice of amen who created her her father and the god of gods  now when the soldiers heard these dreadful words one by one they turned and crept down the stairs till at last there were left upon the pylon roof only the queen asti crouching at her feet and the monstrous abi her uncle  he looked at her and thrice he tried to speak but failed for the words choked in his throat a fourth time he tried and they came hoarsely  take off your curse o mighty queen he said and i will let you go i am old tonight all my lawful sons are dead take off your curse leave me in my government and though i desire you more than the throne of egypt o beautiful still i will let you go  nay answered the queen i cannot if i would it is not i who spoke but a spirit in my mouth do your worst o son of set the curse remains upon you  now abi shook in the fury of his fear and answered  so be it star of amen having nothing more to dread i will do my worst pharaoh my enemy is dead and you his daughter shall be my wife of your own free will or since no man will lay a finger upon you here in this tower you shall starve death is not yet i shall have my day it is sworn to me reign with me if you will or starve without me if you willi tell you daughter of amen that i shall have my day  and i tell you son of set that after the day comes the long terror of that night which knows no morrow  then finding no answer he too turned and went  when he was gone netertua stood a while looking down upon the thousands of people gathered in the great square where the battle had been fought who stared up at her in a deadly silence then she descended from the copingstone and taking asti by the arm led her from the roof to the little chamber where she had slept    six days had gone by and queen netertua starved in the pylon tower till now the water had held out for there was a good supply of it in jars but at last it was done while as for food they had eaten nothing except a store of honey which asti took at night from the bees that hived among the topmost pylon stones that day the honey was done also and if had not been without water to wash it down they could have swallowed no more of the sickly stuff indeed although in after years in memory of its help netertua chose the bee as her royal symbol never again could she bring herself to eat of the fruit of its labours  come nurse said tua let us go to the roof and watch the setting of ra perhaps for the last time since i think that we follow him through the western gates  so they went supporting each other up the steps for they grew weak from this lofty place they saw that save on the nile side of it which was patrolled by the warships of abi all the temple was surrounded by a double ring of soldiers while beyond the soldiers on the square where the great fight had been were gathered thousands of the people who knew that the starving queen was wont to appear thus upon the pylon at sunset  at the sight of her clad in the mail which she still wore a murmur rose from them like the murmur of the sea followed by a deep silence since they dared not declare the pity which moved them all in the midst of this silence whilst the sun sank behind the pyramids of the ancient kings netertua lifted up her glorious voice and sang the evening hymn to amenra as the last notes died away in the still air again the murmur rose while the darkness gathered about the pylon hiding her from the gaze of men  hand in hand as they had come the two deserted women descended the stair to their sleepingplace  they dare not help us asti said tua let us lie down and die  nay queen answered asti let us turn to one that giveth help to the helpless do you remember the words spoken by the shining spirit of ahura the divine  i remember them asti  queen i have waited long since the spell she whispered to me may be used once only but now i am sure that the moment is at hand when that which dwells within you must be called forth to save you  then call it forth asti answered tua wearily if you have the power if not oh let us die but say whom would you summon the glory of amen or the ghost of pharaoh or ahura my mother or one of the guardian gods  none of these answered asti for i have been bidden otherwise lie you down and sleep my fosterling for i have much to do in the hours of darkness when you awake you shall learn all  aye said tua when i awake if ever i do awake is it in your mind to kill me in my sleep asti is that your command well if so i shall not blame you for then i will break this long fast of mine with pharaoh and the divine mother ahura who bore me and together in the pleasant fields of peace we will wait for rames my lover and your son being a queen they will give my burial in my fathers tomb and that is all i crave of them and of this weary world sing me to rest nurse as you were wont to do when i was little and if it be your will tarry not long behind me  so she laid herself down upon the bed and taking her hand that had grown so thin the tall and noble asti bent over her in the darkness and began to sing a gentle chant or lullaby  tuas eyes closed her breath came slow and deep then asti the magician ceased her song and gathering up her secret strength put out her prayers prayer after prayer till at length all her soul was pure and she dared to utter the awful spell that ahura had whispered in her ear at the muttered holy words wild voices cried through the night the solid pylon rocked and in the city the crystal globe into which kaku and merytra gazed was suddenly shattered between them and white with terror at he knew not what abi sprang from his couch  then asti also sank into sleep or swoon and all was silent in that chamber silent as the grave    netertua awoke through the pylon windowplace crept the first grey light of dawn her eyes searching the gloom fell first upon the darkrobed figure of asti sleeping in a chair her head resting upon her hand then a brightness drew them to the foot of her bed and there clothed in a faint white light that seemed as though it were drawn from the stars and the moon wearing the double crown and arrayed in all the royal robes of egypt she sawherself  now tua knew that she dreamed and for a long while lay still for it pleased her starved and wretched as she was a prisoner in the hands of her foes a netted bird to let her fancy dwell upon this splendid image of what she had been before an evil fate speaking with the voice of merytra lady of the footstool had beguiled dead pharaoh to memphis if things had gone well with her she should be as that image was today that image which wore her crown and robes of state yes and her very jewels such were the changes of fortune even in the lives of princes whose throne seemed to be set upon a rock princes whom the god of gods had fathered never before in her young life had the thing come so home to her for until now even through the hunger and the fear her pride had borne her up but in this chilly hour that precedes the dawn the hour when as they say men are wont to die it was otherwise with her her end was nearshe knew it and understood that between the mightiest monarch in the world and the humblest peasant maid at the last there is no difference save perchance a difference of the soul within  here she lay a shadow who must choose between a miserable end by thirst and hunger or a loathsome marriage and what availed it that she was called morningstar of amen she the only child of pharaoh and of his royal wife and that when she was dead they would grant her a state funeral and inscribe her name among the lists of kings while abi the foul usurper sat upon her throne here on the bed lay what she was there at the foot of it stood what she should be if the gods had not deserted her  her poor heart was filled with bitterness like a cup with vinegar bitterness flowed through her in the place of blood it seemed hard to die so young she whom men named a god to die robbed of her crown robbed of her vengeance and taking with her her deep unfruitful love would she and rames meet beyond the grave she wondered would they wed and bear children there who should rule as pharaohs in the underworld would osiris redeem her mortal flesh and amen the father receive her or would she rush down into everlasting blackness where sleep is all in all  oh for one hour of strength and freedom one short hour while at the head of her armies she rolled down upon rebellious memphis in her might and trod its high walls flat and gave its palaces to the flames and cast its accursed prince to the jaws of crocodiles her sunk eyes flashed at the thought of it and her wasted bosom heaved and lo the eyes of that royal queen of her dreams flashed also as though in answer and on its breast the jewels rose as though pride or anger lifted them  then this marvel came to pass for the beautiful facecould her own ever have been so beautifulthe imperial face bent forward a little and from the red lips came a soft voice her own rich voice that said  speak your will queen and it shall be done i who stand here am your servant to command o morningstar o amens royal child  tua sat up in her bed and laughed at the vision  my will she said o dream why do you mock me let me think what is my will well dream it is that of the beggar at the gatei desire a drink of water and a crust of bread  they are there answered the figure pointing with the crystal sceptre in her hand to the table beside the couch  idly enough tua looked and so it was on the table stood pure water in a silver cup and by it cakes of bread upon a golden platter she stretched out her hand for surely this fantasy was pleasant and took that ghost of a silver cup her own cup that pharaoh had given her as a child and brought it to her lips and drank and lo water pure and cold flowed down her throat until at length even her raging thirst was satisfied then she stretched out her hand again and took the loaves of bread and ate them hungrily till all were gone and as she swallowed the last of them exclaimed in bitter shame  oh what a selfish wretch am i who have drunk and eaten all leaving nothing for my fostermother asti who lies asleep and dies of want as i did  fear not answered the dream look there are more for asti and it was true for the silver cup brimmed once more with cold water and on the golden platter were other cakes  now the dream spoke again  surely it said there were other wishes in your heart o morningstar than that for human sustenance  aye o dream i wished for vengeance upon abi the traitor abi the murderer of my father who would bring me to the last shame of womanhood i wished for vengeance upon abi and all who cling to him  the bright figure bowed stretching out its jewelled hands and answered  i am your servant to obey it shall be worked o queen such vengeance as you cannot dream of vengeance poured drop by drop like poison in his veins the torment of disappointed love the torment of horrible fear the torment of power given and snatched away the torment of a death of shame and the everlasting torment of the eaterup of soulsthis vengeance shall be worked upon abi and all who cling to him was there not another wish in your heart o morningstar o queen divine  aye answered tua but i may not speak it all even to myself in sleep  it shall be given to you o morningstar you shall find your love though far away beyond the horizon and he shall return with you and you twain shall rule in the upper and the lower land and in all the lands beyond with glory such as has not been known in egypt  now at length tua seemed to awake she rubbed her eyes and looked there was the sleeping asti there on the table beside her were the water and the bread there at the foot of the couch glimmering in the low lights of dawn was the glorious figure of herself draped in the splendid robes  who and what are you she cried are you a god or a spirit or are you but a mocking vision caught in the web of my madness  i am none of these things o morningstar i am yourself i am that ka whom our father amen gave to you at birth to dwell with you and protect you do you not remember me when as a child we played together  i remember answered tua you warned me of the danger of the sacred crocodile in the temple tank but since then i have never seen you what gives you the strength to appear in the flesh before me o double  the magic of asti with which she has been endowed from on high to save you netertua that gives me strength know that although you cannot always see me i am your eternal companion through life i go with you and when you die i watch in your tomb perfect incorruptible preserving your wisdom your loveliness and all that is yours until the day of resurrection i have power i have the secret knowledge which dwells in you although you cannot grasp it i remember the past the infinite infinite past that you forget i foresee the future the endless endless future that is hidden from you to which the life you know is but as a single leaf upon the tree but as one grain of sand in the billions of the desert i look upon the faces of the gods and hear their whisperings fate gives me his book to read i sleep secure in the presence of the eternal who sent me forth and to whom at last i return again my journey ended my work fulfilled bearing you in my holy arms o morningstar the spells of asti have clothed me in this magic flesh the might of amen has set me on my feet i am here your servant to obey  now amazed bewildered tua called out  awake nurse awake for i am mad it seems to me that a messenger from on high robed in my own flesh stands before me and speaks with me  asti opened her eyes and perceiving the beautiful figure rose and did obeisance to it but said no word  be seated said the ka and hear me time is short i awoke at the summons i came forth i am present i endure until the spell is taken off me and i return whence i came o interpreter speak the will of her of whom i am that i may do it in my own fashion there is foodeat and drink then speak  so asti ate and drank as tua had done and when she had finished and was satisfied behold the cup and the platter vanished away next in a slow quiet voice she spoke saying  o shadow of this royal star by my spells incorporate this is our case here we starve in misery and without the gate abi waits the end if the queen lives he will take her who hates him to be his wife if she dies he will seize her throne our wisdom is finished what must we do to save this star that it may shine serene until its appointed hour of setting  is that all you seek asked the double when she had finished  nay broke in tua hurriedly i would not shine alone i seek another star to share my sky with me  have you faith and will you obey asked the double again for without faith i can do nothing  now asti looked at tua who bowed her head in assent to an unspoken question then she answered  we have faith we will obey  so be it said the shadow presently abi will come to ask whether the queen consents to be his wife or whether she will bide here until she dies i who wear the fashion of the queen will go forth and be his wife oh such a wife as man never had before and as she spoke the words an awful look swept across her face and her deep eyes flamed ill goes it with the mortal man who weds a wraith that hates him and is commanded to work his woe she added  now asti and tua understood and smiled then the queen said  so you will sit in my seat o shadow and as your lord abi will sit on pharaohs throne and find it hard but what of egypt and my people  fear not for egypt and your people o morning star with these it shall go well enough until you come back to claim them  and what of my companion and myself asked tua  the double raised her sceptre and pointed to the open windowspace between them beneath which hundreds of feet beneath ran the milky waters of the river  you shall trust yourselves to the bosom of father nile she answered solemnly  now the queen and asti stared at each other  that means said tua that we must trust ourselves to osiris for none can fall so far and live  think you so o star where then is that faith you promised without which i can do nothing nay i tell no more do my bidding or let me go and deal with abi as it pleases you choose now he draws near and as she spoke the words they heard the bronze gates of the temple clash upon their hinges  tua shivered at the sound then sprang from the couch and drew herself to her full height exclaiming  for my part i have chosen never shall it be said that pharaohs daughter was a coward better the breast of osiris than the arms of abi or slow death in a dungeon in amen and in thee o double i put my trust  the shadow looked from her to asti who answered briefly  where my lady goes there i follow knowing that mermes always waits what shall we do  the ka motioned to them to stand together in the narrow windingplace and this they did their arms about each other next she lifted her sceptre and spoke some word  then fire flashed before their eyes a rush of wind beat upon their brows and they knew no more    chapter xi  the dream of abi  on the night of the drawingforth of the ka of netertua kaku the wizard and merytra the spy she who had been lady of the footstool to pharaoh sat together in that high chamber where merytra had vowed her vow and received the magic image  why do you look so disturbed asked the astrologer of his accomplice who glanced continually over her shoulder and seemed very ill at ease all has gone well if set himself had fashioned that image it could not have done its work more thoroughly  thoroughly indeed broke in merytra in an angry voice you have tricked me wizard i promised to help you to lame pharaoh not to murder him  hush beloved said kaku nervously murder is an ugly word and murderers come to ugly endssometimes is it your fault if an accursed fool of a priest chose to burn the mannikin upon an altar and thus bring this god to his lamented end  no answered merytra not mine or the priests but yours and that hog abis and sets the master of both of you but i shall get the blame of it for the queen and asti know the truth and soon or late it will come out and they will burn me as a sorceress sending me to the underworld with the blood of pharaoh upon my hands pharaoh who never did me aught but good and then what will happen to me  evidently kaku did not know for he rose and stood opposite to her scratching his lean chin and smiling in a sickly indeterminate fashion that enraged merytra  cease grinning at me like an ape of the rocks she said and tell me what is to be the end of this evil business  why trouble about ends fair one he asked they are always a long way off indeed the best philosophers hold that there is no such thing as an end you know the sacred symbol of a snake with its tail in its mouth that surrounds the whole world but begins where it ends and ends where it begins it may be seen in any tomb  cease your talk of snakes and tombs burst in merytra the thought of them makes me shudder  by all means beloved i have always held that we egyptians dwell too much on tombs andwhatever it may be that lies beyond them which after all remains a matter of doubtfortunately so let us turn from tombs and corpses to palaces and life as i said just now although we grieve over the accident of pharaohs death and that of all his guard and i may add of abis four legitimate sons things have gone well for us today i have received from the prince in writing my appointment as vizier and first kings companion to come into force when he mounts the throne as he must do and today you have received from me with all the usual public rites and ceremonies the name of wife as i promised that you should merytra you are the wife of the great vizier the preeminent lord the sole companion of the king of egypt a high position for one who after all during the late reign was but pharaohs favourite and lady of the footstool  a footstool of silk is more comfortable to sit on than a state chair fashioned of bloodstained swords hearken you kaku i am afraid you say that you are the greatest of seers and can read the future well i desire to know the future so if you are not a charlatan show it to me  a charlatan how can you suggest it merytra remembering the adventure of the image  that may have been an accident pharaoh was sickly for years and had a stroke before if you are not a cheat show me the future in that magic crystal i would learn the worst so that i may know how to meet it when it comes  well wife we will try though to see such high visions the spirit should be calm which i fear yours is notnay be not angry we will try we will try sit here now and gaze and above all be silent while i say the appropriate spells  so the ball of crystal having been set upon the table the pair stared into it as kaku muttered his charms and invocations for a long while merytra saw nothing till suddenly a shadow gathered in the ball which slowly cleared away revealing the image of dead pharaoh clothed in his mummy wrappings as she started back to scream the image seemed to loose its hands from the cloths that bound them and strike outwards whereon the crystal suddenly shattered so that the pieces of it flew about the room one of which struck her on the mouth knocking out two of her front teeth and gashing her lips  merytra uttered a cry and fell backwards to the floor while kaku sprang from his chair as though to run away then thought better of it and stood still shivering with fear  what was that said merytra rising from the ground and wiping the blood from her cut mouth  i do not know answered kaku in a quavering voice it would seem that the gods deny to us that knowledge of the future which you sought be content with the present merytra  content with the present she screamed infuriated look at what the present has given mea mouthful of blood and teeth i who was beautiful am spoiled for ever i am become an old hag pharaoh burst the ball with his hand and threw the pieces at me i saw him do it and you set him there wretch i will pay you back for this evil trick and springing at kaku she tore of his astrologers cap and the wig beneath it and beat his bald head with them till he cried for mercy  it was at this moment that the door opened and through it breathless white with terror halfclothed appeared none other than the prince abi  what passes here he gasped sinking into a chair is this the way you conduct your midnight studies kaku  certainly not most high lord replied the astrologer trying to bow with his eye fixed on merytra who stood by him the torn wig in her hand in the act of striking certainly not exalted prince a domestic difference that is all this wild cat of a woman whom i have married having met with an accident gave way to her devilish temper  repeat that exclaimed merytra and i will throw you from the windowplace to find out whether your sorceries can make pavingstones as soft as air see lord what he has done to me by his accursed wizardry and she exhibited her two front teeth in her shaking hand i say that he set the spirit of pharaoh whom he beguiled me to do to death in the crystal for i saw him there wrapped in his mummy clothes and caused dead pharaoh to burst the crystal and stone me with its fragments  be silent woman shouted abi or i will have you beaten with rods till your feet hurt more than your mouth what is this about the spirit of pharaoh kaku is he everywhere for know it is of pharaoh the dweller in osiris that i came to speak to you  most exalted ruler of the north son of royal blood hereditary count who shall be king  cease your titles knave exclaimed abi and listen for i need counsel and if you cannot give it i will find one who can just now i lay on my bed asleep and a dreadful vision came to me i dreamed that i woke up and feeling a weight on the bed beside me turned to learn what it was and saw there the body of my brother pharaoh in his deathwrappings  as i saw him in the ball broke in merytra did he pelt you also o abi  nay woman he did worse he spoke to me he saidyou my brother to whom i forgave all your sins you and the womansnake that i cherished in my bosom and your servant the blacksouled magician her accomplice have done me miserably to death and set the queen of both the lands amens royal child to starve in yonder tower with the noble lady asti until she dies or takes you to be her husbandyou her uncle who seek her beauty and my throne now i have a message for you from the gods who write down these things in their eternal books against the day of judgment when we all shall meet and plead our cause before them osiris the redeemer standing on the right hand and the eaterup of souls standing on the left  this is the message o abigo to the temple of sekhet at the dawn there you shall find that royal loveliness which you desire take it to be your wife as you desire for it shall not say you nay be wedded to that loveliness with pomp before all the eyes of egypt and reign by right of that royalty until you meet one rames son of mermes whom you also murdered and with him a certain beggarman who is charged with another message for you o abi ascend the nile to thebes and lay this body of mine in the splendid tomb which i have made ready and sit in my seat and do those things which that royal loveliness you have wed commands to you for it you shall obey but hasten hasten abi to hollow for yourself a grave and let it be near to mine for when you are dead this my ka would come to visit you as it does tonight  then the ka or the body of pharaohi know not which it wasceased from speaking and lay there a while staring at me with its cold eyes till at length the spirits of my four sons who are dead entered the chamber and lifting up the shape carried it away i awoke shaking like a reed in the wind and ran hither up a thousand steps to find you brawling with this lowborn slut dead pharaohs wornout shoe that in bygone years i kicked from off my foot  now merytra would have answered for she loved not such names but the two men looked at her so fiercely that her rage died and she was silent  read me this vision man and be swift for the torment of it haunts me went on abi if you cannot i strip you of your offices and give your carcase to the rods until you find wisdom it was you who set me on this path and by the gods you shall keep me safe in it or die by inches  now seeing his great danger kaku grew cold and cunning  it is true o prince he said that i set you on this path this high and splendid path and it is true also that from the beginning i have kept you safe in it had it not been for me and my counsel long ago you would have become but a forgotten traitor remember that night at thebes when in your pride you desired to smite at the heart of pharaoh and how i held your hand and remember how many a time my wisdom has been your guide when left to your own rash folly you must have failed or perished it is true also prince that in the future as in the past with me and by me you stand or fall yet if you think otherwise find some wiser man to lead you and wait the end all the rods in egypt cannot be broken on my back o abi now shall i speak who alone have knowledge or will you seek another counsellor  speak on answered abi sullenly we are fish in the same net and share each others fortune to the end whether it be sets gridiron or fat egypts pleasure pond fear not what i have promised you shall have while it is mine to give  just now you promised rods remarked kaku making a wry face and replacing the remains of his wig upon his bald head but let that pass now as to this dream of yours i find its meaning good how did pharaoh come to you not as a living spirit but in the fashion of a dead man and who cares for dead men  i do for one when they cut my mouth with broken crystals interrupted merytra who was bathing her wounds in a basin of water  would that they had cut your tongue instead of your lips woman snarled abi continue kaku and heed her not  and what was his message went on the magician why that you shall marry the majesty of egypt and rule in her right and sit in the seat of kings are not these the very things that you desire and have worked for years to win  yes kaku but you forget all that about one rames and the tomb that i must hollow and the rest  rames merytra here can tell you of him prince he is the madcap young count who killed the prince of kesh and was sent by netertua far to the southlands that the barbarians there might make an end of him without scandal if ever he should come back with the beggarman and his message which is not likely you can answer him with the halter he deserves  aye kaku but how will the queen answer him there are stories afloat  lies every one of them prince she would have executed him at once had it not been for the influence of mermes and her fostermother asti this rames has in him the royal blood of the last dynasty and the star of amen is not one who will share her sky with a rival star unless he be her lawful lord which is your part if rames or the foul beggar brings you any message it will be that you are king of kesh as well as of egypt and then you can kill him and take the heritage a fig for rames and its stalk for the beggar  perhaps replied abi more cheerfully at any rate i do not fear that risk but how about all pharaohs talk of tombs  being dead prince it is natural that the mind of his ka should run on tombs and his own royal burial which as a matter of policy we must give to him besides there the prophesy was safe since to these same tombs all must come especially those of us who have seen the nile rise over sixty timesas i have he added hastily when we reach the tomb it will be time to deal with its affairs till then let us be content with life and the good things it offers such as thrones and find the love of the most beautiful woman in the world and the rest harvest your corn when it is ripe prince and do not trouble about next years crop or whether in his grave pharaohs double eats white bread or brown pharaohs daughteror amensis your business not his ghost  yes good soothsayer said abi she is my business but one more question why did that accursed mummy speak of her as itin my dream i meanas though she were no woman but something beyond woman  for a moment kaku hesitated for the point was hard to answer then he replied boldly  because as i believe prince this queen with whom the gods are rewarding your deserts is in truth more than woman being amens very daughter and therefore in those realms whence the dream came she is known not as woman but by her title of royal loveliness oh went on kaku simulating an enthusiasm that in truth did not glow within his breast great and glorious is your lot king of the world and splendid the path which i have opened to your triumphant feet it was i who showed you how pharaoh might be trapped in memphis being but a poor fool easy to deceive and it was ior rather merytra yonderwho rid you of him and now it is i the master whom you threatened with rods that alone can interpret to you the happy omen of a dream which you thought fearsome think of the end of it prince and banish every doubt who bore away the shape of pharaoh why the spirits of your sons thus symbolising the triumph of your house  at least they will have no share in it kaku for they are dead said abi with a groan for he had loved his sons  what of that prince they died bravely and we mourn them but here again fortune is with you for had they lived trouble might have arisen between them and those other sons which the queen of egypt shall bear to you  mayhap mayhap replied abi waving his hand for the subject was painful to him but this queen is not yet my wife she is starving in yonder tower and what am i to do if i try to force my presence upon her she will destroy herself as she swore and if i leave her there any longer being mortal she must die moreover i dare not for even these folk of memphis who love me begin to murmur egypts queen is egypts queen and they will not suffer that she should perish miserably being beautiful and young and one who takes all hearts this night at sunset they gathered in tens of thousands round the tower to hear her sing that evening hymn to ra and afterwards marched past my palace shouting in the darkness give food to her majesty and free her or we will moreover by now the news must have come to thebes and there a great army will gather to liberate or avenge her what am i to do prophet  do what dead pharaoh bade you in your dream prince at the hour of dawn go to the temple of sekhet where you will find the queen become obedient to your wishes for did not the dream declare that she will not say you nay then lead her to your palace and marry her in the face of all men and rule by right of her majesty and of your own conquering arm  it can be tried said abi for then at least we shall learn what truth there is in dreams but what of this asti her companion  asti has been an ill guide to her majesty prince replied kaku rubbing his chin as he always did when there was mischief in his mind moreover she is advanced in years and must be weak with grief and hunger if she still lives merytra here will take her in charge and care for her you are old friends are you not merytra  very answered that lady with emphasis like the cat and the bird which were pets of the same master well we shall have much to say to each other only beware husband asti is no weakling your magic may be strong but hers is stronger for she is a great priestess and draws it from godsnot devils    so it came about that at dawn prince abi clad in magnificent robes and accompanied by councillors among them kaku and by a small guard was carried in a litter to the gates of the old temple of sekhet being too heavy to walk so far and there descended as there were none to defend them these gates were opened easily enough and they passed through leaving the guard without when they came to the inner court abi stopped and asked where they should search  in one place only your highness answered kaku that pylon tower which overlooks the nile for there her majesty starves with asti  pylon tower grumbled abi have i not climbed enough steps this night still lead on  so they went to the narrow stair up which the thin kaku ran like a cat while the officers pushed and led the huge abi behind him on the third landing they all halted at abis command  hurry not he said in a thick whisper her majesty dwells on the next floor of this hateful tower and since asti is with her she cannot be surprised beware then of frightening her by your sudden appearance lest she should run to the top of the pylon and hurl herself into the nile as she has sworn that she will do halt now and i will call to her when i have got my breath  so after a while he called saying  o queen cease to starve yourself in this miserable abode and come down to dwell in plenty with your faithful subject  he called it once and twice and thrice but there was no answer now abi grew afraid  she must have perished he said and egypt will demand her blood at my hands kaku go up and see what has happened you are a magician and have nothing to fear  but the astrologer thought otherwise and hesitated till abi in a rage lifted his cedar wand to strike him on the back then he went step by step slowly pausing at each step to address prayers and praises to her majesty of egypt at length he came to the door of the queens chamber and kneeling down peeped into it to see that it was quite empty next he crawled across the landing to the chamber opposite that which had been astis and found it empty also then made bold by fear he ascended to the pylon roof but here too there was no one to be seen so he returned and told abi who shouted  by ptah great lord of memphis either she has escaped to raise egypt on me or she has sought death in the nile to raise the gods upon me which is worse so much for your interpretation of dreams o cheat  wait till you are sure before you call me such names prince replied kaku indignantly let us search the temple she may be elsewhere  so they searched it court by court and chamber by chamber till they came to that inner hall in front of the sanctuary where pharaoh had set up his throne while he sojourned at memphis this hall was a dark place into which light flowed only through the gratings in the clerestory being roofed in with blocks of granite laid upon its lotusshaped columns now at the hour of sunrise the gloom in it was still deep so deep that the searchers felt their way from pillar to pillar seeing nothing presently however a ray of light from the rising sun sped through the opening shaped like the eye of osiris in the eastern wall and as it had done for thousands of years struck upon the shrine of the goddess and the throne that was set in front of it revealing the throne and seated thereon netertua her majesty of egypt  glorious she looked indeed a figure of flame set in the midst of darkness the royal robe she wore glittered in the sunlight glittered her sceptre her jewels and the uræi on her double crown but more than all of them glittered her fierce and splendid eyes indeed there was something so terrible in those eyes that the beholders who discovered them thus suddenly shrank back whispering to each other that here sat a goddess not a woman for in her calmness her proud beauty and her silence she seemed like an immortal one victorious who had triumphed over death not a woman who for seven days had starved within a tower  they shrank back they huddled themselves together in the doorway and there remained whispering till the growing light fell on them also but the figure on the throne took no heed only stared over their heads as though it were lost in mystery and thought  at length kaku gathering courage said to abi  o prince there is your bride such a bride as never man had before go now and take her and all the others echoed  go now o prince and take her  thus adjured for very shames sake abi advanced looking often behind him till he came to the foot of the throne and stood there bowing  for a long while he stood bowing thus till he grew weary indeed for he knew not what to say then suddenly a clear and silvery voice spoke above him asking  what do you here lord of memphis why are you not in the cell where pharaoh bound you oh i rememberthe footstoolbearer merytra your paid spy let you out did she not why is she not here with kaku the sorcerer who fashioned the enchanted image that did pharaoh to death is it because she stays to doctor those false lips of hers that were cut last night before you went to ask yonder kaku to interpret a certain dream which came to you  how did you learn these things have you spies in my palace o queen  yes my uncle i have spies in your palace and everywhere what amen sees his daughter knows now you have come to lead me away to be your wife have you not well i await you i am ready do it if you dare  if i dare why should i not dare o queen asked abi in a doubtful voice  surely that question is one for you to answer count of memphis and its subject nomes yet tell me thiswhy did the magic crystal burst asunder without cause in the chamber of kaku last night and why do you suppose that kaku interpreted to you all the meaning of your dreamhe who will never tell the truth unless it be beneath the rods  i do not know queen answered abi but with kaku i can speak later if need be after the fashion you suggest and he glanced at the magician wrathfully  no prince abi you know nothing and kaku knows nothing save that rods break the backs of snakes unless they can find a wall to hide in and she pointed to the astrologer slinking back into the shadow no one knows anything save me to whom amen gives wisdom with sight of the future and what i know i keep were it otherwise o abi i could tell you things that would turn your grey hair white and to kaku and merytra the spy promise rewards that would make the torturechamber seem a bed of down but it is not lawful nor would they sound pleasant in this bridal hour  now while kaku between his chattering teeth muttered the words of protection in the shadow abi and his courtiers stared at this terrible queen as boys seeking wild fowls eggs in the reeds and stumbling on a lion stare ere they fly twice indeed the prince turned looking towards the door and the pleasant light without for it seemed to him that he was entering on a dark and doubtful road then he said  your words o queen cut like a twoedged sword and methinks they leave a poison in the wound say now if you are human how it comes about that after seven days of want your flesh is not minished nor has your beauty waned say also who brought to you those glorious robes you wear here in this empty temple and where is your fostermother asti  the gods fed me answered the queen gently and brought me these robes that i might seem the more worthy of you o prince and as for asti i sent her to cyprus to fetch a scent they make there and nowhere else no i forgot it was yesterday she went to bring the scent from cyprus that now is on my hair today she is in thebes seeing to a business of mine that is no secret i will tell it youit is as to the carving of all the history of his murder and betrayal in the first chamber of the pharaohs tomb  now at these magical and illomened words the courage of the company left them so that they began to walk backwards towards the door abi going with them  what cried the queen in a voice of sorrow that yet seemed laden with mockery would you leave me here alone do my power and my wisdom frighten you alas i cannot help them for when the full vase is tilted the wine will run out and when light is set behind alabaster then the white stone must shine yet am i one meet to adorn the palace of the king even such a king as you shall be o abi whom osiris loves see now i will dance and sing to you as once i sang to the prince of kesh before the sword of rames took away his life so that you may judge of me abi you who have looked upon so many lovely women  as she spoke very slowly so slowly that they could scarcely see her move she glided from the throne and standing before them began to move her feet and body and to chant a song  what were the words of that song none could ever remember but to every man there present it opened a door in his heart and brought back the knowledge of youth she whom he had loved best danced before him her tender hands caressed him the words she sang were sighs which the dead had whispered in his ears even to abi old unwieldy and steeped in cunning these soft visions came although it is true that it seemed to him that this lovely singer led him to a precipice and that when she ceased her song and appeared to vanish to seek her he leapt into the clouds that rushed beneath  now the dance was done and the last echoes of the music died away against the ancient walls whence the images of sekhet the catheaded watched them with her cruel smile of vengeance the dance was done and the beautiful dancer stood before them unflushed unheated but laughing gently  now go divine prince she said and you his followers go all of you and leave me to my lonely house until pharaoh sends for me to share that new realm which he inherits beyond the west  but they would not go and could not if they would for some power bound them to her while as for abi he scarce could take his eyes from her but heedless of who heard them babbled out his passion at her feet while the rest glowered on him jealously she listened always smiling that same smile that was so sweet yet so inhuman then when he stopped exhausted at last she spoke saying  what do you love now more greatly than you fear as the divine prince of kesh loved after amens star had sung to him may your fate be happier o noble abi but that since it is not lawful that i should tell it to you you shall discover abi there shall be a royal marriage in memphis of such joy and feasting as has not been known in the history of the northern or the southern land and for your allotted span you shall sit by the side of egypts queen and shine in her light have you not earned the place by right of blood o conqueror of pharaoh and did not pharaoh promise it to you in your sleep come the sun of this new day shines let us walk in it and bid farewell to shadows    chapter xii  the royal marriage  a strange rumour ran through memphis it was said that the queen had yielded it was said that she would marry the prince abi that she was already at the great white house waiting to be made a bride men wrangled about in the streets they swore that it could not be true for would this high lady the anointed pharaoh of egypt take her fathers murderer and her own uncle to husband would she not rather die in her prison tower on which night by night they had seen her stand and sing in their hearts they thought that she should die for thus they had summed her up this pure highhearted daughter of amen whom fate had caught in an evil net yes being men they held that she ought to die and leave a story in the world whereof egypt could be proud for ever  but their wives and daughters mocked at them after all she was but a woman they argued and was it likely that she would throw aside the pomp of rule and the prospect of long years in order to steal away into the shadows of a forgotten tomb henceforth it was true she must take second place for abi would be a stern master to her still any place was better than a funeral barge she had felt the pinch of hunger yonder in that old temple her fierce spirit had been tamed she had kissed the rod and after long years of waiting abi would be pharaoh in egypt  the dispute grew hot for even those men who rebelled against her in their hearts had set her high and grieved to think of her the divine lady bowing her neck to the common yoke of circumstance and selling herself for safety and a seat on the steps of her own throne but the women mocked on and showed them that as they had always said she was no better than others of her sex  presently the matter was settled for heralds appeared crying throughout the city that the marriage would take place in the great hall of the white house one hour before sundown then the women laughed in triumph and the men were silent  it was the appointed hour and that hall was filled to overflowing by all who could gain entrance there between the towering obelisks that stood on either side the open cedar doors folk hung upon its steps like hiving bees the vast square without and all the streets that led to it were black with them here it is true they could see nothing still they fought for the merest foothold and some of those who fell never rose again at the head of the hall were set two thrones the greater and the richer throne for abi the prince the lesser throne for netertua the queen he had arranged it thus since kaku the cunning pointed out to him that from the first he should show the people that it was he who ruled and not pharaohs daughter  it was the appointed hour and at some signal from every temple top rang out the blare of trumpets thrice they sounded and echoed into silence in that hot still air thus announcing that in the temple of hathor and the presence of the priests of all the gods the hands of abi and netertua had been joined in marriage  another rumour began to run among the crowd like the ring set circling by a stone in water it spread from mouth to mouth ever widening as it went  marvels had happened in the temple of hathor that was the rumour moreover it gave details that the highpriest had handed to the bride the accustomed lotusbud the flower of the goddess and lo it opened in her hand also it was said that presently the stem of it turned to a sceptre of gold and the cup of the bloom to sapphire stones more perfect far than any from the desert mines  nor was this all so went the tale for when as he must the bridegroom abi offered the white dove to hathor in her shrine a hawk swept through the doorway and smote it in his very hand yes there in the gloom of the shrine smote it and left it dead blood running from its beak and breast dead upon the knees of the goddess left it and was gone again  now what hawk asked the people of each other dare such a deed as this unless in truth it was sent by the hawkheaded horus the son of amenra  soon these matters were forgotten for the moment since now it was known that the royal pair were entering the great white hall there to show themselves to the people and receive the homage of the nobles chiefs and captains first advancing by the covered way which led from the temple of hathor appeared the priests in their robes chanting as they walked followed by the masters of ceremonies butlers and heralds next surrounded by his officers and guard came the prince abi himself accompanied by his vizier kaku he whose magic was said to have brought pharaoh to his end  not all his pomp nor the splendour of his apparel whereof the whiteness as many noted was spotted with illomened blood nor even the royal crown which now for the first time was set upon his huge round head could hide from those who watched that this bridegroom was ill at ease even as he stood there bowing in answer to the obsequious shouts of the multitude the sceptre in his fat hand shook and his red lips blanched and trembled still he smiled and bowed on till at length the shouting died away and quiet fell upon the place  abi was forgotten they waited the coming of the queen and though no herald called her advent yet every heart of all those thousands felt that she drew near to them look yonder she stood they had watched closely enough yet none saw her come doubtless because the shadows were thick but there she stood quite alone upon the edge of the dais in front of the two thrones and oh she was different from what they had expected thus now she wore no gorgeous robes but only a simple garment of purest white cut low upon her bosom where the red rays of the sinking sun striking up the hall revealed to every eye that dark mole shaped like the cross of life which was her wondrous birthmark but two ornaments adorned her the double snakes of royalty golden with red eyes set in front of her tall white headdress which none but she might wear the crowns of upper and of lower egypt and of all the subject lands and in her hand a sceptre fashioned of gold and surmounted by a lotusbloom of sapphire that sceptre of which rumour had told the magic tale  yes she was different they had thought to see a woman weak and pale her eyes still red with grief her face still stained with tears one who had been tamed by misfortune hunger and the fear of death whence she had bought herself by marriage with her conqueror but it was not so for never had the star of amen shone half so beautiful never had they seen such majesty in those deep blue eyes that looked them through and through as though they read the secret heart of every one of them her tall and lovely form had not wasted her cheeks were red with the glow of health power and dignity flowed from her presence fear seemed beneath her feet  now no voice was lifted up they stared at her and smiling a little she answered them with her calm eyes till their heads sank beneath her gaze then at length in the midst of that dead oppressive silence which none dared to break she turned and they heard the sweep of her silken robe upon the alabaster floor  with an effort two chamberlains stepped forward their wands of office in their hands to lead her to her seat but she waved them back and said in her clear voice  nay here i am alone of all the millions who serve her not one is left to lead amens daughter and egypts queen to her rightful place therefore she takes it of her own strength now and for evermore  then very slowly still in the midst of silence she mounted the greater throne that had been prepared for abi and there seated herself and waited  now murmuring rose among the courtiers and kaku whispered into abis ear while the multitude held its breath abi stamped his foot and issued orders which all seemed to fear to execute at length he stepped forward addressing the queen in a hoarse voice  lady he said doubtless you know it not but that place is mine your seat is on my left be pleased to take it  why so prince abi she asked quietly  lady he answered because the husband takes precedence of the wife and he added with savage meaning the conqueror of the conquered  the conqueror of the conquered she repeated after him in a musing voice should you not have saidthe murderer of the murdered and his seed nay prince abi you are wrong the sovereign of egypt by right divine takes precedence of her vassal even though it has pleased the gods whose will she has come to execute to command her to give to him the name of husband until that will is more fully known come now and do homage to your queen and after you those slaves of yours who dared to lift the sword against her  then a great tumult arose a tumult of rage and of dismay for well nigh all in that vast place were partners in this crime and knew that if netertua prevailed death yawned wide for them  they shouted to abi to take no heed of her they shouted to him to tear her from the throne to kill her and seize the crown they drew their swords and raged like an angry sea those who were loyal among them to pharaohs house and those who feared turmoil began to work their way backwards and slipped by twos and threes out of the great open doors till tua had no friend left in all that hall but ever as they went others of the turbulent and the rebellious who had been concerned in the slaughter of pharaohs guard took their place pouring in from the mob without  wild desertdwellers of the bedouin tribes who for thousands of years had been the bitter enemies of egypt descendants of the hyksos whose forefathers had ruled the land for a dozen generations and at last been driven out those hyksos whose blood ran in abis veins and who looked to him to lift them up again evildoers who had sought shelter in his regiments hooknosed semites from the lebanon black barbarian savages from the shores of puntwith such as these was that hall filled  abi was the hope of every one of them to him they looked for the spoils of egypt and before them on abis throne they saw a woman who stood between them and their ends who in her ancient pride dared to demand that he her husband should do homage to her and who tomorrow if she conquered would give them to the sword  tear her to pieces they screamed the bastard whom childless pharaoh palmed off upon the land she is a sorceress who keeps fat on airan evil spirit away with her or if you fear then let us come  at length they had roared themselves hoarse at length they grew still then abi who all this while had stood there hesitating and now and again turning to hearken to kaku who whispered in his ear looked up at tua and spoke  you see and you hear queen he said my people mistrust you and they are a rough people i cannot hold them back for long if once they get at you very soon that sweet body of yours will be in more fragments than was osiris after set had handled him  now tua who hitherto had sat still and indifferent like one who takes no heed seemed to awake and answered  a bad example prince for osiris rose again did he not then she leaned back and once more was silent  do you still desire that i should do homage to you queen i your husband he asked presently  why not she replied i have spoken a decree of pharaoh may not be changed and though a woman i ampharaoh  now abi went white with rage and turned to his guard to bid them drag her from the throne but she who was watching him suddenly lifted her sceptre and spoke in a new voice a clear strong voice that rang through the hall and even reached those who were gathered on the steps without  there is a question between you and me o people she said and it is thisshall i your queen rule in egypt as my fathers ruled or shall yonder man rule whom by the decree of amen i have taken for husband now you who for the most part have the hyksos blood running in your veins as he has desire that he should rule and you have slain the good god my father and would make abi king over you and see me his handmaid one to give him children of my royal race no more see you are a multitude and my legions are far away and ii am alone one lamb among the jackals thousands and thousands of jackals who for a long while have been hungry how then shall i match myself against you  you cannot shouted a wildeyed spokesman come down lamb and kneel before the lion abi or we the jackals will rend you we will not acknowledge you we who are of the fierce hyksos blood while the obelisks stand that were set up by the great hyksos pharaoh whose descendant was abis mother while the obelisks stand that are set there for all eternity we will not acknowledge you come down and take your place in our lords harem o pharaohs bastard daughter  ah tua repeated after him while the obelisks stand that the hyksos thief set up you will not acknowledge me pharaohs bastard daughter  then she paused and seemed to grow disturbed she sighed wrung her hands a little and said in a choking voice  i am but one woman alone among you my father pharaoh is dead and you bid me lay down my rank and henceforth rule only through him who trapped pharaoh and brought him to his end what then can i do  be a good maid and obey your husband bastard mocked a voice and during the roar of laughter that followed tua looked at the speaker an officer of abis who had taken a great part in the slaughter of their escort  very strangely she looked at him and those who stood by the man noted that his lips became white and that he turned so faint that had it not been for the press about him he would have fallen presently he seemed to recover and asked the priests who were near to let him join their circle as among the outer throng the heat was too great for him to bear thereon one of them nodded and made room for him and he passed in which tua noted also  now she was speaking again  ill names to throw at egypts anointed queen crowned and accepted by the god himself in the sanctuary of his most holy temple she said her eyes still resting on the brutal soldier yet it is your hour and she must bear them who has no friends in memphis oh what shall i do and again she wrung her hands good people it was sworn to me that amen greatest of the gods set his spirit within me when i was born and vowed that he would help me in the hour of my need of your grace then give me space to pray to amen look and she pointed before her yonder sinks the red ball of the sun soon soon it will be gonegive me until it enters the gateways of the west to pray to amen and then if no help comes i will bow me to your bidding and do homage to this noble prince of the hyksos blood who snared pharaoh his brother and by help of his magicians and of his spy merytra brought him to his end  yes my people give her the space she asks called abi who feared nothing from amen a somewhat remote personage and was afraid lest some tumult should happen in the course of which this lovely newmade wife of his might be slain or injured  so they gave her the space of time she asked standing up tua raised her arms and eyes towards heaven and began to pray aloud  hear me amen my father in the house of thy rest as thou hast sworn to do o amen my father thou seest my strait is it thy will that thy daughter should degrade herself and thee before this man who slew his king and brother to whom thou hast commanded her to give the name of husband if it be so i will obey but if it be not so then show thy word by might or marvel and cause him and his folk who mock my majesty and name me bastard to bow down before me o amen they deny thee in their hearts who worship other gods as did the barbarians who begat them and threw down thy shrines in egypt but i know that thou sentest me forth and in thee i put my trust aye even if thou slay me amen my father yonder sinks that glory in which thou dost hide thy spirit now ere it be gone and night falls upon the world declare thyself in such fashion that all men may know that indeed i am thy child or if this be thy decree desert me and egypt and leave me to my shame  she ended her prayer and sinking back upon the throne rested her chin upon her hand and gazed steadily upon the splendour of the sinking sun nor did she gaze alone for every man in that vast hall turned himself about and stared at its departing glory there in the red light they stood and stared and since the place was open to the sky the shadows of the two towering obelisks without fell on them like the shadows of swords whereof the points met together at the foot of tuas throne they did not believe that anything would happen no not even the priests believed it who here at memphis the city of ptah thought little of amen the god of thebes they thought that this piteous prayer was but a last cry of dying faith wrung from a proud and fallen woman in her wretchedness  and yet and yet they stared for she had spoken with a strange certainty like one who knew the god and was she not named star of amen and were there not wondrous tales as to her birth and had not a lotusbloom seemed to turn to gold and jewels in the hand of this young anointed queen who bore the cross of life upon her breast no nothing would happen but still they stared  it was a very strange sunset for days the heat had been great but now it was fearful also a marvellous stillness reigned in heaven and earth nothing seemed to stir in all the city no dog barked no child cried no leaf quivered upon the tall palms it might have been a city of the dead  dense clouds arose upon the sky and moved though no wind blew where the suns rays touched them they were gold and red and purple but above these of an inky blackness they took strange shapes those clouds and marshalled themselves like a host gathering for battle there were the commanders moving quickly to and fro there the chariots and there the sullen lines of footmen with their gleaming spears now one cloud higher than the rest seemed to shoot itself across the arch of heaven and its fashion was that of a woman with outspread hair of gold her feet stood upon the sun her body bent itself athwart the sky and upon the far horizon in the east her hands held the pale globe of the rising moon  the watchers were frightened at this cloud it is isis with the moon in her arms said one nay it is the mother goddess nout brooding upon the world answered another and though they only spoke softly in that awful silence their voices reached tua on the throne and for the first time her face changed for on it came a cold curious smile  kaku began to whisper into abis ear and there was fear in the eyes of both of them he pointed with his finger at two stars which of a sudden shone out through the green haze above the sunset glow and then turned and looked at the queen urging his master eagerly at last abi spoke  ra is set he said come let us make an end of all this folly  not yet answered tua quietly not yet awhile  as she said the words of a sudden as though at a given signal all the long lines of palm trees that grew in the rich gardens upon the river banks were seen to bow themselves towards the east as though they did obeisance to the queen upon her throne thrice they bowed thus without a wind and then were straight and still once more next the clouds rushed together as though a black pall had been drawn across the heavens only in the west the halfhidden globe of the sun shone on through an opening in them shone like a great and furious eye by slow degrees it sank till nothing was left save a little rim of fire all the hall grew dark and through the darkness netertua could be heard calling on the name of amen  ra is dead shouted a voice have done bastard ra is dead  aye she answered in a cold triumphant cry but amen lives behold his sword ye traitors  as the words left her lips the heavens were cleft in twain by a fearful flash of lightning and in it the people saw that once again the palmtrees bowed themselves this time almost to the ground then with a roar the winds were loosed and beneath their feet the solid earth began to heave as though a giant lifted it thrice it heaved like a heaving wave and the third time through the thick cover of the darkness there rose a shriek of terror and of agony followed by the awful crash of falling stones  now the whole sky seemed to melt in fire and in that fierce light was seen tua star of amen seated on her throne holding her sceptre to the heavens and laughing in triumphant merriment well might she laugh for the two great obelisks without the gate that the old hyksos lion had set up there to stand to all eternity had fallen across the low pylons and the doors and crushed them on to the heads of those who watched beneath they had fallen shattering in their fall and carrying death to hundreds beneath the electrum cap of one of them that had been hurled from it in its descent right into the circle of the priests lay a shapeless mass it was that man who had mocked the queen and turned faint beneath her gaze  through the western ruin of the hall those who were left alive within it fled out a maddened mob trampling each other to death by scores fighting furiously to escape the vengeance of amen and his daughter within the enclosure the priests lay prostrate on their faces each praying to his god for mercy in front of the throne upon his knees the royal crown shaken from his head abi grasped the feet of netertua and screamed to her to forgive and spare him whilst above shining like fire that which sat upon the throne pointed with her sceptre at the ruin and the rout and laughed and laughed again  soon all were gone save the mumbling priests the dying the dead and abi with his officers  the clouds rolled off the moon and the stars shone out filling the place with gentle light then tua spoke looking down at the wretched abi who grovelled before her  say now husband she asked who is god in egypt  amen your father he gasped  and who is pharaoh in egypt  you and no other o queen  ah she said it was over that matter that we quarrelled did we not which forced me whom you thought so helpless to find helpers look there are their footsteps they walk heavily do they not my uncle and she nodded towards the huge fragments of the broken obelisks  he glanced behind him at his ruined hall at the dying and the dead you are pharaoh and no other he repeated with a shudder give breath to your servant and let him live on in your shadow  the first is not mine to give she answered coldly though perchance it may please amen to hold you back a little while from that place where you must settle your account with him who went before me and his companions who died in your streets i hope so for you have work to do as for the secondarise you priests and officers and see this prince of yours do homage to the queen of egypt  they rose and clung to each other trembling for all the heart was out of them then she pointed to her foot with the sceptre in her hand and in their presence abi knelt down and kissed her sandal after him followed the others the priests the captains the headstewards and the butlers till at length came kaku the astrologer who prostrated himself before her trembling in every limb but him she would not suffer even to touch her sandals  tell me she said drawing back her foot you who are a magician and have studied the secret writings how does it chance that you still live on when for lesser crimes so many lie here dead you who are stained with the blood of pharaoh  hearing these words from which he presaged the very worst kaku beat his head upon the ground babbling denials of this awful crime and at the same time began to implore pardon for what he said he had not committed  cease she exclaimed and learn that your life is spared for a while yes and even merytras also you will retain your office of vizierfor a while  now he began to pour out thanks but she stopped him saying  thank me not seeing that you do not know the end of this matter perchance it is hidden from you lest you should go mad you and your wife merytra she who was the pharaohs lady of the footstool and sang him to sleep look at me wizard and tell me who am i and she bent down over him  he glanced up at her and their eyes met nor could he turn his head away again  come she said as you may have learned tonight i also have some knowledge of the hidden things for otherwise why did the earth shake and the everlasting pillars fall at my bidding now between two of a trade there should be no secrets so i will tell you something that perhaps you have already guessed since i am sure that you will not repeat it even to your master or to merytra for i will add thisthat the moment you repeat it will be the moment of your death and the beginning of that punishment which here i withhold now in the name of the eaterup of souls listen to me o fashioner of waxen images and bending down she whispered into his ear  another instant and stark horror written on his face the tall shape of kaku was seen reeling backward like to a drunken man indeed had not abi caught him he would have fallen over the edge of the dais  what did she tell you he muttered for the queen who seemed to have forgotten all about him was looking the other way  but making no answer kaku wrenched himself free and fled the place    chapter xiii  abi learns the truth  a moon had gone by and on the first day of the new month kaku the vizier sat in the hall of the great officers at memphis checking the public accounts of the city it was not easy work for during the past ten days twice these accounts had been sent back to him by the command of the queen or the pharaoh as she called herself with requests for information as to their items and other awkward queries abi had overlooked such matters recognising that a faithful servant was worthy of his hireprovided that he paid himself but now it seemed that things were different and that the amount received was the exact amount that had to be handed over to the crown neither more nor less well there was a large discrepancy which must be made up from somewhere or in other words from kakus private store  in a rage he caused the two head collectors of taxes to be brought before him and as they would not pay bade the executioners throw them down and beat them on the feet until they promised to produce the missing sums most of which he himself had stolen  then somewhat soothed he retired from the hall into his own office to find himself face to face with abi who was waiting for him so changed was the prince from his old portly self so aged and thin and miserable did he look that in the dusk of that chamber kaku failed to recognise him thinking that he was some suppliant he began to revile him and order him to be gone then the fury of abi broke out  rushing at him he seized the astrologer by the beard and smote him on the ears saying dog is it thus that you speak to your king well on you at least i can revenge myself  pardon your majesty said kaku i did not know you in these shadows your majesty is changed of late  changed said abi letting him go who would not be changed who suffers as i do ever since i listened to your cursed counsel and tried to climb into the seat of pharaoh before that i was happy i had my sons i had my wives as many as i wished i had my revenues and armies now everything has gone my sons are dead my women are driven away my revenues are taken from me my armies serve another  at least suggested kaku you are pharaoh and the husband of the most beautiful and the wisest woman in the world  pharaoh groaned abi the humblest mummy in the common city vaults is a greater king than i am and as for the rest and he stopped and groaned again  what is the matter with your majesty asked kaku  the matter is that i have fallen under the influence of an evil planet  the star of amen suggested the astrologer  yes the star of amen that lovely terror whom you call my wife man she is no wife to me listenthere in the harem i went into the chamber where she was none forbidding me and found her sitting before her mirror and singing clothed only in a thin robe of white and her dark hairo kaku never did you see such hairwhich fell almost to the ground she smiled on me she spoke me fair she drew me with those glittering eyes of hersyes she even called me husband and sighed and talked of love till at length i drew near to her and threw my arms about her  and then  and then kaku she was gone and where her sweet face should have been i saw the yellow mummied head of pharaoh he who is with osiris that seemed to grin at me i opened my arms again and lo there she sat laughing and shaking perfume from her hair asking me too what ailed me that i turned so white and if such were the way of husbands  well that was nigh a month ago and as it began so it has gone on i seek my wife and i find the mummied head of pharaoh and all the while she mocks me nor may i see the others any more for she has caused them to be hunted hence even those who have dwelt with me for years saying that she must rule alone  is that all asked kaku  no indeed for as she torments me so she torments every other man who comes near to her she nets them with smiles she bewitches them with her eyes till they go mad for love of her and then still smiling she sends them about their business already two of them who were leaders in the great plot have died by their own hands and another is mad while the rest have become my secret but my bitter foes because they love my queen and think that i stand between her and them  is that all asked kaku again  no not all for my power is taken from me i who was great after pharaoh the greatest in all the land now am but a slave from morning to night i must work at tasks i hate i must build temples to amen i must dig canals i must truckle to the common herd and redress their grievances and remit their taxes more i must chastise the bedouin who have ever been my friends andnext month undertake a war against that king of khita with whom i made a secret treaty and whose daughter that i married has been sent back to him because i loved her  and then asked kaku  oh then when the khita have been destroyed and made subject to egypt then her majesty purposes to return in state to thebes to attend to the fashioning of my sepulchre since so she says this is a matter that will not bear delay indeed already she makes drawings for it horrible and mystic drawings that i cannot understand and brings them to me to see moreover friend know this out of it opens another smaller tomb for you indeed but this morning she sent an expedition to the desert quarries to bring thence three blocks of stone one for my sarcophagus one for yours and one for that of your wife merytra for she says that after the old fashion she purposes to honour both of you with these gifts  at these words kaku could no longer control himself but began to walk up and down the room muttering and snatching at his beard  how can you suffer it he said at length you who were a great prince to become a womans slave to be made as dirt beneath her feet to be held up to the mockery of those you rule to see your wives and household driven away from you to be tormented to be mocked to look on other men favoured before your eyes to be threatened with early death oh how can you suffer it why do you not kill her and make an end  because answered abi because i dare not since if i dreamed of such a thing she would guess my thought and kill me fool do you not remember the fall of the eternal obelisks upon my captains and what befell that man who mocked her calling her bastard and sought refuge among the priests no i dare not lift a finger against her  then prince you must carry your yoke until it wears through to the marrow which will be when that sepulchre is ready  not so answered abi shivering for i have another plan it is of it that i am come to speak with you friend kaku you must kill her listen you are a master of spells the magic which prevailed against the father will overcome the daughter also you have but to make a waxen image or two and breathe strength into them and the thing is done and thenthink of the reward  indeed i am thinking most noble prince replied the astrologer with sarcasm shall i tell you of that reward it would be my death by slow torture moreover it is impossible for if you would know the truth she cannot be killed  what do you mean fool asked abi angrily flesh and blood must bow to death  a sickly smile spread itself over kakus thin face as he answered  a saying worthy of your wisdom prince certainly the experience of mankind is that flesh and blood must bow to death yes yes flesh and blood  cease grinning at me you ape of the rocks hissed the enraged abi or i will prove as much on your mocking throat and snatching out his sword he threatened him with it adding now tell me what you mean or  prince ejaculated kaku falling to his knees i may not i cannot spare me it is a secret of the gods  then get you gone to the gods you lying cur and talk it over with them answered abi lifting the sword for at least she will not blame me if i send you there  mercy mercy gasped kaku sprawling on the ground while his lord held the sword above his bald head thinking that he would choose speech rather than death  it was at this moment while the astrologers fate trembled in the balance that a sound of voices reached their ears and above them the ring of a light clear laugh which they knew well forgetting his purpose abi stepped to the windowplace and looked through the opening of the shutters presently he turned beckoning to kaku and whispered  come and look there is always time for you to die  the vizier heard and creeping on his hands and knees to the windowplace raised himself and peeped through the shutter this was what he saw in the walled garden below the secret garden of the palace stood the queen netertua and the sunlight piercing through the boughs of a flowering tree fell in bright bars upon her beauty she was not alone for before her knelt a man wearing the rich robes of a noble kaku knew him at once for although still young he was abis favourite captain an officer whom he loved and had raised to high place because of his wit and valour having given him one of his daughters in marriage also he had played a chief part in the great plot against pharaoh and it was he who had dealt the deathblow to mermes the husband of the lady asti  now he was playing another part namely that of lover to the queen for he clasped the hem of her robe in his hands and kissed it with his lips and pleaded with her passionately they could catch some of his words  he had risked his life to climb the wall he worshipped her he could not live without her he was ready to do her bidding in all thingsto gather a band and slay abi it would be easy for every man was jealous of the prince and thought him quite unworthy of her let her give him her love and he would make her sole pharaoh of egypt again and be content to serve her as a slave at least let her say one kind word to him  thus he spoke wildly imploringly like a man that is drunk with passion and knows not what he says or does while netertua listened calmly and now and again laughed that light low laugh of hers  at length he rose and strove to take her hand but still laughing she waved him back then said suddenly  you slew mermes when he was weak with wounds did you not and he was my fosterfather well well it was done in war and you must be a brave man as brave as you are handsome for otherwise you would scarcely have ventured here where a word of mine would give you to your death and now get you gone friend back to my lords daughter who is your wife and if you daretell her where you have been and why you who are so brave a man and once more she laughed  again he began his passionate implorings begging for some token till at length she seemed to melt and take pity on him for stretching out her hand she chose a flower from the many that grew near and gave it to him then pointed to the trees that hid the wall among which presently he vanished reeling in the delirium of his joy  she watched him go smiling very strangely then still smiling looked down at the bush whence she had plucked the flower and kaku noted that it was one used only by the embalmers to furnish coronals for the dead  but abi noted no such thing forgetting his quarrel with kaku and all else he gasped and foamed in his jealous rage muttering that he would kill that captain yes and the false queen too who dared to listen to a tale of love and give the lover flowers yes were she ten times pharaoh he would kill her as he had the right to do and the naked sword still in his hand he turned to leave the place  if that is your will lord said kaku in a strained voice bide here  why man asked abi  because her majesty comes he answered and this chamber is quiet and fitting none enter it save myself  as he spoke the words the door opened and closed again and before them stood netertua star of amen  in the dusk of that room the first thing that seemed to catch her eye was the bared blade in abis hand for a moment she looked at it and him also at kaku crouching in the corner then asked in her quiet voice  why is your sword drawn o husband  to kill you o wife he answered furiously for his rage mastered him  she continued to look at him a little while and said smiling in her strange fashion  indeed but why more now than at any other time has kakus counsel given you courage  need you ask shameless woman does not this windowplace open on to yonder garden  oh i remember that captain of yourshe who slew mermes your daughters husband who made love to meso well that i rewarded him with a funeral flower knowing that you watched us settle your account with him as you and his wife may wish it is no matter of mine but i warn you that if you would take mens lives for such a fault as this soon you will have no servants left since they all are sinners who desire to usurp your place  then abis fury broke out he cursed and reviled her he called her by ill names swearing that she should die who bewitched all men and was the love of none and who made him a mock and a shame in the sight of egypt but netertua only listened until at length he raved himself to silence  you talk much and do little she said at length the sword is in your hand use it i am here  maddened by her scorn he lifted the weapon and rushed at her only to reel back again as though he had been smitten by some power unseen he rested against the wall then again rushed and again reeled back  you are a poor butcher she said at length after so many years of practice let kaku yonder try i think he has more skill in murder  oh your majesty broke in the astrologer unsay those cruel words you who know that rather than lift hands against you i would die a thousand times  yes she answered gravely the prince abi suggested it to you but now did he not after you had suggested it to him and you refusedfor your own reasons  then the sword fell from abis hand and there was silence in that chamber  what were you talking of abi before you peeped through the shutters and saw that captain of yours and me together in the garden and why did you wish to kill this dog she went on presently must i answer for you you were talking of how you might be rid of me and you wished to kill him because he did not dare to tell you why he could not do the deed knowing that if he did so he must die well since you desire to know you shall learn and now look on me wretched man whom men name my husband look on me accursed slave whom amen has given into my hand to punish here upon the earth until you pass to his yonder in the underworld  he looked up and kaku looked also because he could not help it but what they saw they never told only they fell down upon their faces both of them and groaned beating the floor with their foreheads  at length the icy terror seemed to be lifted from their hearts and they dared to glance up again and saw that she was as she had been a most royal and lovely woman but no more  what are you gasped abi the goddess sekhet in the flesh or isis queen of death or but dead tuas ghost sent here for vengeance  all of them or none of them as you will though man it is true that i am sent here for vengeance ask the wizard yonder he knows and i give him leave to say  she is the double of amens daughter moaned kaku she is her ka set free to bring doom upon those who would have wronged her she is a ghost armed with the might of the gods and all we who have sinned against dead pharaoh and her and her father amen are given into her hand to be tormented and brought to doom  where then is netertua who was queen of egypt gasped abi rolling his great eyes is she with osiris  i will tell you man answered the royal shape she is not deadshe lives and is gone to seek one she loves when she returns with him and a certain beggar then i shall depart and you will die both of you for such is the punishment decreed upon you until then arise and do my bidding    chapter xiv  the boat of ra  tua star of amen opened her eyes for some time already she had lain as one lies between sleep and waking and it seemed to her that she heard the sound of dipping oars and of water that rippled gently against the sides of a ship she thought to herself that she dreamed doubtless she was in her bed in the palace at thebes and presently when it was light her ladies would come to waken her  in the palace at thebes why now she remembered that it was months since she had seen that royal city she who had travelled far since then and come at last to whitewalled memphis where many terrible things had befallen her one by one they came into her mind the snare pharaohs murder by magic the battle and the slaughter of her guards the starvation in the tower with death on one hand and the hateful abi on the other the wondrous vision of that spirit who wore her face and said she was the guardian ka given to her at birth the words it spoke and her dread resolve and last of all asti and herself standing in the lofty window niche then a flame of fire before her face and that fearful downward rush  oh without a doubt it was over she was dead and these dreams and memories were such as come to the dwellers in the underworld only then why did she hear the sound of lapping water and of dipping oars  very slowly she opened her eyes for tua greatly feared what she might see light flowed upon her the light of the moon which hung in a clear sky like some great lamp of gold by it she saw that robed all in white she lay upon a couch in a pavilion whereof the silken curtains were drawn back in front and tied to gilded posts at her side wrapped in a grey robe lay another figure which she knew for asti it was still so still that she was sure it must be dead yet she knew that this was asti perchance asti dreamed also and could hear in her dreams at least she would speak to her  asti she whispered asti can you hear me  the grey figure at her side stirred and the head turned towards her then the voice of asti none other answered  aye lady i hear and see but say where are we now  in the underworld i think asti oh that fire was death and now we journey to the place of souls  if so lady it is strange that we should still have eyes and flesh and voices as mortal women have let us sit up and look  so they sat up their arms about each other and peered through the open curtains behold they were on a ship more beautiful than any they had ever seen for it seemed to be covered with gold and silver while sweet odours floated from its hold their pavilion was set in the centre of the ship and looking aft they perceived lines of whiteclad rowers seated at their oars in the shadow of the bulwarks and on the high sternalso robed in whitea tall steersman whose face was veiled behind whom in the dim glimpses of the moon they caught sight of a wide and silvery river and on its distant banks palms and temple towers  it is the boat of ra murmured tua which bears us down the river of death to the kingdom behind the sun  then she sank back upon her cushions and once more fell into swoon or sleep  tua woke again and lo the sun was shining brightly and at her side sat asti watching her moreover in front of them was set a table spread with delicate food  tell me what has chanced nurse she said faintly for i am bewildered and know not in what world we wander  our own queen i think answered asti but in charge of those who are not of it for surely this is no mortal boat nor do mortals guide her to her port come we need food let us eat while we may  so they ate and drank heartily enough and when they had finished even dared to go out of the pavilion looking around them they saw that they stood upon a high deck in the midst of a great ship but that this ship was enclosed with a net of silver cords in which they could find no opening looking through its meshes they noted that the oars were inboard and the great purple sails set upon the mast also that the rowers were gone perchance to rest beneath the deck while on the forecastle of the ship stood the captain whiterobed and masked and aft the steersman also still masked so that they could see nothing of their faces now too they were no longer sailing on a river but down a canal bordered by banks of sand on either side beyond which stretched desert farther than the eye could reach  asti studied the desert then turned and said  i think i know this canal lady for once i sailed it as a child i think it is that which was dug by the pharaohs of old and repaired after the fall of the hyksos kings and that it runs from bubastis to that bay down which wanderers sail towards the rising sun  mayhap answered tua at least this is the world that bore us and no other and by the mercy of amen and the power of my spirit we are still alive and not dead or so it seems call now to the captain on yonder deck perhaps he will tell whither he bears us in his magic ship  so asti called but the captain made no sign that he saw or heard her next she called to the steersman but although his veiled face was towards them he also made no sign so that at last they believed either that these were spirits or that they were men born deaf and dumb in the end growing weary of staring at this beautiful ship at the canal and the desert beyond it and of wondering where they were and how they came thither they returned to the pavilion to avoid the heat of the sun here they found that during their absence some hand unseen had arranged the silken bedclothing on their couches and cleared away the fragments of their meal resetting the beautiful table with other foods  truly here is wizardry at work said tua as she sank into a leatherseated ivory chair that was placed ready  who doubts it answered asti calmly by wizardry were you born by wizardry was pharaoh slain by wizardry we are saved to an end that we cannot guess by wizardry or what men so name does the whole world move only being so near we see it not  tua thought a while then said  well this golden ship is better than the sty of abi the hog nor do i believe that we journey to no purpose still i wonder what that spirit who named herself my ka does on the throne of egypt also how we came on board this boat and whither we sail  wonder not for all these things we shall learn in due season and for my part although i hate him i am sorry for abi answered asti drily  so they sat there in the pavilion watching the desert over the sands of which their ship seemed to move till at length the sun grew low and they went to walk upon the deck then they returned to eat of the delicious food that was always provided for them in such plenty and at nightfall sought their couches and slept heavily for they needed rest  when they awoke again it was daylight though no sun shone through the skies and their vessel rolled onward across a wide and sullen sea out of sight of land also the silken pavilion about them was gone and replaced by a cabin of massive cedar wood though of this being sated with marvels tua and asti took little note indeed having neither of them been on an angry ocean before a strange dizziness overcame them which caused them to sleep much and think little for three whole days and nights  at length one evening as the sun sank they perceived that the violent motion of the vessel had ceased with the roaring of the gale above which for all this while had driven them onward at such fearful speed venturing from their cedar house they saw that they had entered the mouth of a great river upon the banks of which grew enormous trees that sent out long crooked roots into the water and that among these roots crouched crocodiles and other noisome reptiles also the whiterobed oarsmen had appeared again and as there was no wind rowed the ship up the river till at length they came to a spit of sand which jutted out into the stream and here cast anchor  now tuas and astis desire for food returned to them and they ate just as they had finished their meal and the sun was sinking suddenly there appeared before them two masked men each of whom bore a basket in his hand asti began to question them but like the captain and the steersman they seemed to be deaf and dumb at least they made no answer only prostrated themselves humbly and pointed towards the shore where now tua saw a fire burning on a rock though who had lit it she did not know  they mean us to leave the ship said asti come queen let us follow our fortunes for doubtless these are high  as you will answered tua seeing that we should scarcely have been brought here to no end  so they accompanied the men to the side of that splendid vessel for now the netting that confined them had been removed to find that a gangway had been laid from its bulwark to the shore as they stepped on to this gangway their masked companions handed to each of them one of the baskets then again bowed humbly and were gone soon they gained the bank and scarcely had their feet touched it when the gangway was withdrawn and the great oars began to beat the muddy water  round swung the ship and for a minute hung in midstream there stood the captain on the foredeck and there was the steersman at the helm and the red light of the sinking sun turned them into figures of flame suddenly with a simultaneous motion these men tore off their masks so that for a moment asti and tua saw their facesand behold the face of the captain was the face of pharaoh tuas father and the face of the steersman was the face of mermes astis husband  for one moment only did they see them then a dark cloud hid the dying sun and when it passed that ship was gone whither they knew not  the two women looked at each other and for the first time were much afraid  truly said tua we are haunted if ever mortals were for yonder ship has ghosts for mariners  aye lady answered asti so have i thought from the first still take heart for these ghosts once were men who loved us well and doubtless they love us still be sure that for no ill purpose have we been snatched out of the hand of abi and brought living and unharmed by the shades of pharaoh your sire and mermes my husband to this secret shore see yonder burns a fire let us go to it and await what may befall bravely knowing that at least it can be naught but good  so they went to the rock and darkness being come sat themselves down by the fire alongside of which lay wood for its replenishment and near the wood soft robes of camelhair to shield them from the cold these robes they put on with thankfulness and having fed the flame bethought them of and opened the baskets which were given to them when they left the ship the first basket that which asti held they found to contain food cakes dried meats and dates as much as one woman could carry but the second that which had been given to tua was otherwise provided for in the mouth of it lay a lovely harp of ivory with golden strings whereof the frame was fashioned to the shape of a woman tua drew it out and looked at it by the light of the fire  it is my own harp she said in an awed voice the harp that the prince of kesh whom rames slew brought as a gift to me to the notes of which i sang the song of the lovers but just before the giver died yes it is my own harp that i left in thebes say now nurse how came it here  how came we here answered asti shortly answer my question and i will answer yours  then laying down the harp tua looked again into her basket and found that beneath a layer of dried papyrus leaves were hidden pearls thousands of pearls of all sizes and of such lustre and beauty as she had never seen they were strung upon threads of silk all those of a like size being set upon a single thread except the very biggest which were as great as a finger nail or even larger that lay wrapped up separately in cloth at the bottom of the basket  surely said tua amazed no queen in all the earth ever had a dower of such priceless pearls moreover what good they and the harp can be to us in this forest i may not guess  doubtless we shall discover in due course answered asti meanwhile let us thank the gods for their gifts and eat  so they ate and then having nothing else to do lay down by the fire and would have slept  but scarcely had they closed their eyes when the forest seemed to awake first from down by the river there came dreadful roarings which they knew must be the voice of lions for there were tame beasts of this sort in the gardens at thebes next they heard the whines and wimperings of wolves and jackals and mingled with them great snortings such as are made by the rhinoceros and the riverhorse  nearer nearer came these awful sounds till at length they saw yellow eyes moving like stars in the darkness at the edge of the forest while cross the patch of sand beneath their rock galloped swift shapes which halted and sniffed towards them also on the river side of them appeared huge hoglike beasts with gleaming tusks and red cavernous mouths and beyond these again crashing through the brushwood a gigantic brute that bore a single horn upon its snout  now our end is at hand said tua faintly for surely these creatures will devour us  but asti only threw more wood upon the fire and waited thinking that the flame would frighten them away yet it did not for so curious or so hungry were they that the lions crept and crept nearer and still more near till at length they lay lashing their tails in the distance almost within springing distance of the rock while on the farther side of these like a court waiting on its monarch gathered the hyenas and other beasts  they will spring presently whispered tua  did the spirits of the divine pharaoh your father and of mermes my lord bring us here in the boat of ra that we should be devoured by wild animals like lost sheep in the desert asked asti then as though by an inspiration she added lady take that harp of yours and play and sing to it  so tua took the harp and swept its golden chords and lifting up her lovely voice she began to sing at first it trembled a little but by degrees as she forgot all save the music it grew strong and rang out sweetly in the silence of the forest and the great slowmoving river and lo as she sang thus the wild brutes grew still and seemed to listen as though they were charmed yes even a snake wriggled out from between the rocks and listened waving its crested head to and fro  at length tua ceased and as the echoes died away the brutes every one of them turned and vanished into the forest or the river all save the snake that coiled itself up and slept where it was so stillness came again and tua and asti slept also nor did they wake until the sun was shining in the heavens  then they arose wondering and went down over the patch of sand that was marked with the footprints of all the beasts to the rivers brink and drank and washed themselves peering the while through the mists for they thought that perchance they would see that golden ship with the veiled crew which had carried them from memphis returned and awaiting them in midstream  but no ship was there nothing was there except the riverhorses which rose and sank and the crocodiles on the mudbanks and the wildfowl that flighted inward from the sea to feed so they went back to the ashes of their fire and ate of the food in astis basket and when they had eaten looked at each other not knowing what to do then tua said  come nurse let us be going up the river and down the river we cannot walk for there are nothing but weeds and mud so we must strike out through the forest whither the gods may lead us  asti nodded and clad in the light warm clothes of camelhair they set the baskets upon their heads after the fashion of the peasant women of egypt and started forward the harp of ivory and of gold hanging upon tuas back  for hour after hour they marched thus through the forest threading their path between the big boles of the trees and heading always for the south for that way ran the woodland glades beyond which was dense bush great apes chattered above them in the tree tops and now and again some beast of prey crossed their path and vanished in the underwood but nothing else did they see at length towards midday the ground began to rise and the trees grew smaller and farther apart till at last they reached the edge of a sandy desert and walked out to a little oasis where the green grass showed them they would find water in this oasis there was a spring and by the edge of it they sat down and drank and ate of their store of food and afterwards slept a while  suddenly tua in her sleep heard a voice and awaking with a start saw a man who stood near by leaning on a thornwood staff and contemplating them he was a very strange man apparently of great age for his long white hair fell down upon his shoulders and his white beard reached to his middle once he must have been very tall but now he was bent with age and the bones of his gaunt frame thrust out his ragged garments his dark eyes also were horny indeed it seemed as though he could scarcely see with them for he leaned forward to peer at their faces where they lay his face was scored by a thousand wrinkles and almost black with exposure to the sun and wind but yet of a marvellous tenderness and beauty indeed except that it was far more ancient and the features were on a larger and a grander scale it reminded tua of the face of pharaoh after he was dead  my father said tua sitting up for an impulse prompted her to name this wanderer thus say whence do you come and what would you with your servants  my daughter answered the old man in a sweet grave voice i come from the wilderness which is my home long have i outlived all those of my generation yes and their children also therefore the wilderness and the forest that do not change are now my only friends since they alone knew me when i was young be pitiful now to me for i am poor so poor that for three whole days no food has passed my lips it was the smell of the meat which you have with you that led me to you give me of that meat daughter for i starve  it is yours o and she paused  i am called kepher  kepher kepher repeated tua for she thought it strange that a beggarman should be named after that scarabæus insect which among the egyptians was the symbol of eternity well take and eat o kepher she said and handed him the basket that contained what was left to them of their store  the beggar took it and having looked up to heaven as though to ask a blessing on his meal sat down upon the sand and began to devour the food ravenously  lady said asti he will eat it all and then we shall starve in this desert he is a locust not a man she added as another cake disappeared  he is our guest answered tua gravely let him take what we have to give  for a while asti was silent then again she broke out into remonstrance  peace nurse replied tua i have said that he is our guest and the law of hospitality may not be broken  then the law of hospitality will bring us to our deaths muttered asti  if so so let it be nurse at least this poor man will be filled and for the rest as always we must trust to amen our father  yet as she spoke the words tears gathered in her eyes for she knew that asti was right and now that all the food was gone on which with care they might have lived for two days or more soon they would faint and perish unless help came to them which was not likely in that lonesome place once not so long ago they had starved for lack of sustenance and it was the thought of that slow pain so soon to be renewed that brought the water to her eyes  meanwhile kepher whose appetite for one so ancient was sharp indeed finished the contents of the basket down to the last date and handed it back to tua with a bow saying  i thank you daughter the queen of egypt could not have entertained me more royally and he peered at her with his horny eyes i who have been empty for long am full again and since i cannot reward you i pray to the gods that they will do so beautiful daughter may you never know what it is to lack a meal  at this saying tua could restrain herself no more a large tear from her eyes fell upon kephers rough hand as she answered with a little sob  i am glad that you are comforted with meat but do not mock us friend seeing that we are but lost wanderers who very soon must starve since now our food is done  what daughter asked the old man in an astonished voice what can i believe that you gave all you had to a beggar of the wilderness and sat still while he devoured it and is it for this reason that you weep  forgive me father but it is so answered tua i am ashamed of such weakness but recently my friend here and i have known hunger very sore hunger and the dread of it moves me come asti let us be going while our strength remains in us  kepher looked up at the name then turned to tua and said  daughter your face is fair and your heart is perfect since otherwise you would not have dealt with me as you have done still it seems that you lack one thingundoubting faith in the goodness of the gods though surely he added in a slow voice those who have passed yonder lionhaunted forest without hurt should not lack faith say now how came you there  we are ladies of egypt interrupted asti or at least this maiden is for i am but her old nurse manstealing pirates of phoenicia seized us while we wandered on the shores of the nile and brought us hither in their ship by what way we do not know at length they put into yonder river for water and we fled at night we are escaped slaves no more  ah said kepher those pirates must mourn their loss i almost wonder that they did not follow you indeed i thought that you might be other folk for strangely enough as i slept in the sand last night a certain spirit from the underworld visited me in my dreams and told me to search for one asti and another lady who was with heri cannot remember the name of that lady but i do remember the name of the spirit for he told it to me it was mermes  now asti gave a little cry and springing up searched kephers face with her eyes nor did he shrink from her gaze  i perceive she said slowly that you who seem to be a beggar are also a seer  mayhap asti he answered in my long life i have often noted that sometimes men are more than they seemand women also perhaps you have learned the same for nurses in great houses may note many things if they choose but let us say no more i think it is better that we should say no more you and your companionhow is she named  neferte answered asti promptly  neferte ah certainly that was not the name which the spirit used though it is true that other name began with the same sound or so i think well you and your companion neferte escaped from those wicked pirates and managed to bring certain things with you for instance that beautiful harp wreathed with the royal uræi andbut what is in that second basket  pearls broke in tua quickly  and a large basket of pearls might i see them oh do not be afraid i shall not rob those whose food i have eaten it is against the custom of the desert  certainly answered tua i never thought that you would rob us for if you were of the tribe of thieves surely you would be richer and less hungry than you seem i only thought that you were almost blind father kepher and therefore could not know the difference between a pearl and a pebble  my feeling still remains to me daughter neferte he answered with a little smile  then tua gave him the basket he opened it and drew out the strings of pearls feeling them smelling and peering at them touching them with his tongue especially the large single ones which were wrapped up by themselves at length having handled them all he restored them to the basket saying drily  it is strange indeed nurse asti that those syrian manstealers attempted no pursuit of you for here whether they were theirs or not are enough gems to buy a kingdom  we cannot eat pearls answered asti  no but pearls will buy more than you need to eat  not in a desert said asti  true but as it chances there is a city in this desert and not so very far away  is it named napata asked tua eagerly  napata no indeed yet i have heard of such a place the city of gold they called it in fact once i visited it in my youth over a hundred years ago  a hundred years ago do you remember the way thither  yes more or less but on foot it is over a years journey away and the path thither lies across great deserts and through tribes of savage men few live to reach that city  yet i will reach it or die father  perhaps you will daughter neferte perhaps you will but i think not at present meanwhile you have a harp and therefore it is probable that you can play and sing also you have pearls now the inhabitants of this town whereof i spoke to you love music also they love pearls and as you cannot begin your journey to napata for three months when the rain on the mountains will have filled the desert wells i suggest that you would do wisely to settle yourselves there for a while nurse asti here would be a dealer in pearls and you her daughter would be a musician what say you  i say that i should be glad to settle myself anywhere out of this desert said tua wearily lead us on to the city father kepher if you know the way  i know the way and will guide you thither in payment for that good meal of yours now come follow me and taking his long staff he strode away in front of them  this kepher goes at a wonderful pace for an old man said tua presently when first we saw him he could scarcely hobble  man answered asti he is not a man but a spirit good or bad i dont know which appearing as a beggar could a man eat as much as he didall our basketful of food does a man talk of cities that he visited in his youth over a hundred years ago or declare that my dead husband spoke to him in his dreams no no he is a ghost like those upon the ship  so much the better answered tua cheerfully since ghosts have been good friends to us for had it not been for them i should have been dead or shamed today  that we shall find out at the end of the story said asti who was cross and weary for the heat of the sun was great meanwhile follow on there is nothing else to do  for hour after hour they walked till at length towards evening when they were almost exhausted they struggled up a long rise of sand and rocks and from the crest of it perceived a large walled town set in a green and fertile valley not very far beneath them towards this town kepher who marched at a distance in front guided them till they reached a clump of trees on the outskirts of the cultivated land here he halted and when they came up to him led them among the trees  now he said drop your veils and bide here and if any should come to you say that you are poor wandering players who rest also if it pleases you give me a small pearl off one of those strings that i may go into the city which is named tat and sell it to buy you food and a place to dwell in  take a string said tua faintly  nay nay daughter one will be enough for in this town pearls are rare and have a great value  so she gave him the gem or rather let him take it from the silk which he refastened very neatly for one who seemed to be almost blind and strode off swiftly towards the town  man or spirit i wonder if we shall see him again said asti  tua made no answershe was too tired but resting herself against the bole of a tree fell into a doze when she awoke again it was to see that the sun had sunk and that before her stood the beggar kepher and with him two black men each of whom led a saddled mule  mount friends he said for i have found you a lodging  so they mounted and were led to the gate of the city which at the word of kepher was opened for them and thence down a long street to a house built in a walled garden into this house they entered the black men leading off the mules to find that it was a wellfurnished place with a table ready set in the anteroom on which was food in plenty they ate of it all three of them and when they had finished kepher bade a woman who was waiting on them lead them to their chamber saying that he himself would sleep in the garden  thither then they went without more questions and throwing themselves down upon beds which were prepared for them were soon fast asleep    chapter xv  tua and the king of tat  in the morning after tua and asti had put on the clean robes that lay to their hands and eaten suddenly they looked up and perceived that kepher the ancient beggar of the desert was in the room with them though neither of them had heard or seen him enter  you come silently friend said asti looking at him with a curious eye a double could not move with less noise andwhere is your shadow she added staring first at the sun without and then at the floor upon which he stood  i forgot it he answered in his deep voice one so poor as i am cannot always afford a shadow but look there it is now and for the rest what do you know of doubles which those who are uninstructed cannot discern now i have heard of a lady in egypt who by some chance bore your name and who has the power not only to see the double but to draw it forth from the body of the living and furnish it with every semblance of mortal life also i have heard that she who reigns in egypt today has such a ka or double that can take her place and none know the difference save that this ka which amen gave her at her birth works the vengeance of the gods without pity or remorse tell me friend asti when you were a slavewoman in egypt did you ever hear talk of such things as these  now he looked at asti and asti looked at him till at length he moved his old hands in a certain fashion whereon she bowed her head and was silent  but tua who was terrified at this talk for she knew not what would befall them if the truth were guessed broke in saying  welcome father however it may please you to come and with or without a shadow surely we have much to thank you for who have found us this fine house and servants and foodby the way will you not eat again  nay he answered smiling as you may have guessed yesterday i touch meat seldom as a rule once only in three days and then take my fill life is so short that i cannot waste time in eating  oh said tua if you feel thus whose youth began more than a hundred years ago how must it seem to the rest of us but father kepher what are we to do in this town tat  i have told you maiden asti here will deal in pearls and other goods and you will sing but always behind the curtain since here in tat you must suffer no man to see your beauty and least of all him who rules it now give me two more pearls for i go out to buy for you other things that are needful and after that perhaps you will see me no more for a long while yet if trouble should fall upon you go to the windowplace wherever you may be and strike upon that harp of yours and call thrice upon the name of kepher doubtless there will be some listening who will hear you and bring me the news in the desert where i dwell who do not love towns and then i may be able to help you  i thank you my father and i will remember but pardon me if i ask how can one so and she paused  so old so ragged and so miserable give help to man or womanthat is what you would say daughter neferte is it not well judge not from the outward seeming good wine is often found in jars of common clay and the fire hid in a rough flint can destroy a city  and therefore a wanderer who can swallow his own shadow can aid another wanderer in distress remarked tua drily my father i understand who although i am still young have seen many things and ere now been dragged out of deep water by strange hands  such as those of phoenician pirates suggested kepher well goodbye i go to purchase what you need with the price of these pearls and then the desert calls me for a while remember what i told you and do not seek to leave this town of tat until the rain has fallen on the mountains and there is water in the wells goodbye friend asti also when i come again we will talk more of doubles until which time may the great god of egypthe is called amen is he nothave you and your lady in his keeping  then he turned and went  what is that man asked tua when they had heard the door of the house close behind him  man answered asti i have told you that he is no man do men unfold their shadows like a garment he is a god or a ghost wearing a beggars shape  man or ghost i like him well for he has befriended us in our need nurse  that we shall know when he has done with us answered asti  an hour later whilst they were still talking of kepher and all the marvels that had befallen them porters began to arrive bearing bundles which when opened were found to contain silks and broideries in gold and silver thread and leather richly worked such as the arabs make and alabaster pots of ointments and brass work from syria and copper jars from cyprus with many other goods all very costly and in number more than enough for a wealthy traders store  these goods the porters set out on the mats and shelves of the large front room of the house that opened to the street which room seemed to have been built to receive them then they departed asking no fees and there appeared a man riding a fine white horse who dismounted and bowing low towards the screen of pierced woodwork behind which tua and asti were hidden laid a writing upon a little table and rode away when he had gone asti opened the door in the screen and took the writing which she found she could read well enough for it was in the egyptian character and language  it proved to be the titledeed of the house and garden conveyed to them jointly and also of the rich goods which the porters had brought at the foot of this document was written  received by kepher the wanderer in payment of the above house and land and goods three pearls and one full meal of meat and dates  then followed the seal of kepher in wax a finely cut scarabæus holding the symbol of the sun between its two front feet  a proud seal for a tattered wanderer though it is but his name writ in wax said tua  but asti only answered  if small pearls have such value in this city what price will the large ones bring well let us to our business for we have time upon our hands and cannot live upon pearls and costly stuffs    so it happened that netertua star of amen queen of egypt and asti her nurse the mistress of magic became merchants in the town of tat  this was the manner of their trade for one hour in the morning and one in the afternoon asti heavily veiled and a woman of the servants whom they had found in the house would sit on stools amidst the goods and traffic with all comers selling to those who would buy and taking payment in gold dust or other articles of value or buying from those who would sell then when the hour drew towards its close tua would sweep her harp behind the screen that hid her and begin to sing whereon all would cease from their chaffering and listen for never before had they heard so sweet a voice indeed at these times the broad street in front of their house was packed with people for the fame of this singing of hers went through the city and far into the country that lay beyond then the traffic came to an end with her song and leaving their goods in charge of the servants tua and asti departed to the back rooms of the house and ate their meals or wandered in the large walled garden that lay behind  thus the weeks went on and soon although they sold few of the pearls and those the smallest for of the larger gems they said little or nothing they began to grow rich and to hoard up such a weight of gold in dust and nuggets and so many precious things that they scarcely knew what they should do with them still tat seemed to be a peaceful city or at the least none tried to rob or molest them perhaps because a rumour was abroad that these strangers who had come out of the unknown were under the protection of some god  there was nothing to show how or why this rumour had arisen in the city but on account of it if for no other reason these pearlmerchants as they were called suffered no wrong and although they were only undefended women whatever credit they might give the debt was always paid also their servants to whom they added as they had means were all faithful to them so there they remained and traded keeping their secrets and awaiting the appointed hour of escape but never venturing to leave the shelter of their own walls  now as it happened when they came thither the king of tat was away making war upon another king whose country lay upon the coast but after they had dwelt for many weeks in the place this king who was named janees returned victorious from his war and prepared to celebrate a triumph  while he was making ready for this triumph his courtiers told him of these pearlmerchants and desiring pearls for his adornment on that great day he went in disguise to the house of those who sold them as it chanced he arrived late and requested to see the gems just as tua according to her custom was playing upon her harp then she began to sing and this king janees who was a man of under forty years of age listened intently to her beautiful voice forgetting all about the pearls that he had come to buy her song finished the veiled asti rose and bowing to all the company gathered in the street bade her servants shut up the coffers and remove the goods  but i would buy pearls merchant if you have such to sell said janees  then you must return this afternoon purchaser replied asti scanning his pale and haughty face for even if you were the king of tat i would not sell to you out of my hours  you speak high words woman exclaimed janees angrily  high or low they are what i mean answered asti and went away  the end of it was that this king janees returned at the evening hour led thither more by a desire to hear that lovely voice again than to purchase gems still he asked to see pearls and asti showed him some which he thrust aside as too small then she produced those that were larger and again he thrust them aside and so it went on for a long while at length from somewhere in her clothing asti drew two of the biggest that she had perfect pearls of the size of the middle nail of a mans finger and at the sight of these the eyes of janees brightened for such gems he had never seen before then he asked the price asti answered carelessly that it was doubtless more than he would wish to pay since there were few such pearls in the whole world and she named a weight in gold that caused him to step back from her amazed for it was a quarter of the tribute that he had taken from his newconquered kingdom  woman you jest he said surely there is some abatement  man she answered i jest not there is no abatement and she replaced the pearls in her garments  now he grew very angry and asked  did you know that i am the king of tat and if i will can take your pearls without any payment at all  are you asked asti looking at him coolly i should never have guessed it well if you steal my goods as you say you can you will be king of thieves also  now those who heard this saying laughed and the king thought it best to join in their merriment then the bargaining went on but before it was finished at her appointed hour tua began to sing behind the screen  have done said the king to asti tomorrow you shall be paid your price i would listen to that music which is above price  so janees listened like one fascinated for tua was singing her best step by step he drew ever nearer to the screen though this asti did not notice for she was engaged in locking up her goods at length he reached it and thrusting his fingers through the openings in the pierced woodwork rested his weight upon it like a man who is faint as perhaps he was with the sweetness of that music then of a sudden by craft or chance he swung himself backward and with him came the frail screen down it clattered to the floor and lo beyond it unveiled but clad in rich attire stood tua sweeping her harp of ivory and gold like sunlight from a cloud the bright vision of her beauty struck the eyes of the people gathered there and seemed to dazzle them since for a while they were silent then one said  surely this woman is a queen and another answered  nay she is a goddess but ere the words had left his lips tua was gone  as for janees the king he stared at her openmouthed reeling a little upon his feet then as she fled turned to asti saying  is this lady your slave  nay king my daughter whom you have done ill to spy upon  then said janees slowly i who might do less desire to make this daughter of yours my queendo you understand merchant of pearlsmy queen and as a gift you shall have as much gold again as i have promised for your gems  other kings have desired as much and offered more but she is not for you or any of them answered asti looking him in the face  now janees made a movement as though he would strike her then seemed to change his mind for he replied only  a rough answer to a fair offer seeing that none know who you are or whence you come but there are eyes upon us i will talk with you again tomorrow till then rest in peace  it is useless began asti but he was already gone  presently asti found tua in the garden and told her everything  now i wish that kepher of the desert were at hand said tua nervously for it seems that i am in a snare who like this janees no better than i did abi or the prince of kesh and will never be his queen  then i think we had better fly to the wilderness and seek him there this very night for lady you know what chances to men who look upon your loveliness  i know what chanced to the prince of kesh and what will chance to abi at the hands of one i left behind me i can guess perhaps this janees will fare no better still let us go  asti nodded then by an afterthought went into the house and asked some questions of the servants presently she returned and said  it is useless soldiers are already stationed about the place and some of our women who tried to go out have been turned back for they say that by the kings order none may leave our door  now shall i strike upon the harp and call upon the name of kepher as he bade me asked tua  i think not yet awhile lady this danger may pass by or the night bring counsel and then he would be angry if you summoned him for naught let us go in and eat  so they went in and while they sat at their food suddenly they heard a noise and looking up perceived by the light of the lamp that women were crowding into the room led by two eunuchs  tua drew a dagger from her robe and sprang up but the head eunuch an old whitehaired man bowed low before her and said  lady you can kill me if you will for i am unarmed but there are many more of us without and to resist is useless hearken no harm shall be done to you or to your companion but it is the kings desire that one so royal and beautiful should be better lodged than in this place of traffic therefore he has commanded me to take you and all your household and all your goods to no less a place than his own palace where he would speak with you  sheathe the dagger and waste no words upon these slaves daughter said asti since we have no choice let us go  so after they had veiled and robed they suffered themselves to be led out and placed in a double litter with their pearls and gold while the kings women collected all the rest of their goods and took them away together with their servants leaving the house quite empty then guarded by soldiers they were borne through the silent streets till they came to great gates which closed behind them and having passed up many stairs the litter was set down in a large and beautiful room lit with silver lamps of scented oil here and in other rooms beyond they found women of the royal household and their own servants already arranging their possessions  soon it was done and food and wine having been set for them they were left alone in that room and stood looking at each other  now shall i strike and call said tua lifting the harp which she had brought with her look yonder is a windowplace such as that of which kepher spoke  not yet i think lady let us learn all our case ere we call for help and as the words left her lips the door opened and through it clad in his royal robes walked janees the king  now in the centre of this great room was a marble basin filled with pure water which perhaps had served as the bath of the queens who dwelt there in former days or perhaps was so designed for the sake of coolness in times of heat tua and asti stood upon one side of this basin and to the other came the king so that the water lay between them thrice he bowed to tua then said  lady who as your servants tell me are known as neferte a maiden of egypt and for lack of the true name doubtless this will serve lady i come to ask your pardon for what must seem to you to be a grievous wrong o lady neferte this must be my excuse that i have no choice by fortune good or ill i know not which this day i beheld your face and now but one desire is left to me to behold it again and for all my life lady the goddess of love she whom in egypt you name hathor has made me her slave so that i no longer think of pomp or power or wealth or of other women but of you and you only lady i would do you no harm for i offer you half my throne you and you alone shall be my queen speak now  king janees answered tua what evil spirit has entered into you that you should wish to make a queen of a singinggirl the daughter of a merchant who has wandered to your city let me go and keep that high place for one of the great ones of the earth send now to abi who i have heard rules as pharaoh in egypt and ask a daughter of his blood for they say that he has several or to some of the princes of syria or to the king of byblos by lebanon or to the lords of kesh or across the desert to the emperor of punt and let this poor singinggirl go her ways  this poor singinggirl repeated janees after her who or whose mother and he bowed to asti with a smile has pearls to sell that are worth the revenue of a kingdom this singinggirl the ivory figure on whose harp is crowned with the royal uræi of egypt this singinggirl whose chiselled loveliness is such as might be found perhaps among the daughters of ancient kings this singinggirl whose voice can ravish the hearts of men and beasts well lady neferte i thank you for your warning still i am ready to take my chance hoping that my children will not be made ashamed by the blood of such a singinggirl as this who as i saw when that screen fell has stamped upon her throat the holy sign they worship on the nile  i am honoured answered tua coldly yet it may not be among my own humble folk i have a lover and him i will wed or no man  you have a lover then hide his name from me lest presently i should play set to his osiris and rend him into pieces you shake your head knowing doubtless that the man is great yet i tell you that i will conquer him and rend him into pieces for the crime of being loved by you listen now i would make you my queen but queen or not mine you shall be who lie in my power i will not force you i will give you time but if on the morning of the third day from this night you still refuse to share my throne why then you shall sit upon its footstool  now in her anger tua threw back her veil and met him eye to eye  you think me great she said and truly you are right for whatever is my rank with me go my gods and in their strength my innocence is great let me be you petty king of tat lest i lift up my voice to heaven and call down upon you the anger of the gods  already lady you have called down upon me the anger of a goddess that hathor of whom i spoke and for the rest i fear them not let them do their worst on the third night from this night as queen or slave i swear that you shall be mine this woman here whom you call your mother shall be witness to my oath and to its end  aye king broke in asti i will be witness but as to the end of that oath i do not know it yet would you like to learn in my own country i was held to have something of a gift i mean in the way of magic it came to me i know not whence and it is very uncertainat times it is my servant and at times i can do nothing still for your sake i would try is it your pleasure to see that end of which you spoke the end of your attempt to force yonder maiden to be your queen or love  aye woman answered janees if you have a trick show itwhy not  so be it king but of course i have your word that you will not blame me if by any chance the trick should not prove to your likingyour royal word now stand you there and look into this water while i pray our gods the gods of my own country to be gracious and to show you what shall be your state at this same hour on the third night from now which you say and hope shall be the night of your wedding sing my daughter sing that old and sacred song which i have taught you it will serve to while away the tedium of our waiting until the gods declare themselves if such be their will  then asti knelt down by the pool and bent her head and stretched out her hands over the water and tua touched the strings of her harp and began to chant very solemnly in an unknown tongue the words of that chant were low and sweet yet it seemed to janees that they fell like ice upon his hot blood and froze it within his veins at first he kept his eyes fixed upon her beauty but by slow degrees something drew them down to the water of the pool  look a mist gathered on its blackness it broke and cleared and there as in a mirror he saw a picture he saw himself lying stripped and dead a poor naked corpse with wide eyes that stared to heaven and gashed throat and sides whence the blood ran upon the marble floor of his own great hall ruined by fire with its scorched pillars pointing like fingers to the moon there he lay alone and by him stood a hound his own hound that lifted up its head and seemed to howl  the last words of tuas chant died away and with them that picture passed janees leapt back from the edge of the pool glaring at asti  sorceress he cried were you not my guest who names herself the mother of her who shall be my queen i swear that tonight you should die by torture in payment of this foul trick of yours  yet as it is answered asti i think that i shall not die since those who call upon the gods must not quarrel with their oracle moreover i know now what you saw and it may be nothing but a fantasy of your brain or of mine now let us sleep i pray you o king for we are weary and leave its secrets to the future in three days we shall know what they may be  then without another word janees turned and left them  what was it that lay in the pool nurse asked tua i saw nothing  the shadow of a dead man i think answered asti grimly some jealous god has looked upon this poor king whose crime is that he desires you and therefore he must die of a truth it goes ill with your lovers o star of amen and sometimes i wonder if one who is dear to me will meet with better fortune at those royal eyes of yours if ill befalls him i think that at the last i may learn to hate you whom from the first i cherished  now at the thought that she might bring death to rames also tuas tears began to gather and her voice choked in her throat  say not such evilomened words she sobbed since you know well that if he is taken hence for whose sake i endure all these things then i must follow him over the edge of the world moreover you are unjust did i slay the prince of kesh or was it another  another queen but for your sake  and would you have had me wed abi the hog the murderer of my father and of your lord again was it i who but now showed this barbarian chief a shadow in the water or was it asti the witch asti the prophetess of amen lastly will the man die if die he must because he loves me which being a woman i can forgive him or because he laid the hands of violence upon me to force me to be his queen or mistress which i forgive him not oh asti you know well i am not as other women are perchance it is true that some blood that is not human runs in me at least i fulfil a doom laid on me before my birth and working woe or working weal i go as my feet are led by ghosts and gods why then do you upbraid me and she ceased and wept outright  nay nay be comforted i upbraid you not answered asti drawing her to her breast who am i that i should cast reproaches at amens star and daughter and my queen i know well that the house of your fate is built that sail you up stream or sail you down stream you must pass its gate at last it was fear for rames that made me speak so bitterly rames my only child if indeed he is left to me for i who have so much wisdom cannot learn from man or spirit whether he lives here or with osiris since some black veil hangs between our souls i fear lest the gods grown jealous of that high love of yours should wreak their wrath upon him who has dared to win it and bring rames to the grave before his time and the thought of it rends my heart  now it was tuas turn to play the comforter  surely she said surely my fostermother you forget the promise of amen king of the gods which he made ere i was born to ahura who bore me that i should find a royal lover and that from his love and mine should spring many kings and princes and that this being so rames must live  why must he live lady seeing that even if he can be called royal there are others  nay asti murmured tua laying her head upon her breast for me there are no others nor shall any child of mine be born that does not name rames father whatever else is doubtful this is sure therefore rames lives and will live or the king of the gods has lied  you reason well said asti and kissed her then she thought for a moment and added now to our work it is the hour take the harp go to the windowplace and call as the beggarman bade you do in your need  so tua went to the windowplace and looked down on the great courtyard beneath that was lit with the light of the moon then she struck on the harp and thrice she cried aloud  kepher kepher kepher  and each time the echo of her cry came back louder and still more loud till it seemed as though earth and heaven were filled with the sound of the name of kepher    chapter xvi  the beggar and the king  it was the afternoon of the third day tua and asti seated in the windowplace of their splendid prison looked through the wooden screen down into the court below where according to his custom at this hour janees the king sat in the shadow to administer justice and hear the petitions of his subjects the two women were ill at ease for the time of respite had almost passed  night draws near said tua and with it will come janees look how he eyes this window like a hungry lion waiting to be fed kepher has made no sign perchance after all he is but a wandering beggarman filled with strange fancies or perchance he is dead as may well happen at his age at least he makes no sign nor does amen to whom i have prayed so hard send any answer to my prayers i am forsaken oh asti you who are wise tell me what shall i do  trust in the gods said asti there are still three hours to sundown and in three hours the gods to whom time is nothing can destroy the world and build it up again remember when we starved in the pylon tower at memphis and what befell us there remember the leap to death and the boat of ra and those by whom it was captained remember and trust in the gods  i trustin truth i trust asti but yetoh let us talk of something else i wonder what has chanced in memphis since we left it in so strange a fashion do you think that awful ka of mine queens it there with abi for a husband if so i almost grieve for abi for she had something in her eyes which chilled my mortal blood and yet you say she is a part of me a spirit who cannot die cast in my mould and given to me at birth i would i had another ka and that you could draw it forth again asti to bewitch this janees and hold him while we fled see that case draws to an end at length janees is giving judgment or rather his councillor is for he prompts him all the time can you not hear his whispers as for janees himself his thoughts are here i feel his eyes burn me through this wooden screen he is about to rise why who comes awake nurse and look  asti obeyed there in the gate of the court she saw a tall man whitebearded yellowfaced hornyeyed ancient who clad in a tattered robe leaned upon his staff of thornwood and stared about him blindly as though the sun bewildered him the guards came to thrust him away but he waved his staff and they fell back from him as though there were power in that staff now his slow tortoiselike eyes seemed to catch sight of the glittering throne and of him who sat upon it and with long strides he walked to the throne and halted in front of it again leaning on his staff  who is this fellow asked janees in an angry voice who stands here and makes no obeisance to the king  are you a king asked kepher i am very blind i thought you were but a common man such as i am only clad in bright clothes tell me what is it like to be a king and have all things beneath your feet do you still hope and suffer and fear death like a common man is the flesh beneath your gold and purple the same as mine beneath my rags do old memories torment you memories of the dead who come no more can you feel griefs and the ache of disappointment  do i sit here to answer riddles fool answered janees angrily turn the fellow out i have business  now guards sprang forward to do the kings bidding but again kepher waved his staff and again they fell back certainly it seemed as though there were power in that staff  business king he said not of the state i think but with one who lodges yonder and he nodded towards the shuttered room whence tua watched him well that is three hours hence after the sun has set so you still have time to listen to my prayer which you will do as it is of this same lady with whom you have business  what do you know of the lady you old knave and of my dealings with her asked janees angrily  much of both o king for i am her father andshall i tell the rest  her father you hoary liar broke in janees  aye her father and i have come to tell you that as our blood is more ancient than yours i will not have you for a soninlaw any more than that daughter of mine will have you for a husband  now some of the courtiers who heard these words laughed outright but janees did not laugh his dark face turned white with rage and he gasped for breath  drag this madman forth he shouted at length and cut out his insolent tongue  again the guards sprang forward but before ever they reached him kepher was speaking in a new voice a voice so terrible that at the sound of it they stopped leaving him untouched  beware how you lay a finger on me you men of tat he cried for how know you who dwells within these rags janees you who call yourself a king listen to the commands of a greater king whose throne is yonder above the sun ere night falls upon the earth set that maiden upon whom you would force yourself and her companion and all her goods without your southern gate and leave them there unharmed such is the command of the king of kings who dwells on high  and what if i mock at the command of this king asked janees  mock not replied kepher bethink you of a certain picture that the lady asti showed you in the water and mock not  it was but an egyptian trick wizard and one in which i see you had a hand begone i defy you and your sorceries and your king tonight that maid shall be my wife  then janees lord of tat listen to the doom that i am sent to decree upon you tonight you shall have another bride and her name is death moreover for their sins and because their eyes are evil and they have rejected the worship of the gods many of your people shall accompany you to darkness and tomorrow another king who is not of your house shall rule in tat  kepher ceased speaking then turned and walked slowly down the court of judgment and through its gates nor did any so much as lift a finger to stay him for now about this old man there seemed to be a majesty which made them strengthless  bring that wizard back and kill him here shouted janees presently as the spell passed off them and like hounds from a leash they sprang forward to do the bidding of the king  but without the walls they could not find him a woman had seen him here a child had seen him there some slaves had watched him pass yonder and ran away because they noted that he had no shadow at length after many a false turn they tracked him to the southern gate and there the guard said that just such a beggarman had passed through as they were about to close the gate vanishing into the sandstorm which blew without they followed but so thickly blew that sand that they lost each other in their search and but just before sundown returned to the palace singly where in his rage the king commanded them to be beaten with rods upon their feet  now the darkness came and at the appointed hour janees hardening his heart went up into the chamber where dwelt tua and asti leaving his guard of eunuchs at the door the lamps were lit within that chamber and the windowplaces closed but without the desert wind howled loudly and the air was blind with sand on the farther side of the marble basin as once before tua and asti stood awaiting him  lady he said it is the appointed hour and i seek your answer  king replied tua hear me and for your own sakenot for mine i am more than i seem i have friends in the earth and air did not one of them visit you today in yonder court put away this madness and let me be for i wish you good not evil but if you so much as lay a finger on me then i think that evil draws near or at the best i die by my own hand  lady replied janees in a cold voice have done with threats i await your answer  king said tua for the last time i plead with you you think that i lie to save myself but it is not so i would save you look now and she threw back her veil and opened the wrappings about her throat look at that which is stamped upon my breast and thinkis it well to offer violence to a woman who bears this holy seal  i have heard of such a one said janees hoarsely for the sight of her beauty maddened him they say that she was born in thebes and of a strange father though if so how came she here i am told that she reigns as pharaoh in egypt  ask that question of your oracles o king but remember that rumour does not always lie and let the daughter of that strange father go  there is another who claims to be your father lady if by now my soldiers have not scourged him to his deatha tattered beggarman  whom those soldiers could not touch or find broke in asti speaking for the first time  well went on janees without heeding her whether your father be a beggar or a god or even if you are hathors self come down from heaven to be the death of men know that i take you for my own for the third time answer will you be my queen of your own choice or must my women drown yonder witch in this water at your feet and drag you hence  now tua made no answer she only let fall her veil folded her arms upon her breast and waited but asti mocking him cried in a loud voice that he might hear above the howling of the hurricane without  call your women king for the air is full of sand that chokes my throat and i long for the water which you promise me  then in his fury janees turned and shouted  come hither slaves and do what i have commanded you  as he spoke the door burst open and through it no longer clad in rags but wearing a white robe and headdress walked kepher the wanderer while after him their red swords in their hands came savagelooking chiefs bearded blankfaced roundeyed with gold chains that clanked upon their mail captains of the desert men who knew neither fear nor mercy  janees looked and understood he snatched out his sword and for a moment stayed irresolute while the great men ringed him round and waited their eyes fixed on kephers face  spare him father if it may be so said tua since love has made him mad  too late answered kepher solemnly those who will not accept the warning of the gods must suffer the vengeance of the gods janees you who would do violence to a helpless woman your palace burns your city is in my keeping and the few who stood by you are slain janees tomorrow another shall rule in your place amen the father has decreed your doom  aye echoed janees heavily too late mortals cannot fight against the gods that make their sport of them some god commanded that i should love some god commands that i shall die so be it i am glad to die would that i had not been born to know grief and death tell me o prophet what evil power is there which ordains that we must be born and suffer  kepher beckoned to tua and to asti and they followed him leaving janees ringed round by those sternfaced men  farewell lady he called to tua as she passed here and hereafter remember this of janees king of tat that he who might have saved his life chose to die for love of you  then they went and saw him no more  they passed the door of the great marble chamber about which they found guards and eunuchs lying dead they passed down the stairways and through the tall gates where more soldiers lay dead and looking behind them saw that the palace was in flames they reached the square without and at the command of kepher entered into a litter and were borne by black slaves whither they knew not  all that night they were borne awake or sleeping till at length the morning came and they descended from the litter to find themselves in an oasis of the wilderness surrounded by a vast army of the desert men of the city of tat they could see nothing like a dream it had passed out of their lives nor did they ever hear of it and its king again only in the pavilion that had been provided for them they found their pearls and gold and tuas ivory harp  they laid themselves down and slept for they were very weary only to wake when once more the day had dawned then they rose and ate of the food that had been placed by them and went out of the tent in the shadow of some palm trees stood kepher awaiting them and with him certain of the sternfaced desert chiefs who bowed as they advanced  hearken lady neferte and you o asti her companion said kepher to them i must depart who this matter finished have my bread to beg far from here yet fear not for know that these lords of the desert are your servants and for this reason were they born that they may help you on your way repeat your orders he continued addressing the chiefs  then the captain of them all said  wanderer known to our fathers grandfathers guardian of our race by whom we live and triumph these are your commands that we lead this divine lady and her companion a journey of many moons across the deserts and mountains till at length we bring her to the gates of the city of gold where our task ends while one man of us remains alive they shall be obeyed  you hear said kepher to tua put your trust in these men go in peace in the day time and sleep in peace at night for be sure that they shall not fail you but if they or any other should perchance bring you into trouble then strike upon the harp and call the name you know as you called it in the house of janees the mad and i think that one will come to you lords of the desert whose great grandsires were known to me and who live by my wisdom this divine lady is in your keeping see that you guard her as you should and when the journey is done return and make report to me farewell  then lifting his staff without speaking another word to tua or to asti kepher strode away from amongst them walking through the ranks of the desert men who forced their camels to kneel and saluted him as he passed presently they saw him standing alone upon a ridge and looking towards them for a while then of a sudden he was gone  who is that man o captain at whose bidding the wilderness swarms with tribesmen and kings are brought to doom asked asti when she had watched him disappear  lady he answered i cannot tell you but from the beginning he has been master of the desert and those who dwell therein at his word the sandwind blows as it blew yesterday to cover our advance at his word the fountains spring and tribes grow great or sink to nothingness we think that he is a spirit who moves where he lists and executes the decrees of heaven at the least though they but see him from time to time all the dwellers in the wilderness obey him as we do and ill does it go as you have learned with those dwellers in cities who know not the power which breathes beneath that tattered robe  i thank you answered asti i think with you that this wanderer is a spirit and a great one so great that i will not name his name captains my lady is ready to march towards the city of gold whither you will lead us    for day after day for week after week for month after month they marched southward and westward across the desert and in the centre of their host mounted upon camels rode tua and asti veiled once the hillmen attacked them in a defile of some rugged mountains but they beat them back and once there was a great battle with other tribes of the wilderness who hearing that they had a goddess among them sought to capture her for themselves these tribes also they defeated with slaughter for when the fight hung in the balance tua herself headed the charge of her horsemen and at the sight of her in her white robes the enemy fled amazed once also they camped for two whole months in an oasis waiting till rain should fall for the country beyond lacked water at length it came and they went on again on and on over the endless lands till on a certain night they pitched their tent upon a hill  at the first brightening of the dawn tua and asti went out and there beneath them near to the banks of a great river which they knew for the nile they saw the pyramids and the temples of napata the golden the southern city of amen and thanked the gods who had brought them here in safety  while they still gazed upon its glories in the red light of the rising sun the captain of the desert men appeared and bowed before them  divine lady he said woman or goddess whichever you may be we have fulfilled the command given to us by kepher the ancient king of the wilderness beneath you lies napata whither we have journeyed through so many weary months but we would draw no nearer to its walls who from generation to generation are sworn not to enter any city save in war lady our task is done and our men murmur to be led back to their own place where their wives and children await them ere thinking that we are enemies the people of napata sally forth to attack us  it is well answered tua i thank you and the gods shall give you your reward leave us and go back to your homes but before you go take a gift from me  then she sent for the gold that they had gathered in their trading in the city of tat and gave it to be divided among them a great and precious treasure only the pearls she kept with a little of the gold so the captains saluted her and in the mists of the morning they and their swarthy host stole away and soon were hidden in a cloud of dust  from the backs of their camels tua and asti watched them go like a dream of the night then with no word spoken between them for their lips were sealed with hope and wonder wrapping themselves in their dark cloaks they rode down to the highway by the banks of the nile which led to the walls of napata mingling with other travellers they passed through the field of pyramids and coming to the beautiful northern gate that was covered over with gold waited there for this gate was not yet opened a woman who led three asses laden with green barley and vegetables which she purposed to sell in the marketplace fell into talk with them asking them whence they came  asti answered from the city of meroe adding that they were singers and dealers in pearls  then you have come to the right place answered the woman for pearls are rare at napata which is so far from the sea also it is said that the young king loves singing if it be good  the young king asked asti what is his name and where is the old king  you cannot have dwelt long in meroe strangers answered the woman suspiciously or you would know that the old king dwells with osiris beneath yonder pyramid where the general of the pharaoh of egypt he who rules here now buried him after the great battle oh it is a strange story and i do not know the rights of it who sell my stuff and take little heed of such things but at the last high nile before one this general came with three thousand soldiers of egypt and the body of the prince of kesh whom it seems he had slain somewhere it is said because both of them sought the favour of the queen of egypt as they tell this was the command of that queenthat he should submit himself to the king of napata to be judged for his crime this he did and the king in his fury commanded that he should be hanged from the mast of the sacred boat of amen the general answered that he was ready to be hanged if the king could hang him then there was a war between the people of napata and the egyptians aided by many of the soldiers of the city who hated their master and rebelled against his rule which was ever cruel the end of it was that the egyptians and the rebels won and the king having fallen in the fight they crowned the egyptian general in his place  his nameoh i forget it he has so many but he is a goodly man to look at and all love him although he is mad see the gates are open at last farewell and dragging her asses by the halter the peasant woman mingled with the crowd and was gone  tua and asti also mingled with the crowd and rode on up a wide street till they came to a square planted round with trees on one side of which was built a splendid palace here they halted their camels not knowing whither they should go and as they stood irresolute the gates of the palace opened and through them came a body of horsemen clad in armour  see the writing on their shields whispered asti  tua looked and read and lo there in the royal cartouche was her own name and after it new titlesqueen of the upper and the lower land opener of the gates of the south divine lady of napata by grace of amen father of the gods  it seems that i have subjects here she murmured who elsewhere have none then ceased  for now through the gate rode one mounted on a splendid horse whose shape seemed familiar to her even while he was far away  who is that faltered tua  my heart tells me it is rames my son answered asti grasping at her saddlerope    chapter xvii  tua finds her lover  rames it was without a doubt rames grown older and stern and sad of face but still rames and no other man and oh their eyes swam and their hearts beat at the sight of him  say shall we declare ourselves asked asti  nay answered tua not here and now he would not believe and we cannot unveil before all these men also first i desire to learn more let him pass  rames rode on till he came opposite to where the two women sat on their white camels beneath a tree when something seemed to attract his gaze to them he looked once carelessly and turned his head away he looked a second time and again turned his head though more slowly he looked a third time and his eyes remained fixed upon those two veiled women seated on their camels beneath the trees then as though acting upon some impulse he pulled upon his horses bit and rode up to them  who are you stranger ladies he asked who own such fine camels  tua bowed her head that the folds of her veil might hide her shape but asti answered in a feigned voice  sir both of us are merchants and one is a harper and a singer we have travelled hither up the nile to the golden city because we understand that in napata pearls are rare and such we have to sell also we were told that the new king of this city loved good singing and my companion who sings and harps learned her art in egypt even at thebes the holy but who are you sir that question us  lady answered rames i am an egyptian who holds this town on behalf of the queen of egypt whom once i knew or perhaps i should say that i hold it on behalf of the pharaoh of egypt since my spies tell me that the star of amen has taken abi prince of memphis to husband although they add that he finds her a masterful wife and he laughed bitterly  sir replied asti it is long since we left holy thebes some years indeed and we know nothing of these things who ply our trade from place to place but if you are the governor of this town show us we pray you as countrywomen of yours where we may lodge in safety and at your leisure this afternoon permit that we exhibit our pearls before you and when that is done and you have bought or refused them as you may wish that my companion should sing to you some of the ancient songs of egypt  ladies answered rames i am a soldier who would rather buy swords than pearls also as it chances i am a man who dwells alone one in whose household no women can be found yet because you are of my country or by amen i know not why i grant you your request i go out to exercise this company in the arts of war but after sundown you shall come to my palace and i will see your wares and hear your songs till then farewell officer he added to a captain who had followed him take these egyptians and their camels and give them a lodging in the guesthouse where they will not be molested and at sundown bring them to me  then still staring at them as though they held his eyes in their hearts rames departed and the captain led them to their lodging    it was the hour of sundown and tua adorned in beautiful white raiment broidered with royal purple that she carried in her baggage on the camel with her long hair combed out and scented a necklace of great pearls upon her bosom a veil flung over her head and her harp of gold and ivory in her hand waited to be led before rames asti his mother waited also but she was clad in a plain black robe and over her head was a black veil presently that captain who had shown them their lodging came to them and asked if they were ready to be led before the viceroy of napata  viceroy answered asti i thought he was a king  so he is my good woman replied the captain but it his fancy to call himself the viceroy of netertua star of amen wife of abi the usurper who rules in egypt a mad fancy when he might be a pharaoh on his own account but so it is  well sir said asti we merchants have nothing to do with these high matters lead us to this pharaoh or general or viceroy with whom we hope to transact business  so the captain conducted them to a side gate of the palace and thence through various passages and halls in some of which tua recognised officers of her own whom she had commanded to accompany rames to an apartment of no great size where he bade them be seated presently a door opened and through it came rames plainly dressed in the uniform of an egyptian general on which they saw he wore no serpent crest or other of the outward signs of royalty only on his right hand that lacked the little finger gleamed a certain royal ring which tua knew with him also were several captains to whom he talked of military affairs  seeing the two women he bowed to them courteously and asked them to forgive him for having kept them waiting for him then he said  what was it that you wished to show me ladies oh i remember precious stones well i fear me that you have brought them to a bad market seeing that although napata is called the city of gold she needs all her wealth for her own purposes and i draw from it only a generals pay and a sum for the sustenance of my household which is small still let me look at your wares for if i do not buy myself perhaps i may be able to find you a customer  now when they saw the young mans noble face and bearing and heard his simple words the hearts of asti and tua his mother and his love beat so hard within their breasts that for a while they could scarcely speak glad were they indeed that the veils they wore hid their troubled faces from his eyes which as in the morning lingered on them curiously  at length controlling herself with an effort asti answered  perchance lord the great lady your wife or the ladies your companions will buy if you do not  have i not already told you merchant asked rames angrily that i have no wife and no companions that are not men  you said so sir she replied humbly always speaking in her feigned voice yet forgive us if we believed you not since in our journeyings my daughter and i have seen many princes and know that such a thing is contrary to their nature still we will show you our wares for surely all the men in napata are not unmarried  then without more ado she drew out a box of scented cedar and opening it revealed a diadem of pearls worked into the shape of the royal uræus which they had fashioned thus at tat and also a few of their largest single gems  beautiful indeed said rames looking at them though there is but one who has the right to wear this crown the divine queen of the upper and the lower land and he sighed  nay lord replied asti for surely her husband might wear it also  it would sit but ill on the fat head of abi from all i hear lady he broke in laughing bitterly  or went on asti taking no heed of his words a general who had conquered a great country could usurp it and find none to reprove him especially if he himself happened to be of the royal blood  now rames looked at her sharply  you speak strange words he said but doubtless it is by chance merchant those pearls of yours are for richer men than i am shut them in the box again and let the lady your daughter sing some old song of egypt for such i long to hear  so be it lord answered asti still keep the diadem as a gift since it was made for you alone and may yet be useful to youwho can know it is the price we pay for liberty to trade in your dominions nay unless you keep it my daughter shall not sing  let it lie there then most princely merchant and we will talk of the matter afterwards now for the song  then her moment come at last tua stood up and holding the ivory harp beneath her veil she swept its golden chords disguising her voice as asti had done she began to sing somewhat low a short and gentle lovesong which soon came to an end  it is pretty said rames when she had finished and reminds me of i know not what but have you no fuller music at your command if so i would listen to it before i bid you goodnight  she bent her head and answered almost in a whisper  lord if you wish it i will sing you the story of one who dared to set his heart too high and of what befell him at the hands of an angry goddess  sing on he answered once i heard such a storyelsewhere  then tua swept her harp and sang again but this time with all her strength and soul as the first glorious notes floated from her lips rames rose from his seat and stood staring at her entranced on went the song and on as she had sung it in the banqueting hall of pharaoh at thebes so she sang it in the chamber of rames at napata the scribe dared the sanctuary the angry goddess smote him cold in death the highpriestess wailed and mourned the queen of love relented and gave him back his life again then came that last glorious burst when lifted up to heaven the two lovers forgiven purged chanted their triumph to the stars and by slow degrees the music throbbed itself to silence  look whitefaced trembling rames clung to a pillar in his chamber while tua sank back upon her chair and the harp she held slipped from her hand down upon the floor  whence came that harp he gasped surely there are not two such in the world woman you have stolen it nay how can you have stolen the music and the voice as well lady forgive me i have no thought of evil but oh grant me a boon why i will tell you afterwards grant me a boonlet me look upon your face  tua lifted her hands and undid the fastening of her veil which slipped from her to her feet showing her in the rich array of a prince of egypt his eyes met her beautiful eyes and for a while they gazed upon each other like folk who dream  what trick is this he said angrily at last before me stands the star of amen egypts anointed queen the harp she bears was the royal gift of the prince of kesh he who fell that night beneath my sword the voice is egypts voice the song is egypts song nay how can it be i am mad you are magicians come to mock me for that star amens daughter reigns a thousand miles away with the lord she chose abi her own uncle he who they say murdered pharaoh get you gone sorceress lest i cause the priests of amen whereof you also make a mock to cast you to the flames for blasphemy  slowly very slowly tua opened the wrappings about her throat revealing the sign of life that from her birth was stamped above her bosom  when they see this holy mark think you that the priests of amen will cast me to the flames o royal son of mermes asked tua softly  why not he answered if you have power to lie in one thing you have power to lie in all she who can steal the loveliness of egypts self can also steal the signet of the god  say did you o rames also steal that other signet on your hand a queens gift i think that once a pharaoh wore say also how did you lose the little finger of that hand was it perchance in the maw of a certain god that dwells in the secret pool of a temple at holy thebes  so tua spake and waited a while but rames said nothing he opened his mouth to answer indeed but a dumbness sealed his lips  nurse she went on presently i cannot persuade this lord that i am egypt and no other try you  so asti loosed her black veil and let it fall about her feet he stared at her noble features and grey hair then uttering a great cry of mother my mother who they swore to me was dead in memphis he flung himself upon her breast and there burst into weeping  aye rames said asti presently your mother she who bore you and no other woman and with her one who because her royal heart loves you now as from the first from moon to moon for two whole years has braved the dangers of the desert and of wicked men till at last amen her father brings her safely to your side now do you believe  aye answered rames i believe  then o faithful captain said tua take this gift from egypts queen which a while ago you thrust aside and be its lord and mine and lifting the diadem of pearls crested with the royal uræi she set it on his brow as once before she had done in that hour of dawn when she vowed herself to him in thebes    it was night and all their wonderful story had been told  such is our tale rames my son said asti and long may you search before you find another that will match it now tell us yours  it is short mother he answered obeying the commands of her majesty yonder and he bowed towards tua who sat at the further side of the table at which they ate i travelled up the nile to this city as the old king the father of the prince of kesh would have slain me i attacked him first by the help of my egyptians and his own subjects andwell he died moreover none regretted him for he was a bad king and i stepped into his place and ever since have been engaged in righting matters which they needed long ago i would have returned to egypt and reported myself only my spies told me of all that had happened there they told me for instance of the murder of pharaoh by the witchcraft of abi and his companions and they told me that pharaohs daughter the star of amen forgetting all things and the oath she swore to me had married her old uncle abi that she might save her life and power  and you believed them rames asked tua reproachfully  what else could i do but believe lady seeing that those same spies swore that they had seen your majesty seated upon your throne at memphis and elsewhere and causing abi to run to and fro like a little dog and do your bidding in all things how could i know that it was your double and not yourself that married abi  i think that abi knows today answered tua since it seems that a ka makes but a bad wife to any man but now what shall we do  will you not first marry me lady suggested rames afterwards we can think  aye she answered i will marry you as i have promised but in one place only the temple of amen in egypt first win me back my throne then ask for my hand  it shall be done he answered though how i know not seeing that another sits upon that throne of yours who perhaps will not be willing to bid it farewell  we will send her a message son said asti now leave us for we must sleep  where is your messenger mother asked rames as he went  have you known me all these years my son and not learned that i have servants whom you cannot see answered asti    it was midnight and in their chamber of the palace of rames asti and tua knelt side by side in prayer to amen father of the gods then their petitions finished asti rose to her feet and once again as in the pylon tower at memphis uttered the awful words that in bygone days had been spoken to her by the spirit of ahura the divine in osiris  there was a sound as of whispering a sound as of beating wings lo in the shadow beyond the lamplight a mist gathered that brightened by degrees and took shape the shape of a royal woman clad in the robes and ornaments of egypts queen whose face was as the face of netertua only prouder and more unearthly in silence it stood before them scanning them with its glittering eyes  whence come you o double asked asti  from that place where your command found me o mistress of secret things from the house of abi at thebes wherein he seems to rule as pharaoh the form answered in its cold voice  how fares it with abi and with egypt o double  with abi it fares but ill he wastes in toil and fear and longings and knows no happy hour but with egypt it fares well never o lady of strength was she more great than she is today for in all things i have fulfilled the commandments that were laid upon me and now i desire to rest in that bosom whence i came and she pointed to tua who stood and watched  not yet o double for there is still work for you to do and then you shall be at peace till the day of the last awakening hearken return to thebes and tell a false tale in the ears of abi and his councillors say that rames the egyptian who has seized the rule of kesh has declared himself pharaoh of egypt by right of race and your husband by the promise of him who ruled before you whom abi did to death cause this abi to gather a great army and to march southward to make an end of rames but secretly whisper into the ears of the generals of this army that it is true the divine pharaoh who is gone promised you in marriage to rames with your own consent and by the command of amen father of the gods and of your spirit whisper to them that amen is wrath with abi because of his crime as he will show them in due season and that those who rebel against him shall have his love and favour at the gateway of the south whence the nile rushes northward between great walls of rock rames shall meet the army of abi with him will come her of whom you are and i whom you must obey also perchance another who is greater than all of us there at the gateway of the south your task shall be accomplished and you shall find the rest you seek it is said  i hear the command and it shall be done answered the ka in its cold passionless voice only lady of the secrets doer of the will divine delay not lest outworn i should break back like a flame to yonder breast that is my home slaying as i come and leaving wreck behind me  then as the figure had appeared so also it disappeared growing faint by degrees and vanishing away into the night out of which it came    it was morning at thebes and abi sat in the great hall of pharaoh transacting business of the state while at his side stood kaku the vizier changed were both of them indeed since they had plotted the death of their guest and king at memphis for now abi was so worn with work and fear and wretchedness that his royal robes hung about him in loose folds while kaku had become an old old man who trembled as he walked  is the business finished officer asked abi impatiently  nay mighty lord answered kaku there is still enough to keep you sitting here till noon and after that you must receive the council and the embassies  i will not receive them let them wait till another day knave would you work me to death who have never known an hours rest or peace since the happy time when i ruled as prince of memphis  lord answered kaku bowing humbly weary or no you must receive them for so it has been decreed by her majesty the queen whose command may not be broken  the queen exclaimed abi in a low voice rolling his hollow eyes around him as though in fear oh kaku would that i had never beheld the queen i tell you that she is not a woman as indeed you know well but a fiend with a heart of ice and the venomous cunning of a snake i am called pharaoh yet am but her puppet to carry out her decrees i am called her husband yet she is still no wife to me or to any although all men love her and by that love are ofttimes brought to doom last night again she vanished from my side as i sat listening to her orders and after a while lo there she was as before only as it seemed to me somewhat weary i asked her where she had been and she answered further than i could travel in a year to visit one she loved as much as she hated me now who can that be kaku  rames i think lord he who has made himself king of kesh replied kaku in an awed whisper without a doubt she loved the man when she was a woman though whom she loves now the evil gods know alone we are in her power and must work her will for lord if we do not we shall die and i think that neither of us desires to die since beyond that gate dead pharaoh waits for us  at these words abi groaned aloud wiping the sweat from his blanched face with the corner of his robe and saying  there you speak truly go call the scribes and let us get on with the queens business  kaku turned to obey when suddenly heralds entered the empty hall crying  her majesty the queen waits without with a great company and humbly craves audience of her good lord the divine pharaoh of the upper and the lower land  abi and kaku looked at each other and despair was in their eyes  let her majesty enter said the king in a low voice  the heralds retired and presently through the cedar doors appeared the queen in state she was splendid to behold splendid in her proud beauty splendid in her dress and in her royal ornaments on she swept up the hall attended by merytra who bore her fan and cushion for it was her pleasure that this woman should wait upon her day and night without pause or rest although she who had once been so handsome now was worn almost to nothingness with toil and terror behind merytra came guards and highpriests and after them the great lords of the council who were called the kings companions and the generals of the army  on she swept up the hall till reaching the foot of the throne whereon abi sat she motioned to merytra to place the cushion upon its step and knelt saying  i am come as a loyal wife to make a humble prayer to pharaoh my lord in the presence of his court  rise and speak on great lady answered abi it is not fit that you should kneel to me  nay it is most fit that pharaohs queen should kneel to pharaoh when she seeks his divine favour yet she rose and seating herself in a chair that had been brought spoke thus  o pharaoh last night i dreamed a dream i dreamed of the count rames son of mermes the last of that royal race which ruled before our house in egypt i mean that man who slew the prince of kesh in this very hall and whom my father being sick i sent to napata to be judged by the king of kesh but who it seems overthrew that king and took his kingdom in the name of egypt  i dreamed that this bold and able man not satisfied with the rich kingdom of kesh has made a scheme to attack egypt to slay you most glorious lord to proclaim himself pharaoh by right of ancient blood and moreto take me your faithful wife to be his wife and thereby secure his throne  without doubt queen this turbulent rames might think of such things said abi and so far your dream may be true yet it should be remembered that at present he is at napata which is a very long way off and has probably only a small army at his command so why should you trouble about what he thinks  o pharaoh that was not all my dream for in it i saw two pictures the first was of this bold rames attacking thebes and conquering it yes and dragging me away to be his wife over your very corpse o pharaoh the second was of you and your army meeting him at the gate of the south land and slaying him and taking possession of the kingdom of kesh and its golden city and ruling them for egypt until you die  here be two dreams o queen said abi tell us now which would you follow for both of them cannot be right  how can i know pharaoh and how can you know yet by your side stands one who will know for he is the first of magicians and a chosen interpreter of the heart of the gods grant that he may make this matter clear and she pointed to kaku who stood by the throne  divine lady stammered kaku the thing is too high for me i have no message i cannot tell you  you were ever overmodest kaku said the queen command him o pharaoh to shed the light of his wisdom on us for without doubt he knows the truth  yes yes said abi he knows it he knows everything kaku delay not interpret the dream of her majesty  i cannot i will not spluttered the old astrologer ask my wife the lady merytra there she is wiser than i am  my good friend merytra has already told me her mind said the queen now we wait for yours a prophet must speak when the gods call on him or she added slowly he must cease to be a prophet who betrays the gods by hiding their high counsel  now kaku could find no way of escape so since he feared the very name of rames within himself he determined that he would interpret the dream in the sense that pharaoh should await the attack of this rames at thebes and while every ear listened to him thus began his tale yet as he spoke he felt the glittering eyes of that spirit who was called the queen fix themselves upon him and compel his tongue so that he said just what he did not mean to say  a light shines in me he cried and i see that the second vision of her majesty is the true vision you must go up with your army to the gate of the south o pharaoh and there meet this usurper rames that these matters may be brought to their appointed end  their appointed end what appointed end shouted abi  doubtless that which her majesty dreamed answered kaku at least it is laid upon me to tell you that you must go up to the gate of the south  then i wish that the gate of the south were laid upon you also o evil prophet exclaimed abi for two years only have i ruled in egypt and lo three wars have been my portion a war against the people of syria a war against the desert men and a war against the nine bow barbarians that invaded the low lands must i now in my age undertake another war against the terrible sons of kesh also let this dog rames come if come he will and i will hang him here at the gates of thebes  nay nay o pharaoh replied kaku it is laid upon me to tell you that you must hang him in the desert hundreds of miles away from thebes that is the interpretation of the vision that is the command of the gods  the gods have spoken by the mouth of their prophet cried the queen in a thrilling triumphant voice now pharaoh priests councillors and captains of egypt let us make ready to travel to the gate of the south and there hang the dog rames in the desert land that thus egypt and egypts king and egypts queen may be freed from danger and rest in peace and the wealth of the city of gold be divided amongst you all  aye aye answered the priests councillors and captains the shrill voice of kaku leading the chorus still against his will let us go up at once and let her majesty accompany us  yes said the queen i will accompany you for though i be but a woman shall i shrink from what pharaoh my dear lord dares we will sail at the new moon    that night abi and kaku stood face to face  what is this that you have done asked abi do you not remember the words which dead pharaoh spoke in the awful vision that came to me that night at memphis when he bade me take the royal loveliness which i desired to be my wife do you not remember that he bade me also reign in her right until i met one rames son of mermes and with him a beggarman who is charged with another message for me  i remember answered kaku in a hollow voice  what then is this message man that will come from rames or the beggar is it not the message of my death and yours of us whose tombs were finished but yesterday  it may be so lord  then why did you interpret the dream of the queen in the sense that i must hurry southwards to meet this very ramesand my doom  because i could not help it groaned kaku that spirit who is called a queen compelled me abi there is no escape for us we are in the net of fateunless unless you dare and he looked meaningly at the sword that hung by pharaohs side  nay kaku he answered i dare not let us live while we may knowing what awaits us beyond the gate  aye moaned kaku beyond the gate of the south where we shall find rames the avenger and that beggar who is charged with a message for us    chapter xviii  the judgment of the gods  three more months had gone by and the great host of pharaoh was encamped beyond the southern gate and the warships of pharaoh were anchored thick on either bank of the nile there they lay prepared for battle for spies had reported to them that the general rames lord of kesh was advancing northward swiftly though with so small an army that it could easily be destroyed therefore abi waited there to destroy it without further toil nor did his terrible queen gainsay him she also seemed content to wait  one evening as the sun sank it was told to them that the troops of rames had appeared and occupied the mountains on the right bank of the nile being encamped around that temple of amen which had stood there for thousands of years  good said the queen tomorrow pharaoh will go up against him and make an end of this matter is it not so pharaoh and she looked at him with her glittering eyes  yes yes answered abi the sooner the better for i am worn out and would return to thebes yet he added in a weak uncertain voice i misdoubt me of this war i know not why what is it that you stare at in the heavens so fixedly o kaku  now the eyes of the council were turned on kaku the vizier and they perceived that he was much disturbed  look he said pointing with a trembling finger towards the skies  they looked and saw hanging just above the evening glow a very bright and wonderful star and near to it another paler star which presently it seemed to cover  the star of amen gasped kaku in a voice that shook and your star o pharaoh the star of amen eats it up your star goes out and will never be seen again by living man oh abi that which i foresaw years and years ago has come to pass your day is done and your night is at hand o abi  if so shouted abi in his rage and terror be sure of this dogthat you shall share it  as he spoke a sound of screams drew near and presently into the midst of them rushed merytra the wife of kaku  the vengeance of the gods she screamed the vengeance of the gods listen abi but now this very evening as i slept in my pavilion who can never sleep at night there appeared to me the spirit of dead pharaoh of pharaoh whom we slew by magic and he said tell the murderer abi and the wizardrogue kaku your husband that i summon both of them to meet me ere another sun is set and woman come you with them death is at our door abi death and the terrible vengeance of the god and merytra fell down foaming in a fit  now abi went mad in the extremity of his fear  they are sorcerers he shouted who would bewitch me take them and keep them safe and let kaku be beaten with rods till he comes to his right mind again tomorrow when i have slain rames i will hang this magician at my masthead  but the queen only laughed and repeated after him  yes yes my good lord tomorrow when you have killed rames this magician shall hang at your masthead fear not whatever chances i will see that it is done    merytra recovered from her madness lay upon a bed when a woman entered and stood over her looking up she saw it was the queen  hearken to me said the queen in an icy voice and tell the words i speak to abi the time is accomplished and i leave him if he would look again upon netertua morning star of amen the great lady of egypt let him seek her in the camp of rames there he shall find her in the temple of amen which is set upon the mountain in the midst of the camp  then she was gone  merytra rose from the bed and called to the guards to lead her to abi so loudly did she call saying that she had a message for him which must not be delayed that at length one went and told him of her words and he came to her  what is it now sorceress he asked have you dreamed more illomened dreams  nay pharaoh she answered but the queen has fled to rames and word for word she repeated what had been told her  it is a lie said abi how can she have fled through a triple line of guards  search then and see o pharaoh  so abi searched but though none had seen her pass and none had gone with her the queen could not be found  it was midnight and while they still searched by the light of the moon a tall figure clad in tattered robes who bore a thornwood staff in his hand and had a white beard that fell down below his middle was perceived walking to and fro about the camp  who is that fellow asked abi and as he spoke the figure cried aloud in a great voice  listen councillors captains and soldiers of egypt to the command of amen spoken by the lips of his messenger kepher the wanderer lift no sword against rames lord of kesh for he is my servant and shall be pharaoh over you and husband of your queen and father of kings to come seize abi the usurper the murderer of pharaoh his brother and kaku the sorcerer and merytra the traitress and lead them at the dawn to my temple upon yonder hill where i will declare my commands to you in the sanctuary of the temple so shall peace be upon you and all egypt and the breath of life remain in your nostrils  now hearing these fearful words and remembering dead pharaohs prophecy of a beggar who should bring a message to him abi drew his sword and rushed at the man but ere ever he came there the wanderer was gone and lo they heard him repeating his message far away thither they ran also but now the words of doom were being called upon the ships and on their prows they saw his tall shape standfirst on this and then on that  it is the gods who speak cried the priests let us obey the gods and suddenly they flung themselves upon abi and bound him and kaku and merytra they bound also waiting for the dawn but of the tall whitebearded man in beggars robes they saw and heard no more    at that same time tua slept in a chamber of the temple upon the hill while asti watched her presently a wind blew in the chamber and asti looking up became aware of a shape that she knew well the very shape of tua who slept upon the bed  what is your will o double asked asti  my will is that you give me rest answered the ka my task is accomplished i am weary speak the secret words of power that you have and let me return to her from whom i came and in her bosom sleep till the great day of awakening  so asti knowing that she was commanded so to do uttered those secret words and as she spoke them the glorious shape seemed to grow faint and fade away only tua rose upon her bed stretched out her arms and sighed fell back again and slept heavily until the morning then she awoke asking what had befallen her for she was changed  this has befallen queen that which went forth from you by the command of amen has returned to you again its duty done rise up now and adorn yourself for this is your day of victory and marriage  as the sun rose tua went forth more beautiful than the morning and at the gates of the temple found rames awaiting her clad in his armour while from the mists below came a sound as of an army approaching  what passes asked tua looking at him and there was more love in her blue eyes than there is water in the nile at flood  i think that abi attacks us lady he said bowing the knee to her and i am fearful for you for our men are few and his are many  be not afraid of abi or of anything o rames though it is true that this day you must lose your liberty she answered with a sweet and gentle smile and he wondered at her words  then before he could speak again two of the captains of his outposts ran in and reported that without were priests and heralds who came in peace from the army of abi  summon the officers and let them be admitted said rames but be careful all of you lest this embassy should hide some trick of war come queen it is to you that they should speak and not to me who am but a general of your province kesh and he followed her to the inner court where in front of the sanctuary was a chair on which at his prayer she seated herself as a mighty queen should do  now conducted by his own officers the embassy entered bearing with them three closed litters and tua and rames noted that among that embassy were the greatest generals and the most holy priests of egypt at a given sign they prostrated themselves before the glory of the queen all save the soldiers who bore the litters next from among their ranks out stepped the venerable highpriest of amen at thebes and stood before tua with bowed head till with a motion of her hand she commanded him to speak  o morningstar of amen he began after you left our camp last night a messenger came to us from the father of the gods  stay o highpriest broke in tua i did not leave your camp who never tarried there and who for two long years have set no foot upon the holy soil of egypt no not since i fled from memphis to save myself from death or what is worsethe defilement of a forced marriage with abi my uncle and pharaohs murderer  now the highpriest turned and stared at those behind him and all who were present stared at the queen  pardon me he said but how can this thing be seeing that for those two years we have seen your majesty day by day living among us as the wife of abi  now tua looked at asti who stood at her side and the tall and noble asti looked at the highpriest saying  you know me do you not  aye lady he answered we know you you were the wife of mermes the last shoot of a royal tree and you are the mother of the lord rames yonder against whom we came out to make war we know you well o greatest of all the seers in egypt mistress of secret things but we believed that you had perished in the temple of sekhet at memphis that temple where pharaoh died now we understand that being a magician you only vanished thence  what bear you there asked asti glancing at the litters  bring forth the prisoners said the highpriest  then the curtains were drawn and the soldiers lifted from the litters abi kaku and merytra who were bound with cords and stood them on their feet before the queen  these are the very murderers of pharaoh my father who would have also brought me to shame why are my eyes affronted with the sight of them asked tua indignantly  because the messenger of the gods clothed as a beggarman commanded it your majesty answered the highpriest now we understand that they are brought hither to be judged for the murder of pharaoh the good god who was your father  shall a wife sit in judgment on her husband broke in abi  man said tua i never was your wife how can i have been your wife who have not seen you since the death of pharaoh listen now all of you to the tale of that marvel which has come to pass at my birthyou o highpriest should know it wellamen gave to me a ka a self within myself to protect me in all dangers the dangers came upon me and asti the magician my fostermother speaking the words that had been taught to her by the spirit of the divine ahura who bore me called forth that ka of mine and left it where i had been to be the wife of abi such a wife i think as never man had before but me amen my father rescued and with me asti bearing us in the boat of the sun to far lands and protecting us in many perils till at length we came to the city of napata where we found a certain servant of mine whom as it chances ilove and she looked at rames and smiled  meanwhile my shadow did the work to which it was appointed ruling for me in egypt and drawing on abi to his ruin but last night it returned to me and will be seen no more by men except perchance in my tomb after i am dead judge you if my tale be true and whether i am indeed netertua daughter of amen and opening the wrappings about her throat she showed the holy sign that was stamped above her breast adding  the highpriest yonder should know this mark for he saw it at my birth  now the aged man drew near looked and said  it is the sign here shines the star of amen and no other still we do not understand tell us the tale o asti  so asti stood forward and told that tale omitting nothing and then rames told his tale whereto tua the queen added a little and although ere they finished the sun was high none wearied in listening save only abi kaku and merytra who heard death in every word  it was done at length and a great silence fell upon the place for the tongues of men were tied presently the highpriest who all this while had stood with bent head lifted up his eyes to heaven crying  o amen father of the spirit of this queen show now thy will that we may learn it and obey  for a while there was silence till suddenly a sound was heard in the dark sanctuary where stood the statue of the god a sound as of a stick tapping upon the granite floor then the curtains of that sanctuary were drawn and standing between them there appeared the figure of an ancient bearded man with stony eyes who was clad in a beggars robe it was he who had met tua and asti in the wilderness and eaten up their food it was he who had saved them in the palace of the desert king it was he who but last night had walked the camp of abi  i am that messenger whom men from the beginning have called kepher he said i am the dweller in the wilderness whom your fathers knew and your sons shall know i am he who seeks for charity and pays it back in life and death i am the pen of thoth the recorder i am the scourge of osiris i am the voice of amen god above the gods hearken you people of egyptnot for a little end have these things come to pass but that ye may learn that there is design in heaven and justice upon earth and after justice judgment pharaoh the good servant of the gods was basely murdered by his own kin whom he trusted netertua his daughter and daughter of amen was condemned to shame rames of the royal race was sent forth to danger or to death far from her he loved and who loved him by that divine command which rules the hearts of men this is the command of the godslet these twain be wed and take egypt as their heritage and call down upon it peace and greatness but as for these murderers and wizardsand he pointed to abi to kaku and to merytralet them be placed in the sanctuary of amen to await what he shall send them  so spoke kepher the messenger and departed whence he came nor in that generation did any see him more  then they took up abi kaku and merytra and cut their bonds they threw them into the dark sanctuary before the great stone image of the god they shut the electrum doors upon them and left them there wailing and cursing while the highpriest of amen joined the hands of rames and of tua and declared them to be man and wife for ever  now after these things were done the pharaoh and his queen drove through the hosts of egypt in their golden chariot and received the homage of the hosts ere they departed northwards for thebes at nightfall they returned again and sat side by side at the marriage feast and once more tua swept her harp of ivory and gold and sang the ancient song of him who dared much for love and won the prize  so in the dim forgotten years their joy fell on rames and on tua morningstar of amen which still with them remains in the new immortal kingdom that they have won long and long ago    but when in the morning asti the wise dared to open the great doors and peer into the sanctuary of amen she saw a dreadful sight for there at the feet of the effigy of the god lay abi who slew his brother and kaku the sorcerer and merytra the traitress dead slain by their own or by each others hand and the stony eyes of the god stared down upon them
