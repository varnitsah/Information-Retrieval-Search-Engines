37709972	tom tiddlers ground   chapter ipicking up soot and cinders   and why tom tiddlers ground said the traveller  because he scatters halfpence to tramps and suchlike returned the landlord and of course they pick em up  and this being done on his own land which it is his own land you observe and were his familys before him why it is but regarding the halfpence as gold and silver and turning the ownership of the property a bit round your finger and there you have the name of the childrens game complete  and its appropriate too said the landlord with his favourite action of stooping a little to look across the table out of window at vacancy under the windowblind which was half drawn down  leastwise it has been so considered by many gentlemen which have partook of chops and tea in the present humble parlour  the traveller was partaking of chops and tea in the present humble parlour and the landlords shot was fired obliquely at him  and you call him a hermit said the traveller  they call him such returned the landlord evading personal responsibility he is in general so considered  what is a hermit asked the traveller  what is it repeated the landlord drawing his hand across his chin  yes what is it  the landlord stooped again to get a more comprehensive view of vacancy under the windowblind andwith an asphyxiated appearance on him as one unaccustomed to definitionmade no answer  ill tell you what i suppose it to be said the traveller  an abominably dirty thing  mr mopes is dirty it cannot be denied said the landlord  intolerably conceited  mr mopes is vain of the life he leads some do say replied the landlord as another concession  a slothful unsavoury nasty reversal of the laws of human mature said the traveller and for the sake of gods working world and its wholesomeness both moral and physical i would put the thing on the treadmill if i had my way wherever i found it whether on a pillar or in a hole whether on tom tiddlers ground or the pope of romes ground or a hindoo fakeers ground or any other ground  i dont know about putting mr mopes on the treadmill said the landlord shaking his head very seriously  there aint a doubt but what he has got landed property  how far may it be to this said tom tiddlers ground asked the traveller  put it at five mile returned the landlord  well  when i have done my breakfast said the traveller ill go there  i came over here this morning to find it out and see it  many does observed the landlord  the conversation passed in the midsummer weather of no remote year of grace down among the pleasant dales and troutstreams of a green english county  no matter what county  enough that you may hunt there shoot there fish there traverse long grassgrown roman roads there open ancient barrows there see many a square mile of richly cultivated land there and hold arcadian talk with a bold peasantry their countrys pride who will tell you if you want to know how pastoral housekeeping is done on nine shillings a week  mr traveller sat at his breakfast in the little sanded parlour of the peal of bells village alehouse with the dew and dust of an early walk upon his shoesan early walk by road and meadow and coppice that had sprinkled him bountifully with little blades of grass and scraps of new hay and with leaves both young and old and with other such fragrant tokens of the freshness and wealth of summer  the window through which the landlord had concentrated his gaze upon vacancy was shaded because the morning sun was hot and bright on the village street  the village street was like most other village streets wide for its height silent for its size and drowsy in the dullest degree  the quietest little dwellings with the largest of windowshutters to shut up nothing as carefully as if it were the mint or the bank of england had called in the doctors house so suddenly that his brass doorplate and three stories stood among them as conspicuous and different as the doctor himself in his broadcloth among the smockfrocks of his patients  the village residences seemed to have gone to law with a similar absence of consideration for a score of weak little lathandplaster cabins clung in confusion about the attorneys redbrick house which with glaring doorsteps and a most terrific scraper seemed to serve all manner of ejectments upon them  they were as various as labourershighshouldered wrynecked oneeyed goggleeyed squinting bowlegged knockkneed rheumatic crazy  some of the small tradesmens houses such as the crockeryshop and the harnessmaker had a cyclops window in the middle of the gable within an inch or two of its apex suggesting that some forlorn rural prentice must wriggle himself into that apartment horizontally when he retired to rest after the manner of the worm  so bountiful in its abundance was the surrounding country and so lean and scant the village that one might have thought the village had sown and planted everything it once possessed to convert the same into crops this would account for the bareness of the little shops the bareness of the few boards and trestles designed for market purposes in a corner of the street the bareness of the obsolete inn and inn yard with the ominous inscription excise office not yet faded out from the gateway as indicating the very last thing that poverty could get rid of  this would also account for the determined abandonment of the village by one stray dog fast lessening in the perspective where the white posts and the pond were and would explain his conduct on the hypothesis that he was going through the act of suicide to convert himself into manure and become a part proprietor in turnips or mangoldwurzel  mr traveller having finished his breakfast and paid his moderate score walked out to the threshold of the peal of bells and thence directed by the pointing finger of his host betook himself towards the ruined hermitage of mr mopes the hermit  for mr mopes by suffering everything about him to go to ruin and by dressing himself in a blanket and skewer and by steeping himself in soot and grease and other nastiness had acquired great renown in all that countrysidefar greater renown than he could ever have won for himself if his career had been that of any ordinary christian or decent hottentot  he had even blanketed and skewered and sooted and greased himself into the london papers  and it was curious to find as mr traveller found by stopping for a new direction at this farmhouse or at that cottage as he went along with how much accuracy the morbid mopes had counted on the weakness of his neighbours to embellish him  a mist of homebrewed marvel and romance surrounded mopes in which as in all fogs the real proportions of the real object were extravagantly heightened  he had murdered his beautiful beloved in a fit of jealousy and was doing penance he had made a vow under the influence of grief he had made a vow under the influence of a fatal accident he had made a vow under the influence of religion he had made a vow under the influence of drink he had made a vow under the influence of disappointment he had never made any vow but had got led into it by the possession of a mighty and most awful secret he was enormously rich he was stupendously charitable he was profoundly learned he saw spectres he knew and could do all kinds of wonders  some said he went out every night and was met by terrified wayfarers stalking along dark roads others said he never went out some knew his penance to be nearly expired others had positive information that his seclusion was not a penance at all and would never expire but with himself  even as to the easy facts of how old he was or how long he had held verminous occupation of his blanket and skewer no consistent information was to be got from those who must know if they would  he was represented as being all the ages between fiveandtwenty and sixty and as having been a hermit seven years twelve twenty thirtythough twenty on the whole appeared the favourite term  well well said mr traveller  at any rate let us see what a real live hermit looks like  so mr traveller went on and on and on until he came to tom tiddlers ground  it was a nook in a rustic byroad which the genius of mopes had laid waste as completely as if he had been born an emperor and a conqueror its centre object was a dwellinghouse sufficiently substantial all the windowglass of which had been long ago abolished by the surprising genius of mopes and all the windows of which were barred across with roughsplit logs of trees nailed over them on the outside  a rickyard hiphigh in vegetable rankness and ruin contained outbuildings from which the thatch had lightly fluttered away on all the winds of all the seasons of the year and from which the planks and beams had heavily dropped and rotted  the frosts and damps of winter and the heats of summer had warped what wreck remained so that not a post or a board retained the position it was meant to hold but everything was twisted from its purpose like its owner and degraded and debased  in this homestead of the sluggard behind the ruined hedge and sinking away among the ruined grass and the nettles were the last perishing fragments of certain ricks which had gradually mildewed and collapsed until they looked like mounds of rotten honeycomb or dirty sponge  tom tiddlers ground could even show its ruined water for there was a slimy pond into which a tree or two had fallenone soppy trunk and branches lay across it thenwhich in its accumulation of stagnant weed and in its black decomposition and in all its foulness and filth was almost comforting regarded as the only water that could have reflected the shameful place without seeming polluted by that low office  mr traveller looked all around him on tom tiddlers ground and his glance at last encountered a dusky tinker lying among the weeds and rank grass in the shade of the dwellinghouse  a rough walkingstaff lay on the ground by his side and his head rested on a small wallet  he met mr travellers eye without lifting up his head merely depressing his chin a little for he was lying on his back to get a better view of him  good day said mr traveller  same to you if you like it returned the tinker  dont you like it  its a very fine day  i aint partickler in weather returned the tinker with a yawn  mr traveller had walked up to where he lay and was looking down at him this is a curious place said mr traveller  ay i suppose so returned the tinker  tom tiddlers ground they call this  are you well acquainted with it  never saw it afore today said the tinker with another yawn and dont care if i never see it again  there was a man here just now told me what it was called  if you want to see tom himself you must go in at that gate  he faintly indicated with his chin a little mean ruin of a wooden gate at the side of the house  have you seen tom  no and i aint partickler to see him  i can see a dirty man anywhere  he does not live in the house then said mr traveller casting his eyes upon the house anew  the man said returned the tinker rather irritablyhim as was here just now this what youre a laying on mate is tom tiddlers ground and if you want to see tom he says you must go in at that gate  the man come out at that gate himself and he ought to know  certainly said mr traveller  though perhaps exclaimed the tinker so struck by the brightness of his own idea that it had the electric effect upon him of causing him to lift up his head an inch or so perhaps he was a liar  he told some rum unshim as was here just now did about this place of toms  he sayshim as was here just nowwhen tom shut up the house mate to go to rack the beds was left all made like as if somebody was agoing to sleep in every bed  and if you was to walk through the bedrooms now youd see the ragged mouldy bedclothes a heaving and a heaving like seas and a heaving and a heaving with what he says  why with the rats under em  i wish i had seen that man mr traveller remarked  youd have been welcome to see him instead of me seeing him growled the tinker for he was a longwinded one  not without a sense of injury in the remembrance the tinker gloomily closed his eyes  mr traveller deeming the tinker a shortwinded one from whom no further breath of information was to be derived betook himself to the gate  swung upon its rusty hinges it admitted him into a yard in which there was nothing to be seen but an outhouse attached to the ruined building with a barred window in it  as there were traces of many recent footsteps under this window and as it was a low window and unglazed mr traveller made bold to peep within the bars  and there to be sure he had a real live hermit before him and could judge how the real dead hermits used to look  he was lying on a bank of soot and cinders on the floor in front of a rusty fireplace  there was nothing else in the dark little kitchen or scullery or whatever his den had been originally used as but a table with a litter of old bottles on it  a rat made a clatter among these bottles jumped down and ran over the real live hermit on his way to his hole or the man in his hole would not have been so easily discernible tickled in the face by the rats tail the owner of tom tiddlers ground opened his eyes saw mr traveller started up and sprang to the window  humph thought mr traveller retiring a pace or two from the bars  a compound of newgate bedlam a debtors prison in the worst time a chimneysweep a mudlark and the noble savage  a nice old family the hermit family  hah  mr traveller thought this as he silently confronted the sooty object in the blanket and skewer in sober truth it wore nothing else with the matted hair and the staring eyes  further mr traveller thought as the eye surveyed him with a very obvious curiosity in ascertaining the effect they produced vanity vanity vanity  verily all is vanity  what is your name sir and where do you come from asked mr mopes the hermitwith an air of authority but in the ordinary human speech of one who has been to school  mr traveller answered the inquiries  did you come here sir to see me  i did  i heard of you and i came to see youi know you like to be seen  mr traveller coolly threw the last words in as a matter of course to forestall an affectation of resentment or objection that he saw rising beneath the grease and grime of the face  they had their effect  so said the hermit after a momentary silence unclasping the bars by which he had previously held and seating himself behind them on the ledge of the window with his bare legs and feet crouched up you know i like to be seen  mr traveller looked about him for something to sit on and observing a billet of wood in a corner brought it near the window  deliberately seating himself upon it he answered just so  each looked at the other and each appeared to take some pains to get the measure of the other  then you have come to ask me why i lead this life said the hermit frowning in a stormy manner  i never tell that to any human being  i will not be asked that  certainly you will not be asked that by me said mr traveller for i have not the slightest desire to know  you are an uncouth man said mr mopes the hermit  you are another said mr traveller  the hermit who was plainly in the habit of overawing his visitors with the novelty of his filth and his blanket and skewer glared at his present visitor in some discomfiture and surprise as if he had taken aim at him with a sure gun and his piece had missed fire  why do you come here at all he asked after a pause  upon my life said mr traveller i was made to ask myself that very question only a few minutes agoby a tinker too  as he glanced towards the gate in saying it the hermit glanced in that direction likewise  yes  he is lying on his back in the sunlight outside said mr traveller as if he had been asked concerning the man and he wont come in for he saysand really very reasonablywhat should i come in for i can see a dirty man anywhere  you are an insolent person  go away from my premises  go said the hermit in an imperious and angry tone  come come returned mr traveller quite undisturbed  this is a little too much  you are not going to call yourself clean  look at your legs  and as to these being your premisesthey are in far too disgraceful a condition to claim any privilege of ownership or anything else  the hermit bounced down from his windowledge and cast himself on his bed of soot and cinders  i am not going said mr traveller glancing in after him you wont get rid of me in that way  you had better come and talk  i wont talk said the hermit flouncing round to get his back towards the window  then i will said mr traveller  why should you take it ill that i have no curiosity to know why you live this highly absurd and highly indecent life  when i contemplate a man in a state of disease surely there is no moral obligation on me to be anxious to know how he took it  after a short silence the hermit bounced up again and came back to the barred window  what  you are not gone he said affecting to have supposed that he was  nor going mr traveller replied i design to pass this summer day here  how dare you come sir upon my promises the hermit was returning when his visitor interrupted him  really you know you must not talk about your premises  i cannot allow such a place as this to be dignified with the name of premises  how dare you said the hermit shaking his bars come in at my gate to taunt me with being in a diseased state  why lord bless my soul returned the other very composedly you have not the face to say that you are in a wholesome state  do allow me again to call your attention to your legs  scrape yourself anywherewith anythingand then tell me you are in a wholesome state  the fact is mr mopes that you are not only a nuisance  a nuisance repeated the hermit fiercely  what is a place in this obscene state of dilapidation but a nuisance what is a man in your obscene state of dilapidation but a nuisance  then as you very well know you cannot do without an audience and your audience is a nuisance  you attract all the disreputable vagabonds and prowlers within ten miles around by exhibiting yourself to them in that objectionable blanket and by throwing copper money among them and giving them drink out of those very dirty jars and bottles that i see in there their stomachs need be strong and in short said mr traveller summing up in a quietly and comfortably settled manner you are a nuisance and this kennel is a nuisance and the audience that you cannot possibly dispense with is a nuisance and the nuisance is not merely a local nuisance because it is a general nuisance to know that there can be such a nuisance left in civilisation so very long after its time  will you go away  i have a gun in here said the hermit  pooh  i have  now i put it to you  did i say you had not  and as to going away didnt i say i am not going away  you have made me forget where i was  i now remember that i was remarking on your conduct being a nuisance moreover it is in the last and lowest degree inconsequent foolishness and weakness  weakness echoed the hermit  weakness said mr traveller with his former comfortably settled final air  i weak you fool cried the hermit i who have held to my purpose and my diet and my only bed there all these years  the more the years the weaker you returned mr traveller  though the years are not so many as folks say and as you willingly take credit for  the crust upon your face is thick and dark mr mopes but i can see enough of you through it to see that you are still a young man  inconsequent foolishness is lunacy i suppose said the hermit  i suppose it is very like it answered mr traveller  do i converse like a lunatic  one of us two must have a strong presumption against him of being one whether or no  either the clean and decorously clad man or the dirty and indecorously clad man  i dont say which  why you selfsufficient bear said the hermit not a day passes but i am justified in my purpose by the conversations i hold here not a day passes but i am shown by everything i hear and see here how right and strong i am in holding my purpose  mr traveller lounging easily on his billet of wood took out a pocket pipe and began to fill it  now that a man he said appealing to the summer sky as he did so that a maneven behind bars in a blanket and skewershould tell me that he can see from day to day any orders or conditions of men women or children who can by any possibility teach him that it is anything but the miserablest drivelling for a human creature to quarrel with his social naturenot to go so far as to say to renounce his common human decency for that is an extreme case or who can teach him that he can in any wise separate himself from his kind and the habits of his kind without becoming a deteriorated spectacle calculated to give the devil and perhaps the monkeys pleasureis something wonderful  i repeat said mr traveller beginning to smoke the unreasoning hardihood of it is something wonderfuleven in a man with the dirt upon him an inch or two thickbehind barsin a blanket and skewer  the hermit looked at him irresolutely and retired to his soot and cinders and lay down and got up again and came to the bars and again looked at him irresolutely and finally said with sharpness i dont like tobacco  i dont like dirt rejoined mr traveller tobacco is an excellent disinfectant  we shall both be the better for my pipe  it is my intention to sit here through this summer day until that blessed summer sun sinks low in the west and to show you what a poor creature you are through the lips of every chance wayfarer who may come in at your gate  what do you mean inquired the hermit with a furious air  i mean that yonder is your gate and there are you and here am i i mean that i know it to be a moral impossibility that any person can stray in at that gate from any point of the compass with any sort of experience gained at first hand or derived from another that can confute me and justify you  you are an arrogant and boastful hero said the hermit  you think yourself profoundly wise  bah returned mr traveller quietly smoking  there is little wisdom in knowing that every man must be up and doing and that all mankind are made dependent on one another  you have companions outside said the hermit  i am not to be imposed upon by your assumed confidence in the people who may enter  a depraved distrust returned the visitor compassionately raising his eyebrows of course belongs to your state i cant help that  do you mean to tell me you have no confederates  i mean to tell you nothing but what i have told you  what i have told you is that it is a moral impossibility that any son or daughter of adam can stand on this ground that i put my foot on or on any ground that mortal treads and gainsay the healthy tenure on which we hold our existence  which is sneered the hermit according to you  which is returned the other according to eternal providence that we must arise and wash our faces and do our gregarious work and act and re act on one another leaving only the idiot and the palsied to sit blinking in the corner  come apostrophising the gate  open sesame show his eyes and grieve his heart  i dont care who comes for i know what must come of it  with that he faced round a little on his billet of wood towards the gate and mr mopes the hermit after two or three ridiculous bounces of indecision at his bed and back again submitted to what he could not help himself against and coiled himself on his windowledge holding to his bars and looking out rather anxiously     chapter vipicking up miss kimmeens 1   the day was by this time waning when the gate again opened and with the brilliant golden light that streamed from the declining sun and touched the very bars of the sooty creatures den there passed in a little child a little girl with beautiful bright hair  she wore a plain straw hat had a doorkey in her hand and tripped towards mr traveller as if she were pleased to see him and were going to repose some childish confidence in him when she caught sight of the figure behind the bars and started back in terror  dont be alarmed darling said mr traveller taking her by the hand  oh but i dont like it urged the shrinking child its dreadful  well  i dont like it either said mr traveller  who has put it there asked the little girl  does it bite  noonly barks  but cant you make up your mind to see it my dear for she was covering her eyes  o no no no returned the child  i cannot bear to look at it  mr traveller turned his head towards his friend in there as much as to ask him how he liked that instance of his success and then took the child out at the still open gate and stood talking to her for some half an hour in the mellow sunlight  at length he returned encouraging her as she held his arm with both her hands and laying his protecting hand upon her head and smoothing her pretty hair he addressed his friend behind the bars as follows        miss pupfords establishment for six young ladies of tender years is an establishment of a compact nature an establishment in miniature quite a pocket establishment  miss pupford miss pupfords assistant with the parisian accent miss pupfords cook and miss pupfords housemaid complete what miss pupford calls the educational and domestic staff of her lilliputian college  miss pupford is one of the most amiable of her sex it necessarily follows that she possesses a sweet temper and would own to the possession of a great deal of sentiment if she considered it quite reconcilable with her duty to parents  deeming it not in the bond miss pupford keeps it as far out of sight as she canwhich god bless her is not very far  miss pupfords assistant with the parisian accent may be regarded as in some sort an inspired lady for she never conversed with a parisian and was never out of englandexcept once in the pleasureboat lively in the foreign waters that ebb and flow two miles off margate at high water even under those geographically favourable circumstances for the acquisition of the french language in its utmost politeness and purity miss pupfords assistant did not fully profit by the opportunity for the pleasureboat lively so strongly asserted its title to its name on that occasion that she was reduced to the condition of lying in the bottom of the boat pickling in brineas if she were being salted down for the use of the navyundergoing at the same time great mental alarm corporeal distress and clearstarching derangement  when miss pupford and her assistant first foregathered is not known to men or pupils  but it was long ago  a belief would have established itself among pupils that the two once went to school together were it not for the difficulty and audacity of imagining miss pupford born without mittens and without a front and without a bit of gold wire among her front teeth and without little dabs of powder on her neat little face and nose  indeed whenever miss pupford gives a little lecture on the mythology of the misguided heathens always carefully excluding cupid from recognition and tells how minerva sprang perfectly equipped from the brain of jupiter she is half supposed to hint so i myself came into the world completely up in pinnock mangnall tables and the use of the globes  howbeit miss pupford and miss pupfords assistant are old old friends and it is thought by pupils that after pupils are gone to bed they even call one another by their christian names in the quiet little parlour for once upon a time on a thunderous afternoon when miss pupford fainted away without notice miss pupfords assistant never heard before or since to address her otherwise than as miss pupford ran to her crying out my dearest euphemia  and euphemia is miss pupfords christian name on the sampler date picked out hanging up in the college hall where the two peacocks terrified to death by some german text that is waddling downhill after them out of a cottage are scuttling away to hide their profiles in two immense beanstalks growing out of flowerpots  also there is a notion latent among pupils that miss pupford was once in love and that the beloved object still moves upon this ball  also that he is a public character and a personage of vast consequence  also that miss pupfords assistant knows all about it  for sometimes of an afternoon when miss pupford has been reading the paper through her little gold eyeglass it is necessary to read it on the spot as the boy calls for it with illconditioned punctuality in an hour she has become agitated and has said to her assistant g  then miss pupfords assistant has gone to miss pupford and miss pupford has pointed out with her eyeglass g in the paper and then miss pupfords assistant has read about g and has shown sympathy  so stimulated has the pupilmind been in its time to curiosity on the subject of g that once under temporary circumstances favourable to the bold sally one fearless pupil did actually obtain possession of the paper and range all over it in search of g who had been discovered therein by miss pupford not ten minutes before  but no g could be identified except one capital offender who had been executed in a state of great hardihood and it was not to be supposed that miss pupford could ever have loved him besides he couldnt be always being executed  besides he got into the paper again alive within a month  on the whole it is suspected by the pupilmind that g is a short chubby old gentleman with little black sealingwax boots up to his knees whom a sharply observant pupil miss linx when she once went to tunbridge wells with miss pupford for the holidays reported on her return privately and confidentially to have seen come capering up to miss pupford on the promenade and to have detected in the act of squeezing miss pupfords hand and to have heard pronounce the words cruel euphemia ever thineor something like that  miss linx hazarded a guess that he might be house of commons or money market or court circular or fashionable movements which would account for his getting into the paper so often  but it was fatally objected by the pupilmind that none of those notabilities could possibly be spelt with a g  there are other occasions closely watched and perfectly comprehended by the pupilmind when miss pupford imparts with mystery to her assistant that there is special excitement in the morning paper  these occasions are when miss pupford finds an old pupil coming out under the head of births or marriages  affectionate tears are invariably seen in miss pupfords meek little eyes when this is the case and the pupilmind perceiving that its order has distinguished itselfthough the fact is never mentioned by miss pupfordbecomes elevated and feels that it likewise is reserved for greatness  miss pupfords assistant with the parisian accent has a little more bone than miss pupford but is of the same trim orderly diminutive cast and from long contemplation admiration and imitation of miss pupford has grown like her  being entirely devoted to miss pupford and having a pretty talent for pencildrawing she once made a portrait of that lady which was so instantly identified and hailed by the pupils that it was done on stone at five shillings  surely the softest and milkiest stone that ever was quarried received that likeness of miss pupford  the lines of her placid little nose are so undecided in it that strangers to the work of art are observed to be exceedingly perplexed as to where the nose goes to and involuntarily feel their own noses in a disconcerted manner  miss pupford being represented in a state of dejection at an open window ruminating over a bowl of gold fish the pupilmind has settled that the bowl was presented by g and that he wreathed the bowl with flowers of soul and that miss pupford is depicted as waiting for him on a memorable occasion when he was behind his time  the approach of the last midsummer holidays had a particular interest for the pupilmind by reason of its knowing that miss pupford was bidden on the second day of those holidays to the nuptials of a former pupil  as it was impossible to conceal the factso extensive were the dressmaking preparationsmiss pupford openly announced it  but she held it due to parents to make the announcement with an air of gentle melancholy as if marriage were as indeed it exceptionally has been rather a calamity with an air of softened resignation and pity therefore miss pupford went on with her preparations and meanwhile no pupil ever went upstairs or came down without peeping in at the door of miss pupfords bedroom when miss pupford wasnt there and bringing back some surprising intelligence concerning the bonnet  the extensive preparations being completed on the day before the holidays an unanimous entreaty was preferred to miss pupford by the pupilmindfinding expression through miss pupfords assistantthat she would deign to appear in all her splendour  miss pupford consenting presented a lovely spectacle  and although the oldest pupil was barely thirteen every one of the six became in two minutes perfect in the shape cut colour price and quality of every article miss pupford wore  thus delightfully ushered in the holidays began  five of the six pupils kissed little kitty kimmeens twenty times over round total one hundred times for she was very popular and so went home  miss kitty kimmeens remained behind for her relations and friends were all in india far away  a selfhelpful steady little child is miss kitty kimmeens a dimpled child too and a loving  so the great marriageday came and miss pupford quite as much fluttered as any bride could be g thought miss kitty kimmeens went away splendid to behold in the carriage that was sent for her  but not miss pupford only went away for miss pupfords assistant went away with her on a dutiful visit to an aged unclethough surely the venerable gentleman couldnt live in the gallery of the church where the marriage was to be thought miss kitty kimmeensand yet miss pupfords assistant had let out that she was going there  where the cook was going didnt appear but she generally conveyed to miss kimmeens that she was bound rather against her will on a pilgrimage to perform some pious office that rendered new ribbons necessary to her best bonnet and also sandals to her shoes  so you see said the housemaid when they were all gone theres nobody left in the house but you and me miss kimmeens  nobody else said miss kitty kimmeens shaking her curls a little sadly  nobody  and you wouldnt like your bella to go too would you miss kimmeens said the housemaid  she being bella  nno answered little miss kimmeens  your poor bella is forced to stay with you whether she likes it or not aint she miss kimmeens  dont you like it inquired kitty  why youre such a darling miss that it would be unkind of your bella to make objections  yet my brotherinlaw has been took unexpected bad by this mornings post  and your poor bella is much attached to him letting alone her favourite sister miss kimmeens  is he very ill asked little kitty  your poor bella has her fears so miss kimmeens returned the housemaid with her apron at her eyes  it was but his inside it is true but it might mount and the doctor said that if it mounted he wouldnt answer  here the housemaid was so overcome that kitty administered the only comfort she had ready which was a kiss  if it hadnt been for disappointing cook dear miss kimmeens said the housemaid your bella would have asked her to stay with you  for cook is sweet company miss kimmeens much more so than your own poor bella  but you are very nice bella  your bella could wish to be so miss kimmeens returned the housemaid but she knows full well that it do not lay in her power this day  with which despondent conviction the housemaid drew a heavy sigh and shook her head and dropped it on one side  if it had been anyways right to disappoint cook she pursued in a contemplative and abstracted manner it might have been so easy done  i could have got to my brotherinlaws and had the best part of the day there and got back long before our ladies come home at night and neither the one nor the other of them need never have known it  not that miss pupford would at all object but that it might put her out being tenderhearted  howsever your own poor bella miss kimmeens said the housemaid rousing herself is forced to stay with you and youre a precious love if not a liberty  bella said little kitty after a short silence  call your own poor bella your bella dear the housemaid besought her  my bella then  bless your considerate heart said the housemaid  if you would not mind leaving me i should not mind being left  i am not afraid to stay in the house alone  and you need not be uneasy on my account for i would be very careful to do no harm  o  as to harm you more than sweetest if not a liberty exclaimed the housemaid in a rapture your bella could trust you anywhere being so steady and so answerable  the oldest head in this house me and cook says but for its bright hair is miss kimmeens  but no i will not leave you for you would think your bella unkind  but if you are my bella you must go returned the child  must i said the housemaid rising on the whole with alacrity  what must be must be miss kimmeens  your own poor bella acts according though unwilling  but go or stay your own poor bella loves you miss kimmeens  it was certainly go and not stay for within five minutes miss kimmeenss own poor bellaso much improved in point of spirits as to have grown almost sanguine on the subject of her brotherinlawwent her way in apparel that seemed to have been expressly prepared for some festive occasion  such are the changes of this fleeting world and so shortsighted are we poor mortals  when the house door closed with a bang and a shake it seemed to miss kimmeens to be a very heavy house door shutting her up in a wilderness of a house  but miss kimmeens being as before stated of a selfreliant and methodical character presently began to parcel out the long summerday before her  and first she thought she would go all over the house to make quite sure that nobody with a greatcoat on and a carvingknife in it had got under one of the beds or into one of the cupboards  not that she had ever before been troubled by the image of anybody armed with a greatcoat and a carvingknife but that it seemed to have been shaken into existence by the shake and the bang of the great streetdoor reverberating through the solitary house  so little miss kimmeens looked under the five empty beds of the five departed pupils and looked under her own bed and looked under miss pupfords bed and looked under miss pupfords assistants bed  and when she had done this and was making the tour of the cupboards the disagreeable thought came into her young head what a very alarming thing it would be to find somebody with a mask on like guy fawkes hiding bolt upright in a corner and pretending not to be alive however miss kimmeens having finished her inspection without making any such uncomfortable discovery sat down in her tidy little manner to needlework and began stitching away at a great rate  the silence all about her soon grew very oppressive and the more so because of the odd inconsistency that the more silent it was the more noises there were  the noise of her own needle and thread as she stitched was infinitely louder in her ears than the stitching of all the six pupils and of miss pupford and of miss pupfords assistant all stitching away at once on a highly emulative afternoon  then the schoolroom clock conducted itself in a way in which it had never conducted itself beforefell lame somehow and yet persisted in running on as hard and as loud as it could the consequence of which behaviour was that it staggered among the minutes in a state of the greatest confusion and knocked them about in all directions without appearing to get on with its regular work  perhaps this alarmed the stairs but be that as it might they began to creak in a most unusual manner and then the furniture began to crack and then poor little miss kimmeens not liking the furtive aspect of things in general began to sing as she stitched  but it was not her own voice that she heardit was somebody else making believe to be kitty and singing excessively flat without any heartso as that would never mend matters she left off again  byandby the stitching became so palpable a failure that miss kitty kimmeens folded her work neatly and put it away in its box and gave it up  then the question arose about reading  but no the book that was so delightful when there was somebody she loved for her eyes to fall on when they rose from the page had not more heart in it than her own singing now  the book went to its shelf as the needlework had gone to its box and since something must be donethought the child ill go put my room to rights  she shared her room with her dearest little friend among the other five pupils and why then should she now conceive a lurking dread of the little friends bedstead  but she did  there was a stealthy air about its innocent white curtains and there were even dark hints of a dead girl lying under the coverlet  the great want of human company the great need of a human face began now to express itself in the facility with which the furniture put on strange exaggerated resemblances to human looks  a chair with a menacing frown was horribly out of temper in a corner a most vicious chest of drawers snarled at her from between the windows  it was no relief to escape from those monsters to the looking glass for the reflection said what  is that you all alone there  how you stare  and the background was all a great void stare as well  the day dragged on dragging kitty with it very slowly by the hair of her head until it was time to eat  there were good provisions in the pantry but their right flavour and relish had evaporated with the five pupils and miss pupford and miss pupfords assistant and the cook and housemaid  where was the use of laying the cloth symmetrically for one small guest who had gone on ever since the morning growing smaller and smaller while the empty house had gone on swelling larger and larger the very grace came out wrong for who were we who were going to receive and be thankful  so miss kimmeens was not thankful and found herself taking her dinner in very slovenly stylegobbling it up in short rather after the manner of the lower animals not to particularise the pigs  but this was by no means the worst of the change wrought out in the naturally loving and cheery little creature as the solitary day wore on she began to brood and be suspicious  she discovered that she was full of wrongs and injuries  all the people she knew got tainted by her lonely thoughts and turned bad  it was all very well for papa a widower in india to send her home to be educated and to pay a handsome round sum every year for her to miss pupford and to write charming letters to his darling little daughter but what did he care for her being left by herself when he was as no doubt he always was enjoying himself in company from morning till night perhaps he only sent her here after all to get her out of the way  it looked like itlooked like it today that is for she had never dreamed of such a thing before  and this old pupil who was being married  it was unsupportably conceited and selfish in the old pupil to be married  she was very vain and very glad to show off but it was highly probable that she wasnt pretty and even if she were pretty which miss kimmeens now totally denied she had no business to be married and even if marriage were conceded she had no business to ask miss pupford to her wedding  as to miss pupford she was too old to go to any wedding  she ought to know that  she had much better attend to her business  she had thought she looked nice in the morning but she didnt look nice  she was a stupid old thing  g was another stupid old thing  miss pupfords assistant was another  they were all stupid old things together  more than that it began to be obvious that this was a plot  they had said to one another never mind kitty you get off and ill get off and well leave kitty to look after herself  who cares for her  to be sure they were right in that question for who did care for her a poor little lonely thing against whom they all planned and plotted  nobody nobody  here kitty sobbed  at all other times she was the pet of the whole house and loved her five companions in return with a childs tenderest and most ingenuous attachment but now the five companions put on ugly colours and appeared for the first time under a sullen cloud  there they were all at their homes that day being made much of being taken out being spoilt and made disagreeable and caring nothing for her  it was like their artful selfishness always to tell her when they came back under pretence of confidence and friendship all those details about where they had been and what they had done and seen and how often they had said o  if we had only darling little kitty here  here indeed  i dare say  when they came back after the holidays they were used to being received by kitty and to saying that coming to kitty was like coming to another home  very well then why did they go away  if the meant it why did they go away  let them answer that  but they didnt mean it and couldnt answer that and they didnt tell the truth and people who didnt tell the truth were hateful  when they came back next time they should be received in a new manner they should be avoided and shunned  and there the while she sat all alone revolving how ill she was used and how much better she was than the people who were not alone the wedding breakfast was going on no question of it  with a nasty great bridecake and with those ridiculous orangeflowers and with that conceited bride and that hideous bridegroom and those heartless bridesmaids and miss pupford stuck up at the table  they thought they were enjoying themselves but it would come home to them one day to have thought so  they would all be dead in a few years let them enjoy themselves ever so much  it was a religious comfort to know that  it was such a comfort to know it that little miss kitty kimmeens suddenly sprang from the chair in which she had been musing in a corner and cried out o those envious thoughts are not mine o this wicked creature isnt me  help me somebody  i go wrong alone by my weak self  help me anybody        miss kimmeens is not a professed philosopher sir said mr traveller presenting her at the barred window and smoothing her shining hair but i apprehend there was some tincture of philosophy in her words and in the prompt action with which she followed them  that action was to emerge from her unnatural solitude and look abroad for wholesome sympathy to bestow and to receive  her footsteps strayed to this gate bringing her here by chance as an apposite contrast to you the child came out sir  if you have the wisdom to learn from a child but i doubt it for that requires more wisdom than one in your condition would seem to possess you cannot do better than imitate the child and come out toofrom that very demoralising hutch of yours     chapter viipicking up the tinker   it was now sunset  the hermit had betaken himself to his bed of cinders half an hour ago and lying on it in his blanket and skewer with his back to the window took not the smallest heed of the appeal addressed to him  all that had been said for the last two hours had been said to a tinkling accompaniment performed by the tinker who had got to work upon some villagers pot or kettle and was working briskly outside  this music still continuing seemed to put it into mr travellers mind to have another word or two with the tinker  so holding miss kimmeens with whom he was now on the most friendly terms by the hand he went out at the gate to where the tinker was seated at his work on the patch of grass on the opposite side of the road with his wallet of tools open before him and his little fire smoking  i am glad to see you employed said mr traveller  i am glad to be employed returned the tinker looking up as he put the finishing touches to his job  but why are you glad  i thought you were a lazy fellow when i saw you this morning  i was only disgusted said the tinker  do you mean with the fine weather  with the fine weather repeated the tinker staring  you told me you were not particular as to weather and i thought  ha ha  how should such as me get on if we was particular as to weather  we must take it as it comes and make the best of it  theres something good in all weathers  if it dont happen to be good for my work today its good for some other mans today and will come round to me tomorrow  we must all live  pray shake hands said mr traveller  take care sir was the tinkers caution as he reached up his hand in surprise the black comes off  i am glad of it said mr traveller  i have been for several hours among other black that does not come off  you are speaking of tom in there  yes  well now said the tinker blowing the dust off his job which was finished  aint it enough to disgust a pig if he could give his mind to it  if he could give his mind to it returned the other smiling the probability is that he wouldnt be a pig  there you clench the nail returned the tinker  then whats to be said for tom  truly very little  truly nothing you mean sir said the tinker as he put away his tools  a better answer and i freely acknowledge my meaning  i infer that he was the cause of your disgust  why lookee here sir said the tinker rising to his feet and wiping his face on the corner of his black apron energetically i leave you to judgei ask youlast night i has a job that needs to be done in the night and i works all night  well theres nothing in that  but this morning i comes along this road here looking for a sunny and soft spot to sleep in and i sees this desolation and ruination  ive lived myself in desolation and ruination i knows many a fellowcreetur thats forced to live life long in desolation and ruination and i sits me down and takes pity on it as i casts my eyes about  then comes up the longwinded one as i told you of from that gate and spins himself out like a silkworm concerning the donkey if my donkey at home will excuse me as has made it allmade it of his own choice  and tells me if you please of his likewise choosing to go ragged and naked and grimymaskerading mountebanking in what is the real hard lot of thousands and thousands  why then i say its a unbearable and nonsensical piece of inconsistency and im disgusted  im ashamed and disgusted  i wish you would come and look at him said mr traveller clapping the tinker on the shoulder  not i sir he rejoined  i aint a going to flatter him up by looking at him  but he is asleep  are you sure he is asleep asked the tinker with an unwilling air as he shouldered his wallet  sure  then ill look at him for a quarter of a minute said the tinker since you so much wish it but not a moment longer  they all three went back across the road and through the barred window by the dying glow of the sunset coming in at the gatewhich the child held open for its admissionhe could be pretty clearly discerned lying on his bed  you see him asked mr traveller  yes returned the tinker and hes worse than i thought him  mr traveller then whispered in few words what he had done since morning and asked the tinker what he thought of that  i think returned the tinker as he turned from the window that youve wasted a day on him  i think so too though not i hope upon myself  do you happen to be going anywhere near the peal of bells  thats my direct way sir said the tinker  i invite you to supper there  and as i learn from this young lady that she goes some threequarters of a mile in the same direction we will drop her on the road and we will spare time to keep her company at her garden gate until her own bella comes home  so mr traveller and the child and the tinker went along very amicably in the sweetscented evening and the moral with which the tinker dismissed the subject was that he said in his trade that metal that rotted for want of use had better be left to rot and couldnt rot too soon considering how much true metal rotted from overuse and hard service     footnotes   1  dickens didnt write chapters 2 to 5 and they are omitted in this edition
