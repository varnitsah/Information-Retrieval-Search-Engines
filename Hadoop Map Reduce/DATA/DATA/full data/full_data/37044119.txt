was snowing slowly and persistently as it had done all day when henry alton of somasco ranch stood struggling with a halftamed cayuse pony in a british columbian settlement  the cayuse had laid its ears back and was describing a circle round him scattering mud and snow while the man who gripped the bridle in a lean brown hand watched it without impatience admiringly  game he said  i like them that way  still it isnt every man could seize a pack on him and youll have to let up three dollars on the price you asked me  now three dollars is a considerable proportion of the value of an indian pony fresh from the northern grass lands with the devil that lurks in most of his race still unsubdued within him but the rancher who owned him did not immediately reject the offer  possibly he was not especially anxious to keep the beast  oh yes said a bystander  hes game enough and id ask the boys to my funeral if i meant to drive him at night over the lake trail after being most kicked into woodpulp carter hasnt any more use for him and ill lay you a dollar alton you and your partner cant put the pack on him  perhaps the cayuse was tired or desirous of watching for an opportunity for it came to a standstill snorting with its wicked eyes upon the man who laughed a little and shoved back the broad hat from his forehead as he straightened himself  the laugh rang pleasantly and the faint twinkle in altons eyes was in keeping with it  they were grey and steady when the light sank out of them and the rest of the bronzed face was shrewd and quietly masterful  he wore a deerskin jacket fancifully embroidered blue canvas overalls and gum boots to the knee while though all of them needed repair the attire was picturesque and showed its wearers lean symmetry  the mans age was apparently twentyfive and eight years use of the axe had set a stamp of springy suppleness upon him  he had also wrested rather more than a livelihood from the canadian forest during them  all round him the loghouses rose in all their unadorned dinginess beneath the sombre pines and the largest of them bore a straggling legend announcing that it was hortons store and hotel  a mixed company of bush ranchers free prospectors axemen and miners lounged outside it in picturesque disarray and high above rose a dim white line of nevermelting snow  well said alton its time this circus was over anyway and if carter will take my bid ill clinch that deal with you  have the pack and seizings handy charley  the rancher nodded and alton got a tighter grip on the bridle  then the cayuse rose upright with forehoofs lifted and the mans arm was drawn back to strike  the hoofs came down harmlessly but the fist got home and for a moment or two there was a swaying and plunging of man and beast amidst the hurledup snow  then the cayuse was borne backwards until the vicinity of the hotel verandah left no room for kicking and another man hastily flung a rope round the bundles he piled upon its back  he was also tolerably capable and in another minute the struggle was over  the cayuses attitude expressed indignant astonishment while alton stood up breathless with his knuckles bleeding  ill trouble you for that dollar and ill keep him now he said can you wait until i come down next week carter  oh yes said the rancher  your promise is good enough for a year or two  the speaker was a sinewy bushman in curiously patched overalls with a bronzed and honest face and he turned aside with a little gesture of dislike when a man of a very different stamp pushed by him  the latter wore a black felt hat and a great furlined coat while his face was pale and fleshy and his eyes were cunning  his appearance suggested prosperity and a life of indulgence in the cities and when he stopped in front of alton the latter would have lost little by any comparison between the pair  the pose of his sinewy figure and the clear brownness of his skin spoke of arduous labour sound sleep and the vigour that comes from a healthful occupation  the steady directness of his gaze and quiet immobility of his face also conveyed an indefinite suggestion of power and endurance and there was a curious grace in his movements when he turned courteously towards the stranger  you soon fixed him packer said the city man  alton laughed  the boys mostly call me rancher said he  still it dont count for much and i do some packing occasionally  thats all right said the stranger sharply for there was something in altons answer which made him inclined to assert his dignity everybody seems to be a rancher hereaway and you maynt be too proud to put through a job for me  alton nodded and glanced at the speaker questioningly  no  if it would fit in he said  im hallam said the other man  hallam and vose of the tyee mineral claim  theyve been fooling things up yonder big pumps given out and ive a few hundred pounds of engine fixings back at the railroad i want brought in by tomorrow  alton glanced at the packbeasts waiting unloaded outside the store and shook his head  im sorry i cant trade with you he said  you see ive promised another man to pack up some stores for him  hallam made a gesture of impatience  then you can let him wait he said  this deal will pay you better  you can put your own price on it  altons eyelids came down a little and the stranger seemed to find his glance disconcerting  you dont seem to understand  i promised the other man to bring up his things he said  well said hallam come along into the shanty yonder and have a drink with me  we may fix up some way of getting over the difficulty  sorry said alton with a suspicious quietness  i dont drink much anyway and then only with the boys who know me  hey said hallam  you are talking like a condemned englishman  i cant help that said alton  i am a canadian but if you want another reason it wouldnt suit me to drink with you anyway  you see you didnt do the square thing with one or two friends of mine who worked on the tyee  he turned on his heel and hallam who was a man of some importance in the cities gasped with astonishment and indignation  what is that fellow he said  the man laughed and answered him in the bushmans slowest drawl  you dont know much or you wouldnt ask said he  hes alton of somasco but if he lives long enough he will be one of the biggest men in this country  hallam said nothing but there was a curious look in his face which puzzled the rancher  it suggested that he had heard of alton and something more  meanwhile alton entered the store where the man who kept it pointed to a litter of packages strewn about the floor and sundry bags upon the counter  thats townsheads lot and those are thomsons things he said and turned aside to listen to a rancher who came in smiling  alton took up a big cotton bag marked townshead tossed it aloft and caught it and then shook his head dubiously  thats rather too light for ten pounds  you want to try her on the scales again he said  the storekeeper who was also a magistrate grinned goodhumouredly its good enough for the money anyway said he  but whats the matter with the tyee dollars harry that you wouldnt do hallams packing  alton glanced at him gravely  i think not said he  put another pound or two into her and ill pay you on your invoice for the last lot you sent me  otherwise im going to whittle down that bill considerably  you see townshead is too shaky to come down and he cant live on nothing  and the lord knows when hell pay you said the storekeeper  its a good twelve months since he sent a dollar to me  alton laughed a little  i can wait he said  fill that bag up again  get hold of the truck charley  charles seaforth who was apparently younger and certainly a trifle more fastidious about his attire than his comrade shouldered a flour bag and twenty minutes later he and alton tramped out of the settlement with three loaded beasts splashing and floundering in front of them  it was almost dark now though a line of snow still glimmered white and cold high up beyond the trees until the trail plunged into the blackness of the forest  then the lights of the settlement were blotted out behind them the hum of voices ceased and they were alone in the primeval silence of the bush  the thud and splash of tired hoofs only served to emphasize it the thin jingle of steel or creak of packrope was swallowed up and lost for the great dim forest seemed to mock at anything man could do to disturb its pristine serenity  it had shrouded all that valley where no biting gale ever blew from the beginning majestic in its solitary grandeur and eternally green  pine and hemlock balsam and cedar had followed in due succession others that had grown to the fulness of their stature only in centuries and their healing essence which brings sound sleep to mans jaded body and tranquillity to his mind had doubtless risen like incense when all was made very good  now alton loved the wilderness partly because he had been born in it and because he had a large share of the spirit of his race  he had also seen the cities and they did not greatly please him though he had watched their inhabitants curiously and been taught a good deal about them by what he read in books which to the wonder of his associates he would spend hardlyearned dollars upon  it was more curious that he understood all he read and sometimes more than the writer apparently did for alton was not only the son of a clever man but had seen nature in her primitive nakedness and the human passions that usually lie beneath the surface for man reverts a little and the veneer of his civilization wears through in the silent bush  thus he plodded on contentedly on his twelvemile march with the snow and the mire beneath it reaching now and then to his knee until his companion stopped beside a little bark shanty and lighted a lantern  thomsons dumpingplace already he said pulling a burst cotton bag out of the sack of sundries upon the cayuse ponys back  some of it has got out and jimmy was always particular about the weight of his sugar  well the rest of it must be in the bottom somewhere and if youll hold the sack up ill shake it into my hat  altons hat was capacious and he had worn it during the two years which had elapsed since his last visit to vancouver but it did not seem to occur to him that it was in any way an unusual receptacle for sugar  his companion however laughed a little as he stirred the sticky mass round with his wet fingers  there is no use giving him our tobacco and matches in said he here are the letters mrs neilson gave me at the postoffice too  alton took the letters and his face grew a trifle grim under the flickering light of the lantern as he thrust them crumpled into his pocket  from england and they will keep he said  theres nobody im anxious to hear from in that country  now well go on again charley  the cayuse however objected and there was a struggle before alton convinced it that resistance would be useless while presently the trail grew steeper and the roar of water came out of the darkness before them  this said alton gravely is a great country but its mighty unfinished yet and it kind of hurts me to see all that power wasted  wasted said seaforth smiling  dont the salmon swim in it and the bear and deer come down to drink  oh yes said alton  and sometimes the siwash wash themselves in it too but thats not the question  this earth wasnt made for the bear and deer and theyve thousands of poor folks they cant find a use for back there in the old country  isnt that so charley  seaforth who was a young englishman of good upbringing laughed  i have no reason for doubting it said he  in any case none of my worthy relations had any use for me  still i dont see the connection exactly  no said alton  well its simple  we have the gold and silver and the coal and iron too while it dont strike one that these forests were put here just to look pretty  the metals you allude to take some trouble in getting out said seaforth dryly  alton nodded  of course he said  thats what man got his brains for and the one difference between a white man and a siwash is that hes always striking for something better  seaforth laughed  you are trying to get at something as usual said he  yes said alton gravely  i generally am  well i can see what we dont want of these forests sailing sawn up to china and this river sprinkled with sawmills and woodpulp factories  then i can hear the big dynamoes humming and the thump of the mine stamps run with the current the men who put them down will get for nothing  what were wasting round somasco is going to feed ten thousand people by and by  its a big idea said seaforth reflectively  still i dont know that if it were ever put through the place would look any prettierand the question is whos going to set the whole thing running  god knows said alton gravely  but somebody will and if i live long enough ill make a shot at it  oh yes its very pretty as it is but the greatest thing in this world is man and it was made as it is for him to master  you have curious notions for a canadian bush rancher said seaforth you are however really an englishman arent you  no said alton grimly  my father used to be but he was too much of my way of thinking and they fired him out of the country  its a thing i dont like to talk of charley and just now im a lowdown packer hauling in a pile of truck ill never get paid for  steady come up theres nothing going to hurt you julius caesar  the snarling and spitting of a panther came out of the darkness and it was only by main force alton dragged the cayuse past  then he laughed a little  its a pity we didnt bring a rifle along he said panthers must have been made for something or they wouldnt be here but its a beast a white man has no kind of use for  it was an hour later and snowing fast when they climbed out of the valley and floundered over shale and slippery rock amidst scattered pines to the forking of the trail  one arm of it dipped again and wound through a deep sheltered hollow to the somasco ranch the other ran straight along the hillside to townsheads dwelling  the hillside was also steep the beasts were tired and the trail was very bad seaforth glanced at his comrade when they stopped a moment and saw him dimly tugging at the cayuses bridle through the snow  its a long way to townsheads  still i think we can make it out he said  alton laughed  we have got to  theres not generally too much to eat at that house and theyll want the things he said  there was another struggle with the cayuse which appeared reluctant to face a treacherous ascent whose slope was somewhat steeper than the pitch of an average roof but once more alton conquered and they dragged the beasts up and then floundered on doggedly beside them seeing nothing but a dim pine or two through the snow  now and then there was a rattle and a rush beneath them followed by a faint splash and seaforth shivered a little knowing that the shingle they dislodged had plunged into a lonely lake lying far below  still alton said nothing but floundered on apparently as cheerfully as though he would be well paid for the risk he ran until he crawled down into the sliding whiteness when a hide strip burst and some of townsheads packages were scattered about the face of a precipitous declivity  seaforth held his breath a moment as gripping the bridle of a trembling beast he watched him until the dim moving figure sank into the snow  he could hear the wash of the unfrozen lake and knew there was no foothold on the slippery rock which sloped almost sheer to it through the darkness close beneath  then a voice came up wasnt there a dry goods package of some kind charley  there was shouted seaforth  but come up with what youve got and leave it  a faint laugh answered him and through the moaning of the pines he caught the words if its not over the edge here im going to get the thing  seaforth said nothing further  he knew his comrade too well and could picture him clinging by hand and heel as he crawled along the brink of the declivity with the lake below and gasped from relief when once more a dim whitened object lurched up out of the snow  got them all said alton cheerfully  that last one was just on the edge and it took some thinking before i could get at it  still i guessed it was some kind of dress stuff for the girl and if we lost it it might be a long while before she got another  they relashed the packages and went on again floundering through steadily deepening snow until once more the roar of water met them as they dipped into a hollow  it grew louder rapidly and presently alton pulled the cayuse up on the brink of a river  it came down frothing out of a haze of sliding snow tumbling with a hoarse growl about the great dim boulders whirled and tossed in a white confusion down the wild race of a rapid and was lost again  how far the other bank was there was nothing to show for even the scattered pines behind the men were hidden now and seaforth stared at the tumult of froth before him very dubiously  shes pretty full tonight he said  it has got to be attempted but im not quite sure how were going through  alton laughed a little and brought his hand down on the cayuse ponys flank  well if youll come along behind me you will see said he  seaforth was waistdeep next minute and the water was horribly cold then he was washed against a boulder and fancied that one of the packbeasts kicked him in its floundering  in any case one knee seemed to grow suddenly useless but he was not very sure of anything just then for a burst of spray filled his eyes and the bottom appeared to slip from under him  he found foothold again in a moment or two and dimly saw altons head and shoulders above the back of a plunging beast while another was apparently swimming somewhere between them then the one seaforth led stumbled and they went away down stream together clawing for a foothold with the shingle slipping under them until there was a thud as they brought up against another boulder  as he was not sensible of any especially painful blow seaforth decided that it was the pony which had struck the rock and had just come to this decision when his feet were swept from under him and still clinging to the bridle he was pressed against the stone while the river frothed and roared about him  once more he felt that it was horribly cold and flung a wet arm about the rock but the power seemed to go out of him and he wondered vacantly whether the pony would be able to extricate itself and him it floundered spasmodically for a while and then lay still  how long this continued seaforth did not know but it was more than twelve hours since he had left somasco and he had plodded up and down steep hillsides over rock and boulder and through deep mire and snow most of the time while there are limits to the domination the will of any man may exercise over his wornout body  seaforth had commenced to realize still with a curious absence of concern which was possibly the result of cold and fatigue that as the pony could not help him it might be too late very soon unless he made a vigorous effort to help himself when he heard a shout and something came slowly through the sliding whiteness in his direction  then there was another shout and when somebody dragged the pony clear of the boulder he held on by the bridle and went floundering waistdeep up stream  the water however now sank rapidly and soon he was clear of it to the knee  then there was a clatter of hoofs on slippery rock and he lurched dripping and gasping into the partial shelter of the pines  somebody smote him on the shoulder and he heard altons voice get hold and hustle  well fetch townsheads in an hour or so     chapter ii  at townsheads ranch  it was chilly and damp in the logwalled livingroom of the townshead homestead which stood far up in a lonely valley amidst the scattered pines  the room was also bare and somewhat comfortless for the land was too poor to furnish its possessor with more than necessities and townshead not the man to improve it much  he lay in an old leather chair beside the stove a slender greyhaired man with the worn look of one whose burden had been too heavy for him  his face was thin and somewhat haggard his long slender hand rather that of an artist than a bush rancher and his threadbare attire was curiously neat  he wore among other somewhat unusual things an old red velvet jacket and there was a little cup of black coffee and a single cigar of exceptional quality on the table beside him  townshead was in fact somewhat of an anachronism in a country whose inhabitants exhibit at least a trace of primitive and wholesome barbarity  one could have fancied him at home among men of leisure and cultivated tastes but he seemed out of place in a logbuilt ranch in the snowwrapped wilderness swept by the bitter wind  perhaps he realized it for his voice was querulous as he said i wonder if you have forgotten nellie that we were sitting warm and safe in england five years ago tonight  nellie townshead looked up quickly over her sewing from the other side of the stove and for a moment there was something akin to pain in her eyes  they were clear brown eyes and it was characteristic that they almost immediately brightened into a smile for while the girls face resembled her fathers in its refinement there was courage in it in place of weariness  i am afraid i do though i try not to and am generally able she said  townshead sighed  the young are fortunate for they can forget he said  even that small compensation is however denied to me while the man i called my friend is living in luxury on what was yours and mine  had it been any one but charters i might have borne it better but it was the one man i had faith in who sent us out here to penury  townshead was wrong in one respect for it was the weakness of an oversensitive temperament which while friends were ready to help him had driven him to hide himself in western canada when as the result of unwise speculations financial disaster overtook him  his daughter however did not remind him of this as some daughters would have done though she understood it well enough and a memory out of keeping with the patter of the snow and moaning of the wind rose up before her as she looked into the twinkling stove  she could recall that night five years ago very well for she had spent most of it amidst lights and music as fresh and bright herself as the flowers that nestled against her first ball dress  it was a night of triumph and revelation in which she had first felt the full power of her beauty and her sex and she had returned with the glamour of it all upon her to find her father sitting with his head in his hands at a table littered with business papers  his face had frightened her and it had never wholly lost the look she saw upon it then for townshead was lacking in fibre and had found that a fondness for horses and some experience of amateur cattlebreeding on a small and expensive scale was a very poor preparation for the grim reality of ranching in western canada  presently his daughter brushed the memories from her and stood smiling at the man straight and willowy in her faded cotton dress with a partly finished garment in her hands which frost and sun had not wholly turned rough and red  your coffee will be getting cold  shall i put it on the stove she said  townshead made a little grimace  one may as well describe things correctly and that is chickory he said  still you may warm it if it pleases you but i might point out that indifferent as it is preserved milk which has gone musty does not improve its flavour  the girl laughed a little though there was something more pathetic than heartsome in her merriment  i am afraid we shall have none tomorrow unless mr seaforth gets through she said  i suppose you have not a few dollars you could give me father  no said townshead with somewhat unusual decisiveness i have not you are always asking for dollars  what do you want them for  mr seaforth has packed our stores in for a long while and we have paid him nothing said the girl while a little colour crept into her face  townshead made a gesture of weariness  the young man seems willing to do it out of friendship for us and i see no reason why we should not allow him unless he presumes upon the trifling service he said  to do him justice however he and his comrade have always shown commendable taste  the girl smiled a little for considering their relative positions in a country where a man takes his station according to his usefulness the word presume appeared incongruous  still i should prefer not to be in their debt she said  then we will free ourselves of the obligation with the next remittance jack sends in said townshead impatiently  the girls face grew troubled  i am afraid that will not be for some little time she said  poor jack  you surely remember he is lying ill  it is especially inconvenient just now said townshead querulously it has also been a sore point with me that a son of mine should hire himself out as a labourer  i am sorry i let him go the more so because the work upon the ranch is getting too much for me  nellie townshead said nothing though she sighed as she pictured the young lad who had been stricken by rheumatic fever as a result of toiling waistdeep in icy water lying uncared for in the mining camp amidst the snows of caribou  she did not however remind her father that it was she who had in the meanwhile done most of the indispensable work upon the ranch and townshead would not in any case have believed her for he had a fine capacity for deceiving himself  in place of it she spread out some masculine garments about the stove and coloured a trifle when her father glanced at her inquiringly  the creek must be running high and mr alton and his partner will be very wet she said  i am warming a few of jacks old things for them they cannot go back to somasco tonight you know  i confess that it did not occur to me said townshead languidly no i suppose one could scarcely expect them to and we shall have to endure their company  a faint sparkle that had nothing to do with laughter crept into the girls eyes for there were times when her father tried her patience i wonder if it occurred to you that we shall probably starve tomorrow unless mr alton who is apparently not to be paid for it makes what must be a very arduous march tonight she said  im afraid it did not said townshead with a fine unconcern  i think you understand my dear that i leave the commissariat to you and you have a way of putting things which jars upon one occasionally  a little trace of colour crept into the girls cheek but it faded again as she sat down beside the stove  still now and then she pricked her fingers with the needle which she had not done before and finally laid down the fabric and laughed softly  there is she said something distinctly humorous in the whole position  you said her father had always a somewhat peculiar sense of humour  well said his daughter with a slight quiver of her lips i feel that i must either cry or laugh tonight  do you know there is scarcely enough for breakfast in the house and that i am dreadfully hungry now  townshead glanced at her reproachfully  either one or the other would be equally distasteful to me he said  the girl sighed and turned away to thrust a few small billets into the stove  she chose them carefully for the big box whose ugliness she had hidden by a strip of cheap printed cotton was almost empty  the hired man seeing no prospect of receiving his wages had departed after a stormy interview and shortly after his son followed him townshead discovered that sawing wood was especially unsuited to his constitution  then the girl increased the draught a little and endeavoured to repress a shiver  the house was damp for want of proper packing and the cold wind that came down from the high peaks moaned about it eerily  it was also very lonely and the girl who was young felt a great longing for human fellowship  her father presently took up a book and there was silence only broken by the rattle of loose shingles overhead and the soft thud against the windows of driving snow while the girl sat dreaming over her sewing of the brighter days in faroff england which had slipped away from her for ever  five years was not a very long time but during it her english friends had forgotten her and one who had scarcely left her side that memorable night had though she read of the doings of his regiment now and then sent her no word or token  a little flush crept into her cheek as remembering certain words of his she glanced at her reddened wrists and little toilhardened hands  she who had been a highspirited girl with the world at her feet then was now one of the obscure toilers whose work was never done  still because it was only on rare occasions that work left her leisure to think about herself it had not occurred to her that she had lost but little by the change the hands that had once been soft and white were now firm and brown the stillness of the great firs and cedars had given her a calm tranquillity in place of restless haste and frost and sun the clear warmtinted complexion while a look of strength and patience had replaced the laughter in her hazel eyes  suddenly however there was a trampling in the snow and a sound of voices followed after an interval by a knocking at the door  it swung open and two whitened objects loaded with bags and packages strode into the room  the blast that came in with them set the lamp flickering and sent a chill through the girl but she rose with a smile when rancher alton stood a shapeless figure with the moisture on his bronzed face beside the stove  take those things through into the kitchen charley he said  i think weve got them all miss townshead  i hope sir you are feeling pretty well  townshead made some answer with a slight bend of his head but alton appeared a trifle dubious when the girl offered him hospitality  im afraid the beasts are used up or i wouldnt think of it he said  nellie townsheads eyes twinkled as she glanced at him  could you not have put it in another way she said  alton laughed and brushed his fingers across the top of the stove well it doesnt sound quite right but after all the meanings the great thing he said  this place isnt warm enough for you miss nellie  he turned and walked to the woodbox and after glancing into it carefully straightened out its covering  then he strode towards the door and stopped a moment before he opened it  excuse he said simply  no dont you worry i know just where the saw and lantern are and charley who comes from the old country can talk to you for me  he went out in another moment but the fact that he was very weary did not escape the attention of the girl who also noticed the absence of any unnecessary questions or explanations  alton was she knew already one who did things the better because he did them silently still it was seaforth whom when nobody observed her her eyes rested most upon  it was half an hour before the former returned with a load of scented firewood upon his back and saying nothing filled the box with it packing each piece where it best fitted deliberately but swiftly then he passed through the room into an adjoining one and returned attired picturesquely in jack townsheads overalls which were distinctly too small for him  by this time supper was ready and seaforth also dressed in borrowed garments seated at the table but though miss townshead had not lost the stamp of refinement she brought with her from england  and her father was dignified and precise alton showed no embarrassment  he also listened patiently to townsheads views on ranching and the mining prospects of that region though he was already looked up to as a master of the former industry and contrived meanwhile that the girl made a good meal instead of attending to him when it was finished he unfolded a carefully wrapped up packet and took an envelope out of it though miss townshead noticed that several others he laid down were crumpled and wet  here is a letter for you he said  he glanced at the girl questioningly as she took it up and fingered one of the envelopes upon the table  excuse he said  nellie townshead smiled and nodded and then knowing that the communication handed her was of no importance watched him covertly as he tore open a long blue envelope  there were documents inside it and the mans fingers shook a little as he spread out one of them  then bewildered astonishment crept into his eyes and was replaced by a flash of something very like anger after which his face grew suddenly impassive and he thrust the documents all together into his pocket  get up charley and bring the tray along he said  miss townshead glanced at him sharply  what do you wish to do she said  wash up said alton simply  i dont know how you fix these things in england but this is a good canadian custom  stir around charley  but said the girl you dont know where the things are  well said alton smiling i figure i can find them  he laid the cups and dishes on the tray gave it to seaforth and disappeared down a passage carrying the kettle but not before miss townshead had noticed that while his comrade who had apparently been used to the smoother side of life in england displayed some awkwardness everything the big rancher did seemed appropriate and because removing plates is not a mans task she wondered at it  they came back presently and by that time the girl who had opened some of the packages held a roll of fabric upon her knee  if you can find a splash anywhere ill forfeit a dollar  charleys good at mopping up said alton gravely  im afraid that stuffs a little wet but it was the cayuses fault  he started in kicking and burst the rope you see  it would have been wetter if it had gone into the lake said seaforth  the lake said the girl  seaforth nodded  yes he said  it was on the tyee trail the pony commenced kicking  the girl looked up sharply and there was a subdued brightness in her eyes for she had more than once shivered when leading her horse along that perilous trail  alton felt for his comrades leg under the table and kicked it grievously  there wasnt any trouble and the snow was soft said he  youre going to make a dress of that stuff miss nellie  yes said the girl  i could however wish the stuff was better  alton smiled gravely  of course he said  still it dont count for much  you would look like a picture in anything  nellie townshead glanced at him sharply and for a moment there was a faint sparkle in her eyes for she had a trace of temper  whatever made you say that said she  alton laughed  i really dont quite know  i just felt i had to he said with a naive simplicity  i wouldnt have done it if i had thought it would vex you  after this he listened while his comrade talkedand seaforth on occasion could talk gracefullyuntil at last he said englands not so very big miss nellie  i wonder if you know a place called carnaby  yes said the girl  i once went to see rather a fine old hall there  carnaby grange said alton quietly  yes said the girl with a trace of curiosity  we spent some little time in the grounds  they lie deep in the woods and there is a famous rose garden  yes said alton  all kinds of roses  and the old place  tell me about it  is very picturesque said the girl  it looked quiet and grey and almost stately under its ivy that autumn day but i could scarcely describe it you  you have nothing like it in canada  no said alton gravely  i have seen nothing like it in canada  but wasnt there a lake  the girl glanced at him curiously  there was she said  i remember it lay shining before us between the woods  it was very beautiful quieter and calmer than our lakes in canada  a slight flush crept through the bronze in altons face which grew a trifle grim and a light into his eyes  there is a lake at somasco where you can see the white peaks lie shining and the big wapiti come down to drink he said  there are cedars and redwoods about it which except for a few in california havent their equal in the world but theres nothing about that lake or valley thats quiet or calm  its wild and great and grand  no  theyve nothing of that kind in the old country  are not abana and pharfar better than all the waters of israel  apposite said townshead  you apparently read the scriptures  sometimes said alton simply  they get hold of me  those old fellows went right down to the bed rock of human nature back there in palestine and it strikes me theres no great difference in that between now and then  when said townshead smiling i was a king in babylon  no said alton reflectively  youre a little late on time  the christian slave dont quite fit in  townshead glanced at him sharply and said nothing for the rancher had once or twice already somewhat astonished him  well said alton tell me miss nellie were the lilies where the ashes hung over the lake  i want to know all about carnaby  the girl seemed somewhat thoughtful and a trifle astonished but she made the best use of her memory and alton listened gravely  yes he said  i seem to see it  the rose garden on the south side the big lawn and the lake  theres a little stream on the opposite side of it that comes down through the fern from the big beech wood  but said the girl how could you know that  i think i must have dreamt it said alton gravely  or perhaps my father told me  he used to talk of carnaby and i feel i know it well  the girl stared at him in her wonder  but what is carnaby to you she said  alton rose up and stood still a moment somewhat grim in face  it should have been my fathers and now when i dont know that i want it i think its mine he said  anyway im kind of tired and i think ill turn in  excuse me  he went out and nellie townshead glanced at his comrade  do you know what he means she said  seaforth smiled and shook his head  ive never seen harry taken that way before he said  still well hope hell be better tomorrow he has been through a good deal today  miss townshead did not appear contented but she changed the topic then what did you mean when you spoke about the dress packet  ill tell you said seaforth if you dont tell harry  well when the packet slipped down to the edge of the big drop im not sure that the price of two ranches would have induced most men to follow it  but why did mr alton go said the girl with an expression which was not quite the one the man had expected to see in her face  seaforth smiled  he may have fancied you wanted it  anyway harry is a little obstinate occasionally and when a thing looks difficult he cant resist attempting it  in the language of my adopted country thats the kind of man he is  now i think i had better go after him because i fancy he wants soothing after that last speech of his     chapter iii  harry the teamster  the sun was on the hill slopes and there was a dazzling glare of snow when miss alice deringham stood with her travelling dress fluttering about her on the platform of the observation car as the pacific express went thundering down a valley of british columbia  the dress which was somewhat dusty had cost her father a good deal of money and the hat that was sprinkled with cinders had come from paris while the artistic simplicity of both had excited the envy of the two winnipeg ladies who having failed to make friends with miss deringham during the journey now sat watching her disapprovingly in a corner of the car  the girl was of a type as yet not common in western canada reserved quietly imperious and annoyingly free from any manifestation of enthusiasm  she had also listened languidly to their most racy stories with a somewhat tired look in her eyes  they were however fine eyes of a violet blue and gold hair with a warmer tinge in it clustered about the broad white forehead while the rest of the girls face was refined in its modelling if a trifle cold in expression and colouring  miss deringham was also tall and as she stood with one little hand on the rail and the other on the brim of the hat the wind would have torn away from her her pose displayed a daintilyproportioned figure  the girl was however as oblivious of her companions as she was of the dust and her eyes were at last keen with wonder  she had seen nothing which resembled the panorama that unrolled itself before her as the great mountain locomotives sped on through the primeval wilderness and the wild beauty of it left a deeper mark on her because her canadian journey had been more or less a disappointment  alice deringham had tasted of the best that england had to offer in the shape of sport and scenery art and music and had grown a little tired of it all while when her father had announced his intention of crossing the canadian dominion partly on an affair of business and partly for the benefit of his health she had gladly accompanied him in the hope of seeing something new  deringham was a promoter and director of english companies but his daughter having the fine disdain for anything connected with finance which occasionally characterizes those who have never felt the lack of money asked him a few questions concerning one object of his journey  she only knew that the carnaby estate which would in the usual course have reverted to her had been unexpectedly willed to the son of a man its late owner had disinherited on conditions  the man it appeared was dead and deringham desired to see whether any understanding or compromise could be arrived at with the one son he had left behind in western canada  to become the mistress of carnaby hall would have pleased alice deringham but as she had already realized there was no great hope of that she had prepared to enjoy her canadian journey  it had however fallen short of her expectations  ontario reminded her of southern scotland and there was nothing to impress one who had seen the highlands when the cars ran into the confusion of rock and forest lake and river along the superior shore  winnipeg in no way appealed to her and she grew weary as they swept out past straggling wooden towns into the grass lands of the west  the towns rose stark from the prairie in unsoftened ugliness and there was nothing to stir the imagination in the great waste of sunbleached grass  day by day while the dust whirled by them and the gaunt telegraph posts came up out of the far horizon and sank into the east they raced across the wide levels  the red dawns burned behind them the sunsets flamed ahead and still there was only dust and grass chequered here and there with bands of stubble while driving grit and ugliness were the salient features of the little stations they stopped at  miss deringham had read enough to learn that pistol and bandolier had long gone out of fashion in western canada where indeed they had rarely formed a necessary portion of the plainsmans attire but she had expected a little vivid colour and dash of romance  the stockriders she saw at the station were however for the most part dress in faded jean and many of them appeared to speak excellent english while the wheatgrowers rode soberly in dusty and dilapidated wagons  still the romance was there though in place of the swashbuckling cavalier she found only quiet slowlyspoken men with patience most plainly stamped upon their sundarkened faces  their hands were hard with the grip of the bridle and ploughstilt in place of the rifle and the struggle they waged was a slow and grim one against frost and drought and adverse seasons  there was however a transformation when she awoke one morning and found the rockies had been left behind and they were roaring down through the passes of british columbia  this was a new and apparently unfinished world a land of tremendous mountains leagues of forests such as her imagination had never pictured and untrodden heights of nevermelting snow  glacier blue lake river droning through shadowy canons rushed by and the glamour of it crept into the heart of the girl until as they swept down into the valley with a river two thousand feet below she felt she was at last in touch with something strange and new  presently the hoot of the whistle came ringing up the pass wheels screamed discordantly and the pines below flitted towards them a trifle more slowly  then as they swung rocking round the face of a crag and a cluster of wooden buildings rose to view deringham came out upon the platform  he was a tall slightlybuilt man with a pallid face and keen but slightly shifty eyes and bore the unmistakable stamp of the englishman  that must be our alightingplace and i am not sure how we are to get on he said  it is i understand a long way to somasco and when we get there i really do not know whether we shall find any accommodation suitable for you  it might have been better if you had gone on to our friends the fords at vancouver  alice deringham laughed a little  i dont think you need worry  mr alton will no doubt take us in she said  a little primitive barbarity would not be unpleasant as a novelty  a trace of something very like anger crept into deringhams eyes  it was not very perceptible for he seldom showed much of what he felt but his daughter noticed it  it is somewhat unfortunate that we shall probably have to avail ourselves of the young mans hospitality he said  you understand my dear that he is a kinsman of your own and unless he can be persuaded to relinquish his claim the owner of carnaby  still i have hopes of coming to terms with him  the charges upon the land are very burdensome  alice deringhams face grew a trifle scornful  you will do your best she said  the thought of one of these halfcivilized axemen living at carnaby is almost distressful to me  in fact i feel a curious dislike to the man even before i have seen him  there was another hoot of the whistle a little station grew larger down the track and here and there a wooden house peeped out amidst the slowlyflitting trees  then the cars stopped with a jerk and miss deringham stepped down from the platform  her first glance showed her long ranks of climbing pines with a great white peak silhouetted hard and sharp above them against the blue  then she became conscious of the silver mist streaming ethereally athwart the sombre verdure from the river hollow and that a new and pungent smell cut through the odours of dust and creosote which reeked along the track  it came from a cord of cedarwood piled up close by and she found it curiously refreshing  the drowsy roar of the river mingled with the panting of the locomotive pump but there was a singular absence of life and movement in the station until the door of the baggagecar slid open and her father sprang aside as her trunks were shot out on to the platform  a bag or two of something followed them the great engines panted and the dusty cars went on again while it dawned upon alice deringham that her last hold upon civilization had gone and she was left to her own resources in a new and somewhat barbarous land  there were no obsequious porters to collect her baggage which lay where it had alighted with one trunk gaping open while a couple of men in blue shirts and soilstained jeans leaned upon the neighbouring fence watching her with mild curiosity  her father addressed another one somewhat differently attired who stood in the door of the office  there is a hotel here but they couldnt take you in said the man party of timberright prospectors came along and theyre kind of frolicsome  they might find you a berth on the verandah but i dont know that it would suit the lady  it mixes things up considerable when you bring a woman  deringham glanced at his daughter and the girl laughed  then is there any means of getting on to cedar valley she said  the man slowly shook his head  you might walk but its close on forty miles he said  stage goes out on saturday  deringham made a gesture of resignation  i never walked forty miles at once in my life he said  can you suggest anything at all  we cannot well live here on the platform until saturday  no said the man gravely  i dont figure i could let you  well now i wonder if harry could find room for you  he shouted and a man who was carrying a flourbag turned his head and then went on again until he hove his load into a twohorse wagon while miss deringham noticed that although the bag was stamped 140 lbs the man trotted lightly across the metals and ballast with it upon his shoulders  then he came in their direction and she glanced at him with some curiosity as he stood a trifle breathless before them  he wore a blue shirt burst open at the neck which showed his full red throat and somewhat ragged overalls  the brown hair beneath his broad felt hat was whitened with flour and his bronzed face was red with the dust  still he stood very straight and it was a good face with broad forehead and long straight nose while the effect of the solid jaw was mitigated by something in the shape of the mobile lips  the grey eyes were keen and steady until a sympathetic twinkle crept into them and miss deringham felt that the man understood her position  well he said  whats the difficulty  the station agent explained laconically and the stranger gravely took off his battered hat  my wagons pretty full but i can take you through he said  it would be a favour said deringham taking out a roll of bills  i should of course be glad to recompense you for your trouble  for a moment the mans eyes closed a trifle then he laughed and miss deringham noticed that there was nothing dissonant in his merriment well he said lightly there will be plenty time to talk of that these are your things miss  the girl nodded and wondered when heaving up the biggest trunk as though it weighed nothing at all he laid it carefully in the wagon because she remembered having to fee two hotel porters lavishly for handling it in liverpool  he stopped however and glanced at the second one with a faint trace of embarrassment  it had burst open and several folds of filmy fabric projected  my hands are floury  you might be able to shut it up he said  miss deringham stooped over the box that he might not see her face  it was merely the skirt of an evening dress which had displayed itself but she had guessed what the man was thinking and remembering his excuse was not displeased with him  when the box was in the wagon she took out a dollar and then for no special reason put it back again the man was a bush teamster but she did not feel equal to offering him a piece of silver  she swung herself up into the wagon with her foot in his hand and wondered whether it could be by intent that he stood bareheaded while she did it  then her father climbed in and the man at the station laughed as he said whats the odds harry you dont spill the whole freight on the dip to the ford  the teamster who made no answer shook the reins and they went lurching over a horrible trail down the valley while miss deringham delightedly breathed in the scent of the cedars and felt the lash of snowchilled wind bring the blood to her face  she however wished that the bundle of straw which served as seat would not move about so much and fancied her father would have been more comfortable had he not been menaced by a jolting piece of machinery  their progress was rudely interrupted presently for the teamster standing upright reined the horses in on their haunches and the girl saw a line of loaded ponies straggling up the winding trail  one of the men who plodded behind them glanced at the driver of the wagon with an ironical grin and miss deringham saw a warmer colour creep into the sundarkened cheek  this was she fancied a man with a temper  now he said and then stopped suddenly  the other mans grin became more pronounced  you can start in he said  were not bashful  the teamster said nothing but a faint twinkle replaced the anger in his eye when as they started again miss deringham glanced at him questioningly  that he said wasnt quite fair to me  they knew i couldnt talk back you see  miss deringham laughed and when an hour or two later he pulled the horses up beside a lake and made one or two alterations to enhance her comfort glanced at him again  did you come out here from england said she  the mans face grew a trifle grim  no he said gravely  whatever could have made you think that of me  there were reasons why the girl could not explain and the man stretched out an arm with a little proud gesture that became him curiously  i am a canadian first and last said he  isnt this country good enough for anybody  miss deringham was forced to admit that it apparently was  a blue lake gleaming steely blue in the sunlight stretched away before them between the towering firs and beyond it lay an entrancing vision of great white peaks  you do not like england then said she  the teamster smiled a little  that he said is not a fair question to ask me  you and your father live there dont you  miss deringham felt that she had trespassed but was astonished that this teamster should have wit enough to silence her with a compliment she also decided that he should not have the opportunity again  they went on winding along steep hillsides splashing through sparkling rivers and lurching through the dim shadow of the bush until when the saffron sunset flamed along the peaks they came to the head of a long declivity  on the one hand the snow towered in awful white purity on the other scattered firs sloped sharply down into a hollow until they were lost in the fleecy vapours that streamed athwart them  sit tight said the teamster  its eight miles to hobarts ranch and theres no time to lose if were going to get in there tonight  he shook the reins and the girl clutched the side of the wagon as she felt the lash of the wind and noticed how the firs rushed past  it was jolting horribly and she was relieved when as the trail grew steeper she saw the man tightening his grip on the reins and heard the grating of the brake  it ceased suddenly one of the horses stumbled then flung up its head and they were going down faster than ever while the man had flung his shoulders back and was dragging at the reins  it dawned upon miss deringham that something had gone wrong and the team were running away  there was now only white mist beneath them and the roar of water trees came whirling up out of it rock and bush swept past while now and then the wheels hung almost over the edge of the declivity and the girl could look down upon the sombre firs in the haze below  after one glance however she felt that it would not be well for her to do so suddenly one of the horses stumbled again and the teamster flung her father the reins  get hold he said  lines in the tracehook  he was over the front of the wagon next moment and the girl gasped as she saw him crawl out with an arm across the back of one of the galloping horses and his knees on the pole  it looked horribly dangerous and probably was for the wagon was lurching furiously down the declivity  then he leaned out and downwards over the horse clawing at something desperately and miss deringham would have shut her eyes if she could have done so  in place of it she stared fascinated at the clinging figure while the trees flashed past until it was evident that the man had accomplished his task  how he got back she did not know but he was once more on the drivingseat when his voice reached her breathlessly  get a good hold  im going to put them at the hill when i can he said  they swept on until the hillside sloped more gently on the one hand and the teamster flung himself backwards dragging at the reins  the wagon tilting swung partly round then there was a horrible lurching and the lathered beasts were floundering up a slope smashing down the undergrowth and fern until the vehicle stopped suddenly with a crash the man sprang down and miss deringham and her father lost no time in following him while when at last the team stood still trembling he crawled out from under the wagon and turned to them  that brake never was much good he said  one of the beasts stumbling jerked the line into the hook there and the forewheel beam gave out when we struck the tree  im most afraid well have to stop right here tonight  but that as you will realize is quite impossible said deringham glancing towards his daughter  the man nodded  it looks that way now but you wait until ive fixed things up said he  then if you feel like walking eight miles ill go on with you  the girl noticed the swift orderliness of all he did as she watched him take out the horses and tether them tear down armfuls of cedartwigs and then pack them between some flourbags and the side of the wagon over which he stretched a strip of waterproof sheeting  then he made a fire disappeared into the mist and coming back with the kettle strode into the bush again  in the meanwhile deringham looking into the wagon pointed to the twigs  do you think you could sleep there he said  the girl glanced at the twigs  they looked soft and springy and had a pleasant aromatic fragrance while the covering sheet was thick  i know i could not walk eight miles she said  where has our accomplished companion gone to  deringham laughed  to look for something for supper in the bush i believe he said  i also fancy if there is anything eatable in the vicinity he will find it  the snows above had lost their brilliancy and it was dark below when the teamster returned with several fine trout which he skewered upon a barberry stem  he also brought a deerhide bag from the wagon and presently announced that supper was ready while alice deringham who long afterwards remembered that meal enjoyed it considerably more than she would have believed herself capable of doing a few days earlier she had travelled far in search of something new and this was the first time she had tasted the biting green tea with the reek of the smoke about it from a blackened pannikin  grindstone bread baked in a hole in the ground was also a novelty and the crumbling flakes of salmon smoked by some siwash indian a delicacy while she wondered if it was only the keen mountain air which made the flesh of the big trout so good or whether it owed anything to skilful cookery  there was also by way of background the glow of the fire flickering athwart the great columnar trunks which ran up into the dimness above her and the cold glimmer of the snows with a pale star beyond them when the red flame sank while the hoarse roar of an unseen river emphasized the silence  at first she felt there was something unreal and theatrical about it all  the light that blazed up and died awful serenity of the snow and the vast impenetrable shadows filled with profound silence seemed all part of a fervidlyimagined spectacle but as the silence deepened and gained upon her the position was reversed and she seemed to feel that this was the reality the environment man was created for and she wrapped in the tinsel of civilization out of place in the primeval wilderness  her father immaculate as ever in his travelling tweeds with his lean pallid face also jarred upon the picture and harry the teamster bronzed by frost and sun with the stain of the soil upon him alone a part of its harmonies  they seemed no longer harsh and barbaric but vast and subtle and she felt she must go back to the simplicity she had laid aside before she could grasp their meaning  it was the man who first broke the silence  i was wondering if you would like a cigar sir he said  deringham glanced at the indianwrought case which was singularly artistic somewhat dubiously but remembering that something was due to their host drew a cigar out and lighted it  he said nothing for a minute and then turned to the teamster  wherever did you get cigars of that kind from  they are far better than any i could find in winnipeg he said  miss deringham noticed the mans eyes close a trifle and fancied that very little would call the steely sparkle she had seen when the packponies blocked the trail into them  well he said quietly a friend of mine sent them me and i believe they came from cuba  we dont raise cigars of any kind in british columbia  miss deringham saw her fathers face and felt quietly amused  he could she knew assume a manner which went far to carry him smoothly through discontented shareholders meetings but it seemed that the men who dwelt in the wilderness were at least as exigent as those who dwelt in london  deringham however glanced at the speaker  the least said is often the soonest mended but if you think he said  the teamster laughed  it should come from me but the fact is i was worrying about that wagon and forgot he said  now if there is anything i can tell you about this country  i wonder said alice deringham whether you know mr alton of somasco  oh yes said the man with a little smile  you have worked for him possibly said the girl  harry the teamster nodded  considerably harder than i ever did for anybody else he said  the next question required some consideration and he appeared to ruminate over it  you mean what kind of man he is he said  well hes not very much to look at and there are a good many things he dont know  so i should have fancied said the girl more to herself than the listener and wondered whether it was an effect of the firelight or the curious twinkle had once more flashed into his eyes  you do not seem to like him she said  the man looked into the fire  the trouble is i know how mean he is he said  mean said the girl  that is niggardly  no said harry i dont think hes niggardly  its another word for low down in this country  you see he has always had to work hard for a living and never had time to teach himself the nice little ways you folks have in england  hes just a big rough rancher who has fought pretty toughly for his own hand and thats apt to take the gentleness out of a man and make him what you would call coarse and brutal  the girl seemed to shiver  is there nothing to say on the other side she said  well said the teamster reflectively i think he means well and never took more than his right from any man while there are people who would as soon have his word as its value in dollar bills  you seem to know him suspiciously well said miss deringham sharply  i do said harry simply as he stood up  anyway as well as most people  you know where i fixed your bed up sir when you want to turn in  theres nothing in this bush miss that would hurt you  he stepped back into the shadows and the camp seemed lonely without him while as the girl shivered in the cold wind deringham glanced at her curiously  well he said  then the red crept into his daughters cheeks and a sparkle into her eyes  it will take a very long time to get used to  i could almost hate the man she said  it is hard to lose ones inheritance said deringham dryly  the flush grew a trifle plainer in his daughters cheek  it is not the value of the land she said  but think of such a man a brutal cattledriving boor ruling at carnaby where my mother lived  still said deringham the value is not inconsiderable and carnaby would have been yours some day  the girl made a gesture of impatience  that is not my complaint she said  i could have let it pass without bitterness to an englishman who would have lived in it in accordance with the traditions of his race but this man  will no doubt cut down the timber open the fireclay pits and desecrate the park with brickworks he said  that is unless he has convivial proclivities and finding himself ostracized fills carnaby with turf and billiardroom blacklegs  the girl ground her heel viciously into the mould  have you any reason for going into these details she said  deringham watched her closely  i only wished you to understand the position and to remember that you and i are both to some extent at the mercy of our rancher kinsman he said  he left her presently to seek the couch the teamster had prepared for him and miss deringham retired to the wagon  she found the bed of cedartwigs comfortable but it was some time before she slept and dreamed that a stranger dressed in coarse blue jean was holding high revel in the carnaby she loved  she was awakened by the howl of a wolf and lay still shivering until she saw the tall dusky figure of the canadian approach the fire and stand there as if on guard with the red light upon him  then with a curious sense of security she went to sleep again     chapter iv  hallam of the tyee  the morning was still and warm when the driver of the wagon pulled up his team where four trails met in the shadow of the bush  miss deringham had somewhat to her astonishment passed the night very comfortably and enjoyed the breakfast their companion provided  the bracing cold of sunrise when all the bush was steeped in fragrance and a wonderful freshness came down from the snow had also brought her a curious exhilaration as well as a tinge of colour into her cheeks and now she was sensible of a faint regret and irritation when the man glanced towards her deprecatingly  it would please me to drive you straight through to the settlement but theres a load of things i want at calhouns up yonder he said  he pointed to a trail that turned off sharply and the girl glanced at her father somewhat blankly  and what are we to do said she  well said the man you can wait here until barscombe comes along hell be riding in to the settlement presently and would be glad to take you for a dollar or two  but we might have to wait a long time said the girl with a trace of imperiousness  it would suit us considerably better to go on with you  sorry said the man gravely  i cant take you  calhouns a busy man and hell be waiting up at the ranch for me  i told him i was coming  there was now no doubt about the colour in miss deringhams face  few of her wishes bad been denied her hitherto and most of the men she had met had been eager to do her bidding while the scarcely qualified refusal of this one came as a painful astonishment  the fact that she should be left in the lonely forest to avoid keeping some rude rancher waiting was distinctly exasperating  deringham however smiled a little as he took a wallet from his pocket  i can understand it because i am also a busy man when im at home he said  it is a question of the value of your time and mr calhouns apparently  though he possibly did not realize it deringhams tone was a trifling condescending and there was something in it which suggested that he believed anything could be bought with money  he was however a little astonished when the man regarded him gravely out of eyes that closed a trifle  thats just where youre wrong said he  if i could have taken you on to save the lady waiting it would have pleased me  as it is i cant you see  he said nothing more but dismounting pulled the boxes out of the wagon and laid some travelling wraps upon one of them while miss deringham affected not to see what he was doing  and how long will it be before barscombe passes said she  it cant be more than two hours said the teamster quietly  all you have to do is to sit there and wait for him  he took off his broad hat when the others alighted and miss deringham noticed there was a trace of courtliness in his simplicity  then he strode past her father who was taking something out of his wallet and swung himself lightly into the wagon  he spoke to the team there was a creak and rattle and next moment the vehicle was lurching down the trail  deringham stood still a moment his fingers inside the wallet and mild wonder in his eyes and then smiled a little as his daughter turned towards him  there was a faint pink flush of anger in her cheeks  the dollar does not appear to retain its usual influence in this part of canada he said dryly  possibly however the man was too embarrassed by your evident displeasure to remember his hire  miss deringham saw the twinkle in her fathers eyes and laughed a little  i dont think he was she said  had that been the case one could have forgiven him more easily  well i wonder how long barscombe will keep us waiting  deringham made a whimsical gesture of resignation  in the meantime i notice that our late conductor has arranged a comfortable seat for you he said  the girl sat down and looked about her  it was very still in the bush and the sound of running water drifted musically out of the silence  from somewhere in the distance there also came a curious drumming which she did not know then was made by an axe but it presently ceased and the song of the river rose alone in long drowsy pulsations  in front of and behind her stretched the rows of serried trunks which had grown to vastness of girth and stateliness with the centuries and the girl who was of quick perceptions felt instinctively the influence of their age and silence  there was it seemed something intangible but existent in this still land of shadow which reacted upon her pleasantly after the artificial gaieties and glitter of surface civilization  her impatience and irritation seemed to melt and the time slipped by until she was almost drowsy when with an increasing rattle another wagon came jolting down the trail  its driver pulled up and regarded them with placid astonishment but he was amenable to the influence of deringhams wallet and they took their places in the vehicle  there was nothing remarkable about the man and he ruminated gravely when as they stopped to let the horses drink deringham asked him a question concerning their late companion  it might have been thomson he said  a big man kind of solid and homely  no said miss deringham reflectively  i should scarcely describe him as homely  well said the other if you told me the kind of wagon i might guess at him  deringham described the vehicle as well as he was able and the stranger nodded  thats jimmy thomsons outfit all right said he what did he charge you  miss dillingham laughed  it is curious that he charged us nothing said she  well said the stranger gravely that was blame unlike jimmy theres only one man in this country would do that kind of thing and as he hasnt a wagon to fit what youre telling me it couldnt he him  miss deringham had purposed asking who the man in question was but the driver started his team just then and an hour later drove them into the sleepy settlement and carried their boxes into hortons hotel  he gravely invited deringham to drink with him and appearing mildly astonished went about his business when the latter declined  deringham smiled at his daughter  there are as one might expect men of somewhat different type in this country but i prefer the first one said he  miss deringham also fancied that she did so though she did not admit it and that evening was made acquainted with yet another and more different one  horton as usual served supper at six oclock and all his guests were expected to partake of reasty pork potatoes flapjacks green tea and fruits at the same table  to this he made no exception and would not have done so for the premier and when a small company of axemen and free prospectors filed in deringham and his daughter took their places amidst the rest  the room was long and bare boarded with roughsawn cedar and furnished chiefly by the benches that ran down either side of the plain table but the aromatic smell of the wood was stronger than that of stale tobacco and the company avoided more than quietly respectful glances at the daintilydressed englishwoman  they were quiet men with grave and steady eyes and though they ate as if feeding was a serious business and they had no time to waste there was nothing in their converse that jarred upon the girl  indeed she saw one break off in a story whose conclusion she fancied might not have pleased her when a comrade glanced at him deprecatingly  in another ten minutes they filed out again and deringham smiled at his daughter  what do you think of them he said  the girl laughed  ostriches she said  of course i guess your thoughts  you were wondering if my kinsman resembles them  how long do we stay here  deringham glanced at her covertly and noticed the faint sparkle in her eyes and the scornful set of her lips  that depends he said partly upon our kinsmans attitude for if he offered us hospitality we should probably stay a little  you were also right my dear as usual  the girls pose grew a trifle more rigid and the fingers of one hand seemed to close vindictively  it is grotesquealmost horrible isnt it she said  her father nodded  it might be he said  still as you know the carnaby affairs are involved and there is a possibility of contesting his claim under the somewhat extravagant will  it is not altogether improbable that i shall find means of persuading him to stay here with his cows and pigs  deringham slightly accentuated part of the sentence and again a faint tinge of colour crept into the face of the girl and vindictiveness into her eyes for she understood him  the man who had on his deathbed bequeathed carnaby to his grandson had driven out the young mans father years ago and approaching dissolution had possibly somewhat clouded his faculties when he made the will  deringham who had married into the alton family and figured as a legatee was with the exception of the disinherited the nearest of kin and it had been generally expected that carnaby would fall to his daughter but perhaps in an endeavour to treat both sides fairly its dying owner had in the face of his lawyers protests inserted one clause which for financial reasons rendered a second union between the houses of alton and deringham distinctly advisable  there was however a high spirit in the girl and she looked at her father steadily  but you were left the money or most of it she said  yes said deringham grimly  i was left the money  the girl asked nothing further for there was something in the mans face which warned her not to press that subject  she knew that her father had long acted as financial adviser to the late owner of carnaby but it was not astonishing that deringham had not told her he had exceeded the discretion allowed him and been singularly unfortunate in his speculations  she rose and a man who like themselves had finished his meal leisurely followed them outside into the verandah  he smiled as he drew out a chair for the girl and then sat down opposite her father with a card in his hand  glad to meet you mr deringham  ill introduce myself said he  deringham took the card handed him and glanced with an air of quiet indifference at the stranger while his daughter looked apparently straight past him towards the climbing pines  nevertheless she had seen the man and was not pleased with him  he had a somewhat fleshy face beady black eyes with a boldness in them that was more akin to insolence than courage and a fulllipped mobile mouth  his dress was correct enough though he wore a somewhat ample ring with a diamond in it and his watchchain was too heavy and prominent but there was a suggestion of coarseness about him  her father leaning forward in his chair with an air of languid curiosity the card in his slender fingers appeared his antithesis and yet the girl fancied there was a resemblance in the expression of the two faces  she also felt her dislike for the stranger increased when she saw for the first time the look of greed and cunning in his face reflected in that of her father she had hitherto only pictured him as a skilful financier but now she saw qualities she had never suspected in him revealed as by a daring caricature  willard hallam deringham read aloud  hallam and vose  land and mining agents  advances made on mineral claims  yes said the stranger smiling  thats me  deringham made no comment but laid the card down beside him  i wonder he said indifferently how you came to know me  the chilling evenness of his voice seemed to irritate the other man and alice deringham was conscious of a faint amusement as she glanced at them  deringham in his tweed travelling attire which worn with apparent carelessness seemed to hang with every fold just where it should be was wholly at his ease and there was a trace of halfexpressed toleration in his thin finelycut face while hallam appeared to become coarse and embarrassed by comparison  he probably did not feel so for diffidence of any kind is not common in the west but he may have realized that in any delicate fencing the advantage would lie with deringham  both producing nothing and living upon the toil of their fellows played the same game but while the stakes and counters are very similar one played it in vancouver and the other in london where a more subtle finesse is demanded from the players  hallam however smiled  i dont know that you will be pleased when i tell you but this should explain things he said  of course since your company took hold out here i have heard of you  deringham took the colonial journal handed him glanced down a paragraph and passed it to his daughter  your maid he said  i fancied it was a mistake to part with her my dear  it is evident she has not gone home  alice deringham unconsciously drew herself up a trifle as her eyes ran down the column  it was headed another missing heir and ran we are getting used to having our railroadshovelling and trailcutting done by scions of the british aristocracy and seldom ask them what they did in the old country so long as they behave themselves decently in this one  twice recently as mentioned in these columns the successor to an english property of some value was discovered in the one case peddling oranges and in the other digging a ranchers ditches while now we have another instance in the somasco valley  it appears that long ago there was a family quarrel at carnaby england and though we do not know what it was all about the owner of what we understand is an encumbered estate turned out his son who had the good sense to come out to this country where he did pretty well  he died and left a son mr henry alton well known in the somasco district who appears to be a credit to the country which took his father in the owner of carnaby dying later left the ancestral property to him and as in this case there does not seem to be a wicked uncle mr deringham the next of kin and a distinguished london financier who has we believe had some dealings in local mines has come out to look for him  mr alton of somasco will probably stop right where he is if he is the sensible man his neighbours seem to think him  thats correct said hallam glancing at deringham  i knew who you were when i saw you  yes said deringham  the taste is questionable but i cant deny its comparative accuracy  then said hallam alton stands between you and this carnaby property  i believe so said deringham quietly  its a big estate said hallam and alice deringham who knew his capabilities wondered when her father would effectually silence this presumptuous stranger  in the meanwhile he however showed no intention of doing so  no he said languidly  it is a small one and heavily in debt  i presume you know rancher alton by the interest you show in him  yes said hallam and i dont like him  deringham scarcely glanced at his daughter but she realized that her presence was not especially desired and when she rose and went back into the building her father glanced steadily at hallam  i wonder why you told me that he said  hallam laughed  well i generally talk straight and i feel like that he said  now they dont keep anything that doesnt burn a hole in you here and ive a bottle of english whisky  dont see any reason why you shouldnt take a drink with me  no said deringham indifferently  i am however a somewhat abstemious man  hallam went into the building and returned with a cigarcase and a bottle  the contents of both were good and deringham sat languidly glancing over the curling smoke towards the glimmering snow  it towered white and cold against a pale green shining high above climbing pines and dusky valley while the fleecy mist crept higher and higher athwart the serried waves of trees that fell to the river hollow  alice deringham saw it and drinking in the wonderful freshness that came down from the peaks and permeated the silence of the valley realized a little of that great white ramparts awful serenity  she also wondered vacantly what the two men on the verandah were talking about but in this she was wrong for hallam overcharged with western vivacity was talking and her father waiting quietly  no said the former returning to the subject with an affectation of naive directness  i dont like alton and i figure he dont like me nothing wrong with the man that i know of but im not fond of anybody who gets in my way and alton of somasco has taken out timber rights all over the valley where were running the tyee  he got in with his claim a day or two ahead of me  a capable man said deringham quietly  oh yes said the other  hes capable so far as he sees but the trouble is he doesnt see quite far enough  now theres not room enough for two men with notions round about somasco and a onehorse rancher cant fight men with money so altons got hold of a good deal bigger contract than he can carry through  anyway now ive told you what i think of your relation you can if you feel like that let right go of me  deringham smiled a little  this he said is the best whisky i have tasted in canada  hallam laughed  well he said im glad i met you especially as youll no doubt stop here a little and size up the mineral resources of the country  theres lots of information lying round that should be useful to you  anyway you made a big mistake when you took up the peveril  dropped a good many dollars that time didnt you  deringhams face grew a trifle grim  as you probably know just what the mistake cost us there is no use in me denying it said he  well said hallam sympathetically one cant always come out on top and if youre stopping down at vancouver i may be of some use to you and you to me  if youll come up tomorrow ill show you the tyee and ive something better still up the valley  im sorry said deringham indifferently im going through to somasco  hallam glanced at him steadily  of course you are said he  well ive told you nothing alton doesnt know and ive letters to answer youll excuse me  deringham rose with him and strolling along the verandah together they stopped a moment at the door close by where alice deringham sat at an open window  it was growing dark now but the last of the afterglow was flung down into their faces by the snow and it seemed to the girl that the resemblance between them had grown stronger  her fathers appeared a trifle less refined in its chiselling than it had been and there was a look which did not please her in his eyes  it suggested cupidity and cunning in place of intellectuality  well said hallam youll call on me at vancouver anyway and its possible we may be some use to each other  the hint of a confidence or understanding between them which the mans tone conveyed irritated the girl but she saw that her father did not resent it  yes he said  if i think i can benefit by your cooperation in any way i will not fail to let you know  hallam went in and deringham leaned upon the verandah balustrade smoking tranquilly while the shadows that left the rolling mist behind crept higher and higher up the climbing pines until at last they touched and smeared into dimness the ethereal snow  then the girl rose with a shiver and turned towards her father as horton lighted the big lantern at the door  deringhams face was she fancied a trifle haggard  i wonder why you have borne with that man so long she said  deringham smiled a little  there are many kinds of men and presumably all of them are useful in their place said he     chapter v  the heir of carnaby  the sun was dipping towards the black ridge of firs on the shoulder of a hill when deringham and his daughter rode down the winding trail into the somasco valley  the girl gazed about her with eager curiosity but the man who rode in silence apparently saw nothing and it was only when his horse stumbled into a rut that he glanced round for a moment abstractedly  deringham had much to occupy his mind just then for while it was generally understood that he had made the journey at a physicians recommendation he had reasons for choosing british columbia to recuperate in  he still retained control of the finances of carnaby with the concurrence of the trustees who were country gentlemen of no business capacity and as it suited the family lawyer to remain on good terms with him nothing more than a very perfunctory account of his stewardship had been demanded  the late owner of carnaby had been a man of simple tastes and unbending pride who had a faint contempt for his kinsman and refrained from inquiries respecting finances while there was no stoppage of supplies  there were one or two men who suspected that deringham had profited by his relatives supineness but it was only a vague surmise and they did not know that the legacy bequeathed him had little more than an apparent value  deringham had been unfortunate in his latest ventures and could foresee considerable difficulty in extricating himself from a distinctly unpleasant position if the new heir decided to take immediate possession of his property the latter had however shown no great desire to do so and deringham had accepted a commission from the trustees to ascertain his intentions  a company of which he was one of the promoters had also invested somewhat unhappily in western mines and deringham who purposed to see what could be done with the depreciated securities intended that the expenses of his sojourn in the mountain province should be borne by the shareholders  he had acquired considerable facility in the art of managing them but the owner of carnaby was an unknown quantity and deringham was anxious  presently his daughter reined in her pony  stop a moment father that must be the ranch she said  the man drew bridle and for a moment forgot his perplexities as he gazed at the scene before him  far down in the valley lay a still blue lake with a great white peak shining ethereally at its northern end dark pines rolled about it growing smaller and smaller up the hillside until they dwindled with spires clean cut against the azure into a gossamer filigree  between them and the water stupendous forest shrouded all the valley save where an oblong of pale verdure ran back from the fringe of boulders and was traversed by the frothing streak of a river whose roar came up hoarsely across the pines in long pulsations  that was all deringham saw at first sight but he realized that it was very beautiful and then commenced to note details with observant eyes there was a sawmill beside the river for he could faintly hear a strident scream and see the blue smoke drifting in gauzy wisps across the hill  the square loghouse which stood some little distance from the lake looked well built and substantial and the road that wound through the green oblong had been skilfully laid with rounded strips sawn off the great firtrunks  sleek cattle stood apparently ready for dispatch in a corral the yellowing oats beyond them were railed off by a sixfoot fence and behind the rows of sawnoff stumps which ringed about the clearing great trunks and branches lay piled in the confusion of the slashing  deringham was not a farmer but he was a man of affairs and all he saw spoke to him of prosperity that sprang from strenuous energy and administrative ability  you are very silent said his daughter  what are you thinking  deringham laughed a little somewhat mirthlessly  it occurs to me that whatever our unknown relative may be he is a good rancher if this is his handiwork he said  well we shall see him very shortly  the girls fingers tightened a little on the switch she held  we know what we shall find she said with a gesture of cold disdain  it would be so much easier if he had only been an educated englishman  still said deringham dryly since we are ousted from carnaby i do not see that it makes any great difference  miss deringhams eyes sparkled and a spot of colour tinged her cheeks her mother had been one of the altons who had long been proud of carnaby and the instincts of the landholding race were strong within her  no she said with a little scornful inflection  and you could look on while a cattledriving boor made himself a laughingstock at carnaby  deringham smiled again  i am he said inclined to feel sorry for the canadian but you will at least be civil to him  miss deringham made a little gesture of impatience  you do not suppose i should be openly resentful she said  her father still appeared ironically amused  i do not know that it would be necessary but i fancy the canadian will have cause to regret he is an alton he said  no doubt it would be some solace to you to make him realize his offences but i scarcely think it would be advisable  then they rode down into the valley through oatfields and between the tall firstumps that rose amidst the fern under the boughs of an orchard and up to the square loghouse  nobody came out to receive them or answered their call and deringham dismounting helped his daughter down and tethering the horses passed through the verandah into the house  the long table in the big logwalled room they entered was littered with unwashed plates  torn overalls and old kneeboots lay amidst the axes and big saws in one corner the dust was heavy everywhere and rifles and salmonspears hung upon the walls  there was no sign of taste or comfort  everything suggested grim utility and the house was very still  the girl who was tired sat down with a little gesture of dismay  this is worse and worse she said  deringham who was fond of his daughter laid a hand upon her shoulder reassuringly  you can go on to vancouver when you wish said he sit still and rest while i see if there is anybody about  he strolled round the homestead and noticed that log barns and stables were all well built while presently he found a man plucking fowls in a galvanized shed  there was a row of them before him all without heads while an ensanguined axe close by indicated the fashion of their execution  he glanced at deringham a moment and then fell to work again  oh yes this is somasco and the finest ranch this side of the fraser he said  can you see mr alton  well i figure hes busy and you had better wait a little  get hold of this  its your supper  deringham recoiled a pace when a somewhat gory fowl struck him on the knee and then sat down on a pile of cedarwood staring at the speaker i wish to see mr alton as soon as possible he said  the other man looked up again and grinned  youd better not said he  harry altons a bit short in temper when hes busy and if youre peddling anything it would be better if you saw him after supper  then if you cant make a deal you can go on tomorrow  theres plenty good straw in the barn  deringham was not especially flattered at being mistaken for a peddler nor had the prospect of sleeping on straw any great attraction for him but he had a sense of humour and being desirous of acquiring information took up the fowl  do you put up every stranger who calls here and give him a fowl for supper  what am i to do with this one he said  now where did you come from said the other  thats just what we do  a fowls not much for a man anyway and harry will eat two of them when hes hungry  what are you going to do with it  well you can pull the feathers off it and fix it for cooking unless you like them better with their insides in  deringham gravely pulled out four or five feathers and then finding it more difficult than he had expected desisted  mr alton is apparently not married he said  the man grinned  no harry knows when hes well off and it would take a woman with a mighty firm grip to manage him said he  still theres one or two of them quite ready to see what they could make of him but mrs margery scares them off when they come round bringing him little things and harrys a bit pernicketty  his father was a duke or something in the old country  mrs margery said deringham inquiringly  yes said the other  shes not here just now but she keeps the house for him  i help round and do the cooking  deringham who could adapt himself to his surroundings nodded  that is what you would consider a soft job in this country  well said the man grimly as he pointed to the deformation of one lower limb i am not fond of it but its about all im good for now thats where the axe went in and anybody but harry alton might have fired me  it was my own blame foolishness too but when the doctor told him harry comes to me  you neednt worry about one thing anyway  therell be a job for you just so long as youre wanting it says he  he does that kind of thing sometimes said deringham curiously  no sir said the other dryly  he does it every time but the devil himself wouldnt squeeze ten cents out of harry if he didnt want to give it him  but how long are you going to be stripping that fowl  as im afraid it would take me all night i would prefer to give you a halfadollar to do it for me said deringham  the man straightened himself a little and deringham received another surprise  patent medicines and hairgrowers are up said he  i dont quite understand said deringham quietly  no said the other  well you will do presently unless you get right out of this shanty  im fit to make my wages yet if ive only got one handy leg and i can put my mark on any blame peddler who talks that way to me  im sorry said deringham gravely  i have you see just come from england where folks are not always so well paid as you seem to be  i think i will look for mr alton  can you tell me where he is  the man who appeared a trifle mollified pointed to the bush  hes yonder but if he scares you you neednt blame me he said  deringham picked his way amidst the sixfoot firstumps girdled with tall fern over a breadth of white ashes and charcoal where the newlywon land lay waiting for the plough in and out amidst the chaos of trunks that lay piled athwart each other all round the clearing and stopped close by three men who were making an onslaught on a majestic tree  its topmost sprays towered two hundred feet above them and the great trunk ran a stupendous column to the vault of dusky green above it was however the men who most attracted deringhams attention and he stood for a moment watching them  two were poised on narrow boards notched into the tree a mans height from the ground and one was huge and swarthy so that the heavy axe he held seemed a toy in his great gnarled hand  the other whose figure seemed in some respects familiar stooped a little with the bright axe blade laid flat in one palm as though he were examining it and deringham who could not see his face turned towards another who sat at the foot of the tree sharpening a big saw  his overalls were in tolerable repair while from an indefinite something in his face and the way he wore them deringham set him down as an englishman  still he did not think he was an alton  can you tell me where mr henry alton is he said  the young man nodded  harry he said  then the man on the plank above turned round and deringham felt inclined to gasp as he stood face to face with the new heir to carnaby the man was grimed with dust and ashes  his blue shirt rolled back to the shoulders left uncovered arms that were corded like a smiths and was rent at the neck so that deringham could see the finelyarched chest  the overalls tightbelted round the waist set off the solidity of his shoulders and the leanness of the flank while with the first glance at his face deringham recognized the teamster who had driven them through the bush  he stood poised on the few inches of springy redwood looking down upon him with a grimly humorous twinkle in his eyes but through the smears of perspiration and the charcoal grime deringham now recognized the expression of quiet forcefulness and the directness of gaze which was his birthright  mr henry alton he said  yes said the other quietly  there was a moments embarrassing silence for alton said nothing further and deringham gazed at the man he had journeyed three thousand miles to see  i should like a little talk with you he said presently  cant oblige you said the other  i couldnt spare more than a minute now for a railroad director  you can tell me anything you want after supper  deringham lost a little of his usual serenity  my business is of some importance he said  alton smiled grimly  i cant help that  so is mine said he  a lawyer by the stamp of you  well youre trailing the wrong man because i dont owe anybody money  well put you up tonight and you can look for him tomorrow  i have come from carnaby england said deringham watching the effect upon the man  you are i presume the grandson of its late owner  this shot got home but the effect was not altogether what deringham had anticipated for altons big hands tightened on the axe and his face grew very stern  im not proud of the connection anyway he said  alton of somasco is good enough for me  but said deringham quietly i have come to talk things over with you  tristan alton left you carnaby  alton straightened himself a little and flung out an arm while deringham recognized the alton pride as with a sweeping gesture he pointed to wide lake forestshrouded hillside and the clearing in the valley  he turned out my father because he knew his mind and now when there is no one else leaves me the playedout property  thank god i dont want it while thats all mine he said  what brings you here to talk of carnaby  deringham smiled a little  the executor sent me and i have come a long way said he  when i tell you that i am ralph deringham you should know me  alton nodded gravely  then you can tell me all about it after supper and well have plenty time for talking because youll stay a while with me he said  if youll go back to the house youll find some cigars that might please you in the bureau  sorry i cant come with you but im busy  are you ready tom  he turned and swung up the axe while the big bushman swept his blade aloft and deringham watched them curiously  alton swayed with a steely suppleness from the waist and the broad wedge of steel flashed about his head before it came down ringing  the man had a few inches of springy wood which bent and heaved beneath him to stand upon but the great blade descended exactly where the last chip had lain and when it hissed aloft again that of the silent axeman dropped into the notch it made  deringham knew a little about a good many things including swordplay and he realized as he watched the whirl and flash of blades precision of effort and exactitude of time that this was an example of mans mastery over the trenchant steel  presently the man with the saw rose and touched his shoulder  i fancy we had better draw aside a little he said  she will come down in another minute just here  now deringham had seen trees wedged over and drawn down by ropes in england and wondered a little when the man pointed to the spot where he was standing  if you dont resent the question how do you know he said  the other man laughed a little  harry told me and hes seldom more than a foot out he said  there was a groaning of fibres as deringham drew aside but the two figures on the springy planks still smote and swung until simultaneously they flung the axes down and sprang  then the great fir quivered a little toppled lurched and fell and the hillside resounded to the thud it made  it also smote the trembling soil just where the man with the saw had indicated  then alton signed to his assistant and strode away with the axe on his shoulder towards another tree  the sawsharpener laughed a little as he sat down again  now you have had your say it would be better if you waited until after supper he said  you see one thing at one time is quite enough for harry and he really isnt in the least uncivil when you understand him  still its no use trying to make him listen when he doesnt want to  that said deringham dryly was always one of the characteristics of his family  you are presumably an englishman  the other man laughed a little  yes he said im charles seaforth better known to the boys here as the honourable charley though i have no especial right to the title and am fortunate in holding a small share in the somasco ranch which i owe to my partners generosity  do i understand that he gave it you said deringham  seaforth nodded  you would be near the mark if you came to that conclusion  and is mr alton in the habit of making similar presents said deringham  seaforth glanced towards the sinewy figure with the glinting axe and smiled again  that he said quietly is one of the most generous men in the dominion of canada but i should not care to be the man who attempted to take advantage of him  deringham said nothing further though he was sensible of a slight uneasiness and presently went back to the house to rejoin his daughter while the dusk was creeping across the valley when the men from the sawmill and clearing came home and deringham led his daughter out when he heard altons voice in the verandah  the latter and his partner were together and the girl at first felt a slight sense of relief as her glance fell upon seaforth who stood with his wide hat in his hand  he was for that country somewhat fastidious in dress his eyes were mildly humorous and his face was pleasant while he had not as yet wholly lost the stamp of the graceful idler he had brought with him from england  this said deringham with the faintest trace of irony is our kinsman mr henry alton of carnaby  you have seen him already  my daughter alice mr alton  the girl stood still a moment and glanced at seaforth whom she could not recollect having seen before with something that suggested not altogether unpleased surprise in her face  his appearance and attitude disarmed her but as she was about to speak to him the other man moved so that the fading light fell full upon him  he stood tall and almost statuesque in his torn overalls with the misty pines rolling up the hillside behind him and a big axe in his handa type it seemed to her of western barbarityand a red spot faint but perceptible rose into her cheeks as he bent his head  then she came near forgetting what was due to both of them in her astonishment and anger  you she said  yes said the axeman gravely  still your father made a little mistake  im alton of somasco  then he turned and moved forward with a gesture that was almost courtly  you are very welcome to this poor house of mine he said     chapter vi  miss deringham makes friends  the homeric supper was over and miss deringham who sitting next to alton at the head of the long table had watched the stalwart axeman feed with sensations divided between disgust and wonder was talking to seaforth on the verandah when her father sat by a window of the room his kinsman called his own  there were survey maps tassels of oats and a great wapiti head upon the wall while alton himself lay almost full length in a deerhide chair  the window was open wide and the vista of lake pineshrouded hillside and snow framed by its log casing steeped in nocturnal harmonies of silver and blue  out of the stillness came the scent of balsam and the sighing of a little breeze amidst the pines  deringham held a good cigar and there was a cup of coffee beside him while he was not wholly sorry that they sat in darkness  he had realized that alton of somasco was by no means a fool and waited his questions with some anxiety  the rancher however had apparently no present intention of asking any  so theyve been wondering when i am coming over he said reflectively  i dont know that ill come at all  deringham looked down at his cigar to cover his astonishment  but you are an alton of carnaby he said  yes said alton slowly  but that is one of the things i want to forget  you see they drove my father out because he had the grit to marry the woman who loved him instead of another one who had the money but you know all that  deringham nodded and altons face showed grim in the moonlight as he continued but what you dont know is how he fought his way uphill in this country and what my mother suffered helping him  oh yes i can remember her well gentle brave and patient as she was and know what it must have cost her to camp down alone in the bush and fight through the hard winter in the ice and snow  well she was too good for this world and she just faded out of it before the good time came  i think they must have a special place for women of her kind in the other one  deringham only nodded again because this type of man was new to him and he had learned to keep silent when in doubt but altons big right hand closed into a fist  and now when i have somasco the man who had not a dollar for his only son leaves me carnaby he said  there  look out and see timber lake and clearing cattle mills and crops the finest ranch in the district  my father commenced it and i have finished  the almighty made him a man and he wouldnt sell his birthright to loaf his days away overfed at carnaby  alton dropped his cigar and laughed a little  well im talking like a fool again  there are times when i cant help it  its a way of mine  deringham sat still smoking and thinking rapidly  he had never had dealings with a man of this description before but while he surmised that alton of somasco might under some conditions prove himself a headstrong fool it was evident that there were limits to his folly the mans handiwork spoke for him and his energy and intentness had not escaped deringhams attentions while the occasional utterances that might have appeared bombastic coming from other men were redeemed in his case by the tone of naive sincerity and imperious ring deringham was becoming conscious of a vague respect for and fear of his companion  we are apparently no nearer the answer to my question he said at length  no said alton smiling  this thing will take some thinking over carnaby isnt exactly what you call a rich property  it is heavily encumbered said deringham almost too eagerly  alton nodded still it must be worth a little and would give the folks who lived there a standing in the old country  yes said deringham thoughtfully and was once more astonished by his companions answer  well he said slowly  i was thinking about your daughter  all this it seems to me is mighty rough on her  it would hurt her to be turned out of carnaby  isnt that beside the question said deringham with a trace of stiffness  alton took up another cigar and lighted it  i dont quite know that it is he said  you see i remember a good deal what my mother had to put up with and it has made me kind of sorry for women who have to do without the things they have been used to  now miss deringham has had a pretty good time in the old country  deringham moved his head very slightly  i scarcely think we need go into that but it is incontrovertible that the loss of carnaby would make a difference to her he said  alton sat silent a space and then while deringham wondered smiled a little  and she might have kept it but for a very little thing that happened a month or two ago he said  if the junipertwigs had broken it would have saved considerable trouble to everybody  i was back there in the mountains looking for a silver lead you see  silver mines are i understand not always profitable to the man who finds them and i should have fancied you had already sufficient scope for your energies said deringham dryly  alton laughed but there was a trace of grimness in his voice  if i once get my stakes in on the lead this ones going to be and if i could get the dollars i could do a good deal for somasco he said we want roads and mills the biggest orchard in the province and a fruit cannery and were going to have them presently  thats why i wanted the silver  you did not find it then said deringham who was not unwilling to follow his companion from the former topic  no said alton not that time but i will by and by  well there was a good deal of snow up in the ranges and my feet got away from me one evening when we were crawling along the edge of a gully  there was a river and big boulders some five hundred feet below and i slipped down clawing at the snow until i grabbed a little bunch of juniper just on the edge  part of it tore up but i got a grip of a better handful and hung on to it with most of me swinging over the gully charley was stripping off the packrope on the slope above and he was mighty quick but i knew that bush was coming away with me and didnt think he could be fast enough  i didnt feel exactly happy but while ive read that folks think of some astonishing things when theyre starting out on the long trail it wasnt that way with me  i could only remember there was a man id never got even with whod badly cheated me  illustration  there was a river and big boulders some five hundred feet below  deringham felt a little shiver run through him for there was a grim vindictiveness in the speakers tone and he felt that alton of somasco would not lightly forgive an injury  you managed to crawl up he said  no said alton simply i didnt  i lay there watching charley and felt the bush drawing out until the rope came down and charley hauled me up  it would have made a big difference to miss deringham if hed been a second or two longer  well well have lots of time for talking because youre out for your health and well keep you right here until we see what somasco can do for you and just now i see miss deringham alone on the verandah  he rose and left deringham sitting by the window  the moon had swung higher now and the lake was a blaze of silver but deringham scarcely noticed it or the ethereal line of snow  in place of it he saw a shadowy figure hanging between earth and heaven with tense fingers gripping a little bush while a river frothed down the black hollow five hundred feet below and remembered that even in that moment the man who hung there regretted he could not repay somebody who had cheated him  then he rose and moved once or twice up and down the room his fancy still dwelling upon the picture  if the junipertwigs had yielded it would have made a great difference to him as well as his daughter  he sat down again presently and stared at the valley seeing nothing as he remembered that alton of somasco might go back to the ranges again and then with an effort shook the fancies from him  they were not wholesome for a man hemmed in by difficulties as he was then  in the meanwhile his daughter stood with one hand on the verandah balustrade listening to the song of the river which came sonorously through the shadows of the bush  she also breathed in the scent of the firs and found it pleasant but it was instinctively she did so for her thoughts were also busy  alice deringham had noticed her fathers fits of abstraction as well as the anxiety in his face and had no great difficulty in connecting them with the loss of carnaby  she was also fond of him for deringham had shown only his better side to her and sensible of a very bitter feeling towards the man who had supplanted him  in addition to this she remembered the faint amusement in his eyes when he noticed the glint of a silver coin she held halfcovered in her hand and her pulses throbbed a little faster the man had placed her in a ridiculous position and had he guessed her feelings towards him he would probably not have made his appearance as he did just then  the boards creaked behind her and turning partly round she straightened herself with a slow sinuous gracefulness and stood drawn up to her full height looking at the newcomer  he stood still a moment with veiled admiration in his eyes and this was not altogether surprising in one who had dwelt for the most part far remote from civilization in the lonely bush  alice deringham had been considered somewhat of a beauty in london and it was possible that she knew the pale moonlight and the harmonies of blue and silver she stood out against enhanced the symmetry of her outline  the man stood watching her with his head bent a trifle but miss deringham evinced a fine indifference  she had formed a somewhat mistaken estimate of him already  i want to tell you that im sorry he said  the girl fancied she understood him and it increased her anger for the fact that this barbarian of the bush should venture to express pity for her was galling  still she had no intention of admitting it and regarded him inquiringly with a halfcontemptuous indifference which she had found especially effective with presumptuous young men in england  somewhat to her astonishment it apparently had no result at all for alton returned her gaze gravely and without embarrassment  i dont understand she said  i was hoping you would because i felt i must tell you and im not good at talking said the man  i cant help seeing that you are vexed with me  if alton had intended to be conciliatory he had signally failed because miss deringham had no intention of admitting that anything he could do would cause her anger  i am afraid you are taking things for granted she said  alton smiled gravely and the girl noticed that he accepted the onus of the explanation she had forced upon him  i really dont think you should be he said  i cant help being tristan altons grandson you see and we are some kind of relations and ought to be friendly  miss deringham laughed a little  relations do not always love each other very much said she  no said alton  still i think they should and even if it hurts i feel ive got to tell you im sorry  if you would only take it it would please me to give you back carnaby  the girl almost gasped with astonishment and indignation  that is a trifle unnecessary since you know it is perfectly impossible she said  she had at last roused the man for the moonlight showed a darker colour creeping into his tan  i dont usually say more than i mean he said  now we shall never understand each other unless you will talk quite straight with me  alice deringham had not lost her discretion in her anger and since there was no avoiding the issue decided it would be preferable to blame him for the lesser of his offences  then she said coldly it was somewhat difficult to appreciate the humour of the trick you played upon us  you may however have different notions as to what is tasteful in the colonies  again the darker colour showed in altons bronzed forehead but he spoke gravely  i dont think thats quite fair he said  i am what the almighty made me a plain bushman who has had to work too hard for his living to learn to put things nicely but i never came down to any meanness that would hurt a woman and there isnt any need for a dainty english lady to point out the difference between herself and me  there may be less difference than you seem to fancy said the girl a trifle maliciously  you are alton of carnaby  pshaw said the man with a little gesture of pride and impatience which miss deringham was forced to admit became him  im alton of somasco and nobody gave it me  i won it from the lake and the forest that comes crawling in againbut im getting off the trail  i didnt know your father was coming here and hadnt any notion who you were  thats curious because he wrote to tell you said the girl  alton flushed a little for he was somewhat quicktempered and too proud to be otherwise than a veracious man  well he said slowly i have the honour of telling you i didnt get the letter  theres a place called somasco down in vancouver  miss deringham decided that she had ventured sufficiently far  indeed on subsequent reflection she was forced to admit that she had gone farther than was quite seemly which somewhat naturally increased her displeasure against the man  in the meanwhile she however made a little gracious gesture  then i dont think the explanation was necessary she said  alton laughed a little and held out his hand  do you know im thankful thats over once for all and now we can be friends he said there are lots of things i can show you in the valley and a good deal more that you can teach me  alice deringham could not afterwards quite decide why she shook hands with him for she had no intention of teaching him anything just then but she did and felt as the hard brown fingers closed upon her own that the friendship of this curious man could in time of necessity be relied upon  in any case and obeying some impulse she shook off her chilliness and asking questions about the district evinced a gracious interest in all he had to tell her while presently induced by his naive frankness she smiled at him as she noticed him regarding her gravely  i presume a dress of this kind is scarcely suitable for the bush she said  alton laughed  i wasnt looking at the dress though its a very pretty one he said  you see except my mother and miss townshead i have never spoken to an english lady  but you must have been very young when you lost her said the girl  alton took off his hat and pointed to a hillside shrouded with sombre firs  yes he said quietly  she sleeps up there and in a little while my father followed her  he was lonely without her and because of what she had done for him proud of his countrywomen  he often used to talk about them  and said alice deringham you wondered if he was mistaken  alton made a little gesture that in a curious fashion implied a wide chivalric faith  no he said gravely i believe he was right  miss deringham felt a faint warmth creep into her cheek and it was not because the speech might have been deemed a personal compliment  she saw a little deeper into the mans nature than that and if she had not the tone of grave respect would have enlightened her  then she turned with a little sense of relief as deringham came out upon the verandah  i am pleased to see you and mr alton have made friends he said and the girl who noticed a faint twinkle in his eyes turned quietly and looked down the valley as she remembered one odious clause in the will  she rose early next morning and flinging the window open to let in the glorious freshness heard a commotion below while as she wondered as to the cause of it several pairs of old boots went gyrating over the balustrade of the verandah  a dilapidated saddle followed them and then a cloud of dust rolled up while she saw the new owner of carnaby appear somewhat scantily attired out of the midst of it  he had a brush in one hand and seemed disturbed about something  where the brimstone does mrs margery keep the scrubbing soap he said  nobody answered him and he moved back into the dust while seaforth was coming up the stairway carrying a mop and pail when a big empty oilcan smote him upon the chest  he dropped the pail and leaned a moment gasping and dripping against the balustrade  you might notice where youre throwing things he said  the dust rolled more thickly and altons voice came out of it  i hadnt time to be particular and a sensible man would have got out of the way of it  dont stand there anyway but help me fix this place fit for a lady before miss deringham gets up  then youre going through to the railroad with the new packhorse to wire for mrs margery after breakfast  i dont think i am said seaforth  not on julius caesar anyway he will need a little more taming before im fit to ride him  then said alton laughing i guess you can shove him because youll want a horse to bring up the things youre going to wire vancouver for and toms off with the teams up the valley  fetch some more water and start in with the scrubbing  i dont want miss deringham to guess weve been doing anything unusual  if she doesnt hear you said seaforth she must be very deaf  now said alton regretfully i never thought of that  sit right down charley and take your boots off  i am going to the well first said seaforth who retired grinning and miss deringham laughed softly as she heard the cautious movements of a big barefooted man floundering about clumsily with a brush or mop  when she came down to breakfast however she was a little astonished the room was swept and garnished with cedar sprays while though it smelled of some crude soap the aromatic sweetness of balsam was present too and there were signs of taste in its decoration and the disposition of the splendid fruit upon the table  alton had not plucked it all and the golden apples and velvety peaches lay with their soft tinting enhanced amidst the leaves  when he came in bright of eye and apparently glowing from a plunge in the river she glanced at him with quiet amusement  you have been improving the place wonderfully she said  you are pleased with it said the rancher and the girl noticed the contentment in his eyes when she smiled approvingly  i think she said it is very pretty     chapter vii  alton blunders  deringham spent several weeks at somasco without arriving at any understanding with its owner  this however did not cause him any great concern because he had at his doctors recommendation decided on a somewhat lengthy absence from england and found himself regaining health and vigour with every day he passed in the pleasant valley  he was also desirous of gaining time because he had left negotiations for the formation of a company to take over an enterprise he was interested in in train and while these could proceed as well without him a favourable termination would by relieving him from immediate financial anxiety enable him if it seemed advisable to adopt a firmer tone in any discussion respecting carnaby  alton had in the meanwhile quietly avoided the subject  affairs were in this position when he sat one evening with his daughter on the verandah glancing now and then down the valley  it was very still and peaceful and trails of white mist crept about the pines while though the paling light still lingered high up upon the snow a crescent moon was growing into visibility against the steely blueness behind the eastern shoulder of a hill  deringham however was listening for the thud of hoofs and wondering if the mounted man sent down to the settlement would bring any letters for him  his daughter sat close by him dreamily watching the darkness roll higher about the pines  she had not as yet grown tired of somasco and found its owner an interesting study  he was of a type that was new to her and the girl of a somewhat inquiring disposition  presently she turned to her father  how long shall we stay here she said  i dont know said deringham  it depends upon the canadian and in the meanwhile i am picking up a good deal of useful information about the mineral resources of this country  alton of somasco seems to be a somewhat intelligent man  yes said the girl thoughtfully  it is a little difficult to dislike him  i said her father smiling do not know that there is any great necessity or notice signs of a marked endeavour on your part to do so  the girl glanced at him inquiringly  you mean said she  nothing said deringham  only the canadian is also a man  well we shall be going on to vancouver presently  the girl laughed a little  that is incontrovertible she said  why not go on now  there are reasons said deringham somewhat gravely  for one thing i hope to be in a position shortly to make terms with him  but carnaby is his said the girl  yes said deringham unless he gives it up  his daughter appeared thoughtful  i scarcely think he will  deringham laughed a little  it might be possible to find means of inducing him  alice deringham shook her head  from what i have seen of mr alton i fancy it would be difficult  well said deringham dryly we shall see  he had scarcely spoken when a soft drumming sound came out of the stillness  it grew steadily louder was lost in the roar of the river and rose more distinct again while the girl who realized that a man was riding up the valley wondered with unusual curiosity what news he would bring  she also grew impatient for that staccato drumming seemed to jar upon the harmonies of the evening and she walked to the balustrade when the sound swelled into a thudding beat of hoofs  the man was crossing the oatfield at a gallop now  then the sound rose muffled out of the gloom of the orchard the trail ran through and she felt curiously expectant when once more the rider swung out into the shadowy clearing  she afterwards remembered the vague apprehension with which she watched and listened for it seemed to her that some intangible peril was drawing nearer with the galloping horse  a minute or two later seaforth came into the verandah with a packet of letters in his hand  there are several for you sir he said handing deringham some of them and passed into the house shouting harry  deringham glanced through his budget and his face changed a little while his daughter noticed the set of his lips and the clustering wrinkles about his eyes  there was a telegraphic message but he put it aside and opened a bulky envelope whose stamp he recognized  then the missive he took out rustled a little in his hand as he read  im afraid negotiations are not progressing well  mortimer as you will see by enclosed copies of correspondence demands a revaluation which would not be advisable before he will underwrite any of the capital  deringham laid down the letter and his daughter turned suddenly at his exclamation  the fools should have bought him off he said  then he took up the telegraphic message and read scheme impracticable  cannot compromise with mortimer  harper and the syndicate against us  details following  deringham said nothing but sat staring before him with a face that seemed to have grown suddenly grey and haggard until his daughter spoke to him  have you had bad news father she said  the man who had been sitting so that the light which shone out from the room behind them fell upon him moved  i have he said  this message informs me that at least ten thousand pounds have been virtually taken out of my pocket  as it happened i wanted the money somewhat badly  he rose and entering the house met alton coming out of it  the canadian brushed past him with a letter in his hand and deringham turned a moment and looked after him  the financiers face was not pleasant just then and there was a curious glitter in his eyes while seaforth who was following his comrade stared at him as he passed and came up with alton on the verandah  what has gone wrong with deringham he said  i dont know said alton lightly  do you think anything has  that said seaforth is what i am asking you  he looked condemnably ugly just now  one could have fancied that he contemplated killing somebody  alton laughed  got a little business trip up i expect he said and moved forward as he spoke  heres word from mrs jimmy  she wants to know when im going to begin  women are very persistent miss deringham but this one has some reason  they usually have said the girl  i do not however know mrs jimmy  of course said alton smiling  still i expect youll see her up here presently  it was a day or two later when alton returned to the topic of mrs jimmy and he was then kneeling in the stern of a canoe which slid with a swift smoothness down the placid lake as he dipped the glistening paddle  miss deringham was seated forward on a pile of cedartwigs with a wet line in her fingers and in no way disturbed by the fact that she had caught nothing  such expeditions had become somewhat frequent of late and though the girl sometimes wondered what she found to please her in the company and conversation of the bush rancher the fact that she usually went with him when he crossed the lake remained  i have seen that trail of smoke up there before  where does it come from she said languidly pointing to a distant film of vapour that drifted in a faint blue wreath along the slope of a hill  that said alton is the tyee mine  i have heard of it  they find silver there  yes said alton dryly  they find a little  there is silver in those mountains then said miss deringham  alton nodded  lots of it  still it costs a good deal to get out and then it doesnt pay for the mining occasionally  thats the trouble with the tyee  still it must pay somebody or they would not go on said miss deringham  alton laughed a little  oh yes he said dryly  it pays a man called hallam and some others of his kind who got up the company still sometime and somehow i think he will be sorry he stole poor folks money  you said miss deringham smiling are an optimist then  alton gravely glanced about him and the girl fancied she understood him as she followed his gaze from snowpeak down the great pineshrouded hillside to the river frothing in the valley  i dont know but one feels theres something beyond all that he said  it didnt come there by accident and it has all its work to do  sun and frost and sliding snow grinding up the hillside very sure and slow and the river sweeping what it gets from them way down the valley to spread new wheatfields out into the sea  but said miss deringham smiling we are speaking of men and i dont quite see the connection  well said alton they have their place in the great machine too and must work like the rest and do something to make it more fruitful in return for the food the good earth gives them  a good many men dont seem to realize the obligation said miss deringham  alton nodded  no but i cant help thinking theyll be dealt with somehow  theyre just stealing from the others  you are a socialist then  no said alton i dont think i am  it seems to me that every man is entitled to all the dollars he can get by working for them honestly and theres a place somewhere in this great world for him if he has the grit to get up and look for it as he was meant to do but it has no use for the man who wants to sit still and think about his dinner while other folks work for him  still he may have earned the right to do so said the girl  well said alton grimly most of that kind ive met with seemed to have stolen it and one or two of them had for a few thousand dollars sent good men to their death  when youve seen your comrades sickening and starving on rotten provisions in the snow or washed out down the valley by the bursting of a dam that was only built to sell you begin to wonder whether it would be wrong to wipe out some of that crowd with the rifle  the veins swelled on his forehead and there was a smouldering fire in his eyes while the girl suspected he was alluding to some especial member of the class and noticed that his eye seemed to follow the smoke of the tyee  then he laughed  i guess im talking nonsense again but theres a little behind it and i feel that you can pick it out he said  now im not good at amusing women but you and mrs jimmy seem to understand me  who is mrs jimmy and does her husband belong to somasco asked the girl with a smile  alton laid down the paddle and took off his hat  jimmy he said solemnly is dead  he was my partner and his wife is a friend of mine  she was in some ways very like you  they had a ranch up here said miss deringham languidly  no said alton  it wasnt often they had ten dollars  she was a lady barkeep down in vancouver before she married jimmy  he was a trailchopper in this country  i dont know what he was in the old one  and said miss deringham mrs jimmy resembles me  she regretted it next moment when she saw altons face  it expressed subdued surprise and the girl felt irritated with herself  yes he said gravely  human natures much the same at the bottom whether it has gold on the top of it or the dints of the hammer and mrs jimmy was good all through  that said miss deringham is distinctly pretty  well said alton smiling i didnt mean it that way  work was scarce in the province and id lost my cattle when jimmy went up with me into the ranges to look for silver  he brought his wife along because he had no dollars or anywhere to leave her and it was a mighty tough place for a woman where we camped under the big glacier  we stayed right there most of the winter  there was only frost and snow and the wind that whirled it about the pines and until it froze up we lived a good deal on salmon from the river  they were dead when we got them and some of them rotten  miss deringham shivered  and when the river froze she said  then said alton gravely there were days when we lived on nothing and worked until we couldnt hold the pick to keep from thinking still we got a deer now and then and we had a very little flour  it was mouldy when we bought it but we hadnt dollars enough for anything better  mrs jimmy got sick and thin but she never grumbled and was always waiting bright and smiling when we crawled back into the shanty anyway we found no silver that would pay for the getting though we knew it was there  how did you know that said miss deringham  well said alton a siwash told us something  he crawled in starving one day and though we hadnt much over we fed him  for another thing we felt it in us that we were on the right trail  that said the girl does not sound possible  alton nodded  no he said  still one gets taught up there in the bush that theres more in a man than what some folks think of as his reason  well we made a tough fight and were beaten  miss deringham glanced at him covertly and noticing his quiet bronzed face steady eyes and big brown hands felt that the struggle had been very grim and stubborn  so you gave it up she said  yes said alton for a time and i had my hands full with other things when jimmy went back again  he had piled up a few dollars and left the woman behind him  he took the trail with a good outfit and a packhorse but he didnt come down again and when mrs jimmy got anxious i went up to look for him  it was a good while before i found him sitting under a pine and he had found the silver though it wasnt much use to him  was it a rich vein said the girl  yes said alton solemnly i think it was from the specimens he had brought along but and its difficult sometimes to see why things should happen that way he couldnt tell me where it was  jimmy was dead you see  the girl shivered visibly  it must have been horrible  no said alton gravely  he was sitting there very quiet in the snow with his hand frozen on the rifle and there was a big dead panther not far away but i was more sorry for mrs jimmy than i was for him jimmy hadnt always been a trailchopper and one could see he had been carrying a heavy load he brought out from the old country  i think he was tired  and the silver still lies hidden up there said miss deringham  alton nodded  yes he said  ive hunted for it twice but couldnt find jimmys trail  by and by and because the woman wants it im going back again  but it would belong to anybody who found it now said miss deringham  no said alton quietly  a half of what i get there belongs to mrs jimmy  the dead man has a claim  i am not sure that most men would think so  you are generous said the girl  no said alton  im just where i can and it hurts me to owe anybody anything whether its a favour or the other thing  miss deringham understood him and reflected as she glanced at him out of the corners of her eyes that her father would do well if he dealt openly with this man  she fancied he could be remorseless in a reckoning and she had now and then of late had unpleasant suspicions respecting deringhams intentions concerning him  alton took up the paddle and the pair found deringham waiting them when they landed  they crossed the valley together and the girl who had seen little of industrial activity became interested when at her fathers desire they followed alton into the mill  a cloud of pungent smoke hung about it and the steady pounding of an engine jarred through the monotone of the river which was low just then while there was a pleasant fragrance in the opensided building where brawny men moved amidst the whirling dust with the precision of the machines they handled  alice deringham could see with untrained eyes that there was no waste of effort here  the great logs that slid in at one end passed straight forward over the rattling rollers and made no deviation until they went out as planking  silent men and whirring saws whose strident scream changed to a deeper humming as they rent into the great redwood trunks alike did their work with swift efficiency and once more the girl glanced with a little wonder at the man who had organized it all  this appears to be a remarkably welllaidout mill said her father  alton laughed a little  we shall have a bigger one by and by he said  the only thing im proud of is the planer and she cost me a pile of dollars  i had to cut down all round before i could buy the thing and then i pulled her all to pieces and fixed her up myself  alice deringham followed her father towards a big humming machine that was tearing off the surface of the planks fed to it and flinging them out polished into whiteness  alton glanced at it admiringly  yes im proud of that he said  it was a tight fit buying her and now shes saving me dollars every day  then he turned to a stooping man  youre crowding her a little  alice deringham noticed the resentment in the mans face which was not a pleasant one and that in place of relaxing the pressure he seemed to thrust a little more strenuously upon the plank he guided but that was all she saw for the next moment there was a crash and a loud whirring and a cloud of woody dust was flung all over her  alton sprang forward through it and a big leather belt suddenly stopped but the girl could never clearly remember what happened next for the dust still whirled about her  there however appeared to be a brief altercation and as alton moved towards him the other man dropped his hand to his belt  guessing what the action meant alice deringham shrank back with a little shiver and her father appeared to grasp the mans shoulder  alton swayed suddenly sideways and then hurled himself forward while next moment two men fell violently against the wrecked machine  one of them seemed to be helpless in the grasp of the other and staggering clear of the planer they went reeling through the mill  then there was a splash in the river and alton returned alone breathless and somewhat white in face  sorry but there was no other way out of it he said a trifle hoarsely  now ive got to size up the ruin if youll excuse me  deringham turned away with his daughter in time to see a dripping object crawl out on the opposite side of the river  are you still pleased with your tame bear he said ironically  the girl laughed a little though her colour was perhaps a trifle higher than usual  there is a good deal of the beast still unsubdued in him she said  deringham nodded  still he had some provocation and i think he was right  so far as i could follow the discussion the other man meant to question his ability to dismiss him with the pistol  alice deringham said nothing further upon the subject until alton joined them as they sat out on the verandah that night  you are not pleased with me he said  there is nothing to warrant me telling you so and i may have been mistaken said the girl reflectively  no said alton thats the pity but couldnt you remember just now and then that you are friends with me  things of this kind make it a little difficult said miss deringham  well said alton that machine cost me twelve months grim selfdenial and the fellow broke it out of temper because i spoke to him  it was said miss deringham sufficiently exasperating but was the rest justifiable because you were a stronger or bolder man than him  alton laughed a little  you dont understand  i did it because i was afraid said he  now if i hadnt been id have backed that man right into the river without touching him  the girl glanced at him and then lapsed into a ripple of laughter im afraid i must give you up said she  just then deringham came into the verandah and alton turned towards him  its a little difficult to put it as i would like to but im glad it was you  you know what i mean  deringham appeared a trifle embarrassed  im not sure that you are indebted to me at all he said  i only seized his shoulder and you would not have expected me to look on  alton shook his head  i dont think he would have missed if you hadnt done it and i will not forget he said  this thing will always count for a good deal between you and me  he went away and alice deringham glanced at her father with a flush in her face  i did not understand before  the man had a pistol and you took it from him  no said deringham with a curious little laugh  i meant to knock his arm up and am not sure that i did it  it was considering all things a somewhat disinterested action     chapter viii  hallams confederate  it was about the middle of the afternoon of the day following altons affray with the workman when the cook came limping into the verandah of the somasco ranch where deringham leaned cigar in hand against a pillar talking to his daughter  she lay in a hide chair alton had found for her listening more to the drowsy roar of the river than to her father but she lifted her head when the man appeared  he carried a tray whereon were displayed a badly dinted metal teapot of considerable size two large flat cakes of bread a can of condensed milk and a saucer swimming with partially melted butter which had resolved itself into little lumps of whitish grease and a thin golden fluid under the afternoon sun  he laid them on the table and after deftly picking out one or two dead flies from the butter turned to the girl with a grin in which pride was evident though it was apparently meant to be deprecatory  i guess this is the kind of thing you were used to in the old country miss he said  you have only got to tell me if you would fancy a piece of cold pork or other fixings  alice deringham dared not glance at her father who seemed to be gazing fixedly down the valley but her lips quivered a little as she turned towards the man  i do not think we shall want anything else she said with a serenity that cost her an effort though it was excellently assumed  the man limped away with the tray though he stopped again at the foot of the stairway  if you take a notion of that pork after all hammer on the iron roofing sheet there and ill bring it right away he said  alice deringham waited until he was out of sight and then lay back in her chair and laughed when her father glanced at her with a little grim smile  savages my dear he said  still their intentions are evidently kindly which is unfortunate because it involves us in a difficulty  a difficulty  deringham nodded  i have a suspicion that our estimable kinsman who seems to consider that what is good enough for somasco should content anybody might be offended if we slighted his hospitality and that teapot apparently contains at least three pints of strong green tea he said  i do not know whether you feel equal to consuming half of it but if it is the same as i had at breakfast i must be excused  one could also fancy from their solidity that those cups had been intended for breaking stones with  i can at least pour the tea over the balustrade said the girl  it is the bread that presents the difficulty  it would crumble in your pocket and you will presumably have to eat a little to save appearances  deringham made a gesture of resignation  on condition that you do as much  i am not going to be the only victim though i fancy you could not crumble that bread in a stamp battery  this meal and what we have otherwise seen at somasco confirms my theory that the folks who make money in the colonies could save as much or more in england if they lived in a similar fashion  would it be worth while asked the girl with a little smile  it is a question of temperament said deringham  personally i do not think it would  indeed one could fancy that a man of taste would sooner be interred decently which is why i will take a very little of the tea  you see our mode of life in england unfortunately depends to some extent upon my retaining the good will of mr alton of somasco he will however have to excuse me from tasting his butter  the girl poured a little of the tea into the cups and then emptied the pot over the balustrade which was as it happened a blunder because while she endeavoured to crumble a small portion of the bread so as to convey the impression that she had been eating it alton and seaforth came into the verandah  the latter glanced at her and for he could not help it a little smile flickered in his eyes  it is a very long while since i had afternoon tea and i am not sure that harry ever indulged in it in his life he said  i will bring some more cups if you will give us some  deringham looked at his daughter reproachfully though his eyes twinkled and for just a moment a flush crept into the girls face but she laughed as she said then i must trouble to ask the cook for more water  alton hammered upon the suspended iron sheet and in a minute or two the cook appeared again with a large plateful of sliced pork which he laid down before miss deringham  i was figuring you would change your mind and if you want any more you have only to ask for it he said  it cost the girl an effort to repress a shiver of disgust but though she succeeded alton saw her face and she noticed that the bronze grew a trifle darker in his forehead  it seemed that he guessed her thoughts but the fact that he offered no explanation and made no excuse for the uninviting fare pleased her  she fancied she understood his reticence and that it became him  take that pork away and bring more water he said and there was a faint ring in his voice as he turned to the cook  the man who took up the teapot shook it and then as though still incredulous lifted the lid and gazed inside it  more water he said  yes said alton a trifle harshly  get it right now  the man went away and there was for almost a minute a somewhat unpleasant silence  even seaforth did not seem to know what to say though he felt an absurd desire to laugh and alice deringham was at once relieved and somewhat astonished when alton put an end to it by a whimsical story of a raw englishmans camp cookery  seaforth followed it with a better one and the whole four were laughing when the cook came back again  he smiled at them reassuringly as he put the teapot down  i guess theres enough this time he said  its that full i could scarcely get the lid on  the tea was strong and acrid with the sting of the wood smoke but there was no avoiding another cupful and deringham drank determinedly while his daughter felt that she had made full atonement when she set her cup down half empty  then alton who explained that he had something to attend to went away and seaforth smiled at the girl when deringham went in for another cigar  i wonder if one might venture to congratulate you on your resolution he said  if i knew exactly what you meant i could answer more readily said alice deringham  well said seaforth reflectively i fancy you do and if its any comfort to you i think harry does too  he is considerably less of a fool than folks who do not understand this country might suppose him to be but the point is that if he can prevent it you will not suffer an infliction of this kind again  i wonder why you thought it worth while to tell me said alice deringham  have i admitted that it was an affliction or do you suppose i am very frightened of a little indifferent tea  seaforth laughed  i cant fancy you so fond of it as the cook seems to conclude and i dont think indifferent was exactly the word  a stronger one would have been appropriate  still though i am not sure that you will understand me i told you because i felt it was due to harry  you see his attitude was really the correct one and taking him all round i am rather proud of him  hasnt that an appearance of unnecessary patronage asked miss deringham who was slightly nettled  seaforth nodded  it has he said  only that the feeling is shared by everybody in this district it would be sheer presumption  good wine you know needs no bush  he went away because he had a suspicion that alton would be wanting him which was borne out when he found his comrade saddling a horse  where are you going harry  we are not half way through with the sawlogs he said  no said alton dryly  still if you work hard enough you and tom should get them into the water before its dark tonight  im going right down to hortons  seaforth laughed  i thought you would  horton has however as much taste in china as the average mule  dont leave it to him  how did you guess that and alton stared at him  that said seaforth was delightfully simple  it is a little more difficult to decide what miss deringham who is a quickwitted young woman did with the tea  as you are quite aware she did not drink it still that is not the question  ill write you out a little list of what is wantedi used to know a little about china once you see and you tell horton to send it on to vancouver  how much would you care to spend harry  just whatever is necessary but get the best said alton  write another list of cakes and jellies and things of that kind too  put down plenty  seaforth returned by the time the horse was saddled with an envelope and alton who took it rode out at a gallop for it was a long way to the settlement and the evenings at the ranch had of late become very pleasant to him  he did not wish to lose a minute of one of them  he drew bridle however when he came up with two men standing in the narrow trail one of whom signed to him  he was a small rancher but it was not until the impatient horse plunged that alton recognized the other who moved aside as the man he had thrown into the river  the rancher saw the glance that passed between them  hallo he said  then you two had trouble when you split  now damer was telling me hed got kind of tired of saw milling  alton laughed  thats quite likely he said  he showed it by breaking up my planer in a fit of temper and i fired him  then he touched the horse with his heel and damers gaze grew venomous as he watched him ride away down the shadowy trail  the rancher evidently noticed it  now i begin to understand how you got your jacket tore up and that lump on your forehead he said  i wasnt quite sure about your tale anyway and if harry fired you it was for something mean  youll get no horse from me  the other man said nothing as he turned away but his face was not pleasant as he plodded down the trail and those words of altons were to cost him dear for if damer had obtained the horse he wanted to carry him to the railroad he would in all probability have left the country which would have prevented a good deal of trouble  as it was however he restrapped the roll of blankets on his back and trudged on with bitterness in his heart under the heat of the afternoon  he had when he left the somasco mill headed in the direction of the tyee mine and passed the night in the woods but with the morning reflection came and he had doubled on his trail and was then making for the railroad stiff with fatigue  each time he stumbled into a rut and the jolt shook him he remembered his last grievance against alton who had sent him on foot and his frame of mind was not an enviable one when he limped into sight of the settlement as dusk was closing down  he had made a long journey that day and a good deal depended on the fact that he was weary and his boots galled him because it had been his intention to push on to a ranch beyond the settlement before he slept and hire a horse there  damer was not especially sensitive but he felt no great desire to encounter the badinage of the men generally to be found about the store who he surmised would have heard by this time what had happened at the somasco mill  still he was hungry and weary and stopped a moment when he caught a blink of light between the trees  the bush behind him was very black and still the dampness of the dew was on his dusty garments and he shivered a little in the faint cold breeze that came down from the snow  then more lights twinkled into brightness a cheerful murmur of voices and a burst of laughter came out of the shadows and the glow that broke out from the windows of hortons store seemed curiously inviting  damer however dallied still and fumbled for his tobacco  he would sit down where he was and smoke he said and then attempt that last toilsome league  as it happened he could not find the tobacco and having a hazy recollection of laying it on the ground the last time he filled his pipe he shook his aching shoulders and trudged on  the loss of the tobacco decided him and with a malediction on alton he made for hortons  it was also a fateful decision with farreaching results he made just then  supper had long been cleared away when he entered the general room of the hotel and then stopped a moment with his hand on the door for the one man who sat under the big lamp was the last person he desired to meet  he had however some papers spread out in front of him and damer decided to slip away quietly but as he moved the blankets on his shoulders struck the door which rattled and the man looked up sharply  he had a fleshy face and black beady eyes which he fixed on damer who stood still with a little unpleasant smile  come right in he said  damer smothered an anathema as he recognized the command in the tone no he said  if you dont mind mr hallam ill be getting on again  come in said hallam a trifle more sharply but for just a moment damer remained motionless  a few steps would take him down the verandah stairway and then the shadowy bush lay before him  had he had a horse he would have obeyed the impulse which prompted him to avoid the encounter but as it happened owing to the fact that alton had met the rancher who would otherwise have lent him one he had none so with evident unwillingness he came slowly forward and dropping his bundles on the floor flung himself into a chair  well he said im here  hallam who had been watching him nodded reflectively  i guess you didnt expect to find me or you wouldnt have come he said  where were you going  to the railroad said damer  out of the country  without telling me  that was kind of foolish of you  still you havent much sense anyway  you had quite a wellpaid job at somasco  well said damer dryly i havent got it now  hallam laughed though the glint in his eyes did not express good will you have got a temper that will be the ruin of you and dont know when a mans too big for you while now i come to look at you theres a lump on your forehead that makes the thing quite plain  you have been fooling with alton and he has most pounded the life out of you still what do you want to leave the country for anyway  damer set his lips and drummed with his fingers on the table  then he made a little deprecatory gesture and glanced at hallam  youll hear it all by and by but theres one point where youre wrong he said  now im not scared too easily but i kind of feel it in me ill make nothing but trouble for myself by worrying alton still its not the man himself im afraid of  ive met tougher ones and come out ahead of them  hallam sat silent a moment for he knew the prospectors and survey packers who passed their lives amidst the desolate ranges and in the shadowy bush and their superstitions  you have had trouble with him before he said  yes said damer i have  he cut my partner down with an axe back there in washington  it was in the big rush in the baker foothills and we had a hard crowd standing in with us but i had to pull out and alton and another man made most of five thousand dollars out of the claim i left  the bluebird said hallam reflectively  i remember that rush alton did himself well  wasnt there a man called nailer mixed up in the affair  there was said damer who seemed to shiver a little  he was my partner  wed have had the claim and alton wouldnt have worried anybody again if nailer had kept his nerve that night  something went wrong with the spring of his winchesterand alton didnt give him another chance  the silence that followed was somewhat impressive  hallam was trying to remember what he had read about the affray in question in a tacoma paper while damer once more saw in fancy a man spring halfdressed through the wisp of smoke that drifted about a little tent  he remembered with an unpleasant distinctness the crash of the rifle shot that rang amidst the shadowy pines and the grim face of the man who whirled an axe that glinted in the moonlight about his head  he saw the flash of its descentand then brushing the memories from him stretched out a hand that shook a little towards the whisky on the table  well he said i owe alton a good deal and thats why i went up to somasco when you told me but he has been too much for me again and now i feel it in me that if im wise ill let that man alone  he drank a little whisky and sat still staring vacantly before him with a vague apprehension in his eyes while the strained tenseness of his expression and attitude was not without its effect on hallam and it was unfortunate he did not yield to the impulse which prompted him to let damer go  he however shook off the fancy with a little impatient laugh  its not going to suit me to have you slipping out of the country he said  i want you right here though it would be quite easy to find a man with twice the grit you have in you  you let alton whip you off your claim in washington andfor ive a notion of what has happenedmost pound the head off you yesterday  now you want to light out leaving him to laugh at you  damer flushed a little and a look of vindictive malice crept into his eyes as he rose  thats about enough he said  youre quite a different man from alton  im going on  sit down said hallam sharply  im quite as dangerous to you  take some more whisky and listen to me though i didnt think it would be necessary to go into the thing again  i was with the men who found gordon at the bottom of his shaft on the quatchigan  damer appeared irresolute but he sat down  nobody knows how he got there  no  well i have a notion and i guess tom winstanley and one other man could tell  winstanleys dead  hallam laughed  still the other man is on my payroll but where you cant get at him unless i want you to  now are you going to gain anything by kicking against me  damer was evidently astonished and sat for almost a minute as though lost in reflection  then he made a little gesture as one who abandons a struggle  i guess that takes me  what do you want he said  nothing very much in the meanwhile  theyll start you rockdrilling at the tyee but its quite likely ill send you up into the ranges prospecting by and by  still i dont want any of the folks down here to know youre with me and youll start out by the railroad trail tomorrow and wait at the lake until i come up with you  theres somebody coming now  damer moved abruptly for there was a step on the stairway and as he reached the verandah a man brushed past him  he stopped and for a moment damer and alton stood face to face  the latter however passed on and swept his glance round the room seeing only a man he did not recognize sitting at the opposite end with his back to him  then he swung round again and went down the stairway shouting horton until a man came out from a shed at the back of the store  well he said im here  you neednt raise the whole place harry  alton laughed  ive been up to grantlys and hes going in to the railroad tomorrow  you can send that order for the crockery along with him  dollars are no object so long as its pretty  the tea is to be the best they keep in vancouver too  he swung himself into the saddle and shook the bridle while damer leaned on the verandah balustrade gazing up the dusky trail he had taken until the last faint beat of horsehoofs sank into the silence of the bush  it was now very black and solemn but away beyond it the snow still shone faintly cold and white against the sky and once more damer shivered a little as he turned towards the lighted store  he had meant to leave the country but fate had been too strong for him and remembering what hallam had told him about the prospecting he wondered if he and alton would meet again under that cold gleam of snow amidst the great desolation of the ranges     chapter ix  miss deringham feels slighted  the morning was still and almost unpleasantly warm but miss deringham looked very fresh and cool in her long white dress as she lay in a deerhide chair on the verandah of the somasco ranch  she had hung her hat on the back of the chair and a shaft of sunlight called up an answering brightness from the coils of lustrous hair  one foot in the scantiest form of slipper rested on the lowest rail of the balustrade and she had slightly curled herself up in the chair in a fashion which implied a languid content with her surroundings and that there was no longer any need for ceremony between herself and her companion  it is possible that miss deringham was aware of this even if she had not intended to convey that impression  alton who now wore a new jean jacket buttoned right up to the neck leaned against a pillar answering the questions of the girl who glanced at him with a smile occasionally  he had as usual a good deal to do that day and now and then turned his eyes towards the sun as though noticing its height above the cedars which did not of course escape miss deringhams attention  still he lingered upon the verandah and what she deduced from this was not unpleasant to the girl  though it still returned at increasing intervals she had almost forgotten her antipathy to the man and the fact that he was rapidly yielding to her refining and sometimes chastening influence was indirectly flattering  miss deringham experienced the more gratification in using it because he was quickwitted and a veiled rebuke would bring a little darker colour into his sundarkened face and she could forgive his offences which were indeed not frequent for the sake of his penitence  you have been very patient she said at length  no said alton with a twinkle in his eyes i dont think that is a thing anybody could bring up against me  still said the girl you have been an hour here talking to me when you must have been dying to get away  alton laughed and miss deringham found something pleasant in his naive directness  now thats not fair  if i had been i should have gone said he  it would please me to stay right here and talk to you all day  miss deringham shook her head reproachfully  one should imply such things and not put them into words  still i scarcely think you will much longer have an opportunity  we are going on to vancouver very shortly  altons face grew clouded  why he said  the girl laughed softly  we have inconvenienced mrs margery a good deal already and it is evident that we cannot stay here for ever  alton moved abruptly and his companion fancied she heard a stifled sigh  no he said gravely  its a pity but you could wait for another month or two  alice deringham smiled a little  you and charley will miss us then  alton nodded gravely but there was a subdued brightness in his eyes and the girl wished he would open them fully  she fancied he was putting considerable restraint upon himself  i dont know about charley  he can talk better than i can for himself but i shall miss you all the time he said  this has been a revelation to me and i feel that it is good for me to talk to you  then before you came i had a kind of bitter feeling against all my fathers folks in england i figured they were wrapped up in their castiron pride and ready to trample on anybody who got in their way but you have started me thinking differently and it seems my duty to know more of them  after all i am an alton of carnaby  the girl smiled again  you fancy you may have been wrong  the mans face flushed a little and there was once more evidence of the selfrestraint  yes he said simply  i know i was a fool  he might have said a good deal more and lessened the effect for miss deringham had seen his face and read the respect in it  its sincerity touched her and she felt with a vague uneasiness that it would not be pleasant to face his contempt if he found it misplaced  and yet you take your fathers part he said  of course said alton simply  what would any son do  but it seems to me there might be a little allowance for my grandfather too and i think he and my father have fixed up that quarrel long ago  they are both dead said the girl with a little curiosity  yes said alton and they kept their word and died unyielding well i think they were each right from their way of looking at the thing and that being so they could only do what they did and would respect each other for it when they meet where the long trail ends  my father was right in holding to the woman who loved him and i think tristan alton knew it when he left carnaby to me  miss deringham seemed thoughtful  the mans grim code of honour inflexible as it was primitive caused her for no apparent reason indefinite misgivings and she made a little gesture of weariness  i think she said it would be better if we did not talk of carnaby and i was wondering if it would be possible to catch a trout if there is a little more wind presently  this was scarcely a correct rendering of her thoughts for she was in reality desirous of ascertaining whether the man would to afford her pleasure thrust his work aside  well he said eagerly i shouldnt wonder if it would  now theres the planer to fix up but that could wait a little andbut heres someone coming  miss deringham was conscious of a trace of annoyance when a girl rode out of the orchard on a wiry little pony  she was dressed neatly and rode well though the somewhat scanty skirt was evidently not the work of a habitmaker and had seen lengthy service while the plain straw hat could not at the limit have cost more than a dollar nor did she wear any gloves and her hands were brown while her face betokened exposure to frost and wind and sun  it was however a comely face and miss deringham noticed that the girl carried herself gracefully  it was also curious that she was not wholly pleased when alton went forward to greet the newcomer with his hat in his hand and she fancied offered more assistance than was absolutely necessary in helping her down then they entered the verandah together and alice deringham smiled in a fashion which did not pledge her to any extreme goodwill when alton presented the stranger  miss townshead from the ranch back yonder he said  miss deringham said something of no importance and waited with slightly unusual curiosity for the girls answer which somewhat astonished her  the voice was nicely modulated and the intonation free from western harshness and unmistakably english  you will come over and see us  it is a long time since we had a visit from anybody from england she said  are you pleased with this country  miss deringham glanced at alton  i grow almost enthusiastic about it at times she said  its inhabitants are also especially kind  the man did not however respond as he might have done  its a tolerably good country he said gravely and then glanced at the stranger  nothing wrong at the ranch i hope miss nellie  no said the girl  we have however heard that jack is seriously ill and i rode over because the spotted steer has broken away and i found the trail led into the somasco valley  it was one of the beasts father was sending down to sell  alton became suddenly intent  then it has not gone far  i saw its trail an hour ago he said  well we must head the beast off before it gets into the thick timber under the range and theres no time to lose  ill be ready in two minutes  would you like to follow with charley miss deringham  the time had scarcely been exceeded when he led a horse out of the stable held his hand out for miss townshead to mount by and then swung himself to the saddle  then he and the girl swung across the clearing at a gallop and alice deringham endeavoured to assure herself that she was not angry  it appeared that her angling was of considerably less importance than the capture of the steer  it was possibly for this reason that she was unusually gracious to seaforth who came along just then and though evidently in some haste stopped to talk to her while when she had promised to accompany him to witness the chase and he strode away towards the stable her father sauntered out of the house and glanced in her direction whimsically  it occurs to me that one of us is responsible for some irregularity in the work upon this ranch and that the beast it a trifle uncertain in his moods said he  it is said his daughter a little difficult to understand you  deringham pointed to the two mounted figures just entering the brush and the girl fancied that something had ruffled him  he could be unpleasant when that happened  alton of somasco is a somewhat busy man but both he and his partner seem to have suspended their energies this morning he said  no doubt wildbeast taming has its fascination but one might fancy it was apt to prove a somewhat disconcerting and perilous amusement  yes said the girl in a tone of languid inquiry  deringham nodded  one can never tell when the beast may revert to his primitive instincts and do something unpleasant he said  this one is also evidently of somewhat uncertain temperament  we are told that una had a lion but the effect of the story would have been diminished if it had been recorded that the king of the forest divided his allegiance  miss deringham was now convinced that her father was not pleased  i have not noticed anything especially leonine about mr seaforth she said  no said deringham dryly  the honourable charley appears to be an admirable young man of the domestic feline species but i dont know of any reason that would make it advisable to waste powder and shot over him  miss deringham rose languidly but her father felt he had gone as far as was desirable and went back to grapple with a financial difficulty from which he could see only one escape while she rode away with seaforth who led out the horse reserved for her use  alice deringham could ride but when they left the clearing and plunged into the bush she found that all she had been taught in england was not much use in british columbia  there was no perceptible trail and the horses floundered round great fallen trees and plunged smashing through thickets of black raspberry and barberry  in places their flanks were brushed by tall blackstemmed fern and where the forest was more open treacherous gravel slipped beneath the hoofs that sank from sight amidst the bloodred clusters of the little wineberry  after an hour of it the girl was shaken and breathless and she contemplated her habit somewhat ruefully when seaforth drew bridle  somewhere far up on a hill shoulder there was a smashing in the bush  are you sure you have not lost the way she said  it seems impossible for horses or cattle to get through this forest  seaforth laughed  the bush is really thin here he said  anybody used to it could get through at a gallop while a good bushman could scarcely make five miles a day walking where its tolerably thick  i wonder if you know that the ox was originally a denizen of the bush  i didnt until harry told me  it always seemed to me a tranquil beast adapted for sober locomotion on nice green grass  and isnt it said the girl with indifference in her eyes  mr alton is an authority on cattle  harry said seaforth smiling is although one might not always fancy so a complete encyclopaedia on everything useful  anyway from the sound up yonder you will presently see some of the primitive habits of the genus bos and the spectacle may be the more interesting because the beast will if possible head away up that valley into fastnesses where only a prehistoric man with a tail could follow it  alice deringham said nothing further and was glad of the rest  they had pulled their horses up on the slope of a hill which formed one side of a hollow out of which several valleys opened  there were great trees about them and it was only here and there a ray of sunlight pierced the dim green shadow while below them a stream went frothing down a miniature canon whose banks were cumbered by fallen timber  it was the girl fancied an especially difficult place for a horseman to pick his way through  meanwhile the sound above grew louder and presently an object apparently travelling like a thunderbolt came out of the shadow  it was notwithstanding the speed it made gambolling playfully with head tossed sideways and tail in the air and when miss deringham fancied it must turn aside for a tangled brake went smashing straight through it as it emerged with an exultant flourish of head and tail two other objects became visible behind it and seaforth pushed forward when the mounted figures came sweeping down the mountain side  here and there they swung wide round a fallen tree but they rode straight through raspberrycanes and breasthigh fern and alice deringham wondered when she saw that one of them was a girl  she had left her hat somewhere in the bush her hair streamed about her the skirt was blown aside but she held on with set lips and two vivid spots of colour in her warmtinted face a length or two behind her companion  he was riding hard and there was a red smear across his face where a branch had smote him  miss deringham turned to watch them realizing that whatever the steer risked its pursuers were in peril of life and limb  sometimes one horse rose above fern and thicket or twisted apparently with the sinuosity of a snake in and out amidst the clustered trunks while once the girl lurched forward  miss deringham gasped but part of the fluttering skirt was rent away and the little lithe figure swept on again  the pair were it was evident closing with the steer and the latter apparently cut off from the valley it made for by the ravine this was not however to prove an insuperable obstacle for as miss deringham with difficulty edged her horse nearer the beast charged straight at the hollow and dropped into it  then while she regarded its capture as certain it rose into view again and floundered up the almost vertical slope on the other side with no very obvious difficulty  miss deringham who found this riding down of a canadian steer almost as exciting as anything she had seen when following the english hounds regretted that the ravine with its fringe of undergrowth and litter of netted branches must apparently put a stop to the pursuit  though the width was not great no horse she fancied would be expected to face it and she watched the two figures flitting amidst the trunks to see when they would pull up  there was however no sign that they intended to do so and miss deringham gasped a little when alton glanced for a moment over his shoulder  pull him his voice reached her hoarsely and she held her breath as she saw the mans hand move on the bridle and his heels pressed home the horse swung clear of the thicket plunged with head down flung it up and straightened itself again there was a drumming of hoofs and man and beast had shot forward from the bank  it seemed an appreciable time before they came down amidst the fern and then miss deringham drew in her breath with a little sibilant sigh  oh she said softly and there was a great smashing as man and beast reeled through a brake on the other side  yes said seaforth it was a tolerably risky thing but it takes a good deal to turn harry  wheres nellie townshead now  there said miss deringham instinctively clenching her bridle surely the girl cannot be going to try it  good lord said seaforth under his breath and the second figure rushed with streaming skirt and hair at the gap cleared by altons passage  then the man turned his head and it was a moment before he looked round again very white in face  thank heaven he said hoarsely shes over  miss deringham glanced at him curiously and then laughed a little miss townshead is evidently a determined young woman she said with something in her manner which led seaforth to fancy that this was not intended as a compliment  but what is mr alton doing  getting the rope ready said seaforth  its scarcely used in this country but harry once did some stockriding on the prairie  well push on a little  it became evident as they did so that the position favoured the pursuers now  a rock it was apparently incapable of climbing prevented the flight of the steer in one direction and miss townshead had ridden forward ready to turn the beast if it attempted escape in another  it stopped with lowered head as though meditating an onslaught upon her then wheeled again and came back towards alton who rose a trifle in his stirrups whirling the rope about his head  it shot forward presently uncoiling in a curve and then the man swung backwards wheeling his horse and there was a crash as the steer went down amidst the fern  that should take a good deal of the friskiness out of it said seaforth  well go across and join them  theres a way over somewhere  the steer was roped to a tree when they came up with the pair and seaforth noticed with some inward amusement the way in which the two girls glanced at each other and the contrast between them  miss deringham was almost too serene and he fancied might have stepped out of a picture  miss townsheads cheeks were crimson her skirt was rent and though she had evidently found opportunity to effect some alteration loose wisps of hair still hung about her shoulders  they were however of a fine silky brown and it seemed to seaforth might have been arranged in a more unbecoming fashion  i wonder if i might venture to congratulate you  we seldom witness horsemanship of this description in england said miss deringham with an inflection in her voice which seaforth guessed the meaning of and seemed to bring a slightly warmer tinge into the already carmine cheeks of the girl  still she looked at the speaker with a little smile  there is a difference between the two countries and the scarcity of dollars in this one explains a good deal she said  alton glanced at both of them with a slightly bewildered expression of course said he  the things quite simple  that steer is worth so many dollars to miss townsheads father and he couldnt afford to lose them  alice deringham turned aside with a just perceptible gesture of impatience which seaforth noticed and fancied he understood though it was not apparent to the others and while she rode on with him alton appeared thoughtful as he did something to his bridle  when he had finished it he saw that his companion was smiling at him  it seems to me there are a good many things i dont know said he  of course said the girl lightly  still i dont think i would worry over them if i were you  they are very trivial  alton nodded sagely and odd fragments of his conversation reached miss deringham  well send someone back for the steer he said  jacks no better  no said the girl with a little quiver in her voice  i am afraid the work is too hard for him up there  alton seemed thoughtful  i wonder if he would come down and do something for me he said  i could find a use for another man or two you see  again the little flush of crimson crept into miss townsheads cheeks i dont think so he seems to fancy he can get into the cpr service when he is better  well said alton im going to take a liberty  jack wouldnt have gone up yonder if you hadnt wanted the dollars  nellie townshead looked down a moment then swiftly raised her head and though her fingers seemed to tighten on the bridle there was a curious steadiness in her eyes  there is she said no use in denying what everybody knows  alton nodded  i know that kind of worry and its a bad one  has hallam got a hold upon the ranch  miss townshead appeared astonished and did not answer for a moment i fancied you did not know but he has she said  he came up to see my father a week ago and that is why we are selling the stock  altons face darkened  that mans of the same breed as the panther only the panther lets up when hes full  well you neednt tell me any more  interests high in this country but its a pity your father  he stopped a moment and appeared a trifle embarrassed when the girl regarded him with a little flash in her eyes  my father has done his best she said  of course said alton hastily  well now hallam wants your ranch and when that man wants a thing its bad to keep him from getting it but it wouldnt please me to see him take the ranch  i wonder if you can figure what his next move will be  the girls fingers trembled but there was patience and courage in her eyes  i am afraid i can said she  we shall be sold up and driven out very shortly  alton shook his head  i wouldnt count too much on that  hallams bad all through but there are one or two other men who will have a finger in whats going to be made out of this country and it would be a favour if when he shuts down on you you send word to me  the girl did not look at the man but rode silent for a while  i think i understand you and you are very kindbut it is impossible  no said alton grimly  you dont understand me  theres not room enough up here for hallam and me and ive a deal to square off with him already  now when you get your notice you will send word to me  yes said the girl as one making a swift decision and there was a sudden flash of hope in her eyes  that is a bargain said alton with the little soft laugh of his then when the deals fixed up all the winnings will not be counted over by mr hallam  miss deringham heard nothing further and understood very little of what had reached her while though unusually gracious to seaforth she found him distinctly unresponsive  she however lent miss townshead a hat when they reached the ranch and made no comment when seaforth rode home with her  it was late that night when the latter found alton smoking in a somewhat dubious mood upon the verandah  is there anything worrying you said he  oh yes said alton grimly  theres work of all kinds waiting and nothing done today  somehow women seem to play the devil with a mans plans charley  yes said seaforth they not infrequently do  well said alton i wouldnt mind so much if id pleased anybody but i havent you see  i was talking at large about something after wed got the steer when miss nellie turned right round on me  then i came back here and miss deringham didnt seem pleased with me  did she tell you so said seaforth smiling and alton turned upon him savagely  no sir she did not said he  anyway it wasnt necessary  you understand these folks from the old country charley  it is said seaforth dryly a tolerably bold venture to assert that one understands anybody  well said alton you know what i mean  now do you think miss deringham was vexed because she didnt get that fishing  you see she is tolerably keen on it  of course if i had thought of it i might have sent you with her  no said seaforth smiling  i should scarcely fancy that was the reason and i dont fancy the arrangement suggested would have given miss deringham any great pleasure  nor do i think i should have gone  no said alton inquiringly  no said seaforth dryly  im not alton of somascoand carnabyyou see  alton regarded him sternly out of halfclosed eyes  there are jokes that dont please me charley he said and then laughed softly  im a fool with a redhot temper but its a consolation that i know a bigger one than me  you need not be bashful harry  you mean me  alton nodded as he turned upon his heel and seaforth watched him meditatively  i wish i was as sure of it as you seem to be said he well im occasionally thankful im not a rich man nor much of a beauty     chapter x  the undelivered message  the afternoon was slipping by when some time after the capture of the steer alice deringham sat waiting for alton under a big fir  he had promised to take her out upon the lake and the little breeze that stirred the cedars to drowsy music would she knew ripple the shining surface and render the capture of a big trout the less problematical the trout of british columbia are also at least equal to those of england in their faculties of discrimination and observation and during the listless autumn days miss deringhams angling had not been especially successful  still though she not infrequently returned with an empty basket the girl apparently retained an enthusiasm for it she had not always displayed at home  the lake she declared was beautiful and this was beyond contravention while even when no splash disturbed its mirrorlike shining she found it pleasant to slide across its black depths in a light canoe  she knew and so did alton that under those conditions the silver and vermilion lure would have been quite as useful in the bottom of the craft but the man usually seemed too content to lazily dip the paddle while the girl would lead him on to talk with judicious questions alton could on occasion talk well displaying a vigour and freshness of thought which at the commencement had slightly astonished his companion who found a curious pleasure in sounding this and that depth of his nature  as a rule he responded readily and she was conscious of the same sense of power that a master of the organ might feel as his fingers touched the stops and keys  alton had lived simply in close touch with nature and though he had read much his thoughts had something of the pristine purity and vigour of the land he dwelt in and were in a fashion musical but now and then the girl venturing overfar chanced upon a chord that rang harsh and discordant and shrinking a little recognized she fancied the undertone of primitive barbarity  on the afternoon in question she was however slightly angry with him he had fixed no special time but she had waited some while and alice deringham preferred that other people should wait for her  she had also taken some pains with her toilet and though her attire was neat in place of ornate its simplicity was the result of lavish expenditure and artistic selection  to some extent and so far as she could ascertain it it was also in accordance with the taste of the man who was to accompany her  it was very still  nobody moved in the clearing though from beyond it rose the faint humming of saws and the little breeze was heavy with a resinous fragrance  the loghouse was silent save for an occasional clatter from the kitchen where mrs margery was apparently busy alice deringham did not like mrs margery and had reason to believe the latter returned the feeling though she had noticed that the somewhat grim old lady had a smile that was almost gentle for rancher townsheads daughter  presently the rattle of plates also ceased and the girl found the silence exasperating  the time was slipping by and there was still no sign of alton  at last however there was a thud of horsehoofs in the orchard and a man rode out from among the trees but miss deringham who had risen with a smile shut the fingers of one hand a trifle viciously when she saw that it was not alton  the man sat loosely in his saddle and his face was a trifle flushed when he pulled the horse up  is harry alton anywhere around miss he said and the girl noticed that his voice was uneven  he may be here presently she said  i dont know where he is  ive a long way to ride and cant wait for him said the man swaying a little as he gathered up the bridle  there seems to be nobody around the place and when he comes you might tell him to go up to townsheads as soon as he can  miss nellies wanting to see him and its thursday  thursday said miss deringham  yes said the man  harry will understand  there was some more about it but ive forgotten it  well youll tell him  i must be getting on  he lurched when the horse started and though most men are abstemious in that country alice deringham decided that he was under the influence of alcohol  she also felt distinctly displeased with him for bringing his message before she and alton had set out for the lake  it was a favourable afternoon for fishing and not pleasant to reflect that her amusement must be deferred at the bidding of the girl from the ranch  then she decided that as alton would not have received the message had he come when she expected him it would not make any great difference if he did not hear it until their return  miss deringham did not remember by what reasoning she arrived at that result but it seemed to her distinctly more fitting that miss townshead should be the one to wait  ten minutes later alton rode up at a gallop  sorry i couldnt come before but i was over at thomsons borrowing a new trolling spoon he said  jimmys too slow for anything and i had to look at a span of oxen hed been buying  it seems to me that leisureliness is a characteristic of the country said the girl  alton glanced at her with a faint twinkle in his eyes  now if you feel vexed with me look at the horse said he  anyway the canoes ready and the lake all rippling and ive one of the new flighthook spoons  miss deringham who saw the spume upon the bit and the horses whitened sides smiled graciously and decided that nellie townsheads message could very well wait until the evening  i will be ready in about five minutes she said  she kept the man waiting twenty possibly because she believed it would be a salutary discipline and was not displeased to notice that he stamped impatiently up and down  then she went down with him to the lake and it was dusk when they returned with several fine trout in the state of content with each other which occasionally characterizes comrades in a successful angling expedition  they had also so much to talk about that miss deringham completely forgot the message and her pleasure was only dissipated when she met her father alone for a minute  his pose expressed dejection and indecision as he came towards her along the verandah  you do not look well she said  that said deringham dryly is quite possible  things are not going well with me just now  business worries said the girl  deringham nodded  and domestic too if the affairs of carnaby come under that heading  in fact i am hemmed in by difficulties i cannot see a way through and to make it worse alton will come to no decision until he has sent somebody over to report upon the property  i have wondered now and then if he was talking altogether at random when he told you that he was willing to give it you  of course said his daughter smiling outwardly to cover her indignation  it would be preposterous to think that i could accept such a favour even if he had the slightest intention of relinquishing his claim  yes said deringham dryly  still i fancy there are young women who would not disdain to be mistress of carnaby  the girl straightened herself a little and the colour crept into her face  do not be foolish father  you cannot fancy that the man was speaking seriously  i dont know said deringham  i am not sure that he does himself and if you do not there is an end of the affair  still if there had been anything in the speech the possibility alluded to would have lifted a great load from me  he said nothing further but passed on leaving the girl standing on the verandah with head bent a trifle and a face that was less cold in colouring than usual  presently however she stood upright suddenly as alton came up the stairway but not before he had seen her  after a swift glance at her he put his hand gently on her shoulder  you are in some trouble  cant you tell me what it is he said  alice deringham could just see his face in the moonlight and it was gravely compassionate but there was in it none of the personal admiration she had sometimes noticed there which had its effect upon her attitude towards him  he was she felt sorry for her because she was a woman menaced by some difficulty and that she should be an object of pity to this bush rancher stung the pride of which she had a good deal  had he tendered his sympathy because she was alice deringham it is possible that she would have told him something though not exactly the simple state of the case  as it was however she shook his hand off and looked at him with a sparkle in her eyes  why should you suppose that and venture to presume upon it she said  would it be presuming  it would said the girl very coldly  then said alton you cant tell me  no of course not  is there any reason why i should  here at least was an opportunity but if the man desired to gain his companions confidence he made an indifferent use of it  we are some kind of relations and you promised to be friends with me he said  miss deringham laughed a little  one seldom tells ones troubles to ones friends she said  alton seemed to sigh  then there is nothing i can do  yes said miss deringham  people are usually best alone when they have to grapple with a difficulty  alton still lingered a moment  if you dont want to tell me i dont know how to make you and im sorry because i might fix the thing up he said gravely  well im going but it hurts me to see anything worrying you and know that somebody else has brought it upon you  how could you know that said the girl  the man smiled a little  its quite simple said he you are too good and kind to bring sorrow upon yourself or anybody  this was much better but it was overlate now and for the girl said nothing he moved away and presently met seaforth as he strode down the trail  hallo said the latter  where are you going harry  i know where you can go said alton grimly and thats right away to the devil  seaforth laughed a little  and thats the womans work  its a pity harry cant distinguish between paste and diamonds said he  it happened about this time that miss townshead sat in an attitude of expectancy in her fathers house  townshead still wearing the red velvet jacket sat in the old leather chair with the resignation of the incapable stamped upon him and the cigar and cup of coffee close by  his attitude seemed to imply that he was a very illused man but had discovered that it was no use protesting  he sipped his coffee delicately and then glanced towards his daughter with a trace of irritation  i wish you could keep still my dear he said  there is an inquietude in your very pose that unsettles me and with a little fortitude one can get used to anything  for instance if anybody had told me five years ago that i could take my afterdinner coffee without a slight flavour of old cognac i should not have believed them  nellie townshead evinced a little impatience  it might be slightly more difficult to dispense with the dinner as well as the coffee and that is what we shall probably have to do presently said she  why did you borrow that money from mr hallam father  any one could have seen that he was a rascal and i believe that mr seaforth warned you  townshead sighed  the difficulty he said is to arrive at a correct decision before one knows what will happen  afterwards it is comparatively easy  it appeared desirable to buy some cattle and that i should visit victoria where i made an unfortunate speculation to recuperate after my last attack  during my absence jack as you will remember lost some of the cattle and mismanaged the ranch  mr seaforth is also a young man who occasionally takes too much upon himself  the girl flushed a little  jack worked from morning to night and if we had spent a few dollars hiring somebody to help him it would have been better for all of us she said  that however is not the question  what are we to do when we are turned out of the ranch as we shall be very shortly  there is said townshead no use in anticipating unpleasant probabilities  we will in the first place go down to vancouver where i fancy you will be able to earn a moderate sum by typewriting  the use of the instrument is i understand readily acquired and while i regret the necessity for a daughter of mine to follow such an occupation the emolument appears to be reasonable  nellie townshead smiled somewhat bitterly for the fact that she had ridden after straying cattle and done a good many things that women do not usually undertake upon the ranch had apparently escaped her fathers attention  but is there anything you could do in vancouver  you have no great knowledge of business she said  townshead smiled wryly  it is he said a pity that i have so much because on the two occasions i took an interest in it i lost a good deal of money  there is nothing for me to do here at least  i cannot chop big trees  no said the girl  but have you nothing in contemplation  townshead shook his head as though he were tired of the subject  no he said resignedly  i have too much regard for my very indifferent health to worry unnecessarily  the girl sighed a little and felt very helpless knowing that the task of maintaining both would devolve upon her and her brother  she was a dutiful daughter but she occasionally found it difficult to maintain her respect for her father  had he been beaten down after a stubborn struggle she would with almost fierce loyalty have been proud of him but townshead who spent most of his time safeguarding his constitution had never fought at all  conflict of any kind jarred upon him  answering nothing she sat still listening until at last a tramp of horsehoofs became audible  somebody was riding that way but there was another ranch farther up the valley and her pulses throbbed when her strained senses told her that the horseman had reached the forking of the trail  if he passed on the blow she shrank from might be suspended a little longer  the man did not however pass by but turned into the home trail and she rose with a little shiver when there was a knocking at the door  a man stood outside it with a horse behind him and a paper in his hand while his dress betrayed him as one from the cities  he was also young and appeared considerably embarrassed but he took off his hat and made the girl a little bow  she flung the door open and stood very straight and still before him  you may come in she said  the stranger glanced at her swiftly and nellie townshead was somewhat astonished to see the blood mantle to his forehead  very sorry but i see you guess who i am he said with a crisp english intonation  i am here towell you understandon behalf of mr hallam but i really wouldnt be if i could help it  you can put your horse in the stable and then i will give you some supper said the girl in a coldly even tone  there is still a little to eat here and you must be hungry  the man appeared dubious and stood still a moment then touched his hat again when he saw the crimson flame higher in the cheeks of the girl  of course he said im going  nellie townshead laughed bitterly  if i had intended to shut you out i should scarcely have asked you in she said  the young man came back in a few minutes and by that time there were a few plates upon the table  he sat down and then stood up once more when he saw the girl standing close by with a tray  you must let me wait upon myself said he  during the course of my last ranching visit they set savage dogs on me and i wouldnt trouble you only that ive ridden fifty miles and am very hungry  the girl seemed to soften for she saw he was talking at random to cover her embarrassment as well as his own  you are an englishman she said  yes said the stranger  im not especially proud of it just now but you see a man must live  townshead looked up from his chair  i fancy that is a slightly mistaken sentiment  some men are better dead and i occasionally feel tempted to include myself in the category  the young man smiled a little  the frenchman put it a trifle more concisely sir he said  townshead nodded  still he was correct  i dont mind admitting that i looked forward to your visit with apprehension but i now fancy you will not jar upon me so much as i expected  the stranger glanced at miss townshead who though she wished to could not quite check a smile  he was very young and had a pleasant face  that was very kind of you he said  now i think the least that i can do is to retire to the barn or stable  i have some blankets and can make myself comfortable  he went out knocking over a cup in his haste and the girl sat still and laughed  there was not a great deal of merriment in her laughter and the tears were close behind it but it was a relief  townshead however watched her disapprovingly  you should he said endeavour to preserve a becoming serenity  nellie townshead became grave again  i fancy it would have been better if we had not displayed so much of it and let things drift but that is not the question now she said  how could any one willing to help us do so father  townshead made a little grimace  are you not suggesting an impossibility  but if there was somebody persisted the girl  what could he do on thursday  i want to understand everything  well said townshead i think this is the position  hallam lent me money which i cannot repay him and he sells us up  incidentally i fancy he has some reason for desiring this ranch and as he has been acquiring a good deal of land lately will get somebody to buy it in very few of our neighbours have any dollars to spare and the price will necessarily be a low one  now if any man with the means to bid against him were here it would put heart into some of the others and run the prices up and in that case hallam would have to hand me over a balance as well as pay a good deal more than he meant to for the ranch  i think that is simple and i believe the manoeuvre has been used with some success in other parts of canada  but said the girl if the man offered more than hallam or his nominee would outbid he would have to take the ranch  townshead nodded agreement  that he said is the difficulty still though i do not think there is any one who would do so much for us i presume you would not have asked the question unless you had something in your mind  the girl who did not answer for a moment stooped and stirred the stove  no she said very slowly  i sent word to mr alton  alton said townshead and sat silent a while  well although i do not altogether approve of him i fancy that if there is anybody in this district able to help us that is the man  there remains the question is he willing  nellie townshead still busied herself at the stove  i think he is she said  townshead straightened himself a trifle in his chair  then i am curious to know why he should be he said  i do not know said the girl who rose and took up the supper dishes still i feel sure that he is  townshead turned towards her  you fancied so a moment or two ago and now you are sure he said  there must be some meaning to this  his daughter looked round and laughed a little holding the tray at a perilous slope  he made me promise to let him know she said  her father shook his head  a young man of mr altons description does not do anything of the kind without a motive he said  now i wonder if there are minerals upon the ranch  the colour crept into his daughters cheeks again  they would in any case belong to the crown she said  can you not believe that the man who packed our provisions in through flooded fords and snow would do anything out of generosity  she turned away and left him and townshead puckered his face dubiously  i should find it very difficult and the care of a daughter is a heavy responsibility he said  miss townshead did not return for some little while but stood above the cedar washingboard scarcely seeing the dishes that once or twice almost slipped from her hand  there was her father had told her one man who could help them in the only way in which assistance could be accepted and she felt sure he would  if rancher alton failed to keep his word she felt it would be very difficult to believe in the honour of his sex again     chapter xi  confidence misplaced  there was sliding mist in the somasco valley and the pines were dripping when alton and miss deringham stood upon a slippery ledge above the river  just there it came down frothing into a deep black pool swung round it whitestreaked and swept on with a hoarse murmur into the gloom of the bush again  a wall of fissured rock overhung the pool on the farther side and a fallen pine wetted with the spray stretched across the outflow and rested on one jagged pinnacle  a wet wind which drove the vapours before it called up wild music from the cedars that loomed through them on the side of the hill  id cast across the rush at the head of the pool and let the fly come down said alton  theres generally a big trout lying in the eddy behind the boulder  the girl nodded and the line sweeping back towards the pines behind her went forward again  it fell lightly amidst the frothing rush and alton smiled approval as he watched the rod point follow it downstream towards a foamlicked rock  it swung to and fro a moment then slid on again towards the still black stretch behind the stone tightened there suddenly and ran tense and straight upstream again while the reel clacked and rattled  a big one said alton quietly  check the winch a little and keep the butt down  he cant face the rapid and youll lose him unless you can keep a strain on when he turns again  the girl flung herself backwards with eyes dilated and a warmth in her cheeks the rod bending above her and the line ripping its way towards the welter at the head of the pool  there it curved inwards a trifle and alton shouted reel  there was a quick rattle something broke the water with a silvery flash and the line was shooting downstream again  let him go unless he makes for the fir yonder said alton quietly  for the space of several minutes the line swept up and down the pool and miss deringham watched it almost breathlessly with fingers on the reel  then it swept straight towards the fallen fir  stop him said alton  its a good trace  keep the butt down  the rod bent further a big silvery body rushed clear of the water and went down again while next moment the line stopped and quivered as it rasped against the fallen fir  miss deringham turned to her companion with a gesture of consternation  oh she said breathlessly  it has gone  i dont know said alton that trace is a good deal thicker than what you use in england  ill see if i can get him  keep your thumb on the reel  he took up a net and clambering along the ledge sprang lightly upon the log  it was sharply rounded the bark was wet and the way along it obstructed by the stakelike ends of tornoff limbs but the man crawled forward foot by foot with the swift whirl of current close beneath him  then he knelt where the tree dipped almost level with the flood and grasping the line with one hand swept the net in and out amidst the brokenoff branches while the girl watching him fancied she could see a bright flash between the splashes  presently he rose again shaking his head with nothing in the net  give me a yard or two when i shout he said  grasping a branch with one hand he lay down on the log and lowered himself until arm and shoulder were in the river  then he sank still further until his head was under too and the girl shivered a little it seemed to her that it would be difficult for even a good swimmer to extricate himself from the tangle of snappedoff branches between the log and the bottom of the river   still the clinging foot and arm were visible above the rush of frothing water  then more of the man came into sight again there was a halfsmothered shout and she loosed the reel while in another moment or two alton swung himself up dripping with part of one hand apparently thrust into a great flapping fishs head  with the back of it pressed gainst his knee he drew the head towards him and the long silvery body became still while the man stood up smiling  fingers were made before nets but i wasnt quite sure of him all the time he said  miss deringham who was flushed and breathless felt very gracious towards her companion just then  it was she realized a somewhat perilous thing he had done to please her and this was gratifying in itself while the knowledge that he had postponed several affairs which demanded his attention was more flattering still  he was also in such surroundings almost admirable as he stood before her bareheaded and dripping the river frothing at his feet and the sliding mists behind him  deerskin jacket and stained and faded jean lean sinewy figure and bronzed face were all in keeping with the spirit of the scene then a voice came out of the bush  hallo harry  are you anywhere around it said  alton answered and miss deringham felt distinctly displeased  she had been about to say something delicately apposite and now seaforth whose company she could have dispensed with stood on the bank above them apparently quietly amused  you seem to be enjoying yourself harry he said  well said alton a trifle curtly you didnt come keeyowling through the bush like a prairie coyote to tell me that  no said seaforth with a sudden change in his voice which miss deringham noticed  theres a man in from the settlement and hallams selling townshead up today according to his tale  alton scrambled swiftly along the log  just one question charley quite sure nobody came here with any message for me about it that you forgot he said  seaforth made a little gesture of impatience and there was a trace of anger in his tone  it is scarcely likely i should have forgotten that he said  then he glanced at miss deringham and was slightly bewildered by what he saw in her face  seaforth had once or twice admired the girls serenity in somewhat difficult surroundings but there was now a suggestion of fear in her eyes and she seemed to avoid altons gaze it however passed in a moment and she turned towards the rancher tranquilly  i wonder how far i am to blame she said  a man came here a day or two ago and apparently endeavoured to tell me something  he was however unintelligible and i fancy somebody had been giving him whisky  mounted said alton  what kind of horse  miss deringham considered for a moment and then possibly deciding that alton would have no difficulty in ascertaining elsewhere told him tom he said grimly  well ill talk to him  youll take miss deringham home charley and then come on to townsheads after me  he swung away into the bush next moment and seaforth followed him more slowly with miss deringham  neither of them spoke but though the mans thoughts were busy with other affairs he noticed that his companion glanced at him covertly  the girl could have told us something more he said to himself and put a stern check on his impatience as he kept pace with her  when they came out into the clearing they heard the thud of hoofs and saw a mounted man send a horse at the tall split fence  the sliprails were up and the fence was unusually well put together but there was a crash as the top bar flew apart and presently the thud of hoofs grew fainter down the firshadowed trail  miss deringham now appeared quite serene again  has he ridden off wet through as he was she said  i expect so said seaforth dryly  harry does not usually let trifles of that kind worry him nor do i think there are many men who would have ridden at that fence  alice deringham said nothing but though she smiled seaforth fancied that she was not pleased  her thoughts were however of small importance to him and he hastened fuming with impatience towards the stables  it was some time later when nellie townshead stood by a window of her fathers ranch  jeanclad stock breeders and axemen hung about the clearing and a little knot of men from the cities stood apart from them  a wagon implements out of repair old sets of harness axes saws and shovels were littered about the front of the house and there were two or three horses and a few poor cattle in the corral  the ranchers spoke slowly to one another and their faces were sombre but hallam who stood amidst the other men was smiling over a big cigar the girl clenched her hands as she watched him and then turning her head looked down the valley  i fancy i hear hoofs  he told me he would come she said but townshead who sat apathetically in the old leather chair shook his head  he has of course forgotten if he did he said  no said the girl with a trace of harshness in her voice  mr alton never forgets a promise  that must be the drumming of hoofs  can you hear nothing  the river said townshead despondently  he will be too late directly  they are putting up the ranch  confidence and dismay seemed to struggle together in the face of the girl but the former rose uppermost for she clung fast to hope  there  oh why can they not stop talking  that is something now she said  no said townshead  only the wind in the firs  the girl leaned forward a little drawing in her breath as she stared down the valley  the voices drowned the sound she fancied she had heard and the colour came and went in her face when she caught one of them  the things no better than robbery  why isnt harry alton or his partner here  nellie townshead had asked herself the same question over and over again that day when rancher and axemen in somewhat embarrassed fashion tendered her their sympathy  what she expected from him she did not quite know but she had a curious confidence in alton and at least as much in his comrade and felt that even if the scheme her father had alluded to was not feasible there would be something they could do then she drew back from the window and sat down with a little shiver as the harsh voice of the auctioneer rose from the clearing  she caught disjointed words and sentences  dont need tell you what the place is worth  you have seen the boundaries  richest soil in the dominion  grow anything  now if i was a rancher  well im waiting for your offer  he apparently waited some little time and then a laugh that expressed bitterness in place of merriment followed the voice of one of the men from the cities  put two hundred dollars on to it said somebody and there was another laugh which the girl recognizing the voice understood for it was known that the bidder had probably not ten dollars in his possession and was in debt at the store  the fact that this man whom she had scarcely spoken to should endeavour to help her while her friends at somasco did nothing also brought a little flash of anger to her eyes  then she told herself that there was time yet and they would come  the voices rose again more rapidly  fifty more  another to me  oh whats the use of fooling  one hundred better  twenty again to me  miss townshead glanced at her father  theyll stop presently said he  the place stands at a third of its value but it would cripple most of them to pay for it if they got it now  the man from vancouver who goes up by twenties will get it at half of what it cost me and i dont think you need watch for rancher alton  still nellie townshead did not quite give up hope  the bidding was only beginning and there was time yet  she had been taught to look beneath the surface in western canada and had cherished a curious respect for rancher alton  the girl was young still and he stood for her as a romantic ideal of the new manhood that was to grow to greatness in the wildest province of the dominion while now and then she fancied she saw something in his comrades face which roused her pity and stirred her to sympathy  that having made it unasked the former should slight a promise of the kind appeared incomprehensible and she felt that if he did so her faith in the type he served as an example of would fall with him  there was also pressing need of some one to look to for guidance in her time of necessity because townshead was not the man to grapple with any difficulty and most of his neighbours knew little or nothing about the cities  father she said in case the purchaser turns us out where shall we go tonight  the stage does not go in to the railroad until a week today and do you think there will be anything left over to keep us for a little in vancouver  townshead glanced at her querulously  somebody will take us in said he  i should have fancied my dear that you would have seen i am sufficiently distressed and unwell today without having to anticipate further difficulties  there will i hope be a balance  what is the bidding now  the girl listened but for a few moments there was a significant silence and her heart sank when a single voice rose  one or two others joined in and there was silence again until the auctioneer repeated the offer  then she turned quivering towards her father  you heard him she said  townshead groaned despondently i am afraid the prospect of a balance is very small he said  again there was a stillness in the clearing until the auctioneers voice rose raucously expostulating  it is really preposterous gentlemen he said  im giving the place away  well ill go ten better said somebody and the girl held her breath  twenty said another man and there was a laugh  then that takes me  you can have the ranch  the voice of the auctioneer rose again  nobody to follow him  your last chance gentlemen  hes getting it for nothing  too late in a moment  goinggoing  nellie townshead closed her hands and turned her head away then sprang up quivering with the revulsion from despair to hope  through the silence she heard a faint drumming down the valley  he is coming  stop them father she said  nobody else apparently heard the sound  the eyes of all in the clearing were fixed upon the auctioneer and while townshead rose from his chair he brought down his hand  its yours sir he said ill take your cheque or you can fill this contract in if youre bidding for the smaller lots  nellie townshead grew white in face as she glanced towards her father townshead stood still gripping the back of his chair  we are homeless now he said  it was five minutes before the girl looked out again and then in spite of every effort her eyes grew hazy but it was a long time before she forgot the scene for the groups of bronzed men in jean cattle clearing and the tall firs behind them burned themselves into her memory  hallam stood smiling close by the auctioneers table with a cigar in his hand and another man from the cities was apparently replacing a roll of paper dollars in his wallet  that impressed her even more than the sympathetic faces turned towards the house for it was a token that the sale was irrevocably completed  then the group split up as a man rode at a gallop straight towards the table  he was breathless the horse was smoking and there were red smears upon its flanks as well as flecks of spume  he swung himself from the saddle and there followed the sound of an altercation while a noisy group surged about the table  it opened up again and rancher alton walked out pale and grim of face alone  you should have come sooner harry said somebody  the rancher turned the group closed in again and the girl did not see alton stride up to a big man and laying a hand upon his shoulder swing him round  tom he said with a curious quietness there was a message you did not give me you drunken hog  the man shook his grasp off glanced at him bewilderedly and then while the bronze grew a little darker in his face doubled a great fist  if i take a little more than is good for me now and then thats my lookout he said  now i dont want any trouble with you harry but ill not take that talk from any man  altons face was almost grey and his eyes partly closed but there was a steely glint in them as he said did you bring me the message miss townshead gave you  i did the next thing said the man  when i couldnt find you i gave it to the lady  she promised to tell you  tom said alton slowly you are worse than a drunken hog you are  a man stepped in front of him before the word was spoken while another pinioned the culprits arm  weve no use for that kind of talk and the fuss that follows it said the first one  anyway if tom mixed things up it was my fault and dobeys for giving him the whisky  wed sold some stock well and we rushed him in  well now if you still feel you must work it off on somebody youve got to tackle dobey and me  alton let his hands drop  do you know what you have done said he  it wasnt very much anyway said the other man  tom didnt want to come in told us hed a message for you  but we made him and were sorry after because when he got started he left us very little whisky  alton glanced at him a moment and the man grew embarrassed under his gaze  then he smiled wryly  and this is what you have brought townshead and his daughter to and there is more behind  what you have made of me counts for little after that he said  some time had passed when he walked quietly into the house  nellie townshead rose as he entered and stood looking at him very white in face  i wonder if you will believe what i have to tell you miss townshead he commenced and stopped when the rancher turned towards him  my daughter has i think been taught that it is unwise to place much confidence in any one he said  alton glanced at the girl and stood silent a moment when she made a little gesture of agreement  i am afraid appearances are against me he said  yes said the girl  so are the facts  well said alton grimly the latter are of the most importance but i think you should hear me  there is said miss townshead no reason why i should  you made me a promisewhy i do not know any more than i do why i allowed youbut i was very anxious just then  no doubt you spoke on impulse and afterwards regretted it  my daughter was a trifle injudicious said townshead  alton made a last endeavour  i know what you must think of me and it hurts he said  still that is a little thing  the girl checked him by a gesture and the man stopped with his meaning unexpressed  you have made as much evident she said  alton turned towards her father  im afraid the suggestion i wished to make would be out of place just now he said  still i had ridden over in the hope that you and miss townshead would stay with us at somasco while you decided on your next step  we have to thank you for your offer but your surmise is correct said townshead  alton said nothing further but went out into the clearing and stood apart from the rest while the auctioneer disposed of the household effects until a little cabinet was offered when he moved up to the table and bid savagely  hallam for some reason bid against him and only stopped when he had quadrupled its value  alton flung down a roll of dollar bills and then turned to a man close by  will you take that in to miss townshead and not tell her who bought it he said  it was her mothers and i believe she values it  ill do my best said the other man dryly  still im not good at fixing up a story and miss nellies not a fool  well said alton simply theres another thing  where is townshead going  the rancher smiled a little  hes coming home with me  susies driving over with the wagon  alton nodded  now you neednt be touchy but weve fruit and things at somasco you havent got said he  well i want you to come round with the wagon  the rancher straightened himself a trifle  my place isnt somasco but it will be a mean day when i cant feed my friends said he  alton laughed softly  i dont care ten cents about your feelings jack he said  the girl and the old man might like the things and theres no reason they should know where you got them  the other man also laughed  you ride straight home harry before you make it worse said he  one might figure that youd mixed things up enough already  alton turned away and found seaforth awaiting him  they mounted and alton rode in silence until when they were climbing out of the valley he said i wonder charley if theres a man in the dominion who feels as mean as i do  seaforth smiled curiously and there was bitterness in his voice which alton was too disturbed to notice  i think there is he said  you havent asked what kept me but you will see if you look at the horses knees  its a little difficult to understand why he must get his foot in a hole today  it was late that night when they reached somasco but alton found miss deringham upon the verandah and she glanced at him with very pretty sympathy  still seaforth fancied that she seemed a trifle anxious  have you seen the man who brought the message she said  i have said alton  you were right of course  hed had too much whisky  the girl appeared so seaforth fancied curiously relieved  i was almost afraid you might think i was in some respects to blame she said  no said alton simply that was one of the things i couldnt do  it was right out of the question  he went in and the warm colour crept into miss deringhams face as she presently followed him     chapter xii  in vancouver  autumn was merging into winter when one morning alton and his comrade strolled along the waterfront at vancouver  it was still early and the store and office clerks were just hastening to their occupations but alton had spent an hour already in a great sawmill  his face was thoughtful and he seemed to be repeating details of machines and engines half aloud  presently he stood still and gazed about him and seaforth who followed his gaze knew there was something working in his comrades mind  the scene was also inspiriting and suggestive  across the wide inlet mountain beyond mountain towered against the blueness of the north  to the east sombre forest shut the sheltered basin in its black ridge serrated by the ragged spires of taller pines and blurred in places by the drifting smoke of mills  between them and the water stood long lines of loaded cars with huge locomotives snorting in the midst of them and where the metal road which commenced at quebec ended the white shape of an empress liner rose above the wharf the clasp of the new steel girdle which bound england to the east  above the pines which shrouded the narrows shone the topsails of a timberladen barque and a crawling cloud of smoke betokened a steamer coming up out of the wastes of the pacific while fourmasted ships lay two deep beneath the humming mills  then rising ridge on ridge jumbled in picturesque confusion and flanked by towering telegraph poles store and bank and office climbed the slope of the hill  it was a new stone city which had sprung as by enchantment from the ashes of a wooden one and would purging itself of its raw crudity rise to beauty and greatness yet  alton glanced towards it with a comprehensive gesture  what a place this will be by and by he said  sometimes im proud i was born in this country  now i might have been raised back there at carnaby and taught it was every mans chief duty to dress and talk nicely chase foxes and think about his dinner  i fancy there are men who would not have thought that a great misfortune said seaforth dryly  you could also if you liked it do so still  alton laughed a little grimly  there are two kinds of men in this world charley and which of them makes it go said he  the ones who have too much to eat and too little to do or the others who have to keep on doing something because theyre hungry  well i neednt ask you because the conundrum was answered long ago and that kind of talkings no great use to anybody  that was a very fine mill and i picked up a good deal down there  still we will scarcely want such a big one at somasco  no said seaforth smiling  i dont quite see how we are going to keep the one we have busy  well said alton you will by and by and im going to buy three or four new sawfixings today  you dont know anything about bookkeeping charley  you have surmised correctly said seaforth  i dont know that i want to  alton laughed and presently stopped in front of a building on which a brass plate was inscribed bookkeeping and shorthand taught efficiently  i think youre wrong and this is the place said he  thats a sensible man and he just puts down what he can do  go right in and ask how long hell take to make a business man of you  seaforth stared at him in bewilderment  you took nothing with your breakfast harry said he  alton smiled a little grimly  i havent had any yet  ive been too busy he said  walk in charley while i see whether theyll lend me twenty thousand dollars at the bank yonder  seaforth who however knew that there was no use in arguing with his comrade shook his head  its a long rest you want harry he said  he went in and alton proceeding down the street presently entered the bank of montreal where he left the manager divided between astonishment and admiration  he however came out with just as many dollars as he carried into the building and lighting a cigar watched the passersby gravely as he waited for his comrade  they were of many and widely different types men with keen sallow faces from eastern cities hastening as though every moment lost was an opportunity wasted others moving with the tranquillity which proclaimed them englishmen bronzed prospectors and solemn axemen from the shadowy bush with the stillness of the forest in their eyes sailors japs and siwash sealermen  all of them appeared well fed and prosperous and alton was wondering whether there was any one hungry in that city when a girl came down the stairway of the building seaforth had entered  alton did not at first see her face but he noticed that her dress was threadbare and she was walking wearily while the man who read dejection in her attitude was sorry for her  she stopped in the passage glancing at the card in her hand then drew herself up a little and with a quick nervous movement lifted her head  alton saw her face at last and though it had grown a trifle hollow and pale he recognized miss townshead  then she saw him and he moved forward hastily  this is a pleasure i was not expecting he said  he fancied for a moment that the girl would have retreated  she however looked at him quietly though something in her manner checked altons outstretched hand  are you staying here she said  no said alton  im going away tomorrow but i want quite a long talk with you  i do not wish to hear anything about somasco said the girl  well said alton who understood her smiling well let that go by now they begin on time in this city and as your father doesnt like his breakfast early im figuring you havent had any  well get some together  ive been too busy to think of mine  nellie townshead was afterwards both astonished and angry with herself she had lost her respect for this man who had it seemed betrayed her confidence and if he had given her a moments time would probably have dispensed with his company  as it was however alton drew her out into the street with a swift forcefulness before she could frame an answer  she was also feeling very lonely and downcast then and it was pleasant to find somebody she knew in the busy city that had apparently no place for her  now said alton presently well go in here  its nice and quiet for vancouver but i expect you know this place  he realized that he had blundered when he saw the girls face but in another second she was laughing a little  no she said  im afraid you are forgetting  alton apparently misunderstood her  well he said smiling its quite possible you know another place thats nicer but sit right yonder while i waken some of these people up  now the public breakfast is an institution in western cities whose inhabitants frequently take no meals at home and the appearance of the bronzed man and girl together excited no comment while alton was able to contrive that they had a table in a corner to themselves  his tastes were as his companion knew severely simple and she wondered a little because that establishment was one of the most expensive in the city  in the meanwhile the man talked assiduously if somewhat at random and was contented when he found that he could keep the girls attention occupied so that she scarcely noticed how often he refilled her plate  at last as he passed a great cluster of fruit across he said its time you did the talking now  you are going right ahead in this city  the girls face quivered for a second and her fingers moved nervously i am afraid i have not commenced yet she said  no said alton  now susie thomson told me you were running a typewriter for somebody  a tinge of carmine flickered into the cheek of his companion and faded swiftly again  i was she said  the commercial school found a place for me but it was impossible that i should stay there  alton half closed his eyes and the girl noticed his big hand slowly clenched for he fancied he understood  its a pity i wasnt a brother of yours miss nellie  i should like to see those folks he said  still you have known me a long while and thats something to go upon  im afraid its not sufficient said the girl hastily with a little smile  well said alton with a sigh you have got hold of something better  miss townshead appeared to make an endeavour to answer hopefully but again her fingers trembled and there was a little less courage than usual in her eyes  not yet but i shall soon she said  of course said alton gravely  now how long have you been looking for it  a month said the girl without reflection and alton nodded as though in answer to some question he had put to himself  and when you went into that place this morning there was nothing again he said  no said miss townshead with a trace of despondency she could not quite conceal  there was a post vacant but it had some trust attached to it and nobody knows me  now while he talked altons eyes had been busy and he had noticed a curious weariness which he had not seen before in his companions face her fingers which had grown white were also very slender and the wellworn dress which he remembered did not seem to hang about her as it had done  her eyes however were brighter and now and then a little florid colour flushed her cheeks but that did not please him for alton had seen not a little of want and hunger in the snows of the north  you mean they want security said he  yes said miss townshead hastily  still one of the girls i met at the school told me there was somebody wanted at a big dry goods store and i think i had better go round and see the people now  alton rose and when they went out together gravely held out his hand we used to be good friends and you were kind to me said he  now is there nothing that i can do  no said miss townshead hastily  of course there is nothing and you will hear that i am prospering presently  alton bent a trifle over the little hand in the shabby glove that rested a moment in his palm  well if ever there is anything you will let me know  you are a brave girl said he  nellie townshead turned and left him feeling for no apparent reason a slight choking sensation and alton who watched the little figure in the threadbare dress for at least a minute strode resolutely back to the commercial school  i want to see the man who runs this place he said  he was shown into an office where a man whose face he was pleased with greeted him  you taught miss townshead here he said  yes said the other  she is a lady of considerable ability and i could recommend her with confidence  alton stared at him a moment out of halfclosed eyes  of course you would he said  well now she has been applying for some place where they want security  is it fit for a lady  yes said the man dryly  otherwise i should not have mentioned it to her  the storekeeper having been victimized lately however requires a deposit of one hundred dollars  alton took out his wallet  he can have two hundred if he likes  now i want you to fix it up without telling miss townshead or anybody  you are a relation of hers said the man  no said alton i am a friend  then im afraid i cant assist you said the other man  it is necessary to avoid any probability of complications in my business  again a glint crept into altons eyes but it vanished and he spoke quietly  i think youre straight he said  well im direct too and im going right back to my ranch tomorrow  anybody from that district will tell you all about alton of somasco  now youll take the dollars and if you hear of me hanging round this city you can send them back to me  the man appeared dubious but finally nodded  ill make an exception in your case he said  the fact is im sorry for miss townshead because i fancy it is desirable that she should secure an appointment of any kind as soon as possible  alton went out contented having so he fancied somewhat skilfully obtained townsheads address and found seaforth awaiting him  they could if i am an apt pupil turn me out proficient for anything in three months he said  alton laughed  theyll have to do it in less and well find a use for all theyve taught you by and by he said  now i came across miss townshead and she wasnt looking well or happy  well call upon her father when we get through what we have to do  seaforth who appeared disturbed would have gone sooner but it was afternoon when they strolled round the outskirts of the city and his face was somewhat grim as they entered the alsatia which is the usual adjunct of such places  it would however have impressed the unsophisticated eastern observer as being well painted respectable and especially prosperous for virtue is not the only thing which is rewarded and recognized in a western city  finally after traversing it they found townshead in a little wooden house which was apparently occupied by two other families  the remnants of a very meagre meal lay before him and he sat wearing the red velvet jacket which looked older and more faded than ever in a canvas chair  he greeted the two men coldly and somewhat condescendingly  we have not been especially fortunate hitherto he said presently in fact this city seems to be labouring under a commercial depression and i have been unable to find any of the opportunities i had expected  nor has my daughter been more successful  alton who had been looking about him in the meanwhile noticed that although the day was chilly there was no fire in the stove while glancing at the man who lay infirm alike in will and body in the chair he understood why the girls fingers had trembled and the mistiness he had for a moment seen in her eyes  he was also wondering by what means he could lessen one difficulty but it was seaforth who devised one first  things will get better presently he said  now harry and i often remember the pleasant evenings we spent at your ranch and we never got suppers like those miss townshead made us at somasco  my daughter found it necessary to acquire the art of cookery in canada said townshead a trifle distantly  of course said seaforth smiling  everybody is compelled to in this country and i only referred to the subject because harry seems to fancy it must be difficult to get any of the little things we are used to in the bush in the city while your kindness to us would justify what might otherwise appear a liberty  we brought a few odds and ends you cant get quite so nice in vancouver along  hadnt you better go and bring them in harry  alton glanced at him in bewildered astonishment  bring them in he said  seaforth shook his head deprecatingly  you havent forgotten already and you are not going to escape in that fashion he said  if youll ask at the hotel theyll tell you where to find the things  alton moved so that townshead could not see him and his face was utterly perplexed  what things he said  two or three fowls said seaforth reflectively  there were some eggs a bag of the big yellow apples andnow its curious i forgot the rest  altons eyes twinkled  oh yes he said  some venison  there was the deer you shot in the potatoes and a bag of dried plums  our orchard has done very well mr townshead  i wonder if i forgot the excelsior pears said seaforth  theyre as big as your two fists and harrys quite proud of them  townshead who was not an observant man appeared astonished and also a trifle touched  im afraid i have not always appreciated my bush friends as i should have done and your kindness will i think lessen my daughters difficulty respecting the commissariat he said  there are of course many of the little things we were used to which she feels the loss of  seaforth who read a good deal more than his words expressed in the speakers face signed to his comrade who went out and returned later with a hamper  somebody must have forgotten to put the venison in but the other things are all there he said  townshead assisted them to unpack the hamper and while they were busy over it his daughter came in  it was apparently raining for the thin white dress clung about her and she seemed very white and weary darkness was drawing on the room was dim and at first she apparently only saw her father as she stood taking off her hat by the window  nothing again today and i am very tired she said  still i am to call at another store tomorrow and i was wickedly extravagant  i was kept until it was too late for dinner and i bought something that will please you for supper  then as she turned to lay the wet hat down the blood rushed to her face for she saw alton kneeling by the hamper and seaforth standing in the shadow behind her fathers chair  the former did not rise but his comrade came forward smiling in another moment  i am glad we did not miss you as we were about to go when you came in he said  these are one or two trifles harry fancied might be useful  he is absurdly proud of all the products of somasco and seems to think nobody can get anything nice in the city  seaforth also talked a good deal and miss townshead smiled now and then at him but when she went with them to the door he lingered a moment because he felt her eyes were on him  your comrade didnt support you well and i dont think the expedient would have occurred to him she said with a little tremor in her voice  still it was done in kindnessand i am grateful  seaforth smiled gravely though his face perplexed the girl  a little faith is a good thing and people should believe what theyre told said he  now i wonder if one could take the liberty  no said the girl  even if he had the best intentions  i and my father have not lost our pride  seaforth sighed as he turned away and when he rejoined alton stared at the lights of the city savagely while as they passed along the waterfront he said will you give me a cigar harry  alton drew out his cigarcase glanced at it a moment and then tossed it across the wharf  what right have you and i to be going back to dinner when that girl hasnt enough to eat he said  you know what those cigars cost me  lord what selfish brutes we are  now stop right here and tell me what we are going to do  seaforth made a gesture of helplessness  the difficulty is that one cant do anything he said  you see we cant attempt the hamper trick too frequently and i scarcely think miss townshead would care to be indebted to either of us in any other fashion  well said alton simply there must be a way somewhere and im going to find it  then said seaforth with a trace of bitterness for the sake of everybodys peace of mind i hope you will  you seem especially compassionate towards miss townshead  alton glanced at him a moment and then laughed a little  i suppose you cant help being foolish charley but you should know ive no time to think of anything beyond what i have to do just now he said  the biggest contract ive ever taken hold of is waiting for me  i am said seaforth dryly glad to hear you say so even though your recent conduct would make it somewhat difficult for most people to believe you  alton glanced at him very gravely  i dont like those jokes he said  youll get more sense as you grow up charley     chapter xiii  the somasco consolidated  alton left vancouver by the quebec express next day found horses waiting at the little station and only waiting while fresh ones were saddled at a lonely ranch took the trail again before the first faint light crept out of the east  he also spoke little with seaforth during the journey and stared at the latter who drew rein when the weary horses plodded steaming and bespattered all over into the settlement  what are you stopping for he said  seaforth glanced at the wisp of blue smoke which hung about the pines behind hortons hotel  its rather more than twelve hours since ive had a meal he said  dont you ever get tired or hungry harry  alton laughed  oh yes sometimes i do but not usually when im busy  anyway if the beasts hold out well be getting breakfast at somasco in two hours or so  seaforth groaned inwardly but knowing the futility of argument shook his bridle and rode on lurching a little in his saddle as the tired horse stumbled into mudholes and brushed through dripping fern  by and by however alton swung himself down in front of a lonely loghouse with a big clearing behind it where a man took their horses without a word and signed them to enter  seaforth stretched his limbs wearily and would have dropped into a chair but that alton stood erect until the man came back again and dusting two seats with his soft hat pointed to them with a gesture of hospitality  his hair and beard were frosted his face was lean and brown and there were many wrinkles about his eyes but he held himself very upright and pointed to the stove  yell be in from vancouver  ill ready ye some pork and flapjacks he said  alton shook his head  dont worry i cant wait he said  ye are very welcome said the other  of course said alton simply still i cant stop  im here to talk business callender  seaforth noticed that in face of the typical absence of protest or compliment there was nothing the most critical could find fault with in the invitation or the refusal  the old man was dressed in very curiouslypatched jean but he was almost stately in his simplicity and nothing could have been more apposite than the little nod with which alton made his affirmation  it implied a good deal more than speech could have done  ye will be asking about the place said callender  im wanting three thousand dollars  its worth all that  alton nodded and it was evident that the men understood each other for there was no endeavour to lessen or enhance the value of the property  it will be worth more presently but thats about the fair thing now he said  weel said callender simply by then i may be dead  twenty years ive lived on my lone here and i thought at one time i would be content to lie down by between the bush and the river but now a longing to see the old land grips me  ye will not understand it  ye were born in canada  no said alton gravely  the land that has fed me is good enough for me  the old man made a little gesture of assent  aye he said  its a good country but i feel the old one calling me  its just three thousand dollars im asking ye  alton drew a sheet which seemed covered with calculations from his wallet and glanced at it silently  then he looked at the rancher  one thousand down one thousand in six months and the rest any time in two years with six per cent he said  you might get the dollars in your wallet if you made the deal with a land agent in vancouver  maybe said callender simply i can trust ye  i would not sell the place to anybody  alton stood up  you shall have a cheque tomorrow he said  they had mounted within another minute and alton glanced with a little smile at his comrade as they rode on again  that said seaforth was in a sense a somewhat effective scene but im not sure which of us should go to the business school  alton laughed  i dont often blunder when i deal with a man said he  callender and i wouldnt have been better pleased or five dollars richer if wed talked all day  seaforth nodded though his eyes twinkled  you dont seem so confident about the other sex he said  alton gravely pointed to a towering fir  that redwood would fetch a good many dollars in vancouver  i wonder when well get those saws through he said  while he spoke a thud of hoofs grew louder and presently a man came riding in haste towards them down the trail  he drew bridle when he recognized them and seaforth became curious when he saw that it was hallam  the latter made them an ironical salutation and sat regarding alton covertly with his cunning beady eyes until the rancher smiled  if you were going down to see callender i fancy youre a little too late he said  seaforth wondered whether his comrade saw the wickedness in the other mans face and the slight closing of his hands upon the bridle  it was very perceptible for a second and then he made a gesture of resignation  i think there was another time you got in ahead of me and it might be cheaper to buy you off he said  you havent answered my letter asking what you wanted for all youre holding up here as well as the ranch  alton flung his head back a trifle and seaforth knew what lay behind his laugh  no he said i put it in the stove  a little grey spot appeared in hallams cheeks and once more his fingers closed upon the bridle  well you may be sorry by and by but as im a business man first and last ill give you another chance he said  theres not room for two of us in this valley and with what im holding i can call you any time  altons eyes were half closed now and there was a glint in them ive been figuring on that he said  when im ready ill let you see my hand  now if hallam had been taught his business which was an especially mean one in england he might have kept his temper but he lacked finish though his abilities were unpleasantly sufficient in the west  then it is to be hoped youll put up a better game than you did at townsheads ranch  i was a little sorry for the girl he said  met her once or twice in vancouver and she didnt seem well off  alton said nothing but he pressed his heels home and the big tired horse moved forward  the trail was narrow just there and wound through a quaggy belt where tall wild cabbage grew out of black depths of mire  there was also no room for hallam to wheel his horse on the slippery sawnup logs and alton urged his beast on glancing imperturbably at the man in front of him  again the grey crept into hallams face and a very unpleasant look in his eyes but he drew his bridle and next moment his horse was floundering in the mire  alton laughed a little as he rode on without glancing behind him  that may have been pleasant said seaforth dryly but in view of what i saw in hallams face i dont know that it was wise  well said alton i think it was  theres only one way of arguing with a panther and that beasts a good deal less dangerous than hallam is  now youll ride in to the settlement tomorrow and put up a notice at the store the ranchers of the somasco district are requested to attend a meeting at 630 saturday  at the bottom youll put a big important  ive got to have a talk with you tonight  he made a hasty breakfast when they reached the ranch and was busy at the sawmill from which he did not return until supper all day so that it was not until that meal was finished and he was waiting for seaforth that he had speech with miss deringham  she sat by the stove apparently occupied with some delicate embroidery but it was possible that her attention was not confined to the stitches  alton sat near her looking straight before him in a deerhide chair and it was significant that neither of them found speech necessary  the mans face was somewhat grim and the girl wondered what he was thinking  you apparently did not find vancouver enlivening she said  alton laughed a little  i took one or two little worries along and found another when i got there  miss deringham went on with her embroidery for a while and then glanced at the man again  i wonder if any of them were connected with the sale of townsheads ranch she said  alton smiled a little  im getting kind of afraid of you he said one of them was  alice deringham laughed prettily and was inwardly contented  she had been used to influence and admiration but there was a subtle pleasure in being the recipient of this mans homage while she surmised that had he not offered her all of it he would not have made the admission concerning townshead  your recent neighbour is not doing well down there she said  i am sorry for miss townshead  alton nodded and his face was sombre as well as pitiful its very rough on a girl of that kind and shes true grit right through he said  im thankful you dont know what some women who have to earn their living doing what used to be mens work in the cities have to put up with  still said alice deringham i can guess  miss townshead was working at something uncongenial for a livelihood and was not especially cordial to you  alton looked at her gravely  no he said  she hadnt even found that something yet and she was very kind  thats what made me feel it worse  of course she would not have shown you what she thought said the girl a trifle dryly  and you were not responsible in any case  alton glanced at her with some bewilderment  no he said  im sitting here with all that a man could wish for while that girl who was used to all the good things you have in the old country walks round and round the city looking for something she can earn a few dollars at when i might have fixed things differently if it hadnt been for tom  its hard to feel theres a meaner man than i am in the dominion  miss deringham saw the veins rise on his forehead and the glint in his eyes and shivered a little as she hoped the man would never discover it was not the rancher who had brought the shame upon him  would it have been possible for you to do anything to help them if you had reached the ranch in time she said  yes said alton simply i think it would  and it would have been better for everybody in the district  though the girl did not altogether understand him his very quietness was impressive for she knew by this time that what he stated was usually rather more than less the fact  well she said lightly it was not your fault and you will forget it presently  alton smiled wryly  i dont know he said  there are some kinds of stains that dont wash out but youre only wishing to be kind to me because you understand all that better than i do in the old country  the girl glanced aside and dropped her needle while when she spoke her voice was a trifle strained  do you know that you bushmen have made me ashamed once or twice she said  i am afraid there is a great disappointment waiting for you when you see us as we are  alton rose as her father and seaforth came in with a curious little inclination of his head which came well from him  that simply couldnt be he said  well its a pity i couldnt tell you all you have done for me alreadyand thats one reason why im so sorry the other thing will not wash out  now charley and i have a good deal to do and youll excuse me  he went out with his comrade and deringham smiled at his daughter he is learning rapidly  still i fancy the man will feel it whenand i am of course speaking impersonallyhe finds you out he said  alice deringham laughed though she was not conscious of much amusement just then and pointed to the bookcase close by her  it is really not his fault if that is where he gets his fancies from she said  no said deringham nodding  we grow out of them at sixteen in the old country  of course tennyson kingsley scott  now i wonder if he would find elaine a more common type than vivienne if he went home to carnaby  still if you look a little more closely there is literature which might throw a slightly different light upon the mans character i notice a bulky volume on softwooded trees somebody on trigonometry geology in relation to mining and what i recognize as a standard work on finance and banking  alice deringham smiled  do you know i fancy that alton of somasco would with a little training make his mark at home she said  has he mentioned any intention of returning with you  deringhams face grew a trifle sombre  he has not  we will talk of something else he said  alton and seaforth sat up late that night but what their conversation was did not appear until they walked into a room at the rear of hortons store just as supper was being cleared away on the saturday evening  the nights were already growing cold and a pile of pinewood crackled in the stove while the light of two big lamps fell upon the bronzed faces of grave jeanclad men all turned expectantly towards alton  he sat down at the head of the table with seaforth beside him and horton got up in a frayedout white shirt from which his bony wrists and red neck protruded grotesquely at the foot  the rest sat on the table and sundry boxes and barrels smoking tranquilly  they were for the most part silent men who waged a grim and ceaseless warfare with the forest and disdained any indication of curiosity nobody asked a question but the steady eyes which watched the convener of the meeting were mildly inquiring when he rose up  i sent for you boys because it seemed the fairest thing he said now somebody has got to take hold with a tight grip if the dollars that are coming into it are to go to the men who have done the work in this valley  you have seen what has happened down washington and oregon way and we dont any of us want it here in canada  when the good time came was it the man whod put in his twelve hours daily with the axe and crosscut who got the dollars or the one who lived soft in the cities  there was a little growl from several among the assembly for most of those who sat there realized that it was usually the mortgage broker and speculator who reaped where the toilers with axe and saw had sown  therell have to be laws made to hold them fellows grip off the poor man said somebody  alton laughed a little  well he said dryly it seems to me that the poor man should do a little of the holding off himself  now i want you to listen carefully  within twelve months youll see a new wagonroad cut south towards the big river and inside two years the surveyors running the line for a new railroad into the somasco valley  the men stared at the speaker and there was a murmur almost of doubt and wonder  they knew what that promise meant and it implied the opening of mines and mills a market for all they could raise on the spot and the quadrupling in value of every ranch  alton sat quietly imperturbable at the head of the table  and you believe the things going to be said somebody  i think said alton quietly i have just told you so  there was another murmur of strong and patient mens unexpressed exultation and seaforth noticed that they had accepted his comrades statement without further question implicitly  they were in some respects simple and the complex life of the cities was unknown to most of them but they had seen human nature stripped of its veneer in the bush and understood it well  it was a delicate compliment they had paid alton and the little flush in his face showed that he realized it  its great news said somebody  alton nodded  yes he said  now i cant tell you exactly why i know this thing will come and you wouldnt be any worse off if i were wrong  further you see i might have gone ahead and brought you up without speaking a word to you  a man got up from a barrel  no sir he said  im not going to disturb this meeting but thats just what you couldnt do  it wouldnt be like somasco harry  there was grave applause but the glint in the steady eyes was pleasant to see and seaforth felt a curious thrill as he glanced at his partner  alton however proceeded quietly  i neednt tell you what it means he said  it may mean anything including a wooden city  you know it as well as i do but im going to tell you this  unless you hold tight to your own and do a little for yourselves when the good time comes youll be left out in the cold theres a man who sees this better than you or i feeling for a grip on the somasco valley and therell be very little left for the rest of us if he gets it  hallam of the tyee a growl ran down the table  alton nodded  yes said he  now you have seen poor men frozen out of their ranches and claims by men with money in other parts of this country as well as across the frontier and theres usually only one end to the battle when the man without the dollars kicks against the man with plenty  stay right where you are with mortgages held open timber rights that are lapsing because youve done nothing and undeveloped mineral claims and the man who sits scheming while youre resting will squeeze you out one by one  it has happened before said somebody and there was silence for a space  the men had spent the best years of their life hewing the clearings that grew so slowly farther into the virgin forest faring sparingly and only quitting that herculean toil to earn sufficient dollars railroad building or working at the mines to feed them when they continued it again  they had sown the best that was in them of mind and body giving all they had courage that never faltered as well as the ceaseless effort of overstrained muscle and as yet their fee was but the right to hope and toil  and now they knew it was once more possible that the fullfleshed taxer of other mens labours would sweep what was theirs into his garner  yes said alton  and what has happened before will happen againunless you stir round and stop it  thats the only use in remembering things  standing alone hallam and his crowd will squeeze you out one by one standing fast together for what is your own youre fit to choke off anybody and what ive called you here for is to see whether we cant fix up a cooperative company  a man stood up with a light in his eyes  then youve hit the thing plumb where you wanted he said  whose standing in with alton of somasco boys  there was a roar this time and then a silence as if the assembly felt that they had done an unseemly thing but it was evident that they were all of them ready  i figure youve got a programme said somebody  i have said alton  ill have a bigger one by and by but in the meanwhile it includes the selling of timber in place of destroying it and a doubling right off of the somasco mill  it also takes in a gristmill the recording of more timber rights and most of you getting in on the ground floor of a new silver mine  theres to be an office down in vancouver and a desiccated fruit store and the best men we can get hold of to run them  now sit still while i read what might do for a scheme  they sat very still and even seaforth who knew his comrade wondered a little for that scheme while crude in one or two directions was eminently workable  it provided for a pro rata division of profits and partition of expenses while each man would retain the control of his own holding and those who listened nodded now and then as they noted the efficiency of some portion of the plan of cooperation  now said alton quietly laying down the paper  thats my notion im willing to listen if any man can bring out a better  there was a silence until horton rose up at the foot of the table glass in hand  i he said simply dont think he can  every dollar i can raise is going in and were all standing in with alton  heres the somasco consolidated and to  with hallam  there was a roar louder than the first one a clink of glasses and forgetting their reticence for once the big bronzed men thronged about the one who smiled at them from the head of the table     chapter xiv  the compact  after the first meeting of the somasco consolidated alton was frequently absent from the ranch and spent most of the nights shut up with bulky books while he also apparently became involved in an extensive correspondence with the cities  there were however times when miss deringham surprised him standing still and gazing into vacancy which was distinctly unusual with him but the girl who had once or twice noticed his eyes fixed upon her and signs of an inward conflict in his face was not displeased  she could arrive at a tolerably accurate deduction as well as most young women  in the meanwhile seaforth had gone down to vancouver and deringham still appeared content to linger at somasco  he had his daughter knew been ordered a lengthy rest and it was evident that the tranquillity of the mountain ranch was benefiting him physically though now and then the girl noticed that his face was anxious when communications from england reached him  she was also for no reason she was willing to admit content to remain a little longer at somasco  one night when she was sitting meditatively in the room set apart for her use alton passed the halfopened door and noticing the curious slowness of his pace she signed him to enter  she had somewhat to the indignation of mrs margery taken the room in hand and with the aid of a few sundries surreptitiously brought from vancouver with seaforths connivance made a transformation in its aspect  a red curtain hung behind the door  there were a few fine furs which seaforth had collected here and there about the ranch upon the floor and alton who had just returned from a ride of forty miles through the mire and rain stopped a moment upon the threshold  he was a man of quick perceptions and all he saw seemed stamped with the personality of its occupant  it was dainty and essentially feminine and he became for perhaps the first time uneasily conscious of his own solid masculine proportions and bespattered garments as he glanced deprecatingly at the girl  she lay with lithe gracefulness in a basket chair very collected and very pretty while he dimly understood that the fact that she did not move but only smiled at him implied a good deal  a brightness flashed into his eyes and sank out of them again  come in and sit down she said i have seen very little of you lately and you seem tired  halfanhours casual chatter will do you no harm although it may appear to you a terrible waste of time  alton came in and dropped into a chair which creaked beneath him  his face was somewhat weary and the girl noticed the stiffness of his movements  he also looked about him with a curious expression which seemed to suggest reverence in his eyes  no he said gravely it wouldnt be a waste of time  alice deringham smiled a little and moved one foot a trifle nearer the stove  it was little and delicately moulded and lost nothing from being encased in a very open bronze slipper  alton noticing the slight rustle of fabric which accompanied the movement glanced towards it and then turned his eyes away  you see i have been taking liberties said the girl  all this is very tawdry isnt it  altons eyes were wistful  no  do you know this place has quite an effect on me  it makes me feelas if i were in church said he  miss deringhams face was not responsive  there were times when she was sensible of a curious compunction in this ranchers presence  a sensation of that kind is apt to become oppressive she said  when we have gone you will throw these things away  the man seemed to wince as though the contemplation of something was painful to him but he looked at his companion gravely  i think i shall screw the door up tight he said  alice deringham laughed musically  now i think that was very pretty she said  it seems commonplace to offer you a cup of coffee after it and no doubt you will consider the indulgence in such luxuries a sign of weakness  i have reasons for believing that mrs margery does  alton smiled somewhat grimly  im just about as fond of good things as most other men he said  the difficulty was that i seldom had the chance of getting them  miss deringham busied herself with a spirit lamp and alton watched her with a little glint in his eyes  possibly the girl knew that her movements were graceful as she bent over the lamp and that the light from the one above her struck a fine sparkle from her hair  she may also have been aware that the picture had its attractions for a man who had lived a grim life of toil and selfdenial as this one had done  it has occurred to me that this coffee is not the same that we had when we first came to somasco she said  alton appeared a trifle embarrassed  i had to go down and worry horton about one or two little things he said  its good for him occasionally and he had been sending me flour we couldnt use lately  miss deringham nodded though she was quite aware that the storekeeper was scarcely likely to supply axemen and ranchers whose tastes were simple and dollars scarce with what she guessed by its bouquet was the finest product of costa rica  if she had not been she was capable of deducing a little from the stamp upon the packets she had seen in mrs margerys store which showed that they had come direct from vancouver  alton took up the cup handed him and leaned back in his chair with a little gesture of content while the girl smiled as she glanced at him  illustration  alton leaned back with a little gesture of content  you bear it very well she said  the man looked at her with a bewildered expression for a moment or two then he laughed  no he said i find it wonderfully nice  there was an underlying sincerity in his voice and alice deringham driven by curiosity went a step farther  the coffee she said  she was almost sorry next moment for she had at other times called up considerably more than she had expected or desired from the unsounded depths of the mans nature  for a second or two there was a great wistfulness which changed into a little glow she shrank from in his eyes  he turned them upon her and then away and they were once more grave when he looked back again  still she guessed what that effort had cost him  no he said quietly  i did not mean the coffee  you see i had never until you came here been used to anything smooth or pretty  alice deringham smiled a little for she understood  the man she thought was willing she should accept the somewhat pointless compliment as the sequence of his former speech to cover his mistake if he had betrayed more than he thought desirable  it also increased her liking for him since it appeared that alton was capable of selfrestraint  there was however no mistaking what she had seen and the girl remembered that one of the winnipeg ladies she travelled with who had visited one of the weird valleys across the american frontier described to her the fascination of throwing stones into the basin of a geyser to see how many it would take before it erupted during her intercourse with rancher alton alice deringham had experienced the sensation  you have been working too hard lately and worrying too i think she said  alton laughed a little and then glanced at the stove for a while in silence as though communing with himself  when he looked up again the girl fancied that he had decided something  work hurts nobody  its the worry that leaves the mark he said with a smile  of course a good many people will have told you that before  yes ive been thinking a good deal lately  it is occasionally a solace to tell ones friends ones thoughts said miss deringham  well said alton gravely theres a thing i feel i should do and yet i dont want to because it would stand in the way of my doing something else  that is a somewhat common difficulty said alice deringham  it depends upon the importance to yourself or others of the first thing  alton nodded  there are he said men in this district who have worked very hard not for the bare living the ranch gives them because some have put a good deal more into the land than they have taken out of it but for what it will give them presently  now unless somebody does the right thing for them another man will walk right in and take all they have worked for away  i wouldnt like that to happen because i am one of them you see  no said miss deringham  still surmising that you are the somebody i wonder if you have a more convincing reason  a little flush seemed to creep into altons bronzed face  i find i can talk to you as i never did to any one else he said  well this valleys waiting to feed a host of people and teeming with riches that somebody is wanting and i feel its my task to do the best i can for it  now when one feels that and does nothing hes putting a load he was meant to carry on other peoples shoulders  yes said miss deringham  still isnt it slightly egotistical there may be other men who could do what is necessary better  alton laughed a little  you get right home every time he said ive been thinking the same thing but though i wanted to i couldnt find the man and there isnt much use in running away from the work thats set out for you  alice deringham understood him because she was a somewhat intellectual young woman though she had and possibly fortunately but seldom been required to decide between inclination and duty in any affair of importance hitherto  there was also something that touched her in the mans simple faithfulness  and you are going to do a good deal she said  i dont know said alton gravely  i should like to  you see we want roads and mills and an office down there in the city  and said the girl that means money  yes said alton  when a man goes round borrowing he finds out that the folks who have got the dollars like to keep them  thats why im going up to look for jimmys silver mine  miss deringham shivered a little  winter is coming on she said the last man who looked for it was frozenand there is carnaby  the girls pulses throbbed a little faster as she spoke and there was nothing in the mans face which escaped her attention  again the curious glint became apparent in his eyes and the warm bronze a little deeper in tint  i might raise some dollars on carnaby but i dont want to he said  miss deringham had seen sufficient and decided to change the topic so you intend to find the silver she said  yes said alton simply  i feel i have got to do thatfirst  there was a significant silence and the girl leaned back in her chair conscious without resentment that the man was watching her  her eyes were softer than usual the faintest trace of colour showed in her cheek while the light evening dress emphasized the fine sweep of curve and line that was further accentuated by her pose  the lamp that hung above her smote a track of brightness athwart her redgold hair until she slightly moved her head so that while part of the full round neck showed in its snowy whiteness her face was in the shadow  i think you will be successful  i hope you will she said  it was evident that the man understood all that was meant but he rose with an apparent effort  and now i have a good deal to do he said  alice deringham also rose with a little stateliness and when he had gone out sank down contemplatively into the chair again  her hands lay open in her lap and it is possible that she saw nothing of the sewing they rested on as she grappled with the question why had the man told her what he had done  there were two apparent reasons for alice deringham realized that there was a certain greatness behind his simplicity  granting that she could see his standpoint clearly though it was more difficult to understand why such a man had made it evident to her  he was she knew not one to stoop even to win a womans good opinion and would have seen that in this direction silence became him best unless he felt that while so much was due to honour there was something due to her  he had told her simply that it was not to please himself he was going out to look for the silver just then and the deduction was that the expedition had no attractions for him because he wished to stay at the ranch  allowing that the revelation of his motive had not been purposeless  it was only his responsibility drove him away from her and there was a vague but effective compliment in the implication that she would recognize it  still this train of reasoning had led alice deringham far enough and she sought distraction from it in her embroidery which during the next hour progressed but indifferently  it was a day or two later when alton drew deringham into his room when he came in bemired all over from the settlement and the financier noticed that the table and most of the floor was littered with books survey plans and miscellaneous papers  ill have to leave this place for a little he said  im going up to find the silver but the ranch and all thats in it is at your service just as long as it pleases you  if all goes as i expect it i shall be back in a month or so and would be glad to find you still at somasco  then if you are ready charley and i will go back to the old country with you  a lawyer in vancouver has written to an english accountant for me and with him to help us we can fix up all about carnaby  now deringham had up to that moment still retained a hope that he could arrive at an understanding with alton respecting carnaby on the spot as it was unless he could gain time exposure and even worse things stared him in the face  it had been comparatively simple to hoodwink his cotrustee but it would be very different with an accountant of reputation and he had also grown afraid of altons instinctive grasp of whatever subject he turned his attention to  there was of course much the rancher did not know but that left him with attention the more concentrated upon issues of importance  deringham however showed but little evidence of dismay or astonishment  had he been liable to do so he would not have held his own so long in the occupation he followed  his breath came a trifle more quickly and his hand trembled a little but he rested it upon the table and all that alton noticed was a curious little movement about the corner of his eyes  the rancher however remembered it  well said deringham i must endeavour if possible to return to england with you  when you spoke of being away a month you seemed to contemplate a possibility of being absent longer  alton nodded  i did he said  the man who found the silver is lying up there still but ive provided for anything of that kind happening to me as you will see in a day or two  now i dont think we need worry any more until we get to carnaby  deringham made a gesture of concurrence but the grim irony of altons speech occurred to him as he went out to grapple with his torturing anxiety  at first he could scarcely think of anything consecutively and once more the picture of a man hanging by a juniperbush with a river frothing down the gorge below rose up persistently before his memory  it was replaced by another of a grim silent figure keeping watch with eyes that never ceased their fixed stare beside a frozen trail  on the second day afterwards he sauntered into hortons store and found hallam there  the mining speculator appeared ironically amused the storekeeper flushed and savage but when hallam turned to deringham there was something in his manner that suggested they had not met by accident  ive been telling the storekeeper not to lay in too many somascos just yet and have got to put in the time here for an hour or two he said know any reason why you shouldnt have a drink with me  they strolled into an adjoining room and horton who supplied them with a bottle and glasses came back smiling sardonically  now if hallam hadnt put it that way i mightnt have thought anything said he  still when a man of his kind takes the trouble to tell one anything its a blame good reason for not believing him  in the meanwhile hallam who filled the glasses glanced at deringham you think i can be of some use to you he said  yes said deringham  i presume you know alton is going up to find the silver he needs to help him traverse your schemes  oh yes said hallam  still i should have figured he could have got it out of carnaby  i believe he intends to  hallam smiled unpleasantly  now i begin to understand you he said you lost a good many dollars over the peveril  i think that is beside the question said deringham  hallam regarded his companion steadily  well i dont know but we neednt argue  you dont want him to get those dollars out of carnaby  and you dont want him to find the silver  hallam laughed  thats quite right said he  the same thing would suit both of us  i scarcely think so said deringham  in my case i really do not mind whether he gets the dollars from carnaby or not  no said hallam  then youll have to tell me what you want  i dont want him to come over to england too soon  if anything kept him up there among the mountains a month or so longer than he expected so that i should have time to straighten up things a little i would not complain  and said hallam you would be ready to pay for it  deringham bent his head  yes  to a moderate extent  hallam sat silent for a time and then looked up with a glint in his beady eyes  it could be done  well i dont want him to find that silver and if he doesnt get through his prospecting in the next month or so hell not find much of anything under six feet of snow and ill have fixed things up as i want them before its melted  now youre holding pretty heavy in the aconada mine and ive been wanting to get my foot in there for a long while  deringham stood up and thrust aside the bottle hallam passed him before we go any further i want you to understand that if alton is held up there until december is over it is all i ask he said  hallam nodded  oh yes he said  all i want is so many of those shares transferred to me  they debated for a while and then deringham said i would sooner fix it through a third party  hallam laughed unpleasantly  that would suit but id want your cheque to buy them with made out payable to me  it would said deringham not suit me  then we cant make a deal  its me thats putting this thing through and if anything goes wrong im anxious to have somebody to stand in with me as well as pick up the dollars if it doesnt  im talking quite straight  there it is  take it or leave it  deringham was silent again  then he laughed a little  since i cannot apparently do anything else ill take it  hallam filled up both glasses  then thats all he said  heres my respects to the somasco consolidated  deringham just touched his glass and went out while hallam who sat down and emptied his smiled ironically  that man might have kept his dollars and id be quite pleased if alton stayed up there a good deal more than two months said he  deringham was in the meanwhile hastily writing out telegraphic messages which were to cause a little astonishment on the london stock market and hamper the working of one or two companies  he would so far as he could see be a much poorer man in a few months or so but he fancied he could gain time to save the reputation that would help him to commence again and to men of his attainments there are always opportunities  then he sent off a mounted messenger and rode slowly back towards somasco while horton spent some time examining a blottingpad in his back store  im kind of sorry i cant make anything of that stuff said he whats the use of wiring any one the names of cities  during the next day alton drew deringham into his room and laid a document on the table  i dont know if thats quite the usual thing but horton and i have been worrying over a lawyers book and i think it will hold he said  deringham took up the paper and again there was the little movement at the corners of his eye as he read  i henry alton of somasco ranch being now in sound health and as clear of head as usual but about to start on a journey to which there are risks attached hereby bequeath in the event of disaster overtaking me the estate of carnaby england with all its rents and revenues of any kind whatever to which i am entitled to miss alice deringham daughter of   in case of my decease during the next six months the abovementioned ralph deringham and my partner charles seaforth of somasco british columbia will acting as trustees either dispose of the estate for the benefit of miss deringham or install her in possession of it at her discretion  there was a little more to the purpose and deringham read all of it this is very generous he said  no said alton its only just and it cant be very generous because carnaby wouldnt be much use to me if i dont come back  i could of course revoke this thing if i do  deringham said nothing  there was a good deal he wished to say but for once words failed him and when he went out with the will in his pocket his face had grown a trifle grey  yet though he suffered grievously in that moment he was conscious of something in his brain that throbbed in time to the refrain alice deringham mistress of carnaby     chapter xv  on the trail  daylight was just creeping through the rain and thin mist rolled about the pines when early one morning alton who was setting out to find the silver stood upon the verandah of somasco ranch  the trickle from the eaves dripped upon two packhorses waiting in the mire below and tom of okanagan the big axeman who had been hewing with alton when deringham first met him at the ranch stood motionless with their bridles in his hand apparently as oblivious of the rain as the pines behind him  seaforth was at the head of the stairway with a pack upon his back and the barrel of a marlin rifle sloped across his shoulders beyond lay a blurred vista of driving rain and dripping trees  early as it was deringham and his daughter were also upon the verandah and the girl shivered a little as she gazed northwards into the mist  it was a very wild and lonely region the rolling vapours hid and she knew the men who ventured into it at that season of the year would find their courage and endurance tested to the uttermost there were but three of them but she had discovered already that they were a little more than average men and a glance at their burdens and those of the dripping beasts was as reassuring as their bearing  it was evident that they knew what their task would be and had prepared for it with a thoroughness that overlooked nothing  tents blankets flourbags cooking utensils and hide packages were hung where man and horse could carry them with a minimum of effort  the place for every strap had been exactly determined and there was an absence of concern and a quietness about the men that had its meaning  presently seaforth descended the stairway with deringham tom of okanagan moved forward with the horses and alton was left alone with alice deringham  neither of them spoke for a moment and it was noticeable that the girl who knew that silence is often more expressive than speech and had acquired some skill in avoiding unpleasant situations was for the moment unable to break it  it was alton who spoke first and his voice was a trifle too even  you will be gone when we come back he said  the girl noticed he did not look at her and fancied she understood the reason  this was a strong man but it seemed he knew there were limits to his strength  yes she said  the time we spent at somasco has passed very pleasantly but we shall go down to vancouver in a day or two  it seemed very trivial for alice deringham was quite aware that this might be the last time she would look upon her companion but she had bidden farewell to men of his kind before  they had worn their nations khaki and alton wore deerskin and jean with the shovel girded about him in place of the sword but she knew there was in him the same spirit that animated them and that it was a silent spirit made most terribly manifest in action  i hope you will have a good time down there he said  the girl glancing at him in sidelong fashion noticed his curious little smile  oh yes i think i shall she said  i shall expect to hear you have come back with the silver  alton nodded  yes he said  when i come back i shall have found the silver  he spoke quietly and there was nothing unusual in his voice but glancing at his eyes the girl understood what he had left unspoken  if this man did not return with his object accomplished she felt it would be because he would not come back at all  then there was another silence more oppressive still until alton held out his hand  i must be going he said  alice deringham was conscious of a little thrill as her fingers rested in his big hard palm and when he released them waited for a moment with a curious expectancy  you will take my good wishes with you she said  alton bent his head  i am doing this thing because i feel i have to he said very slowly  i could come and see you at vancouver when i come back  the light was dim but the girl moved her head a little so that the man did not see her face  yes she said if it would please you  alton smiled gravely as he swung down his wet hat  then he said i will come  he went down the stairway next moment there was a soft thud of hoofs splashing in the mud and in another minute he had gone and alice deringham glancing towards the bush saw only sliding mist and driving rain until her father stopped close by her  there is evidently a good deal in heredity he said  our rancher kinsman occasionally makes it very evident that he is altonof somascobut there are also times when he appears to understand what would be becoming in alton of carnaby  now deringham may have been right and he may equally have been wrong for while alton of somasco had doubtless inherited something from the generations of landholders who had gone before him the man animated by a single purpose who has grappled with untrammelled nature subduing the weaknesses of his body and bearing hardship peril and toil not infrequently attains to something of the greatness which is the birthright of humanity and not confined to the english gentleman  alice deringham however smiled ironically at her father  did you expect anything else from him she said  i wonder how long it will be before he comes back again  deringham did not answer her but there was a curious look in his face and he seemed to shiver  it was however very cold and the rain drove into the verandah  it was ten days later and the little party clearing a path for the horses through a chaos of fallen trunks and thickets had made with difficulty some six or eight miles a day when alton was awakened one night by the trampling of the beasts  he sat up in his blankets and listened intently but could only hear the hoarse roar of a river and the little cold breeze moaning in the pines  a man new to that region would have lain down again but alton had taught himself to understand a little of the nature of the beasts that worked for him and when he heard another movement crept to the tent door  looking out he could see the pines lifting their spires of blackness against the night where they followed the ridge of a hill  that was on the one hand but on the other they rolled vague and blurred down into a vast hollow from which the mist was drifting  the sound of the river rose reverberating from its profundity of shadow for it had cost the party most of a day to climb to the height they had pitched the camp upon  there was but little light overhead though here and there a star blinked fitfully and alton shivered again for it was very cold and but little past the hour when mans vitality sinks to its lowest  raising himself a trifle he listened again with ears that could distinguish each component of the nocturnal harmonies  no one but a bushman could have heard them but to those who toil in the stillness of that forestshrouded land the silence is but the perfect blending of musical sound  there was the faintest of crisp rattles as the withered needles shook down from a twig and then a sigh and a whisper along the dim black vault above as though a spirit hovered above the sleeping earth  alton heard and knew it was not the wind for the little breeze had paused while the river made it answer in subdued antiphones he had dwelt in close contact with the soil he sprang from and there were times when he felt his nature thrill in faint response to the life there is in what the men of the cities deem inanimate things  then a leaf sailed past the tent and he knew what tree it came from as it touched the earth and strained his ears the more wondering what he listened for as he and others of his kind had done in the bush before  it could be he almost felt nothing material and yet though they did not move now he knew the horses were also listening  that had its meaning for man cannot measure his keenest senses with those of the beasts of the field  the little breeze awoke again and shook fantastic harmonies out of the shivering trees and one horse stamped the other wheeled and snorted and alton sprang back into the tent as somewhere in the bushes there commenced a sound that suggested the snarling of a great cat  it was possibly unfortunate he was not a trifle less prompt because otherwise he might have noticed something slightly unusual in the sound  as it was however he fell over okanagan tom who being a very similar man to him and not as yet wholly awake asked no questions but gripped him silently and proceeded to crush the breath out of him  alton was sinewy but he was almost choking before he freed one hand and drove it into a tender portion of his assailants frame  then with a little laugh tom of okanagan flung him across the tent  great columbus  its good i found out in time he said  alton was almost speechless still and while he gasped the object he had fallen on moved strenuously beneath him  you might get up it said  its a somewhat unprotected place youre sitting on  confound you both said alton  hand me the rifle  seaforth afterwards remembered that he did not ask where the rifle was which would have been the question put by most men and as he held it out felt the stock touch altons hand  then there was a little rattle and as seaforth floundered to his feet a weird snarling cry broke out alton was out of the tent in a moment but seaforth afterwards recalled the fact that they were all moving when he heard the sound and tom of okanagan apparently groping for his axe and throwing things about  he also decided that it might have been better if one had sat still and listened but it is not given to human beings to always do the most appropriate thing  alton instinctively avoided the tentline nearest the opening which was unfortunate because the peg had drawn a trifle and seaforth had moved it after his comrade had driven it  it therefore came about that the line was not where he had last seen it and he went down headlong while the rifle rolled away from him  just there there was a rush and a drumming of hoofs and before alton could pick himself up the horses were sweeping in a panic through the shadowy bush  anything the worse harry said seaforth  we had better get off at once while theres the sound to guide us  alton laughed softly as he did now and then when he might have been disconcerted  i cant beat a cayuse charley and i dont think youll hear them very long he said  tom of okanagan grunted approval and the three stood still until the drumming of hoofs was lost in the silence of the bush  theyre gone said seaforth  do you mean to do nothing  yes said alton  i am going to stop right where i am until theres light enough to trail them by  do you know anything better tom  no said the man from okanagan  still im not quite as good at thinking just now as i would like to be  the last time i felt like this was when siwash bob took the back of the axe to me  i figure that was a panther  yes said alton it was a panther  well said okanagan did you ever hear of one that went for a horse close up with a tent before  i have said alton seen a panther that turned on a man who wanted to get a shot at it in the undergrowth  oh yes said okanagan  hed got something hed caught for dinner in the bushes but its kind of curious that beasts come round and howl at us  anyway we cant find out nothing until the daylight comes  they crawled back into the tent and it was characteristic of them that although the loss of the horses might traverse all their plans they went to sleep again and awakened as the beasts do instinctively when the first light crept over the shoulder of the hill  ten minutes later alton had the fire lighted and sat down beside it with the frypan in his hand  the recovery of the horses was a question of importance but it might well entail a days journey and he knew that to commence it without his breakfast would be distinctly unwise of him  accordingly he tranquilly held the pan while as the mists melted and the awakening earth put on shape and form there was unrolled before him a wondrous transformation scene  when he had last awakened the wilderness had lain formless wrapped in blackness primitive and pagan  now the great pines rising row and row from the hollow pointed heavenwards with all their sombre spires and led the eye upwards ever over the rock that lost its greyness and glinted to the gleam of snow far up in the empyrean that was sundered from earth by the vapours and wholly spiritual  alton realized dimly a little of the motive of the scene and felt that the world was good for laying down the frypan he stood up stretching his arms above his head as he rejoiced in the strength of his vigorous manhood  still like most of the bushmen he did not express his feelings in speech  charley youll be slow for your wedding  turn out the porks done he said  they lost no time but they did not eat in haste and alton glanced at seaforth when the meal was done  youll stop right here charley by the tent he said  i cant quite tell when tom and i will be back again  then without another word he strode into the bush and seaforth who first washed the breakfastcans proceeded to make a circuit of the camp  he found the spot where the horses had been tethered with but little difficulty and also the hole out of which one of them had drawn the picketpeg  the redwoods which towered above him were vast of girth and it would have needed a long halter to encompass them while there was no branch for sixty feet or so  still though he searched diligently he did not find any print which might have been left by the paw of a panther and regretted that there was a ridge of rock outcrop behind the camp  that beast was hungry or he wouldnt have come so near he said  it was near dusk when alton came back leading one weary horse and darkness had closed down before tom of okanagan strode in with nothing but the packrope he had set out with  seaforth had supper ready and no questions were asked until they had eaten  then alton stretching himself at full length beside the fire lighted his pipe  you found nothing after i left you where the trail split tip he said  no said okanagan  anyway not for more than a mile  ran into rock and gravel and lost the trail  crawled round in rings most of the day and couldnt strike it again  guess the beast swam the river and lit out for home  well said alton dryly i found more than that for i ran into a mans trail and it wasnt very old  i think he had long boots on and one was down at the heel  i spent an hour over it and when it led me into rock came back again  a man said seaforth  i fancied there was nobody but ourselves between here and somasco  what could he be doing  i dont know said alton  did you find the panthers trail  no said seaforth  rock again  alton said nothing for a minute and when he spoke his voice had a curious tone  well he said gravely the rock belongs to this place and we dont so theres no use kicking but it would have been convenient if there had been less of it  now its quite possible that a few pounds of grub and a load of blankets may make a big difference before we get home again and if we cant trail that horse tomorrow youll go back to somasco for another one  well cache the load somewhere here and make a big smoke for you at every camping  that means the loss of a fortnight anyway said seaforth  time is valuable with the winter coming on  alton nodded  still it cant be helped he said  ill lose no time said seaforth who had been watching his comrade are you quite sure you have told us all harry  alton slowly drew a strip of hide from beneath him and passed it across  seaforth and okanagan bent over it together their faces showing intent in the light of the fire while alton laughed softly as he watched them  what do you make of that he said  seaforth glanced round sharply  its a trifle curious  that hides thick and yet the beast has evidently broken it but it pulled up the peg  did you find the peg said alton and okanagan swept his glance across the faces before him  seaforths expressed bewilderment altons was grim  i found one said seaforthjulius caesars  yes said alton dryly   there should have been another and a horse that breaks his tether cant pull out the peg  still i dont think he broke it  but said seaforth the thing is broken  tom of okanagan smiled in a curious fashion while alton reached out and laid his finger on the hide  one cant be sure of anything he said still one could fancy that had felt the knife before it snapped  there was silence for almost a minute and the shadows of the great firs seemed to close in upon the camp  then alton rose up and stretched his limbs wearily  i am kind of tired he said  theres a good deal to be done tomorrow     chapter xvi  cause for anxiety  there was no sign of the missing horse next day and altons face was grave when he returned to camp at noon  tom of okanagan arrived an hour or two later and shook his head when seaforth glanced at him inquiringly  rock again  right down to the river he said  alton nodded but did not ask if his companion had effected a crossing there was a good deal of water coming down he said  oh yes said okanagan  it was cold  boulders all along on the other side  now if the beast got over hell be lighting out for home and there are some of us better than others at picking up a trail  seaforth understood him and the implication pleased him though it was not openly expressed  had you any especial reason when you asked me to go harry he asked  alton smiled dryly  i had but i dont know that it was a very good one  you would sooner stay up here  what do you think tom  of course said seaforth and alton nodded silently while okanagan rose to his feet  now you have asked me charleys right he said  ill be moving south in ten minutes  he had set off in somewhat less and the men he left behind stood still listening until the sound of his footsteps had sunk into the stillness then seaforth glanced at his comrade and alton laughed  its lonely charley he said  i dont know that you were wise but well get a move on and cache some of these provisions  seaforth was glad of something to do  three had started from somasco and already one had gone while he felt a slight sense of depression as he glanced north towards the wilderness of rock and snow their path led into  he did not however tell his comrade so and they toiled for an hour before alton carefully smoothing off the soil that covered what they had hidden strewed it with cedartwigs  step it off charley twenty paces east to the rock with the big peak over the shoulder of the hill he said  seaforth walked straight forward with measured strides  a foot over he said  alton nodded  go back and make your traverse he said  forty north with the gully over the fork of the river  forty said seaforth and a half  well said alton whatever you dont remember hold tight on to that  seaforth felt the depression he had shaken off return to him  there are he said slowly few things that you forget  alton glancing at him understood and then turned his eyes towards the snow of the wilderness  its the man that cant look forward who gets left he said  now something might stop me coming back with you for that grub  seaforth said nothing and he was a little graver than usual as they packed the tent and blankets on the remaining horse and an extra load upon their own backs  a good many things might happen up there in the north including snowslides floods and frost or the downward rush of great trees in a brulee  that was possibly why he commenced a little jingling song of the musichalls when they took the trail again but the white grandeur of the great peaks silenced him or his breath gave out as they floundered into fernchoked forest which was further garnished with the horrible devils club  seaforth fell into a clump of it and for several minutes his comments were venomous for though he had been taught restraint in england and had further tuition in canada of a grimmer description little can be expected from the man who is gripped by that satanic thorn  it was half an hour before he went on again with his garments ensanguined as the result of altons treatment with the knife and he gasped with relief when after a march of four miles which occupied most of what was left of the day they came out into the more open spaces of a big brulee  some time in the hot autumn a fire had passed that way and the great trees towered above them stripped and blackened columns that seemed to stretch between earth and sky  there was no limb left them and they rose majestic in their cylindrical symmetry in apparently endless battalions a vista of plutonic desolation  underfoot there was charcoal and feathery ashes that whirled aloft and sprinkling the men with a fine grey powder slowly settled again  alton was white in ten minutes a gritty mire defiled the horses sides and seaforth floundered coughing ankledeep at times with livid circles where he had rubbed the grime away about his eyes  there was no sign of beast or bird and the shuffle of weary feet and thud of hoofs rose muffled out of a great silence until there was a stupendous crash somewhere in the distance  the charred trunks took up the sound and while they flung it from one to another alton sprang forward and smote the packhorse with his fist  jump he said hoarsely  next moment seaforth felt himself hurled forward and glancing over his shoulder when he found his footing again saw a big trunk tilt a little it seemed to hang quivering for a second or two then toppled further and with a great humming came rushing down  then there was a stunning crash and he stood gasping deafened and bereft of sight amidst a stifling cloud of dust which swept into his mouth and nostrils and almost suffocated him  when he could see anything again the horse was quivering and the dust still rising from a shapeless pile a few yards behind him  alton who was black and grey to the ankles took his hat off shook it and put it on again in a curious unconcerned fashion which suggested that he did it unconsciously  those six feet make a big difference said he  as he spoke there was a crash a little farther behind them another ahead and they stood still alton gripping the horses bridle seaforth staring about him and scarcely breathing while concussion answered concussion until there was a silence that was almost bewildering again  now said alton quietly well get out of this though i dont know that we need worry because that should have cleared out the shaky ones  when one goes more of them generally follow  it wouldnt have grieved hallam of the tyee very much if we had been a yard or two farther back  seaforth was possibly a little shaken for he answered as he might not otherwise have done  i wonder if it would have displeased anybody else he said  alton jerked the horse to a standstill and looked at him  i dont think you meant that charley  seaforth noticed the glint in his comrades eyes and departed a little from veracity  no he said  there are times when a man is apt to talk a little at random  alton nodded  youll not forget again  the man is a kinsman of mine  seaforth smote the packhorse because he did not quite know what to answer  he had vague suspicions concerning deringham but was quite aware that it would be inappropriate for him to express them  also having seen a little of the smoother side of life in england he knew a trifle more about young women of miss deringhams description than his comrade did  he admired the girl as most men would have done but the qualities alton had evidently endowed her with were not especially apparent to him  he also fancied that miss deringham would have found some of them distinctly irksome now and then  it was dark when they came out of the brulee and pitched camp amidst the boulders beside a lonely lake  the mists crawled about the pines that shut it in and its surface was seamed with white by a little bitter wind  sombre clouds rolled lower down the surrounding hills and seaforth was glad to stretch his weary limbs under the lee of a big boulder while the fire snapped and crackled in front of him  i wonder when we shall see this lake again he said  alton who was busy with the frypan turned and stirred the fire and the sparks and smoke whirled about them before a stinging blast  i dont know he said glancing at a smear of whiteness that swept athwart the lake  it depends upon the weather and im not pleased with that tonight  you see the chinook winds would keep off the snow  of course said seaforth who knew that the warm breezes from the pacific occasionally drive back the rigorous winter that turns the northern portion of the mountain province into a white desolation they usually do but well surmise that in place of them we get the backdraughts from the pole  then said alton dryly it would be a good deal nicer down at somasco  are you sorry you didnt stop there charley  seaforth threw an armful of fir wood upon the fire with somewhat unnecessary violence  you are not so pleasant as you might be tonight he said  alton rose and stretched himself  i wouldnt worry about me  it seems to me we are both of us feeling lonely and thats curious because when we had him okanagan wasnt any special kind of a companionable man  there was a time when you would have been driving to dinner with a diamond pin stuck in you and silk stockings on about this time charley  seaforth laughed  i scarcely think either of the things are in common masculine use he said  there however was a time when i walked into a british columbian mining camp with my whole wardrobe on my back and i think fifty cents in my pocket  still what you ask me suggests a not quite unwarranted question  what are you going to do with carnaby harry  i dont know yet  im not sure its mine you see  your grandfather left it you said seaforth and it was his  yes said alton gravely  he did but he tacked a kind of condition on to it andwell thats about all i can tell you charley  of course and seaforth smiled curiously  i would not have asked you only i am your partner and when youre alton of carnaby you will have no more use for me  alton seemed to sigh  i am he said simply alton of somasco and i fancy now and then that was all i was meant to be  you are my partner charley and it would take a good deal more than carnaby to separate you and me  seaforth smiled again though there was more than amusement in his face while alton who stopped beside the fire and filled two cans from the kettle shook his head reproachfully as he flung their contents into the bush  thats what comes of talking too much  you have forgotten to put in the tea he said  they lay down early rolled in the blankets with the tent across them for the wind that lashed the lake rendered it advisable not to erect it but it was some time before seaforth went to sleep  he fancied he understood altons assertion that he was not sure carnaby was his for he knew his comrade was capable under certain conditions of almost reasonless generosity  nor did he desire a better partner but he was not sure that in the event of alton transferring his activities to england their friendship would be approved of by a possible mistress of carnaby  women seaforth knew regarded these things differently  he slept at last and awakening felt the tent heavy upon him  there was also a curious rawness in the atmosphere and he glanced about him with a little gasp of consternation  the hillside gleamed coldly above him under the creeping light and only the pines were sombre for the earth was white with snow  get up harry he said with something in his voice that roused his comrade suddenly  alton rose and his face became a trifle grim  this he said quietly is going to mix up things  well have breakfast quick as you can get it  they were on their way in half an hour struggling up the hillside under the pines until at last the trees grew smaller towards the timber line  then they floundered painfully over what had been bare slopes of rock and was now a waste of snow with a dazzling field of whiteness between them and the blue  up there the frost was biting and the snow lay fine as flour blowing in thin wisps from under the horses hoofs while the mens jean and deerhide were sprinkled with glittering particles  the wind dropped towards sundown and when climbing a great hill shoulder they dipped again to the forest the snows flamed crimson against a pitiless blueness out of which there seemed to fall a devastating cold  diamonds glinted upon the shivering pines sound seemed frozen and there was a great impressive stillness across which the jingle of the bridle rang stridently when alton pulled the horse up near the foremost of the trees  this he said softly is where i found jimmy  he was sitting there with his rifle on his knee looking straight at me as though there were lots of things he could tell me  seaforth shivered a little  he had the specimens with him  alton nodded  yes he said  he had his grip right on the deerhide bag as though he didnt want to let me have them and i had to think of mrs jimmy while i took them from him  it didnt seem quite fair of jimmy because they havent much use for silver in the country the long trail leads to  seaforth glanced down into the great hollow that fell away beneath them and up at the glittering snow  you were alone i think  i was said alton grimly  and most halffrozen  it was that cold there was ice in the big rapid and i hadnt had much to eat for several days  seaforth shivered again as he pictured that strange encounter between the dead and the living  jimmy the prospector having taken his secret with him to a region where silver is valueless had sat within a few paces from where he stood with his fingers clenched upon the bag and an awful disregard of the rights of the woman he had left behind in his frozen face  seaforth could also picture his comrade stooping over him with averted eyes but swift resolute movements for when there was work to be done alton of somasco was not the man to turn aside  it must have been a trifle horrible he said  altons eyes closed a little  it wasnt nice  still there was mrs jimmy working down at the store and that secret belonged to her  he stopped abruptly with a little gesture as of one shaking off a painful memory and looked down across the climbing pines to the lake in the hollow behind them  it still shone steelily and apparently not very far away though it had cost the men strenuous toil all day to traverse the distance that divided them from it  seaforth who watched him noticed something unusual in his attitude for his comrade stood very still with eyes that never for a moment wavered from one point in the valley  do you see anything down there he said  yes said alton grimly  i see smoke  there is nothing astonishing in that said seaforth  i damped down the bark well and raked up the soil to shut off the draught  there was a big pile of wet green twigs harry  alton smiled curiously  you made one fire  yes said seaforth wondering  we dont usually make two  his sight was not equal to his comrades but he could see a smear of blue vapour curl athwart the pines for he had banked the fire with wet fuel so that it should smoke all day in case tom of okanagan had overtaken the horse and was following their trail  well said alton dryly there is another one  seaforth swept his gaze twice across the valley before he saw anything beyond the crowded pines and then for a moment he caught sight of a second faint streak athwart their sombreness  it was a mere film that vanished and rose again illusory and almost imperceptible but for some reason it troubled him  it might be tom he said  alton laughed in a curious fashion  i dont think it is  one fire would be enough for tom to make his supper with and that ones nearer us  but said seaforth i can scarcely see the smoke  alton raised one hand impatiently  no he said  whoever made that fire didnt want you to and theres no need to make much smoke if you keep clear of sap and twigs  seaforths face grew grave  is there any reason why you cant tell me a little more  if the man would sooner we did not see it what did he make the fire for  alton smiled grimly  i dont know any more but a man must eat he said  in the meanwhile it seems to me that fellow understands his business and ive a kind of notion we shall hear from him or see him presently  seaforth glanced back along the bluegrey trail that led towards the bare hill shoulder which rose a mere ridge of the great mountain side that swept round the hollow  there is no controverting that and he neednt have much difficulty in finding us if he wants to  is there anything to be done he said  no said alton dryly  if there was id sit down here and wait for him but theres nothing to stop a free miner prospecting round where it suits him in this country     chapter xvii  alone  the frost held for two days and the men made small progress through the dusty snow  on the third it grew softer as they floundered wearily down into a valley and seaforth was aching in every limb when at last they halted at the edge of a river  not far below them it plunged frothing into a gloomy canon and the roar of its turmoil came out of the thin white vapour which curled through the stupendous portals of streamworn stone  seaforth felt moist and generally uncomfortable as well as weary for it was humid and a trifle warmer now while his long boots were soaked and at every step he dragged after him a clogging weight of snow  he leaned against a cedar glad to rest a while and glanced inquiringly at his comrade  alton however showed no sign of fatigue  he stood with the halfmelted snow he had fallen in clinging about his deerskin jacket and trickling slowly down his tattered leggings the bridle of the wornout horse in his hand and a slight perplexity in his eyes  now i wonder if that will make a road to the south he said reflectively pointing to the canon  i dont know said seaforth dryly  so far as my opinion goes i scarcely think it will but isnt that a little outside the question just now a road to the north would be more to the purpose  well said alton a few sticks of giant powder here and there would make a difference and one could do a good deal with a few score of men used to the pick and drill  it would also said seaforth take a good many dollars to pay them  alton laughed as he turned and pointed upstream darkness was not far away and the river came down deep and slow out of the dimness  dark pines rolled up the hillsides that shut it in and wisps of grey vapour drifted about them  there are he said dollars enough to build a road right down to vancouver in those hills and by and by one of two men will have his hands on them  isnt that a somewhat curious way of putting it said his companion  well said alton there is as usual a reason  whichever of those men comes out on top will not have much use for the other fellow  in the meanwhile well be getting on  theres a canoe under the big boulders yonder and the island should make the horse a corral  seaforth said nothing though he thought a good deal  he guessed that one of the men alluded to was his comrade and the other hallam and there was a grim suggestiveness in the formers simple explanation for it seemed that alton understood quarter would not be given in the struggle he had embarked upon  there was also something disconcerting in the fact that they found the canoe where he indicated  that it had lain there since jimmy the prospector who lay sleeping on the heights above them had last used it emphasized the desolation of the region they were pushing their way into and seaforth once more felt a curious depression as he glanced up the lonely valley  it stretched away before them a road to the unknown and he fancied that a future which was fraught with great and perilous possibilities lay hidden beyond the drifting mist  they had it seemed set out upon a journey which led farther than the silver jimmy had found but knowing that his comrade would go on to the end of it seaforth shook off his misgivings and assisted him to load and launch the craft  they made fast the packhorse by a halter and in ten minutes had landed the beast upon an island  then somewhat to seaforths regret they took up the paddles and went on again  alton smiled curiously as he glanced towards the firs that slid by them halfseen through the mist  were taking jimmys road  he was the last man to come down here and i wonder what he was thinking about he said  there would have been an ice fringe along the bank and jimmy was hungry  i think he knew he wouldnt get through and it was only because of the woman he held on so tight  seaforth shivered a little as his fancy called up the scene  the starving man crouching halffrozen with the paddle clenched in stiffened fingers had watched those trees slide by him knowing that on their speed depended his fastfailing chance of life  he had seaforth fancied stared at the crawling boulders with despair in his dimming eyes and the weary man turned towards his comrade almost savagely  cant you think of anything a little more pleasant he said  alton smiled gravely  it comes to all of us one day and the trail of the treasureseeker leads most often to the unknown hunting grounds he said  we have got to keep faith with jimmy  he did his best and i think he knew i would come up here after him  seaforth said nothing further but bent over his paddle until an hour later they landed on a point and set up the tent  neither was communicative over the supper and seaforth went early to sleep  the last thing he saw was alton sitting a black motionless figure apparently staring into the darkness from the door of the tent with his face towards the north  it was raining when he awakened next morning  the tent was saturated the fire ill to light and that day was spent in unremitting toil  the stream ran strong against them and seaforths wet hands grew blistered from the grasp of the paddle and his knees raw from the rasp of the crafts bottom as he swung with the weary blade  hour by hour the rain beat on them and the pines that crawled out of it went very slowly by while it was almost a relief to stand upright now and then and with strenuous effort drive the frail shell up against the swirl of the slower rapids with long fir poles  at times they were swept down sideways before the poles could find hold again and fought gasping and panting for minutes to regain what they had lost in as many seconds  now and then it was also needful to drag the canoe out flounder amidst boulders or through tangled forest with her contents and then hewing a path here and there with the axe painfully drag her round but portage after portage was left behind and they were still fighting their way yard by yard upstream while the rain came down  seaforth also knew that it often rains for several weeks in that country when the chinook wind that melts the snow sets in  darkness was closing down when at last they drew the canoe out upon a shelving bank and dragged themselves ashore  seaforth was too chilled and wet to sleep and his eyes had scarcely closed when alton shook him and he rose up shivering and stiff in every joint to commence the task again  it was fortunately easier that day for the river spread out into a narrow winding lake and there was less current against them  still the rain did not abate and the afternoon was not quite spent when alton pointed to a little cove  we havent made much today but unless youre anxious to go on that would make a good campingplace he said deprecatingly  now there was a time when i wouldnt have thought of stopping yet but i guess too much good living has taken a little of the stiffening out of me  seaforth slowly unclenched one hand from the redsmeared paddlehaft and glanced at it  if you feel diffident dont worry about me he said  eight hours hard labour while youre wet through is in my opinion quite enough for anybody  alton ran the canoe in and seaforth staggered a little when he walked ashore  the water was draining from him and it was several minutes before he could straighten himself  there were pools amidst the boulders and when they had splashed through these to the edge of the forest fallen needles and withered fern were spongy while the dark branches shook down water on them as they swung to the chilly blast seaforth groaned now and then as he struggled with the tent while alton tramped into the forest with the axe but he came back presently with an armful of resinous chips and his comrades spirits rose a trifle when a crackling fire flung its red flicker through the creeping shadows  it hissed as the gusts lashed it with the rain but the blackened and dinted kettle boiled and while they ate and drank the smokeflavoured tea a little warmth crept with the pungent vapour into the tent  the bush was dim and shadowy before the meal was finished but alton flung fresh branches on the fire and the blaze that whirled aloft rent a track of radiance through the rain and called up the vague outlines of the columnar trunks  then he stretched himself out upon an armful of dripping twigs and his garments steamed about him as he lighted an old blackened pipe  seaforth lay amidst the packages feeling blissfully drowsy as the warmth crept slowly into his aching limbs overhead the pine branches wailed in wild harmonies and the showers they shook down beat upon the tent  it seems to me this journey might have begun better said alton presently  seaforth nodded full concurrence  it would be a little difficult to imagine it commencing very much worse  wouldnt it have been wiser if you had waited a little longer harry  alton seemed to notice something unusual in his companions inflection you will have to talk straighter charley he said  seaforth who saw the glint in his eyes laughed  i merely meant that spring is coming and it would be a trifle warmer then  im inclined to be a little cantankerous tonight but of course it is not my business how long you stayed at the ranch  no said alton dryly i dont think it is  spring would have been nicer but you see hallam was crowding me  did anything else strike you charley  nothing of much importance said seaforth smiling  only that while we lie shivering here hallam is probably dining in state in the big hotel at vancouver  jingling glasses good wine light and warmth flowers and silver on the table  the contrasts a little exasperating  alton glanced at the saturated canvas and his steaming clothes while seaforth for no apparent reason stretched out one foot and kicked over the dinted kettle  there are folks who would think thats only fit he said  mr hallam is one of the men who are building up the future greatness of this wonderful country  at least thats what they called him at the last big speechmaking but i dont quite see what good it would do us if you kicked the bottom of that kettle in charley  now its curious how a thing thats once started goes on  jimmy took a notion that there was silver here and that drew me in as well as mrs jimmy  then you came along and presently it got hold of hallam  the somasco consolidated has got drawn in toonow there are you and i with only the almighty knows how much upon our shoulders up here in the rain and snow  seaforth glanced at his comrade reflectively as he said i was wondering if there was anybody else  altons face grew suddenly impassive  oh yes he said  theres another man i dont know the one who lighted the fire  hes back there somewhere  seaforth said nothing for a minute or two but as he glanced about him the shadows seemed to grow darker beyond the flickering radiance of the fire and the roar of wind in the branches angrier  he had been a prey to halfformed suspicions of late and there was something sinister in the thought of that man who followed them  harry he said presently you have got most of the things you wanted so far  yes said alton quietly  it wasnt always easy and they didnt come to me but i knew what i wanted and i usually got it  seaforth made a sign of comprehension  did it ever occur to you that you had probably as much already as is good for you  alton glanced at him with halfclosed eyes  a little plainer charley  you have somasco the liking of all the ranchers down the valley the timber rights and mill  you have also carnaby and most folks would think you a fortunate man  now the man who wants too much is occasionally sorry when he gets it  altons eyes glinted  i have a partner too who doesnt know where to stop he said  seaforth met his comrades gaze steadily  this he said reflectively is a good country  in fact i dont know a better one for the man who wants to live as he was meant to in the wind and sun watching what he has worked for slowly grow  is it a little thing harry to see the oats and timothy where the forest had been to clear a new way for the river with giant powder and hear the big wheels humming where there was only a frothing rapid  orchards barns and homestead built by your own labour horses and herds of cattle all your own and by and by the railroad coming through to bring you the long dreamed of prosperity  its alluring harry  the glint was a trifle plainer in altons eyes and his lean fingers were closed together  i dont quite see where that trail leads to he said quietly  seaforth laughed a little  it is good to rise when the sun is creeping above the firs and plunge down into an icecold pool  better still to lie on the verandah tired in body tranquil in mind when the snows are fading and your work is done knowing that every redwood hewn and new ploughfurrow driven has been so much added to the prosperity of this province and the dominion  it isnt a bad lifethis one you were meant for harry  no said alton slowly  there are times when im a very thankful man  well there is another one and i have seen very tired men playing at being amused by the trifles that sickened them  they had however kept up the game so long that the manhood they were once proud of was only a memory  there are a good many of them in the old country and some of them have sacrificed all they had for the one thing that wasnt good for them  it was too late when they found it out harry  altons face was grim  it would he said be a pity if you and i fell out charley  seaforth laughed in a curious fashion  it would but i scarcely think we shall  you and i are partners and a little more and i will keep silent now i have spoken  alton said nothing but sat smoking and staring at the fire until seaforth rolled himself in his damp blankets and sank into not altogether refreshing sleep  a misty light was creeping into the tent when he was awakened by the thudding of his companions axe and rising stiffly with the ache at the hipjoint which every bushman knows went out shivering  coffee said alton  i left it in the deerhide bag in the canoe  seaforths limbs were too stiff to be much use to him yet and he blundered amidst the boulders falling over one or two before he reached the shingle where they had partly drawn out the canoe  then he stood still staring about him and saw only the greentinted water sliding by under the uncertain light and the pines on the other side growing a trifle plainer through the mist  turning he hastened along the shingle until a shelf of rock shut it in and then back to the tent again  alton laid down the axe for there was something in his comrades face that troubled him  have you got it he asked  no said seaforth very quietly  you told me the bag was in the canoe  of course said alton  well wasnt it there  i dont know said seaforth  i couldnt find the canoe  alton said nothing further but stumbled in haste towards the river seaforth followed him more slowly and alton stood very still when he found nothing but boulders and shingle  then he stooped and bent over a little depression in the pebbles and when he rose again his face was impassive  the water has risen since last night but im not sure that accounts for it he said  the bank slopes a little but we pulled most of her out  i think we pulled the whole of her clear said seaforth quietly  alton stood silent for almost a minute with his right hand clenched then he said slowly youll have to go down and look for her while i push on charley  seaforth was about to speak but he saw his comrades eyes and did not express himself as he had meant to  yes he said  i dont know that i shall find her  the two men looked at each other until alton moved his head  still one of us must try he said  take all you can carry and a rifle ill load up as much as im fit for and well cache the rest  youll come on after me or join tom as you think best  seaforth smiled a little  ill come on and even if i sacrifice something else ill take the rifle  alton said nothing and for an hour they were busy about the camp then as they stood a moment loaded like beasts of burden under the dripping pines seaforth held out his hand  harry are you wise he said  i dont know said alton simply but im going on  it was noticeable that they shook hands which they were not in the habit of doing and that there was a very faint but perceptible tremor in seaforths voice  goodbye he said  well said alton with a smile which seemed to lack heartiness  i wouldnt put it that way  he swung forward with his face towards the north but the smile faded and his fingers closed on the rifle when he heard seaforth struggling southwards through the bush  two of them gone now he said  i wonder if that is what the other fellow wanted     chapter xviii  in the wilderness  dusk was closing down on the valley and the rain had ceased when alton unstrapped his load and stood with aching shoulders amidst the dripping pines  he could hear the rattle of the twigs that met and brushed through the shrill wailing of the wind about the sombre spires that pierced the growing darkness far above him and the harmonic murmuring that rose and fell in cadence along the dim vaulted roof there was however nothing else beyond the growl of a rapid somewhere up the valley and stretching out his arms wearily he stooped with a little smile that was grim rather than mirthful and caught up the axe  now one can usually hear the thudding of the axe a mile or more in the stillness of the woods that is not silence to the bushmans ear  their voice is always musical and the sounds that man makes jar through its harmonies but only a forest rancher or free prospector would have caught the muffled sound that was lost in the song of the pines a few score yards from altons camp  he knew where to find the resinous knots with their sticky exudations and was a master of the axe while it was noticeable that when the fire commenced to crackle he stood still and listened again before he went down to the river with the kettle  nor did he at once return into the light but slipped for a moment behind a widegirthed trunk  it was only a deer he heard moving along the hillside above him and there was nothing visible but the row of stupendous columns that appeared and vanished as the red light rose and sank  alton set the kettle down amidst the flame and unrolling one of the packages laid out his supper  it was prepared and eaten in twenty minutes and refilling the kettle for breakfast he lay smoking in a hollow between the great roots which crawled away from a cedartrunk  nothing moved in the bush now but a bear that was grubbing amidst the wild cabbage in a swamp and the weary man stretching out his hand instinctively to touch the rifle that lay within his reach gave himself up to thought  he had also much to occupy him and being a somewhat systematic person he proceeded to consider the questions that demanded an answer in what appeared to him their order of importance  it was characteristic that in face of recent events he placed the probable whereabouts of the silver first  this was at the first glance a somewhat difficult problem  in front of him lay the wilderness a trackless chaos of forest and rock and snow wherein he had to find the scar made by a stick of giant powder or the scratching of the shovel  there were however points to guide the searcher and alton could deduce a good deal from each of them  jimmy the prospector had it was evident perished of hunger and exhaustion for alton had traced the last stages of his journey backwards through the snow and the grim story of human endurance and anguish was plainly legible  here jimmy had fallen there lain still and then dragged himself forward before he rose again while the uneven footsteps had borne their own testimony  also the bag of specimens was heavy and alton decided that for a man in the last stages of exhaustion the river had furnished the only road  the silver was therefore somewhere up the valley and as it was winter when jimmy found it it would lie low down where the snow was cut off by the pines  alton lay still a minute with a curious glint in his eyes when the firelight touched them which was a tribute to the dead man and then filled his pipe again  his journey had been marked by petty misfortunes each of which might become a more serious one hitherto and he was now alone  this might be due to coincidence but alton admitting that hypothesis proceeded to consider an alternative one which resolved itself into two  it was generally known in somasco that he and jimmy had held the clue to a secret that might be valuable and strange prospectors for timber rights and minerals occasionally strayed into the valley  alton knew that most of the bushmen and free prospectors had a standard of honour which was somewhat higher than that usually lived up to in the cities they were quiet fearless freehanded men the antitype of the roystering desperadoes he had now and then seen them depicted as by those who did not know them  there were he however knew among them a few who it was probable had their own reasons for vacating the great republic and these were men of distinctly different calibre  one or more of them it seemed might have heard of his aspirations and be following him  if so it was evident that he would be in security until he found the silver  then the peril would begin  this led to the second issue  alton was quite aware that he had an enemy whom he had got the better of on several occasions hitherto partly because devious finesse is not always superior to shrewd sense and fearless honesty he had as yet held his own against hallam of the tyee  both knew that a time of prosperity was approaching for somasco and had decided more or less correctly that it would lead to affluence the man who had control of the valley but while alton had striven with arduous toil to bring about this consummation hallam of the tyee was waiting while those he meant to plunder worked for him  it was also plain that there was no room for two leaders with divergent aspirations and the rancher had seen sufficient of his opponents dealings to recognize that he would not scruple about any measures which promised to rid him of a rival  therefore it became him to be careful and once more his fingers fell upon the rifle  alton had reached the limit of his surmises and refilling his pipe again abandoned himself to more pleasant dreams  he heard the whistle of the locomotive ringing among the pines and the hum of the great mills that would grind out wealth for somasco  then while the pungent smoke curled about him visions materialized out of its filmy wreaths and he saw the lake at carnaby shining amidst the woodlands of peaceful england and the old grey hall  in place of the sting of the resin he could smell the english roses and when the next acrid wisp slid past him it seemed to change its form and there grew out of it the gracious alluring shape of a woman  costly fabrics floated about her there was a flash of diamonds in the redgold hair a face that lost its patrician serenity as it smiled and for a setting the glitter of light and silver in the great hall at carnaby  alton whose eyes were growing dim stretched out his arms towards the darkness and a chilling gust swept the smoke aside while great drops of water fell splashing upon him  he was back once more in the wilderness a wet and very weary man with thornrents in his deerskin jacket and the mire clinging about him but he smiled as he rose stiffly and stretched his aching limbs  i figure theres a good deal to be done before that time comes and some of it cant wait after sun up he said  then having left the tent behind he carried his blankets away from the fire and rolled himself up in them between two great firroots that afforded concealment as well as shelter  though he had strewn them about the blaze the blankets were still clammy but he drew the damp folds about him uncomplainingly and lay down with the rifle at his side  ten minutes passed  the fire snapped and crackled the growl of the rapid rose and fell fitfully but the wornout man heard neither for he was sleeping heavily  there are many like him who dream great dreams scattered across the new lands by the pacific from the snow of the yukon to mexico but their visions are sacred and not expressed in speech while a smile which is half ironical flickers in the steadfast eyes when they hear them caricatured by the platform imperialist  their words are scanty but their handiwork is plain the gap hewn in the virgin forest bridge flung over frothing river and the raw rent of the giant powder amidst the lonely hills  it is crude and unsightly often the creosotereeking railroad track and the ugly humming mills but it means food for the toilers good wages and trade and in place of a pleasance for the rich to seek diversion in a new and rich dominion won not for england or the republic alone but for humanity  he started with the sunrise the packstraps galling his shoulders his feet bleeding in the saturated boots clammy blankets flourbag and pork upon his aching back kettle frypan and rifle rattling about him and for the first hour every stride that led him farther into the wilderness was made with pain and difficulty  still he made it cheerfully for alton had long borne the burden that was laid on adam uncomplainingly while his rival sitting beyond the reach of hardship in his vancouver office plotted and filched the fruits of others toil  it was also an apparently unequal conflict they had been drawn into subtlety pitted against sturdiness the elusive foining rapier against the bushmans axe but there are moments in all struggles when finesse does not avail and it is by raw unreasoning valour a man must stand or fall while at times like these the ponderous blade is the equal of the slender streak of steel  it was two days later when alton who may have made ten miles in the time noticed something unusual on the opposite hillside  a snowslide had come down that way and its path was marked by willows and smaller trees  alton of course knew that the hollow they sprang from had been scored out deep by countless tons of debris and snow and that prospector jimmy would scarcely have passed the place  it also seemed to him that there was a gap in the slighter band of forest which ran straight towards the snowline up the face of the hill that suggested the work of man and his pace quickened a trifle as he pressed forward towards the river  there he stopped for several minutes gazing about him  the flood came down before him stained green with the clay that underlies the glaciers and swollen by rain and snow  there was a big pool above him lakelike and still but it was too wide for any weary and shivering man to swim and the wild white rush of a rapid close below  alton glanced at both of them and a cluster of smaller trees across the river and smiled somewhat grimly  now i wonder he said why the thing one wants the most is always on the other side  the firs behind him were great of girth the smallest some distance from the bank and he was weary but loosing the straps about him he dropped his burdens and fell to with the axe  it was an hour before the tree went down and at least another had passed before he had hewn off a portion  then very slowly and painfully he rolled it to the river with skids and levers cut in the bush  he was breathless and the perspiration dripped from him when at last it slid into the water and he seated himself astride with his possessions on the wet bark in front of him  the device was a very old one but there is a difficulty attached to the putting it in execution for it is needful to lean out a little while using the propelling pole and a log is addicted to rolling round when anything disturbs its equilibrium  alton of course knew this but when still some distance from the opposite side had apparently to choose between a somewhat perilous effort and an unwishedfor descent of the rapid  he glanced at its foaming rush a moment and then decided upon the former  several times he dipped the pole and won a yard with the strenuous thrust and then what he partly expected happened  the bark seemed to be slipping away beneath him and as throwing himself forward upon his belongings he flung an arm about it the log rolled slowly and there was a splash in the water  he had restored the equilibrium but one blanket and the flourbag were in the river  in another few minutes he waded ashore and drew the butt of the log out upon the shingle before he turned to glance ruefully at the sliding water  if i went back and plunged for it i might get that flour he said still i should have to go down the rapid with it and i mightnt want it then  dripping from the waist with snow water he reslung his traps glanced back at the sombre bush behind him and then plunged into that ahead while the dusk was closing in when he stood panting amidst the stumps of smaller trees  the mark of the axe was on them and somebody had piled up a mound of rock and stones  alton drew in a long breath and shook off his burden  jimmys claim he said  it may meanmost anythingto me  then though his pulses throbbed and he could feel his blood tingling he fell to work systematically groping about the excavation the dead man had made where the snowslide had rent apart the forest and scored out the rock for him  here and there he smashed a fragment of it with the back of the axe or picked up a discoloured stone of unusual gravity and compared it with the pieces he took out of a little bag until at last he stood up stiffly and flung his head back  all round him the forest rose dim and sombre flinging back the roar of the rapid in long pulsations of sound and its solitude was not lessened by the presence of the wet and weary man standing so still that his outline was scarcely perceptible against the trunks behind him  save for the light of triumph in his eyes there was nothing in the whole scene to uplift the fancy  the mans garments were tattered the river had not washed the mire from him and one of his boots was gaping but the discovery he had made was fraught with great possibilities for that lonely valley and changes in the destinies of many other men  it had lain wrapped in stillness a sanctuary for the beasts of the forest countless ages since the world was young being made ready slowly by frost and sun and now man had come  for five long minutes alton looked into the future and once more the fragrance of english roses seemed to steal faintly through the resinous odours of the firs  then he shook himself and glanced again dubiously at the river  and now he said half aloud ill get supper  its a pity about that flour  as those who have sojourned in the bush of that country know one can sup on reasty pork and green tea alone when it is impossible to get anything better but there are more appetizing compounds and when the edge of his appetite had been blunted alton stopped with greasy fingers in the frypan and a little smile upon his face  and somascos mine and carnabywhen i ask for it with all that lies beneath me here he said and sat very still a space with eyes that had lost their keenness fixed upon the bush  he did not see the big balsam in front of him nor the dusky firs for it was once more the picture of a woman with redgold hair standing in an english rose garden his fancy painted him  then he rose abruptly and the smile faded while his face grew grim again  in the meanwhile i figure theres a good deal to do he said  he commenced it by picking the remnants of the pork out of the fryingpan and when he had replaced them carefully in the bag he filled the former with water and set it on the fire  that done he proceeded to hew four square pegs and spent some little time cutting one discovery upon the largest of them  then with a compass in his palm he strode with even paces up the slope of the hill and drove one of the pegs in turned sharply and floundered into the bush where he hammered down a second and came back along the river until he had paced off and marked down an oblong  now ill put in the first shot he said  he toiled assiduously with the axehead and a little drill bruising his fingers as the light grew dim and when his left hand was smeared with blood drew out a plastic yellow roll from one of his bundles  this he gently rammed into the hole squeezed down a copper cap upon a strip of fuse and lighting the latter retired expeditiously towards the river  standing behind a big cedar he watched the train of blue vapour and thin red sparks creep on through the dusk until a blaze of yellow flame leapt up and a stunning detonation rolled across the woods  the hillsides took up the sound and flung it from one to another in great reverberations while the pines quivering in all their sprays shook drops of water down  alton stood still and listened silent and intent while the discord died until there was once more stillness again realizing dimly a little of its significance  it was mans challenge to the wilderness that had lain sterile long and he could forecast the grimness but not the end of the coming struggle with rock and flood and snow  other men had gone down vanquished in such a fight he knew and the forest they slept in had closed once more upon and hidden the little scars they made  jimmy had also challenged savage nature and jimmy was dead while the man who came after him stood alone dripping still and weary amidst the whispering pines he had more than the wilderness against him  alton turned with a little shiver strode back to the fire unrolled a piece of pork a packet of green tea and a little bag of sugar from a strip of hide  the piece of pork was very small and a good deal of it apparently bad  then he laughed curiously  it seems to me that the sooner i can get south and put in my record the less hungry im likely to be he said  it would be kind of convenient if i could find a deer  i wonder just how far back the other man is     chapter xix  foul play  alton looked for a deer on the morrow and during several days that followed without finding it  there are tracts of the mountain province which for no apparent reason are almost devoid of animal life while the deer are also addicted to travelling south towards valleys swept by the warm chinook wind before the approach of winter  meanwhile though he husbanded it the piece of pork grew rapidly smaller and alton hungry while there were times when he wondered somewhat anxiously when he would find his comrades  it was unpleasantly possible that he might miss them which would have been especially unfortunate because as every adult citizen is entitled to claim so many feet of frontage on unrecorded mineral land which pertains to the crown it appeared advisable that they should have the opportunity of staking off two more claims and his provisions were almost exhausted  thus it came about that one evening he tramped somewhat dejectedly back towards his camp through a strip of thinner forest high up on the hill there was a sting of frost in the air and a little snow beneath his feet while his belt was girded about him tightly and his fingers stiffened on the riflebarrel  alton had eaten nothing since early morning and very little then while the fashion in which he stumbled through the thickets and amidst the fern conveyed a hint of exhaustion it was however fortunate that a twig snapped noisily beneath him because the deer are difficult to see in their sylvan home and the sound was answered by a crackle that roused him to eager attention  alton knowing there was a big fir behind him stood very still glancing about him without a movement of his head until he made out what might have been a forked twig rising above the thicket  he did not however think it was and gazing more intently fancied he saw a patch of something that was not the fern  he knew that at the first movement it would be gone and there was no time for any fine alignment of the sights of the rifle so leaning slightly forward he drew his right foot back and with eyes fixed steadily on the little patch amidst the fern trusted to them and the balance as he flung the long barrel up  few men can use the rifle as the canadian bush rancher can and there was a flash from the muzzle as the heelplate touched his shoulder  alton had not glanced along the barrel but the curious thud which he heard in place of the explosion told him that the heavy bullet was smashing through bone and muscle  then thin smoke drifted into his eyes and there was a crackling amidst the thicket  when he floundered forward the deer had gone but something was smashing through the undergrowth up the face of the hill and the weary man prepared for a grim effort as he saw the red trail it left behind he fell headlong in a thicket where the splashes were warm upon the withered leaves staggered up again and presently reeled against a cedar on the crest of a depression  there was nothing visible but he could hear a confused rattle and snapping of twigs and shook himself as he remembered the speed with which even a badlywounded deer can make downhill  he had his choice of a long and possibly fruitless chase or another supperless night that would be followed by a very scanty breakfast on the morrow  alton did not care to anticipate what might happen after that because he had discovered on previous occasions that green tea will not unassisted sustain vigorous animation very long  in place of it he went downhill falling into bushes floundering to the shoulders through withered fern and now and then stumbling over rotting trees but the splashes grew closer and he fancied the sound before him a little nearer  it was significant that there was any sound at all because a deer usually clears every obstacle in its almost silent flight and the gasping man took heart again  the quarrys strength was evidently failing as its life drained away but darkness was also close at hand and alton knew that he could not hold out very long  already there was a horrible pain in his left side and his sight was growing dim  he went on stumbling gasping falling now and then for any man not accustomed to the bush in that country would find it sufficiently difficult to walk through until once more a grey patch of something showed up in a thicket  again the rifle flashed a dim shape reeled out of the bushes and while the man savagely smashed through those it had quitted plunged into another thicket  alton who did not see it come out again also went in headlong tripped and fell upon something with life in it that struggled spasmodically beneath him  there was no room to use his rifle for he and the deer were rolling amidst the fern together and while he felt for its throat the long knife came out twice it sank harmlessly amidst the snow and leaves and then there was a gurgle and the man rose stiffly to his feet with dripping hands and something smoking on the sleeve of his jacket  he glanced at it without disgust and then down at the limp shape which now lay very still almost compassionately  well he said simply it was you or me and the wolves would have had you anyway  he was busy amidst the bushes for some time and the light had gone when he stood up with the deer upon his shoulders and the rifle beneath it  it would have pleased him better to carry the latter but the bushman brings home a deer with its forelegs drawn over his shoulders and grasped in front of him  alton jerked it into the most convenient position and then stopped a moment panting and glanced about him his burden was not especially heavy but he was weary and his camp was far away while though a halfmoon was now growing into brilliancy above the firs it was dark below  i figure id not have to worry quite so much about my supper at carnaby he said and laughed a little as he floundered stiffly up the hill  it was at least an hour later and he was limping on encouraging himself with the expectation of resting in warm repletion beside the snapping fire when he entered a denser growth of timber  alton had like most of his kind been taught by necessity to hold the weaknesses of his body in subjection but he was a man with the instincts of his fellows and the thought of the steaming kettle smell of roasting meat glare of flickering light and snug blankets appealed to him and just then he would not have bartered the blackened can of smoketasted tea for all the plate and glass of carnaby  his step grew a little steadier and the sound of the river louder until he stopped suddenly near a prostrate fir  there was a gap in the dusky vault above him through which the moon shone down and called up a sparkle from the thin scattering of snow  beyond it the dark trunks stretched back a stupendous colonnade into the shadow again  there was nothing unusual in all this but the man had seen something that made him check his breathing and set his lips  he knew he might be mistaken but the glint he had caught for a moment suggested the barrel of a rifle  he stood as he realized instinctively in the shadow with a great trunk behind him and remained so motionless with his blood tingling because the bushman knows the difficulty of catching the outline of anything that is still  then there was a soft snapping and the glint became visible in another place again while alton saw that he was not mistaken  he was also aware that the free prospector does not usually wait the approach of a stranger in silence with the rifle and it flashed upon him that as the other man had moved there would in place of a shadowy trunk now be a patch of snow behind him  alton regretted he had waited so long and dropping the deer sprang backwards feeling for the sling of his rifle  he was however a second too late for there was a thin red flash amidst the undergrowth and he reeled with a stinging pain somewhere about his knee  it yielded and grew almost useless under him and while his rifle fell with a rattle he lurched into a thicket of withered fern  for a moment he lay still his face awry with pain and groaned as he strove to draw his leg up beneath him  it felt numbed and powerless and desisting he strove to collect his scattered wits realizing that he had never needed them more than he did just then  the rifle had fallen outside the thicket where the forest was more open and there was a sprinkling of snow and alton knew that an attempt to recover it would probably be fatal  he was equally convinced that the man who had shot him would not have come out on such an errand without his magazine full or leave his task unfinished  there was in the meanwhile no sign of him beyond the smoke that hung about the bushes and alton turning over groaned again more loudly as he felt for his longbladed knife  it was not done without a purpose but he had little difficulty in simulating a moan of pain and when he heard a swish of leaves lay flat and dragged himself very softly farther into the fern  the wet fronds brushed his face and here and there his fingers sank into a patch of snow but he found its chilly touch curiously pleasant and once clawed up a handful and thrust it into his mouth  a numbness was creeping over him his head felt curiously heavy but he was scheming for his life with the instinctive cunning of a wounded beast rather than reason  there was now a sound behind him but it was dulled by the roar of the river which he realized would drown the faint rustle he made and when the fern grew scantier dragged himself across an opening and crawled in amidst the raspberry briars on the other side  the thorns scarred his face and ripped his hands but he moved amidst them to clear space for his arms and then lay still with the big knife beneath him  a shaft of moonlight shone down a few yards away and he had no desire to betray his hidingplace by the glint of steel  it was also possible that he might have crawled away beyond the reach of discovery into the shadows but that was not his intention for though he could never decide afterwards whether he acted from instinct or reasoned his course out he was bent on waiting for and not escaping from his pursuer  nor did he know how long he waited but it seemed a very long while before he saw a shadowy object move round and afterwards into the opposite side of the thicket  then the mans face became visible as he moved across the shaft of moonlight  it was set and grey the mouth was awry and there was fear in the staring eyes  it also seemed to alton curiously familiar but his brain was scarcely capable of receiving many diverse impressions just then and he only realized that it was reluctantly and because his safety demanded it the man was looking for him  alton felt a little relief at that  he was growing colder and there was a bewildering dimness in his eyes but he stiffened the muscles of his arms and tightened his grasp on the knife wondering if his strength would last until he had his hands upon his enemy  the man swayed forward as he crossed the strip of moonlight with a little spring then came on again with both hands on the rifle waistdeep in the fern glancing down momentarily at the trail his victim had made and then about him again  altons face was drawn up into a very grim smile as he lay amidst the raspberries watching him for it was evident that the assassin fancied he had crawled straight on  the latter stopped once for several seconds and alton heard his heart thumping while the sound of the river seemed to grow bewildering he stiffened his fingers upon the knifehaft savagely for the horrible faintness he could not shake off was growing upon him  then with a little jerk of his shoulders the man who caught sight of the opening moved again faster than he had done and the watcher surmised that fear and savagery struggled for the mastery within him the latter apparently rose uppermost for he came straight on through the thicket sprang across the clear space and would have plunged into the bush beyond it but that alton reaching out caught him by the ankle  then he lurched forward with a hoarse cry went down and rolled over with altons hand at his throat and the blade of the knife driven through the inner side of the sleeve of his jacket  that was the commencement of a very grim struggle  the stranger was wiry and vigorous but the terrible hard fingers clung to his throat and a leg was wound about him while as he panted and smote he felt something was ripping his clothing  instinctively he jammed the hand that held it down rolled over on his antagonist and then shook himself almost free again halfchoked as something that stung it sank into his shoulder  next moment he smote fiercely at a dim white face knowing that a bone had turned the blade but that the result would have been different had it entered a few inches lower  his fist came down smashing but the terrible fingers were clinging still and the mans face was purple when they rolled together out of the briars and into the widening strip of radiance where the moon shone down  altons hand was free now and with arm bent between his enemy and the ground he thrust upwards with the last of his strength  there was a crash the man writhed backwards the ranchers fingers slipped from their grasp and a figure that rose partly upright reeled into the fern while alton felt the barrel of a rifle under him  he rolled on his side and clawed for it almost sightless with one hand and laughed harshly as he raised himself a trifle  there was a flash and a concussion the triggerguard sank into his nerveless finger and a smashing amidst the undergrowth was followed by footsteps that were presently lost in the roar of the river  alton drew one knee under him and listened until the sound grew altogether bewildering and the dim trunks reeled about him  then he lurched over and lay where he fell sensible only that it was bitterly cold  it was still night when he awakened from sleep or stupor but the moon shone down and he saw that there was white frost on the fern his hands were also stiffened and there was a horrible ache in every limb while he groaned as the cold struck through him  twice he essayed to raise himself and fell back again but at last by an effort crawled towards a tree and leaned his back against it while he stretched out one numbed and useless limb into the silver light  the long boots were curiously smeared the overalls above them stiffened and crusted while following the movement he made there was a swift spreading of the stain  alton shivered and set his lips as he groped for his handkerchief then groaning the while dragged at it until it was knotted above his knee after that he laid his finger on the overalls and saw that the stain spread past it more slowly  then he felt for the matches in one pocket and finding them turned over cautiously and dragged himself towards a fallen fir  he knew where to find the resin and tore at the smaller branches fiercely flung them together and striking a match watched the flame that spread from splinter to splinter and crawled amidst the twigs  at last it sprang aloft in a great crackling blaze and alton swayed unevenly and fell over on his side again  after that he remembered nothing until he saw that the sun was in the sky and dragged himself to the thicket for an armful of frosted fern  when he had piled it on the fire a gauzy blue column that rose straight between the firs replaced the flame and the man who watched it vacantly for a while dragged himself back groaning for another armful of the fern  he afterwards fancied that he spent most of the day crawling between the fire and the thicket but was never very sure of anything he did just then  nor did he feel hungry though now and then he clawed up and sucked a handful of snow but he remembered that he was lying in the smoke when the bush grew dimmer and the red blaze more brilliant as darkness crept down  presently he fancied that something broke through the monotone of the river and after listening to it vacantly groped for the rifle  he clutched it and raising himself a trifle with difficulty blinked at the darkness that hemmed in the fire until footsteps came out of it  they were not furtive but apparently those of somebody coming straight towards the light in haste  alton smiled curiously and wriggled until he was out of the strongest light and found support for the barrel of the rifle  then a cry came out of the shadows is it you harry  alton did not answer for his voice seemed to fail him and he blinked at the man who bent over him  you have been a long while charley and i came very near putting a bullet into you just now he said  well said seaforth i did my best and toms coming along behind me  what are you doing here anyway  alton glanced at him bewilderedly  i dont quite know but i got the deer  its somewhere around here said he  seaforths face grew suddenly grave as he stopped and shook his comrade then let his hand drop as he saw a red trickle spreading across the crusted overalls  good lord  are you hurt harry and whats all this he said  alton glanced up at him with dimming eyes  the things broken out again  i think its blood he said and while his arm slipped from under him slowly rolled over with his feet in the smoking fern     chapter xx  the nicked bullet  the grey daylight was creeping into the little tent and alton sleeping at last when seaforth rose to his feet  his eyes were heavy with the long nights watch which had followed a twelve hours march and he shivered as he went out  the morning was bitterly cold and a fire burned redly outside the tent but there was no sign of okanagan who had joined him during the night nor had any preparations for breakfast been made  tom he twice called softly but only the moaning of the branches overhead answered him and with a little gesture of impatience he strode into the bush  seaforth had no definite purpose but he was glad to stretch his stiffened limbs and instinctively turned towards the spot where he had found his comrade  as he approached it he stopped and watched the dim moving object that caught his eyes with some bewilderment  tom of okanagan was kneeling beside a thicket with a stick in his hand and apparently holding it carefully in line with a fir  after moving once or twice he drove it into the soil and crawled on hands and knees into the fern so that seaforth could only see his boots and surmise by the rustling that he was groping amidst the withered fronds  once he caught a muffled expletive after which the rustling ceased awhile but it commenced again and seaforth wondered the more when okanagan crawled out of the opposite side of the thicket and set up a second stick in line with the other  he had not the faintest notion of what his companion could be doing  are you finding anything down there tom he said  okanagan rose up with a little grim laugh  thorns he said  theres a condemned big one in my thumb  seaforth stared at him with a vague suspicion that the hardships of the forced march they had made had left their mark upon his comrade though he had never noticed any signs of mental weakness in the big axeman before  arent there plenty to be picked up in this country without looking for them he said  okanagan glanced at him with a little twinkle which was not altogether mirthful in his eyes  oh yes  more than ive any use for  you were trying to figure on what i was after  the things quite as easy as trailing a deer  i was said seaforth dryly and okanagan approaching him dropped a big hand upon his shoulder  come right along and ill show you said he  seaforth followed him until he stopped by the fir he had worked his alignment from where he picked up a spent cartridge and pointed to a mark in the snow  nothing particular about that anyway a fortyfour winchester he said  the fellow had long boots on with one heel down and he stood right here waiting for harry  harry was coming along yonder with the deer forty yards i make it and he jumped when the fellow started shooting  you think he did said seaforth slightly bewildered and okanagan laughed  no sir im sure he said  i could show you where his heels went in if it would do you any good  harry was coming along quick as he could thinking about his supper and the other fellow was crouching here clawing his rifle and waiting until he came into the moonlight  the blood surged into seaforths forehead and he clenched one hand the condemned villain  it was devilish he said  okanagan nodded gravely and his rugged face was stern  oh yes but slinging names at hims not much use he said  well i feel it in me that were going to see more of that man by and by and thats just why im working up the whole thing from the beginning  now ill show you some more of it  they floundered through one or two thickets until okanagan stopped again and pointed to the red smear upon the fern and withered pineneedles  thats where harry lay and waited for him he said he was bleeding pretty bad but he knew the other fellow meant to finish him  waited for him when he was almost helpless and the man meant to murder him said seaforth with cold rage and horror in his face  okanagan laughed a little almost silent laugh that had a very grim undertone in it  yes sir  thats just what he did  dont you know harry yet he said  still he didnt figure that all the killing would be done by the other man  see here this is where he gripped him and tried to get the knife in  they fell over together there harry was played out and bleeding hard or that man would never have got away when he once had his hands on him  seaforth stared at the rentdown undergrowth and had no great difficulty in reconstructing the scene  smashed fern and scattered leaves as well as the red smears on the snow bore plain testimony to the fierceness of that struggle and he pictured his comrade grappling with his adversary while his strength flowed from him with that horrible red trickle  the light that came down between towering trunks showed that his face was grey and stern and okanagan who looked at him nodded as it were approvingly  ive seen enough said the former  if i can find that man he will not get away from me  well said okanagan simply were short of the bullet now and ill know better what to do with harry when we find it  its low down in one of those cedars yonder  it will be deep in at that range said seaforth  no said okanagan quietly  i dont think it will  its pretty plain from the hole it made that it wasnt a common bullet and im kind of anxious to know if all of it came out again  seaforth shivered a little as he assisted in the search and his lips were set when okanagan digging something out of the cedarbark with his knife laid it in his palm  it was a little piece of blackened lead that was ragged in place of round as though the soft metal had been rent open and bent backwards  then the two men looked at each other and the hot fury that for a moment flushed seaforth to the temples passed and left him with a curious vindictive coldness and a faint shrinking from the touch of the murderous lead  okanagans eyes were very steady but there was a little glow down at the back of them  nicked across with a hack saw or a fileand its not all here he said  it strikes me the sooner we find the rest of it the better this weather  seaforth drew in his breath  a strip of lead torn off that bullet was rankling in his comrades flesh and during the night bitter frost had laid its grip upon the forest  wounds he knew do not heal but fester under such conditions  you can do it tom he said and his voice was hoarse  ill trywhen he wakes said okanagan  youll find some flat stones by the river  i want one with an open grit that you could grind a knife down with  it was long before alton awakened and then it became evident that he was not wholly sensible  loss of blood overfatigue exposure and hunger had left their mark on him and while he rambled disjointedly a bitter wind sprang up  it raged down the valley bringing with it the cold of the pole and while the pines raised their wild voices the water congealed in the kettle and in spite of the great fire built outside it the tent grew icy  at noon tom of okanagan glanced at his patient and shook his head while seaforth felt his misgivings confirmed as he saw his face  i guess weve got to wait for tomorrow  therell be snow tonight he said  it was a long day to seaforth  alton moved restlessly in his sleep or talked and laughed meaninglessly during most of it while when his eyes closed tom who sat in a corner laid the stone upon his lap and ground at his knife  he had already rubbed the blade down to half its width but was apparently not contented and seaforth felt colder and set his lips each time the harsh grating of steel broke through the roaring of the pines that swelled in volume as the wind increased  it was seldom that either of them spoke though the big axemans face would soften momentarily when alton moaned a little in his sleep  then it grew sombre and impassive again save for the little gleam in the eyes and seaforth guessed what was in his companions thoughts as the hard gnarled fingers tightened viciously on the steel  somehow the day wore through and the snow came with the night  it beat upon the canvas and fell hissing in the fire which snapped and crackled the more fiercely while acrid vapour crept into the tent and now and then one of the mens eyes would close a moment  seaforth had indeed roused himself several times with a jerk when okanagan pointed to the roll of blankets and layer of springy twigs and he saw that at last alton was sleeping restfully  five minutes later the roar of the branches seemed to sink into a musical lullaby and the last thing he saw was the big impassive bushman sitting as still as the motionless figure beneath him on the opposite side of the tent  then he was wafted back to england on the wings of dreams  it was broad daylight and warmer when he awakened  outside the fire crackled noisily and the great pines rose spires of sombre green against a field of white  alton was also awake and smiled at him while tom who stood behind him made a sign  it has got to be done right now before the frost comes back but were not going to hurt you harry he said  youll walk down to the river and fill that kettle up charley  seaforth wondered a little because the snow lay a foot deep in the bush and he could have filled the kettle beside the fire but he floundered down to the river and felt a little more prepared to face what must be done when he returned  when he did so he found that tom had rolled back altons jean trousers to the knee and saw a red smear that broadened across the brawny limb  it pulsed over the swell of the corded muscles that showed through the clear smooth skin and then seaforth shivered and turned his eyes away as they fell upon the welling depression with the discoloured edges  alton noticed the movement and glanced at him with a twinkle in his eyes  it isnt pretty but i dont think tom will keep us long he said  seaforth felt the blood surge into his face for it seemed most unfitting that the wounded man should sympathize with him but finding nothing apposite to say he kept silent and okanagan shook his head at them  get hold of his hands and keep hold  the quieter you are harry the quicker ill be he said  alton smiled a little  i dont think its necessary he said still if it will please you tom  seaforth clutched the fingers held out to him and felt suddenly chilly  he would have touched his lips with his tongue for the blood seemed to have gone out of them but that he felt altons eyes were upon him  accordingly he turned his face which he fancied was growing a trifle colourless aside and for a moment or two watched okanagan who was kneeling with one hand pressed upon the smeared whiteness of the uncovered limb  seaforth could hear his own heart beating and the thud of snow shaken off a swinging branch upon the tent and see the light the whiteness outside flung in glint upon the slender knife  he saw it move a little and sternly repressed a shiver when the lean hard fingers closed suddenly upon his own  a tremor ran through them and then the pressure increased until seaforth was glad that it grew painful  he dare not glance at his comrade he would not look at tom and sat very still in torment for a space while he felt that altons arms had grown rigid by the cruel grip upon his hands  then the tension slackened and the injured man drew in his breath with a gasp while okanagan rose to one knee with great drops of sweat upon his face  you got it said alton in a low strained voice and nodded when the axeman answered him  no he said a trifle huskily  im going to try again  lift him over on his side charley  seaforth trembled a little as he did it and glanced for just a moment at his comrades face  it was set and grey but it went suddenly awry into the grotesque semblance of a smile  tom never was in a hurry  its rough on you he said  still seaforth who had once held his own with men and women in quick retort and graceful badinage in england did not answer but only pressed the hard fingers that now lay somewhat limply in his palm and wondered vaguely whether the ordeal would never be over  it was only then he realized to the full all that alton had been to him since the day he limped ragged and very hungry into a little mining camp  his friends in the old country had turned their backs on him and seaforth who had been hopeless and desperate then knew that he owed a good deal more than material prosperity to alton of somasco  tom he said hoarsely i think were ready  okanagan said nothing but stooped again and seaforth tightening his grasp of the contracting fingers heard the sound of uneven breathing through the thud of snow upon the tent  he was by this time a little more master of himself and looked steadily down on the white face with the grimlyset lips  his own was distorted into what was not a sympathetic smile but a grotesque grin and there was every now and then a reflection of it in the one awry with pain which looked up at him  then alton drew in his breath with a little quivering sigh and there was a rattle as okanagan dropped the steel  i want that bandagequick  we are through now he said  seaforth had afterwards a hazy recollection of helping him to twist the strip of fabric about the firm white flesh and that his hands made red smears on altons deerskin jacket when he stooped and lifted him a little  there was no bronze in his comrades face but in place of it a curious yellow tinge through which the greyness showed in patches and with fingers that were strangely clumsy he held a flask to altons lips  the latter choked and then his eyes opened wide again  pass it round  im figuring youre all wanting some he said  seaforth to humour him touched the flask with his lips and handed it to tom who did the same and then screwing the top on it passed it back to seaforth no emptier than when it reached him  alton however raised his head a trifle further and looked at both of them  youll have to do it better  let me see the thing he said  okanagan glanced at him severely  i guess youll lie right where you are and keep very still or ill make a hole through the other leg he said  alton appeared to chuckle but his arm slipped from under him and he dropped back heavily amidst the blankets with eyes closed while seaforth bent over him  thats all right said okanagan  you neednt worry  i was kind of hoping he would do it because i was anxious about the bleeding  now well get everything fixed up before he comes round again  seaforth did what he was bidden and nothing more for he had been reared in england and not amidst the firs and snows of northern canada where misadventures are many and doctors very few but he envied the big bushman his skill that day and okanagan may have guessed it for he once smiled a little as he said  there are lots of things i cant do and its not your fault that you were raised back in the old country where you have other folks to put the patches on to you  no said seaforth smiling  still he is my partner you see  now i want to know what we are going to do with him  okanagans smile was just perceptible as he held up a ragged piece of lead but seaforth saw that he understood all the speech implied though he made no reference to it  theres half the trouble gone he said  the rest of it went straight through the bone and i kind of fancy smashed it up considerable  will the pieces knit as they were before said seaforth very anxiously and for a moment or two okanagan did not answer him  that he said very slowly is what i dont quite know  one of them bones is a rocker and she swings on the other  that ones cut but i dont think its smashed right through  now if it goes as well as the other its quite possible harry will limp ever after  seaforth stood up with a little shiver  good lord  harry of all men a cripple  tom you must do something  okanagan slowly shook his head  ive done my best now he said  we can get him down to somasco and a live doctor up from vancouver as soon as we can and thats about all  theres no time to lose  well start tomorrow  seaforth cast one glance at the still figure and grey face amidst the blankets and then clenched his hands as he blundered out of the tent a white flake fell upon his face another on his hands and he shivered again as he glanced at the forest  it was very evident that much depended upon their speed and down between the sombre pines came the sliding snow     chapter xxi  okanagans road  the great cedarboughs above the river bent beneath their load and the scanty light was dimmed by sliding snow when seaforth and his comrade stood panting and white all over by the last portage  okanagan by dint of laborious searching had found the canoe jammed between two boulders with her side crushed in and had spent a day repairing her with a flattened out meatcan and strips of deerskin  the craft had notwithstanding this leaked considerably but they made shift to descend the river in her and now if they could accomplish the last big portage hoped by toiling strenuously to make the mouth of the canon by nightfall  what they would do when they reached it neither of them knew but they were too cold and jaded to concern themselves with more than the question how they were to convey their comrade over the boulders and through the thickets which divided them from the next stretch of comparatively untroubled water just then  they had spent most of the day dragging the canoe round the rapid which roared down the hollow in a wild tumult of froth lifting her with levers from rock to rock and now and then sliding with her down a declivity but that was a mode of progression clearly unsuited to an injured man  alton lay in the snow beneath a boulder that but indifferently sheltered him and there was a little grim smile in his face as he looked up at his companions  isnt it time you got hold of me  we cant stop here all day he said  okanagan turned and stared sombrely at the wall of rock which dropped to the river close behind him and the strip of boulders and great fallen fragments amidst which the undergrowth crept in and out between  theres a gully yonder but if we worked back round the hillside i dont quite see how were coming down he said  no said alton dryly  im not good at flying  well you had better start in and carry me  seaforth stooped and grasped his comrade round the thighs which were lashed together with deerhide with a stiff strip of cedarbark outside them  okanagan passed his arms about his shoulders and they rose with a jerk and stood swaying unevenly for a moment while seaforth wondered with a curious feeling of helplessness whether they would ever accomplish the journey to the canoe  it would have tested the agility of an unencumbered man while he was almost worn out and alton cruelly heavy  heave him up a trifle said okanagan  now then  seaforth gasped and floundered forward through a foot of snow that hid the holes he sank into and slipped away beneath him as he clawed for a footing on the boulders but with strenuous toil they made a hundred yards or so and then laying down their burden stood still panting alton lay silent with halfclosed eyes and the soft flakes settling on his grey face in the snow while seaforth gazed about him despairingly  there was rock and shadowy forest behind them and in front the smoking rush of the river while though it was but afternoon the light was failing  get hold again tom  its not good to wait here he said with a shiver  this time with infinite difficulty they made fifty yards and altons face showed what his silence had cost him when they set him down again seaforth stooped and drew the blanket about him with a great gentleness  we did our best  id change places with you harry if i could he said  alton smiled a little but said nothing and in five minutes they went on again seaforth gasping from exhaustion with a horrible pain in his side and his feet slipping from under him as they struggled up a sloping face of rock but they had won forty yards when tom went down and alton who fell heavily upon him rolled over  seaforth held his breath a moment until he heard the voice of the injured man  i wouldnt worry about my head  it would take an axe to hurt me there he said  look at the lashings  the lashings however had not slackened the cedarbark was intact and once more they took up their burden while seaforth could not remember how often they had rested when at last they came out upon a smooth strip of sloping rock close to the last of the portage  he was dragging a clogging weight of snow with him and the white flakes were in his eyes while now and then his breath failed him and he heard okanagan growling hoarse and halfarticulate expletives  you have got to hold out charley  theres the canoe below you he said  seaforth braced himself for a last effort and was never sure whether he or okanagan stumbled first but his feet slipped from under him and he fell upon alton as tom went down  then the three slid together down the slope of rock and fell heavily over the edge of it  seaforth was partly dazed when okanagan dragged him to his feet but he could see that alton lay very still with his face awry and that there was consternation in the eyes of his comrade  have we hurt you harry he said hoarsely  alton groaned a little and his lips moved once or twice before seaforth caught any audible answer  i dont know that you did it but i think that bone has gone he said  okanagan saying nothing dropped on hands and knees and while alton groaned drew the bands tighter about the shattered cedarbark  then he rose up and looked at seaforth and the two stood silent for almost a minute with the snow whirling about them  there was something very like despair in seaforths eyes and at last his comrade solemnly shook his fist at the forest  we have got to get him home straight off he said  seaforth did not ask how it was to be done when they had the range to cross but as one dreaming laid hold of his comrade again and floundered towards the canoe which lay close by them now  he was still partly dazed when he took up the paddle and dimly saw the white pines sliding past through a haze of snow  nor did he remember whether he or okanagan set the tent up when they reached the island near the canon but he was sitting inside it holding out a smoking can of tea to alton when some time after darkness had closed down tom came in  the snow had ceased in the meanwhile and a biting frost descended upon the valley through which the roar of the canon pulsed in long reverberations  okanagan dropped the rifle he carried  i might have left the thing  the horse is dead he said  dead said seaforth vacantly  okanagan nodded  yes he said  somebody has saved me the trouble two bullets in him  seaforth was almost past anger now but the tea splashed from the can he still held as he realized the thoroughness of the work of their enemy  then how are you going to pack harry and the other things over the range he said  okanagans face was almost expressionless  were not going to  it cant be done  seaforth said nothing  the last fall had shaken him severely and he had realized since they started that the task before them was almost beyond the power of any two men but had refused to contemplate what must happen if they failed in it  now he could see that it was impossible but dazed with utter weariness as he was he could not think consecutively and only felt a numbing dismay that in some strange fashion softened the blow while in place of considering the future his memory reverted without his will to the incidents of that strange journey  they rose blurred before him as the creations of an evil dream the wild descent of a rapid the desperate effort of the portage the long hours of toil at the paddle and endless unrolling of whitened pines that crawled by them through the snow  now at least when he could do no more that stupendous toil was finished  turning he glanced at alton who had with apparent difficulty swallowed a little of the tea  he lay amidst the blankets with eyes closed breathing unevenly  then youll go on to somasco tom and send back the boys for us they may be in time he said  okanagan strode softly to the entrance of the tent and drew the canvas back  a moon hung red with frost in the pitiless heavens the stars shone steelily and it was evident that the cold of the icy north was laying its grip upon the valley  harry wouldnt have much use for them when they came  theres an ice fringe round the boulders now he said  seaforth stared out into the glittering night and groaned for he knew what happened to wounded men unsheltered from the frost  his voice was low and harsh as he asked then what is to be done  okanagan replaced the canvas before he answered quietly theres the canon  yes said seaforth  still no man has ever gone down it  no  but the waters lowest in winter and a canoe once came through i cant see why another shouldnt do as well with men in it  its easy getting in anyway  seaforth laughed mirthlessly  oh yes  the question is will any of us come out again alive  as he spoke the sound of the rivers turmoil swelled in a great pulsation about the tent and seaforth involuntarily drew in his breath  the curious glow he had seen there before however grew a trifle brighter in his companions eyes  that he said solemnly only the almighty knows but if we stop here therell be an end of harry  now there are some folks in the old country whod be sorry if you dont come back  seaforth smiled a trifle bitterly  i dont think there are  they had an opportunity of showing their affection before i came out to canada and didnt take it  i found the best friend i ever had in this countryand as there seems no other way well try the canon  okanagan sat down again and hacked away with altons knife at a piece of redwood he was fashioning into a paddle  both of them knew that the effort they were to make on their friends behalf might well cost their life but big untaught bushman and once gentlynurtured briton were in one respect at least alike and that was a fact which would never again be mentioned between them  it was an hour or thereabouts later when alton opened his eyes  i dont know that i asked you though i meant to but you and tom staked two more claims off he said  okanagan appeared a trifle embarrassed but seaforth laughed  im afraid we didnt  you see we started in a hurry and i forgot  alton stared at him a moment in bewilderment and then through the pain that distorted it a curious look crept into his face  i figure youre lying charley and you dont do it well he said folks dont usually forget when they leave a fortune behind them  seaforth smiled a little  well i may have been but a fortune didnt seem very likely to be much use to me then or now he said  alton gravely shook his head but the two mens eyes met for a moment and seaforth felt embarrassed as he turned his aside  there was no need to tell the injured man that his welfare had appeared of more importance to his comrades than any profit that might accrue to them from the silver mine  well he said simply you or tom should get through to somasco  i hope so said seaforth as okanagan signed to him  you see we are all going there together by the shortest way down the canon  alton stared at him a moment  now i had he commenced and then stopped abruptly  once more seaforth smiled  then you had thought about it harry  altons eyes closed a little  im not one of the folks who go round telling people all they think he said  theres no way down that canon  seaforth understood what was passing in his comrades mind and knew that alton had not kept silence because of the risk to himself for whatever was done the chances were equally against him  im afraid we cant contradict you but we shall discover tomorrow whether you are right or not he said  altons glance grew a little less direct  i would stop you if i could  of course said seaforth smiling  still you see you cant and when you go out mining with featherbrained companions must take the consequences  alton who said nothing further apparently went to sleep and there was silence in the tent save for the roar of water and the rattle of okanagans knife  they launched the canoe with the first of the daylight dragging her through the crackling ice fringe under the bitter frost and as they slid down the smooth green flow towards the stupendous rent in the mountain side the river poured through okanagan glanced towards it and then at the still figure lying huddled in the blankets in the bottom of the canoe  that i figure is one of the most useful men in the dominion and between somasco and the place in england he has a good deal in his hands he said  seaforth understood him and smiled grimly  we brought nothing into this worldand well be very close to the next one in a few more minutes he said  hadnt you better get way on tom  they dipped the paddles and the canoe slid on smoothly under the clear sunlight and the frost towards the film of mist where the oily green now broke up into the mad white tumult that poured down the canon then the strokes quickened the craft lurched beneath them and the sunlight was blotted out as they plunged into sprayfilled dimness high through the vapour towered smooth walls of stone and the river that rebounded from them was piled in a white track of foam midway between  the canoe swept onwards down it apparently with the speed of a locomotive and seaforth crouching in the bows gripped his paddle with bleeding fingers that had split at the knuckles with the frost he watched the smooth walls whirl by him mechanically and remembered that the canon could not last forever  there was comfort in the reflection because the miles would melt behind them at the pace they travelled at  that was so long as the stream flowed straight and even but he did not care to contemplate what would happen if it foamed over any obstacle  for a time he saw nothing but froth and spray and flitting stone and then the roar that came back from the towering walls swelled into a great diapason terrifying and bewildering  seaforth glanced over his shoulder and saw that okanagan was dipping his paddle  a fall or a big rapid  weve got to go through he said  seaforth swept his gaze aloft for a moment while the bewildering roar grew deafening  nothing that had life in it could scale the horrible smooth walls that hung over them and through a rift in the vapour he could see a filigree of whitened pines that seemed very far away projected against the blue  they were he fancied at least a thousand feet above him and he and okanagan alone far down in the dimness of another world with their helpless companion  then he nerved himself for an effort as he looked forward into the spray and vapour that whirled in denser clouds ahead  nothing was visible through its filmy folds but his flesh shrank from the tumult of sound that came out of it  hold her straight cried okanagan in a breathless roar and seaforth just heard his voice through the diapason of the river  then the canoe lurched beneath them and sped faster still plunging rocking rolling while the froth beat into her and seaforth whirled his paddle in a frenzy  the shrinking had gone and he was only conscious of a curious unreasoning exaltation  a pinnacle of rock flashed by them there was a roar from tom and straining every sinew on the paddle they swung with eyes dilated and laboured breath sideways towards the wall of stone  then the froth that leapt about it swept astern and they were going on again faster than ever and apparently down a declivity the spray beating upon them and the canoe swinging her bows out of a frothing confusion  seaforth heard a cry behind him but could attach no meaning to it and whirled his paddle mechanically until the craft appeared to lurch out from under him and fall bodily with a great splashing  twice it seemed to him she swung round a great black pool and then they were driving forward again a trifle more smoothly while here and there a stunted pine that clung to the rocks came flitting back to them  he felt okanagans paddle in his shoulder and glanced round a moment  there was a green strip behind them that seemed to roll itself together and fall roaring into the pool but a wisp of mist that blotted out everything drifted across his eyes  seaforth retained no very clear impression of the remainder of that days journey but it was late in the afternoon when the walls of rock fell back a little on either hand and it seemed to him that they lay motionless in the bottom of a great pit while the hills slowly rolled away behind them  here and there a strip of shingle now divided rock from river and when presently okanagan called out seaforth felt by the change of motion that he was backing his paddle  looking forward he saw the cause of it for there were boulders in the channel and a great fir lay jammed across them  they were almost upon it when the bows reached the shingle  okanagan helped him to carry alton ashore and then stood still looking at the fir which was of a girth seldom seen in any other country  shes lying right across and weve got to chop our way through he said  youll fix the tent and make supper while i take first turn  he came back dripping presently and seaforth was waistdeep in icy water when he reached the tree  the shingle slipped beneath him the stream frothed about his limbs and he felt very puny and helpless with that great log before him  his hands were split and opened by the frost and the wounds bled at every stroke but while the red glare of the fire okanagan was feeding with washedup branches flickered about him he panted and smote until the power went from him and his comrade took his place  it was apparently a task for demigods but it is no unusual thing for the men who come to grips with nature unsubdued in the frozen north to attempt and accomplish more than flesh and blood seem capable of and all night long they fought their grim battle hewing until sight and breathing failed them and then staggering back to lie dripping and gasping by the fire  arms grew powerless eyes were dim the rents in their wet hands gaped and there was blood upon their deerskins but little by little the notch widened until at last the steel splashed in the water that deflected it and seaforth fancied they were beaten still there was no relaxing of effort and as the stars were paling in the rift high overhead he heard a sound that was not the monotone of the river  another man heard it too for okanagan came floundering towards him through a tumult of foam and wrested the axe from his hand for five minutes he smote fiercely and then raised a hoarse halfarticulate cry of triumph  shes going  there was a smashing and snapping  the huge trunk rolled a little rent and swept away and seaforth reeling shorewards sat down with bleeding hands in the ashes laughing foolishly until okanagan stooped and smote his shoulder  get up he said  its time we were going  there was not light enough to see by and they had eaten nothing during all those hours of heroic toil but seaforth seemed to realize that the issue lay beyond them now and it did not matter greatly what they did or failed to do  he was also consumed by a desire to escape from that horrible place of shadow and striking the tent in clumsy haste they launched the canoe  after that he remembered little though he had a hazy recollection of stopping somewhere and helping tom to make a fire for there was wood in abundance everywhere  whether he ate anything he did not know but all day the canoe slid on comparatively smoothly and they toiled at the paddle until hands and arms seemed to move of their own volition  seaforth felt that he would gladly have lain down and frozen but an influence which had apparently nothing to do with his will constrained him to labour on  at last when the stars were shining and the moon hung red in a broader strip of sky the curious sustaining animus seemed to desert him and he lurched forward with a little gasp while the paddle almost slipped from his stiffened fingers  hold up said okanagan  streams running slow and the hills are opening there  im not sure that were not close on the somasco valley  seaforth made a last effort but his fingers lost their grasp and when he slipped forward again his paddle slid away behind them  then he groaned a little and lay still in the bottom of the canoe  the next thing he was clearly conscious of was the ringing of a rifle and he raised himself as the woods flung back the sound  they seemed some distance from him now and the moon shone down on a broadening strip of water  again the rifle flashed and he wondered vacantly whether the twinkle that perplexed his hazy sight could be lights that blinked at them  where have we got to tom he said  okanagan laughed softly  tolerably close on somasco he said  i think theyve heard us at the mill  then as seaforth listened a shout came ringing across the glinting space before them that seemed curiously still  hold on  were coming  is that you and the others tom  okanagan laughed again and the canoe stopped amidst the ice when the paddle fell from his hand  its a good deal less of us than there was when we started out he said     chapter xxii  miss deringham decides  it was a clear winter day when a big sidewheel steamer bound for way ports down the sound lay at the wharf at vancouver waiting for the mail  towering white in the sunshine high above the translucent brine she looked with her huge wheelcasings lines of winking windows and triple tier of decks more like a hotel set afloat than a steamer and the resemblance was completed by the long tables set out for breakfast in the white and gold saloon  no swarm of voracious passengers had however descended upon them as yet for though winter touches the southern coast but lightly it is occasionally almost arctic amidst the ranges of the mountain province and the pacific express was held up somewhere by the snow  bright though the sunshine was a bitter wind came down across the inlet from the gleaming hills that stretched back ridged here and there by the sombre green of pines towards the frozen north and deringham and his daughter who were setting out on a visit to a town of washington had sought shelter in the saloon  alice deringham leaned back in a corner a very dainty picture in her clinging furs with the ivory whiteness of the panelling behind her  her father sat close by with a face that was slightly puckered and thoughtful eyes turning over a packet of letters that had reached him from england the day before and his daughter fancied that their contents by no means pleased him  there were a few of her passengers in the saloon and one couple attracted her languid attention  she could see the man plainly and he was one of the usual type of western citizen keeneyed quick and nervous of movement and gesture and incisive of speech  he had a bundle of papers before him and appeared to be making calculations in pencil while he dictated to his companion  now and then she caught disjointed fragments of his conversation  got that quite straight  fall in securities silver depreciating now did i put in anything about the democrats going in  miss deringham could make but little of this and had always cherished a faint contempt which she may have inherited from her mother who had been born at carnaby for anything connected with business  still she was mildly interested in the mans companion whose face she could not see  the girl was dressed very plainly and miss deringham decided that the fabric had not cost much to begin with and was by no means new  it however set off a pretty slender figure and the girl had fine brown hair while the little ungloved fingers on pencil were white and shapely  alice deringham wondered with a languid curiosity what her face was like and felt a half contemptuous pity for her  she did not consider such an occupation fitting for a woman  then her attention was diverted as a boy with a satchel calling out colonist in a shrill nasal drawl came in and she vacantly watched a man who purchased a paper spread out the sheet  theyve got that fellow up at slocane he said to a companion  yes sir sent him down for trial and it took a special guard to keep the boys off him  i guess if hed done it down our way they wouldnt have worried but put him in a tarkeg and set a light to him  theyre way behind the times in the dominion  killed him in his sleep for a hundred dollars said another man glancing over the readers shoulder but miss deringham was not interested in the murder she remembered having heard about  she was however a trifle astonished to see that her father was watching the gathering group with a serious look in his eyes but he glanced down somewhat hastily at his papers when he met her gaze  then the voices grew less distinct and that of the man dictating broke monotonously through them until a steward approached her father with an envelope in his hand  mr forel has just sent it down sir he said  youre mr deringham  deringham tore the envelope open and while he sat staring at the paper inside it his daughter noticed that there was a little pale spot in his cheek  his hand also appeared to tremble slightly when saying nothing he passed the telegram across to her  regret to inform you that my partner met with accident in the ranges and his condition is critical it read  can you send us nurse or capable woman  mrs margery ill  seaforth somasco  alice deringham shivered a little  he is evidently dangerously injured  it appears so said deringham and his daughter afterwards remembered that his voice was hoarse and strained  the girl however said nothing for a while  she was not impulsive and her face remained almost as cold in its clear whiteness as the panelling behind it but her heart beat a little faster than usual and she was trying somewhat unsuccessfully to analyze her sensations  in the meanwhile the voices of the men who now surrounded the one with the paper reached her and she noticed vacantly that her father seemed to be listening to them  theyll hang him anyway said one  made no show at all when they got him hiding in the bush said another  still you couldnt expect much from that kind of man killed him for a hundred dollars in his bed  yes sir said the first speaker  and he didnt get all of them the man was his own cousin and too sick to do anything  well thank god we havent got many vermin of that kind in the dominion  deringham who had picked up the telegram let it slip from his fingers as he rose and the girl wondered at the change in him  he seemed to have grown suddenly haggard and the lines upon his face were much more apparent than usual  you will excuse me a minute he said and the girl noticed the curious deliberation of his movements and the stoop in his shoulders as he crossed the saloon  deringham had faced more than one crisis in the past and the difference in his pose might not have attracted a strangers notice though it was evident to his daughter that something had troubled him why he should be so disturbed by the news of altons condition she could not quite see but that appeared of the less importance because she was endeavouring to evade the question why the telegram should also have caused her a curious consternation  he was a halftaught rancher and she had been accustomed to the homage of men of mark and polish in englandbut it was with something approaching dismay she heard that the man who had supplanted her father was though she could scarcely contemplate the possibility dying  in the meanwhile deringham walked into the bar and leaned somewhat heavily upon the counter as he asked for a glass of brandy  he spilled a little of it and the steward who saw that his fingers shook glanced at him curiously as he set it down  i guess that will fix you sir he said  youre not feeling well  deringham made a little gesture of assent and the man drew him out a chair  that is good brandy he said  youd better sit down there quietly and have another  heres the colonist  theyve got that fellow up at slocane but one feels sorry the boys didnt get hold of him  hangings not much use for that kind of man  deringhams fingers trembled as he thrust the journal aside but his voice was even  the brandy is rather better than any ive had of late he said  you can give me another glass of it  for at least ten minutes he lay somewhat limply in the chair and his reflections were not pleasant  he had speculated with another mans money and lost most of it as well as profited by several transactions which were little better than a swindle but that was as far as he had gone hitherto and he had in a curious fashion retained through it all a measure of inherited pride  now however the disguise was for a moment torn aside and he saw himself as he was a thief and a miscreant no better than the brutish bushman who had slain his sick kinsman for a hundred dollars  there was as he had read already nothing to redeem the sordid cowardly treachery of that crime  deringham was however proficient at finding excuses for himself and shutting his eyes to unpleasant facts and the phase commenced to pass he had he recollected plainly stated that he merely desired alton to be detained a little amidst the ranges and it became evident to him that what had happened was the result of hallams villainy  hallam had injured him as well as alton while there was no controverting the fact that the ranchers decease would relieve him of a vast anxiety and his first indignation against hallam also melted when he rose composedly from the chair  he felt that seaforth expected something of him and it appeared advisable to consider what could be done while a project already commended itself to him  in another five minutes he had rejoined his daughter looking more like the man who urbanely presided over the not always contented shareholders meetings  he realized however that he had a slightly difficult task before him  you seem to take the news rather badly father said the girl  deringham smiled deprecatingly  i have not been quite so well lately and it upset me a trifle said he  i have a regard for our canadian kinsman and have been inclined to fancy that you shared it with me  of course said the girl indifferently  mr alton has been especially kind to us  yes said deringham  mr seaforth must also be very helpless up there alone with his comrade seriously ill  now there is no great necessity for my journey down the sound and i have no doubt that the business could be handled almost as well by letter  i do not know that there is very much that would please you to be seen in the washington townships either  alice deringham glanced at him thoughtfully  and she said  deringham glanced down a moment at his shoes  i was wondering if you could be of any use up there  his daughter laughed a little  i think that is readily answered  i cannot cook and neither can i wash while i have never attended to a sick person in my life  no said her father with a trace of embarrassment  still one understands that it comes naturally to women  in any case your mere presence would in a fashion be an advantage  alice deringham watched him in silence for a few seconds and then smiled again  it is somewhat difficult to believe it  i am sincerely sorry for mr alton but i can see no reason for intruding at somasco now  deringham regarded her steadily and the girl knew it would be advisable for her to yield  this did not displease her for though she had negatived his suggestion her fathers wishes coincided with her own  she however desired to visit somasco as it were under compulsion and to feel that she had not done so of her own inclination  i think there is a reasonand it would please me he said  then i should be pleased to hear it  deringham appeared to consider because the motives which influenced him were ones he could not well reveal  we are his only relatives in this countryand there is the look of the thing he said  the girl moved a little and her father watching her noticed her fine symmetry and how her redgold hair gleamed against the white panelling  it was possibly because of this background he also noticed the faint flicker of warmth that crept into her face and neck and that there was a glow in her eyes he had not seen there previously  that she said with a cold distinctness is precisely what i object to  deringham laughed a little  i think that aspect of the question will not be evident to alton  no said the girl while the tinge of colour deepened a little still it is very plain to me  deringham said nothing and the two sat still while the voice of the man dictating jarred upon one of them  very little interest taken in mineral claims no inquiries for ranching properties  alice deringham turned and saw the girls fingers flittering across the paper but her face was still hidden and the monotonous voice continued we made a few advances during the last week or two  the other passengers had gone out of the saloon and it was very quiet save for the soft flow of words and rattle of the pencil when deringham once more unfolded the telegram  i am afraid it is going hardly with the man he said suggestively my partner met with accidenthis condition is critical  the message left somasco yesterday  there was a rustle at the adjoining table and the girls pencil fell to the floor  will you wait a moment please a voice said and the dictation broke off abruptly while when the girl rose alice deringham found herself suddenly confronted with miss townshead  deringham who stood up made her a little decorous inclination  i am pleased to see you again he said  the speech was apparently lost upon the girl who did not seem to notice his daughters greeting  i could not avoid hearing a few words of yours she said  mr altonor his partneris seriously ill  deringham handed her the telegram and stood watching her curiously while she read it  he saw her lips set a trifle and a slight lowering of her eyes but though the girl seemed to draw in her breath he fancied it was not with consternation  that is all we know he said  miss townshead gave him back the message but deringham did not see her face for she and his daughter seemed to be looking at each other they formed a somewhat curious contrast for alice deringham appeared taller and more stately than she was in her costly furs and nellie townshead very slight and almost shabby in her thin and wellworn dress  neither spoke for a moment but the halfamiable condescension in miss deringhams attitude was a trifle too marked  i am afraid that is all we can tell you she said  mr alton has evidently met with a serious accident and we are going up at once to somasco to see what we can do for him  deringham moved a trifle and glanced at his daughter  she had said very little but there was a subtle something in her tone and bearing which implied a good deal and he fancied it was not lost upon miss townshead  the latter however glanced round towards her employer and her face was once more expressionless as she said then i hope you will find him progressing favourably and it would be a kindness to my father and myself if you or mr seaforth would send us word  she went back to her duties and deringham smiled a little as the monotonous voice commenced again  thats all right miss townshead now where was i  oh yes we should not recommend any further advances  did i tell him we had to negotiate tyrers bond at a discount  you seem to have reversed your decision somewhat suddenly he said i had not noticed it before but miss townshead is distinctly pretty she was i believe on tolerably good terms with our afflicted kinsman  miss deringham laughed as she answered him  that is one of our privileges but you had better inquire about my baggage  i think i hear the train coming in  she turned a moment as she went out of the saloon and glanced back towards the table  she could only see that miss townsheads head was bent lower over the paper than it had been but she had a suspicion as to what the girl was feeling  it was also partly but not more than partly justified for nellie townshead was writing mechanically just then though now and then she drove the pencil somewhat viciously into the paper when the hasty words grew faster  dont consider your recommendation workable  we are sending you ore to test  finish it up in the usual way  then the locomotive bell on the wharf was answered by the roar of the steamers whistle and the man folded up his papers  you will have to get ashore but we have done a good mornings work said he  those were friends of yours from the old country  no said nellie townshead with a curious expression  they are from the old country but i only met them once or twice at somasco  the man glanced at her thoughtfully  yes he said  i kind of fancied the lady didnt mean to be nice to you  miss townshead smiled though there was an ominous brightness in her eyes  i scarcely think she would take the trouble to make me feel that she said  miss deringham is i understand a lady of some importance in the old country  the man once more regarded her with grave kindliness  folks of that kind can be very nasty prettily  ive met one or two of them  well youre one of the smartest business ladies ive come across yet in this country and i should figure thats quite as good as the other nowwell of course we held back a little when we engaged you and you can tell the cashier to hand you out another two dollars every saturday  nellie townshead felt that the colour was in her cheeks but she thanked the man and gathering up her papers hastened down the gangway at the last moment  she stopped a moment breathless when she reached the wharf and saw deringham and his daughter drive away and shut one little hand  then she laughed and turned towards the city with a gesture of impatience  the two dollars are badly neededand im a little fool but it hurt all of it she said     chapter xxiii  the awakening  the snow had ceased an hour or two earlier and the moon shone down upon the glistening pines that shook off their white covering under a bitter wind when a wagon came lurching into the somasco valley  four weary horses floundered in front of it a thin white steam rising from them into the nipping air and okanagan swayed half asleep upon the drivingseat growling inarticulate objurgations when the vehicle sank creaking into a hollow he could not see  he had wearing out several horses during the journey driven close upon a hundred miles through the frost and snow and had ceased to encourage his companions during the last hour or so  in fact he was almost as incapable of speech just then as they were of comprehending him  they had however won his admiration which he was somewhat slow of according city folk for although there had been times when as he dragged the wornout team up steep hillsides through the blinding snow he almost despaired of reaching somasco he had heard no complaint from either deringham or his daughter  the man had helped him where he could and when there was nothing that he could do sat silent beside him smoking tranquilly while with the flungup snow whirling about them the team went floundering down almost precipitous gully or rutted declivity where a stumble would have hurled them all into the tops of the pines below  nor had a cry escaped the girl who sat behind them gripping the side of the bouncing vehicle when once a horse went down and on another occasion the wagon left the trail and drove into a hemlock  okanagan also remembered that though it had been necessary to lift her down when twice they stopped to change the team at a lonely ranch she rose smiling with blue lips when it was time to go on again  yes sir he afterwards said to seaforth there wasnt any weakening down in either of them and the girls a daisy  deringham however was now sitting amidst the straw in the bottom of the wagon with his arm about his daughter who nestled close to him for the sake of warmth  a bitter frost had set in during the last hour or so and the snow was frozen in white patches upon her wrappings while it was with numbed senses she vacantly watched the pines flit past her  it seemed that they would crawl up out of the darkness and slide by white beneath the moonlight forever  nor could she recollect much of the journey which had only left a hazy memory of biting cold and blinding snow fierce struggles through the drifts and brief interludes of warmth and brightness in forestshrouded ranches where her chilled flesh shrank from the task before her when she rose to go on again  there was alton blood in alice deringham and more than a trace of the alton pride but she did not know what motive had sustained her or why she had borne it all so patiently and in this she differed from her father  deringham seldom did anything without a purpose and he had one now  his daughter had been asleep with her head on his shoulder when a shout roused her two hours earlier and with a drumming of hoofs they came lurching into the settlement  for a blissful moment she fancied the journey was at an end for there were lights and voices and a pleasant smell of firwood smoke but okanagan shouted to his team and the lights faded away behind as they plunged into the silence beneath the pines again  father she said faintly do you think he has gone the wrong way it seems ever so long since we left the settlement  okanagan may have heard her though the words were almost indistinguishable  you lie right where you are for another ten minutes and keep warm miss he said then ill show you something  alice deringham shivered all through  it is a little difficult she said  okanagan spoke to his horses and after what appeared an interminable time looked down again  there he said with a curious almost silent laugh and the girl saw a red blink amidst the pines across the valley  thats somasco  alice deringham let her head drop back on her fathers shoulder with a little sigh  it seems a very long way she said and i am very cold  it was some time later when the wagon stopped with a jerk and she roused herself as a glare of light shone about her  voices came out of it somebody held out a hand and a man whom she did not recognize lifted her from the wagon  then she walked unevenly into the brightness of a logwalled hall and grew faint while a tingling pain ran through her with the change of temperature  a woman whom she did not know clumsily took her wrappings from her and then led her into a room where seaforth drew a chair up to a table beside the stove  alice deringhams head was throbbing but she could see that he was white and haggard  how is he she said and the tingling pain grew more pronounced as she waited the answer  seaforths face was very grave  i think it is touch and go with himbut if he wears the night out he may pull through  it was very good of you to come  alice deringham made a little gesture of impatience  but there is hope she said and her voice was very low and strained  seaforth glanced round sharply as the woman knocking over something went out of the room  a little i believe if he could sleep he said huskily  the doctor is with him nowscarcely left him the last four days  we have nobody to help us  mrs margery broke down  the woman you saw is incapable harry has been deliriousand asking for youhalf the time  seaforth looked at his companion as he spoke and the girl met his gaze directly  there was no room for anything but frankness at such a time  ah she said simply  i am glad i came  seaforths eyes seemed to grow a little misty and alice deringham who suddenly looked aside wondered whether it was only the effect of weariness  whatever he felt he however quietly poured something into a cup and handed it to her  but you must eat he said  hungry and cold as she had been the girl could eat but little though the steaming liquid in the cup put a little life into her and presently she rose up and shook off the coarse shawl which somebody had wrapped about her shoulders  i am ready now she said  seaforth glanced at her a moment with open admiration  the girl to hide her weariness stood very straight and alice deringham knew how to hold herself  the pallor in her face intensified the little glow in her eyes and the ruddy gleam of her lustrous hair under the lamplight she was it seemed to him almost splendid in her statuesque symmetry but there was also a subtle change in her and a sudden sense of confusion came upon him  he remembered his previous distrust of her and that it was to save his comrade she had come  no he said quietly you must rest and sleep before you go to him  alice deringham smiled a little but there was a vibration in her voice that stirred the man  do you think i could  this time there was no mistaking the faint haziness in seaforths eyes god bless you he said simply  he is my friendand i think you are the only one who can do anything for him  alice deringham had in her a trace of greatness which was instinctive and not the result of the training that had taught her serenity  so though the man had not hidden his meaning she made no protest nor asked any question  all this is new to me she said but i will do the best i can  seaforth led her into a room where a dim light was burning  it was most of it in shadow but she could see the still form on the bed and for a moment or two nothing else  the face on the pillow was very white and hollow the halfclosed eyes had a curious glitter while a lean hand was clenched upon the coverlet  alice deringham had seen very little of suffering of any kind and nothing of sickness and for a moment she stood motionless horrified at the sight of what was left of the man who had parted from her on the verandah the incarnation of resolute virility  as she watched him he moaned a little and the sound which was scarcely human and suggested the cry of some unreasoning creature in pain sent a thrill through her  her eyes dimmed a little and moving forward softly she laid a cool palm on the flushed forehead  dont you know me harry  i have come to take care of you she said  the mans eyes opened wider and though it was evident that there was not complete comprehension in them he sighed as with a great contentment  then they closed altogether as he turned his head a trifle on the pillow  the girl did not move but stood stooping a little and looking down at him with a great compassion until a man who had been watching her nodded unseen to seaforth as he also bent over the bed  he waited for almost a minute and then straightened himself wearily as he spoke in a just audible whisper  quiet at last and sleep may come  miss deringham i think he said  the girl bent her head and moved softly with him towards the door he knew me she said  the doctor shook his head  nonot altogether i think  still he is quiet and that is everything  now i may be wantedpresentlyand for a little there is nothing i can do while mr seaforth and i have reached our limits  if alton opens his eyes let him see you and you will give him the draught yonder in an hour from now  it is of vital importance that he should take it  if he does not tap on the door for me  alice deringham bent her head again and when the doctor went out with seaforth sat down beside the bed  her fatigue had gone from her and though she had never done such things before she gently drew the coverings higher about the man and once ventured to raise his head a trifle and smooth down the pillow  alton opened his eyes and for a moment they seemed to follow her but the gleam of understanding went out of them when she sat down again  then he lay very still and there was an oppressive quietness through which she could hear the crackle of the stove and the night wind moaning about the ranch  altons eyes were shut now and the girl sat and watched him too intent almost to wonder at herself  this was the man she had striven to despise and yet she who had never concerned herself with womans work before forgot her weariness as she waited to minister to him  it was but little help that she could offera gentle touch that checked a restless movement a wrinkle smoothed from the pillowbut it was done with a great tenderness for fibres in the girls nature that had lain silent long awoke that night and thrilled  now and then alton moved a little and once or twice he moaned  the firewood snapped and crackled in the stove the sigh of the pines came up in fantastic cadence across the clearing and so while the dark angel stooped above the lonely ranch the night wore on  there was however one man in somasco ranch who needed sleep that night and found it fly from him  deringham who had spoken with the doctor lay fully dressed in an adjoining room listening to the ticking of his watch and for any sound that might rise from beyond the cedar boarding where his daughter kept her vigil  he had gathered that before the morning alton of somasco and carnaby would either have laid aside his activities for ever or be within hope of recovery and while deringham dare not ask himself just then whether he desired the death of his kinsman the suspense was maddening  if the flame of vitality that was flickering so feebly went out carnaby would be his daughters and the burden which almost crushed him lifted  if it burned on there was at the best a long struggle with adversity before him and at the worst disgrace and possibly a prison  a very little thing he knew would turn the scale an effort made in delirium a draught that struck too shrewdly on the fevered frame and the issue of stupendous importance as it was to both of them lay in his daughters hands  seaforth and the doctor slept the sleep of exhaustion and deringham could have laughed with bitter mirthlessness at the irony of it all  until she had quarrelled with her maid alice deringham had apparently been incapable of putting on her own dresses unassisted and it seemed that the grim mysterious destiny which treated men as puppets and traversed all their schemes was the one factor to reckon with in that comedy  deringham however found little solace in such reflections and could not lie still and rising strained his ears to listen  there was nothing but the moaning of the wind the ranch was very still and the sound of his watch grew maddening  if alton was sleeping now deringham knew it was ticking his last hold on good fame and fortune away  twice he paced up and down the room with uncovered feet and then quivering a little when the floor creaked opened the door that led into the one adjoining  alice he said and for he had thrown off the mask now his daughter wondered at his face  hush she said almost sternly and then moved very quietly away from the bed  deringham came in and leaned upon the table beside her  the great question is still unanswered he said  his daughter bent her head and then looked at him steadily  i think we shall know in an hour or two  is it important to you  deringham who was not wholly master of himself made a little grimace and the girl glanced away from him with a curious shrinking  under stress of fatigue and anxiety the veneer had worn off both of them and in that impressive hour when the spirit is bound most loosely to the clay each had seen something not hitherto suspected of the others inmost self  in the girls case the sight had been painful for all that was good in her had risen uppermost just then  in deringhams there was very little but veneer and craven fear and avarice looked out through his eyes  yes he said in a voice that was the harsher for its lowness and to you  i did not tell you but if that man dies you will be the mistress of carnaby  alice deringham made a little halfcontemptuous gesture of impatience but the colour showed in her cheek  you are overtired father or you would not have thought of thatjust now  deringham glanced at her curiously with an unpleasant smile  you apparently did not comprehend me he said  would you be astonished to hear that alton who seems to have anticipated disaster left you carnaby by will  the girl rose and met the mans gaze directly though the colour had crept beyond her cheeks now  no she said very quietly though i never thought of this  i know him better than ever you could do  but it is time i gave him the medicine and you must go  deringham did not move but watched his daughter as she took up the glass and phial  it is important that he should have the draught he said  yes she said in a voice that thrilled a little as she stood very straight before him  i think it would make all the difference betweena girl without a dowry and the mistress of carnaby  then she pointed as it were commandingly towards the door and deringham went out with a white face as though she had struck him upon it while alice deringham shivered and sank down limply into the chair she sat still for a moment with eyes that shone mistily and a great sense of humility and then rousing herself with an effort moved towards the bed and touched the sick man gently  he opened his eyes as she did so and there was no glitter in them now but a dawning comprehension  he seemed to smile a little when she raised his head  you must drink this she said  alton made a gesture of understanding and drained the glass then let his head fall back and feebly stretched out his hand until it touched her fingers  the girl did not move and his grasp tightened suddenly  hold me fast  i am slippingslipping down he said  alice deringham returned the pressure of the clinging fingers and as she saw a curious unreasoning confidence creep into the haggard face her eyes once more shone through a gathering mistiness  i will hold you fast she said  yes said the sick man in a strained voice  you will not let go its five hundred feet to the riverin the dark below  im slipping slippingno holding in the snow  he ceased and looked up at her suddenly as though the fear had left him and the girl said very softly dont you know me  yes said the man  of course  i was sliding back into the gully but i knew you would help me  he stopped again and the strained expression suddenly sank out of his eyes while the girl flushed to the temples when they met her own  now he said very softly i shall get better  nothing can stop me you will hold me fast and not let go  he drew her towards him and alice deringham seeing that the brief flash of reason was fading again yielded to the feeble pressure and sank to her knees holding fast the hot fingers that drew her hand to his breast  then moved by an impulse swift and uncontrollable she bent a little farther and kissed him on the cheek  alton said nothing but opened his eyes and smiled at her and then lay still  for a space of minutes the girl dare scarcely breathe  everything she had been told depended upon the sick man sleeping and now he was very quiet  then she raised her head and glanced at him  he had not moved at all and his face was tranquil but the hot fingers still clung to her hand  it was borne in upon her that she could in verity draw him back from the darkness he was slipping into and with a great fear and compassion she held the hot fingers fast  there was no longer any snapping in the stove  the roar of the pines grew louder and the room grew cold but while the minutes slipped by alton slept peacefully with the hand of the woman he had dispossessed in his and she forgetting her fatigue watched him with eyes that filled with tenderness  still she was not more than a woman and at last the eyes grew hazy while every joint ached  there was a horrible cramp in her shoulder and to lessen it she moved a trifle so that her arm rested on the pillow  that was easier and while she struggled with her weariness her head followed it until it sank down close by altons shoulder then for five minutes she fought with her weakness and was vanquished for her head settled lower into its resting place and her eyes closed  it was some little time later when seaforth came very softly into the room and stopped with a little gasp  he could just see his comrades face and it was still and serene but there was a gleam of redgold hair beside it on the coverlet and now a shapely arm was flung protectingly about the sick mans shoulder  the girl was also very still and a little flush of colour crept into seaforths face as he stooped above her and saw the clasped hands  thank god he said  then he moved backwards on tiptoe towards deringhams room but apparently changed his intention and presently knocked at the doctors door  times up and i thought id better rouse you he said  shall i go in and look at your patient  the doctor rose up fully dressed and seaforth who watched him enter the other room nodded to himself while the man he had left stooped above the sleeping pair and smiled with a great contentment  he had done what he could but he knew that a greater power than any he wielded had driven back the dark angel which had stooped above the sick mans bed  the sun was in the heavens when finding other procedure unavailing he gently touched the girl and alice deringham rose silently and turned to him some moments later almost proudly with a soft glow in her cheeks and a question in her eyes  yes said the doctor smiling  i fancy we have seen the worst  then the girls strength went from her and she caught at the rail of the bed shivering until the man touched her arm and led her from the room  you have done a great deal i think and must sleep he said  it was afternoon when alice deringham resumed her watch and she met seaforth on her way to the sick mans room  i want to thank you miss deringham  he is my partner and the only friend i have he said with a slight huskiness  the girl regarded him steadily  you mean it  seaforth winced a little  yes he said  alice deringham still fixed her eyes upon him  and yet you distrusted me once  seaforths face was haggard but it was less pale than it had been when he bent his head  i can only throw myself on your mercy  i was more of a fool than usual then  alice deringham laughed softly but graciously  i could not blame youand you may have been right she said  then she passed into the room and saw the light creep into altons eyes which had apparently been fixed upon the door  her blood tingled and her neck grew hot for it was evident that while his mind was clear at last he remembered a little  the river is farther away now but i want you still he said     chapter xxiv  hallam tries again  there was frost in the valley when one clear morning alton lay partly dressed in a big chair beside the stove at somasco ranch  outside the snow lay white on the clearing and the great pines rose above it sombre and motionless under the sunlight that had no warmth in it while the peaks beyond them shone with a silvery lustre against the cloudless blue  it was a day to set the blood stirring and rouse the vigour of the strong and alton felt the effect of it as he lay listening to the rhythmic humming of the saws  the sound spoke of activity and raising himself a trifle in his chair he glanced at his partner with a faint sparkle in his eye  its good to feel alive again he said  seaforths smile was somewhat forced for he had reason for dreading the moment when his comrade would take an interest in the affairs of life again  there was something that alton must know and glancing at his hollow face he shrank from telling him  the struggle had been a long one for fever had once more seized alton when he was apparently on the way to recovery and there had been times when it seemed to seaforth that two angels kept the long night watches with him beside his comrades bed  one was terrible and shadowy and stooped lower and lower and above the scarcely breathing form the other bright and beautiful an angel of tenderness and mercy and if seaforth was fanciful there were excuses for him  his endurance had been strained to the uttermost as day and night he kept his vigil while the humanity of the girl who watched with him had become etherealized until her beauty was almost spiritual  the coldness had gone out of it and now and then it seemed to the wornout man that a faint reflection of a light that is not kindled in this world shone through the pity in her eyes  that spark was all that had been lacking and seaforth who had doubted bent his head in homage when it came for it appeared to him that in sloughing off her pride and becoming wholly womanly the girl had reached out in her gentleness and compassion towards the divine  when at last the turning had been passed and alice deringham went down with her father for a brief rest to vancouver she took seaforths limitless respect and gratitude with her though it occurred to him that she had gone somewhat suddenly as though anxious to escape from the ranch  they were however to return that evening  i talked a good deal charley when i was sick said alton  seaforth smiled dryly  there is no use in denying it because you did he said  altons face grew clouded  id have bitten my tongue right through if id known  there were one or two things id been through that would come back to me things one would sooner forget  seaforth appeared thoughtful but evidently decided that frankness was best  there certainly were occasions when your recollections were somewhat realistic  alton groaned and his face was a study of consternation  lord what brutes we are he said  there was the trouble over the bluebird claim down in washington  did i talk about that  seaforth crossed over and sat down on the arm of his comrades chair his expression was somewhat whimsical but there was a suggestion of tenderness in his eyes for he saw the direction in which altons thoughts were tending and that he should speak of such matters to him betokened the closeness of the bond between them  i dont think you need worry about it harry he said  no said alton sternly  are those the things you would like a dainty english lady who knows nothing of what we have to do now and then to hear  seaforth smiled again as he said miss deringham struck me as an especially sensible young woman  now you need not get savage for i am speaking respectfully but i fancy that miss deringham knows almost as much about the ins and outs of life as many bush ranchers of seventy young women brought up as she has been in the old country not infrequently do and as it happened you mentioned nothing about that last affair in the bush while though one or two incidents were somewhat startling there are i fancy girls in the old country who would be rather inclined to look with approval onthe type of man she might have reason for supposing you to be  in any case there was no word of any other woman  alton drew in his breath  no he said simply  thank god there never was another  seaforths expression perplexed his comrade and his voice was a trifle strained  yes he said  that is a good deal to be thankful for harry  alton looked at him thoughtfully in silence for a space  then he said i never asked you any questions about the old country charley and i dont mean to now but i have fancied now and then that you brought out some trouble along with you  seaforth glanced down at his comrade smiling curiously  i may tell you some timebut not now  you do well to be thankful harry and do you believe that any woman would think the worse of you because you cut down the man who meant to take your life you big greatnatured fool  alton sighed  well he said very slowly perhaps it is better over because that and other things would have to be told but though i had only an axe against his pistol i cant get that mans face out of my memory  seaforths face was somewhat awry just then  you can tell your story without a blushif you think it necessary but i have not the courage to tell mineand the silence may cost me very dear he said  alton seemed a trifle bewildered  when you can ill listen but theres nothing you could tell me would make any difference between you and me  seaforth laughed mirthlessly  im glad of that but it wasnt you i was thinking of just then he said  still it seems to me that we are both a little off our balance this morning and may be sorry for it afterwards  alton rose up and moved somewhat stiffly towards the window where he leaned against the log casing looking out greedily upon the sunlit valley  then he limped back to the table and rested both hands upon it  i figure its because i havent used it but this leg doesnt feel the same as it used to he said  did it strike you that i walked kind of stiffly  seaforth knew that the moment he feared had come but he felt his courage fail him and turned his head aside  i was not watching you he said  alton who appeared a trifle perturbed sat down and glanced at the partly finished meal upon the table disgustedly  tell them to take those things away and bring me something a man can eat  then i want my long boots and the nicest clothes i have  they will not be much use to you  youre not going out for another week anyway  alton laughed a little  well he said well see  bring me a good solid piece of venison and take those things away  he made an ample meal dressed himself with wholly unusual fastidiousness and when seaforth left him for a few moments strode out of the room  one leg felt very stiff and he clutched the balustrade a moment when he came to the head of a short stairway then stiffened himself and putting all the weight he could on the limb that was least useful stepped forward resolutely to descend it  his knee bent suddenly under him he clutched at the rails and missed them reeled and lost his balance and there was a crash as seaforth sprang out of his room  he was in time to see his comrade rise and lean against the logs at the foot of the stairway very white and grim in face and shivered a little as he went down  whats the meaning of this charley  said alton with an ominous quietness  i just put my weight on my left footand down i came  again seaforth shrank from his task  you were warned not to try to walk much for a week or two  pshaw said alton with sudden fierceness  theres more than that  seaforth laid his hand compassionately upon his comrades shoulder it had to come sooner or laterand i was afraid to tell you before you will never walk quite as well as you used to harry  alton clutched the balustrade and a greyness crept into his face i he said very slowly a crippleall my life  seaforth said nothing and there was a silence for almost a minute until alton slowly straightened himself  well he said quietly there is no use kickingbut this was to have been the best day of my life  seaforth understood him and saw his opportunity  i dont think that will make any difference harry  alton seemed to choke down a groan  i had so little before he said  again seaforth laid his hand upon his shoulder shake yourself together harry  after all i dont think it is the things that one can offer which count he said  let me help you back  alton resolutely shook off his grasp and moved very slowly and stiffly towards the livingroom  no he said  im not going back there any more  get me a big black cigar charleyand then go right away  seaforth did as he was bidden for there were many things which demanded his attention but he glanced at his comrade as he went out and the sight of the gaunt figure sitting very grim and straight in a chair by the window would return long afterwards to his memory  he takes it badlyand a little while ago i should have thought he was right he said  it was several hours later when seaforth returned to the house and found mrs margery in a state of consternation  wheres harry he said  way down to the settlement said the woman  okanagan was fool enough to hoist him on a horse and though i talked halfanhour solid i couldnt stop him  seaforth smiled dryly   i scarcely think you could  harry is himself again  what has taken him to the settlement anyway  the woman glanced at him contemptuously  all men are fools said she  he went to meet that girl from the old country and find out his mistake  seaforth said nothing but went out in haste and saddled a horse for although it had been apparent to him that there was no affection wasted between alice deringham and mrs margery her words had left him with a vague uneasiness  in the meantime alton dropped very stiffly from the saddle in front of hortons hotel and limping up the stairway found the man who kept it upon the verandah  glad to see you coming round harry but youre looking very white and walking kind of stiff he said  yes said alton dryly  i shall probably walk just that way all my life  horton made no attempt to condole with him  he knew alton tolerably well and felt that any sympathy he could offer would be inadequate well he said heres a letter thomson brought you in from the railroad  alton tore open the envelope and read the message with a faint relief for it was from deringham and stated that an affair of business would prevent him returning to somasco for some little time  then he remembered that to delay a question which must be asked would but prolong the suspense  im going through to the railroad but the ride has shaken me and ill lie down and sleep a while he said  well said horton you know best but you look a long way more fit to be sitting beside the stove up there at the ranch  that was a tolerably bad accident you had  alton glanced at him sharply but his voice was indifferent as he answered  oh yes i came to grief bringing in a deer and lay out in the frost a good while before they found me  have you had many strangers round here  horton nodded  the bush is just full of themlooking for timber rights and prospecting round the crown landshallams friends i think  there was one of them seemed kind of anxious about you lately  altons eyes grew a trifle keener but he was shaken and weary and made a little gesture which seemed to indicate that he would ask questions later  youll give the horse a light feed and let me know when suppers on he said  it was dark when he mounted with hortons assistance and the horse plunged once or twice  then it started at a gallop and alton had some difficulty in pulling it up for the snow was beaten down and the trail was good  he had not been gone halfanhour when seaforth whose horse was smoking swung himself down before the hotel  wheres harry he said  on the trail said horton  i wanted to keep him but he lit out a little while ago and borrowed a rifle  what he wanted it for i dont know but he wouldnt be lonely anyway  one of the boys who was staying here pulled out for the railroad just before him  did you know the man asked seaforth with unusual sharpness  no said horton  he was timberrighting but id a kind of fancy id once seen somebody very like him working round somasco  seaforth said nothing further but swung himself into the saddle and rode off at a gallop  he had been unsettled all day and now it was with vague apprehensions he sent his heels home and shook the bridle  in the meantime alton was riding almost as fast though the saddle galled him and he was stiff and aching  his senses also grew a trifle lethargic under the frost but he knew there would be little rest for him until he reached vancouver and strove to shake off his weakness the horse was however unusually restive and would at times break into a gallop in spite of him where the trail was level but alton who fancied there was something troubling the beast was more than a little dubious of his ability to mount again if he got out of the saddle until that day he had not ventured outside the ranch  the shadowy pines flitted by him here and there the moon shone down and the drumming of hoofs rang muffled by the snow through a great silence which was curiously emphasized when twice a wolf howled still plunging and snorting now and then the beast held pluckily on while the miles melted behind them and midnight was past when alton turning halfasleep in his saddle fancied he heard somebody riding behind him  for a moment his fingers tightened on the bridle but his hearing was dulled by weakness and the numbing cold and pressing his heels home he rode on into the darkness  it would probably have occurred to him at any other time that the beast responded with suspicious readiness but his perceptions were not of the clearest just then which was unfortunate because the trail led downwards steeply through black darkness along the edge of a ravine the rain had also washed parts of it away and no ray of moonlight pierced the vaulted roof of cedarsprays  the drumming of hoofs rolled along it there was a hoarse growling far down in the darkness below and alton strove to rouse himself knowing that a stumble might result in a plunge down the declivity  he could dimly see the great trunks stream past him on the one hand but there was only a gulf of shadow on the other  suddenly a flash of light sprang up almost under the horses feet  the beast flung its head up and next moment they were flying at a gallop down the winding and almost precipitous trail  altons strength had not returned to him and he set his lips realizing the uselessness of it as he shifted his numbed hands on the bridle  twice the horse stumbled but picked up its stride again and the man had almost commenced to hope they might reach the foot of the declivity when it stumbled once more struck a young fir and reeled downwards from the trail  it all happened in a moment but there was just time enough for alton to clear his feet from his stirrups and though he was never quite sure what next he did he found himself sitting in the snow shaken and dazed by his fall while the horse rolled downwards through the shadows beneath him  he heard the brushwood crackle and then a curiously sickening thud as though something soft had fallen from a height upon a rock  after that there was an oppressive silence save for a faint drumming that grew louder down the trail  alton unslung the rifle which still hung behind him and crawled behind a big hemlock that grew out of the slope  he could hear nothing but the increasing thud of hoofs for a while and then there was a sound that suggested stealthy footsteps in the darkness up the trail  alton crouched very still and waited but the footsteps came no nearer and then pitching up the rifle fired in their direction at a venture  the sound ceased suddenly and while the great trunks flung back the concussion it was evident that the rider was coming on at a furious gallop and alton rising sent out a hoarse cry pull him before you come to the edge of the dip  the beat of hoofs sank into silence and a shout came down  hallo is that you harry  yes said alton  lead your beast down  it was five minutes later when seaforth found him leaning against a tree with the rifle in his hand  what was the shooting for and wheres your horse said he  alton appeared to laugh softly and venomously and his voice jarred upon the listener  down there and stone dead  the last drops most of a hundred feet he said  but how did he get there and seaforth felt a little chill strike through him  alton grasped his arm and his voice was harsher still  this is the second time  good lord said seaforth who understood him huskily  well said alton i think the things quite plain  if we could get down to the poor beast i figure wed find something that had no business there under the girth or saddle  the rest is simplera little coal oil or giant powder andjust at the turning yondera lariat across the trail  that man knows his business charley  good lord said seaforth once more  its devilish harry  youre not going to tell anybody and repeat the mistake you made  yes said alton grimly  thats just what i figure on doing  but and seaforths horror was evident he may try again  there are more than the somasco ranchers who would be sorry ifhe was successfulharry  alton laughed but the grating cachination sent a shiver through his companion  yes he said i think he will and thats why im waiting  he may give himself away the third time and then it will be either him or me  seaforth stood silent for almost a minute  if you would only listen to mebut of course you will not  cant you see that you are in the way of somebody who stands behind that man  yes and altons smile was now quietly grim  it dont take much genius to figure out that  before im through ill know just who he is and all about him  once more seaforth was silent a space  then he spoke very slowly are you sure youre wise  alton gripped his comrades arm so that he winced with pain  its the second time youve asked me that he said  there will not be room for you and me in this province if you ask it me again  seaforth shook his grasp off  you are my partner harry and the only friend i have  god send you safe through with it  now is there any use in looking for the fellow with the lariat  no said alton in his usual voice  there isnt  he would have been waiting up there ready to whip the thing away and by this time he has doubled back down the trail  if you met a man riding along quietly what could you do to him  its devilish said seaforth as a fit of impotent anger shook him  oh yes said alton languidly  still there isnt much use in slinging names and im kind of tired  help me up into your saddle and lead the beast by the bridle  well head for gordons  chapter xxv  alton is silent  there is a ridge of rising ground on the outskirts of vancouver city where a few years ago a pretty wooden house stood beneath the pines they rose sombrely behind it but the axe had let in the sunlight between the rise and the water and one could look out from the trim garden across the blue inlet towards the ranges snow  today one would in all probability look for that dwelling in vain and find only stores or great stone buildings for as the silent men with the axes push the lonely clearings farther back into the forest the western cities grow and those who dwell in them increase in riches which is not usually the case with the axeman who goes on farther into the bush again  still one moonlight evening when alton waited upon its verandah cigar in hand the house stood upon the hillside picturesque with its painted scrollwork green shutters colonnades of cedar pillars and broad verandahs  its owner was an englishman who had prospered in the dominion and combined the kindliness he still retained for his countrymen with the lavish hospitality of the west  he knew alton by reputation and having business with him had made him free of his house when he inquired for deringham who was his guest during the formers absence in the state of washington  that was how alton came to be waiting for dinner in company with a young naval officer  deringham and his daughter had returned during the day but they had driven somewhere with their hostess and not come back as yet  alton had seen commander thorne for the first time that day but some friendships are made rapidly and without an effort and he was already sensible of a regard for his companion  he was a quiet and unobtrusive englishman with the steadiness of gaze and decisiveness of speech which characterized those who command at sea and had discovered that he had notwithstanding the difference in their vocations much in common with rancher alton  yes he said  it is very good of you and if we stay at esquimault i will come up and spend a day or two among the deer  atkinson told us what a good time he had with you but we were a trifle astonished to see the fine wapiti head he brought back with him  there was a faint twinkle in the speakers eyes which alton understood for atkinson who was not an adept at trailing deer had shot more than a wapiti  still he was not the man to allude to the misadventures of his guest  he killed it neatlya good hundred yards and in the fern he said  well said thorne with a little laugh you were with him and know best  you had however a tolerably mixed bag on that occasion  alton checked a smile  a wapiti a wood deerand sundries  thorne laughed again  i wonder if you have forgotten the hog  you see atkinson told us one night at mess and i was inclined to fancy he came near including you in the bag  altons face was suspiciously grave but his answer strengthened the incipient friendship between the men  it is a little difficult for a stranger to distinguish things in the bush  thorne nodded  you had deringham and miss deringham staying with you  yes said alton  they are connections of mine and miss deringham did a good deal for me when i was sick a little while ago  you knew them in the old country  there was though he strove to suppress it something in his voice which caused the naval officer to glance at him sharply  oh yes he said  i knew themrather well  the mens eyes met and both were conscious that the words might have been amplified while it was with a slight abruptness they returned to the previous topic and discussed it until there was a rattle of wheels in the drive  then forel their host came out upon the verandah and there was a hum of voices as several people descended from the vehicle beneath  mrs forel came up the stairway first with alice deringham and when a blaze of light shone into the verandah from the open door alton saw the girl draw back for a second as her eyes rested upon his companion she however smiled next moment and alton did not miss the slight flush of pleasure in the face of commander thorne  he was also to meet with another astonishment for deringham and seaforth came up the stairway next together and thorne dropped his cigar when he and the latter stood face to face  charley  is it you he said  seaforth stood quite still a moment looking at him and then being possibly sensible that other eyes were upon him shook hands  yes he said  i heard the gunboat was at esquimault but did not expect to see you  then there was a somewhat awkward silence and alton fancied that both men were relieved when mrs forels voice broke in jack you will look after the men but dont keep them talking too long  we picked up mr seaforth and there are one or two more of our friends coming  alton followed his host wondering at what he had seen  it was evident that miss deringham had not noticed him and he fancied she had been for a moment almost embarrassed by the encounter with thorne  that and what the man had told him had its meaning  he had also noticed that when the latter greeted his comrade there had been a constraint upon both of them but decided that what it betokened did not concern him  returning he found mrs forel waiting for him and having been born in a western city her conversation was not marked by english reticence or the restraint which is at least as common in the canadian bush  dinner is ready and you will have to talk to me and the railroad man during it she said  i had thought of making you over to miss deringham until commander thorne turned up  jack and he are great friends but he didnt seem able to get over here until he heard miss deringham was staying with us  alton laughed a little  now what am i to answer to that  miss deringham was very good to me  the lady fancied that his merriment was a trifle forced  you will just sit down and eat your dinner like a sensible man she said you are a canadian and not expected to say nice things like those others from the old country  they dont always do it very well and though jack is fond of them they make me tired now and then  alton took his place beside her and speedily found himself at home save for the naval officer and two english financiers the men present had a stake in the future of that country and as usual neither they nor their womenkind considered it out of place to talk of their affairs  they were also men of mark though several of them who now held large issues in very capable hands had commenced life as wielders of the axe  most of them had heard of alton of the somasco consolidated and those who had not listened with attention when he spoke for it was evident that they and the rancher had the same cause at heart  alice deringham noticed this and though he was not conscious of it little alton did that night escaped her attention  she saw that while he rarely asserted himself these men whom she knew were regarded with respect as leaders of great industries accepted him as an equal when they had heard him speak but that caused her less surprise than the fashion in which he adapted himself to his surroundings  she had already discovered that he was a man with abilities and ambitions but she had only seen him amidst the grim simplicity of the somasco ranch and now there was no trifling lapse or momentary embarrassments to show that he found the changed conditions incongruous  his dress was also different but he wore his city garments as though he had worn nothing else and there was she fancied an indefinite stamp of something which almost amounted to distinction upon him that set him apart from the rest  even seaforth wondered a little at his comrade but both he and alice deringham overlooked the fact that alton had not spent his whole life at somasco ranch  he on his part as the girl was quite aware glanced often at her she did not however meet his gaze for once alton was on the way to recovery she had left the ranch somewhat hastily and there had been as yet no defining of the relations between them while neither she nor her father were cognizant of the actual cause of his wound  in the meanwhile she made the most of thorne and by degrees alton lost his grip of the conversation  he had never seen alice deringham attired as she was then and for his hostess had made the bravest display possible the profusion of flowers glass and glittering silver which it seemed appropriate that she should be placed amidst in a curious fashion troubled the man  this he knew was a part of the environment she had been used to and he sighed as he thought of the sordid simplicity at somasco  there was also commander thorne beside her and the naval officer was one upon whom the stamp of birth and polish was very visible  this man he surmised would understand the thoughts and fancies which were incomprehensible to him and was acquainted with all the petty trifles which are of vast importance to a woman in the aggregate  altons heart grew heavy as he watched them noticing the passing smile of comprehension that came so easily and expressed so much and heard through the hum of voices the soft english accentuation which by contrast with his own speech seemed musical  he knew his value in the busy world but he also knew his failings and the knowledge was bitter to him then  there were so many little things he did not know and he saw himself as he thought the girl must see himuncouth which it was impossible for him to be crude of thought overvehement or taciturn in speech a barbarian  the misgivings had troubled him before but they were very forceful now and at last he was glad when mrs forel smiled at him  you have been watching miss deringham and neglecting me she said  for a moment alton looked almost confused and the lady laughed as she continued  very pretty and stylish isnt she  now we have pretty girls right here in vancouver but i fancy they can still give us points in one respect in the old country  you think that is foolish of me  well i wouldnt worry to tell me so i think commander thorne could do it more neatly  he is apparently too busy said alton  still i fancy if you asked him he would support me  mrs forel smiled mischievously well though one could scarcely blame you jealousy wouldnt do you any good  those two were great friends in the old country  that said alton is a little indefinite  of course but i dont know anything more said his companion lieutenant atkinson who knew them both told me  thorne wasnt rich you see but he comes of good people and not long ago somebody left him all their money  quite romantic isnt it  still dont you think miss deringham would be thrown away upon anybody less than a baronet  alton did not answer but his face grew somewhat grim as once more he glanced across at thorne  this he thought was a good man and he had all that alton felt himself so horribly deficient in  in the meanwhile mrs forel was looking at seaforth who was talking to the wife of an english financier  i like your partner and he is from the old country too she said of course you know what he was over there  it was put artlessly but altons eyes twinkled  im afraid i dont though ive no doubt charley would have told me if id asked him he said  he is a tolerably useful man in this country anyway and that kind of contented me  the lady shook her head at him reproachfully  and i thought you were slow in the bush said she  still thorne will know  alton fancied his hostess intended to be kind to him but he was glad when the dinner was over and he gravitated with the other men towards forels smokingroom  there as it happened the talk turned upon shooting and fishing and when one or two of the guests had narrated their adventures in the ranges one who was bent and grizzled told in turn several grim stories of the early days when the treasureseekers went up into the snows of caribou  there was a brief silence when he had finished until one of the englishmen said  i presume things of that kind seldom happen now  i dont know said seaforth who spoke in the western idiom  we have still a few of the good oldfashioned villains right here in this country and that reminds me of a thing which happened to a man i know he was a quiet man and quite harmless so long as nobody worried him but generally held on with a tight grip to his own and he once got his hands into something another man wanted  that was how the fuss began  there was a little pause during which alton glanced bewilderedly at his comrade and deringham glanced round as he poured himself out a whisky and seltzer  its not an uncommon beginning said forel  what was the end  there isnt any said seaforth but i can tell you the middle  one day the quiet man who was living by himself way up in the bush went out hunting and as he had eaten very little for a week he was tolerably hungry  well when he had been out all day be got a deer and was packing it home at night when he struck a belt of thick timber the man was played out from want of food the deer was heavy but he dragged himself along thinking of his supper until something twinkled beneath a fir  he jumped when he saw it but he wasnt quick enough and went down with a bullet in him  his rifle fell away from him where he couldnt get it without the other man seeing him and he was bleeding fast but still sensible enough to know that nobody would start out on a contract of that kind without his magazine full  it was a tolerably tight place for himthe man was worn out and almost famishing and he lay there in the snow getting fainter every minute with one leg no use to him  seaforth looked round as though to see what impression he had made and though all the faces were turned towards him it was one among them his eyes rested on  deringham was leaning forward in his chair with fingers closed more tightly about the glass he held than there seemed any necessity for  his eyes were slightly dilated and seaforth fancied he read in them a growing horror  he crawled away into the bush said somebody  no sir said seaforth he just wriggled into the undergrowth and waited for the other man  waited for him said forel  yes said seaforth  that is what he did and when the other man came along peering into the bushes just reached out and grabbed him by the leg  then they both rolled over and i think that must have been a tolerably grim struggle  there they were alone far up in the bush and probably not a living soul within forty miles of them  seaforth stopped again and reached out for his glass while he noticed that deringham emptied his at a gulp and refilled it with fingers that seemed to shake a trifle  and your friend got away said somebody  no sir said seaforth  it was the other man  the one i knew had his hand on the others throat and his knife feeling for a soft place when his adversary broke away from him  he did it just a moment too soon for while he was getting out through the bush the other one dropped his knife and rolled over in the snow  he lay there a day or two until somebody found him  seaforth rose and moved towards the cigarbox on the table  and thats all he said  dramatic but its a little incomplete isnt it said the englishman  seaforth smiled somewhat dryly and once more glanced casually towards deringham  it may be finished by and by and i fancy the windup will be more dramatic still he said  you see the man who would wait for his enemy with only a knife in his hand while his life drained away from him is scarcely likely to forget an injury  there was silence for several moments which was broken by a rattle and a stream of whisky and seltzer dripped from the table  hallo said forel  has anything upset you deringham  deringham stood up with a little harsh laugh dabbing it the breast of his shirt with his handkerchief  i think the question should apply to my glass but the room is a trifle hot and my heart has been troubling me lately he said  forel flung one of the windows open  i fancy my wife is waiting for us gentlemen and i will be with you in a few minutes he said  alton and seaforth were almost the last to file out of the smokingroom and when they reached the corridor the former turned upon his comrade with a glint in his halfclosed eyes  you show a curious taste for a man raised as you have been in the old country he said  now what in the name of thunder made you tell that story  seaforth smiled somewhat inanely  i dont know i just felt i had to all of us are subject to little weaknesses occasionally  alton stopped and looked at him steadily  then there will be trouble if you give way to them again  and you put in a good deal more than i ever told anybody  now you havent brains enough to figure out all that  seaforth laughed goodhumouredly  it is possibly fortunate that tom has he said  tombe condemned said alton viciously and seaforth seeing that he was about to revert to the previous question apparently answered a summons from his host and slipped back into the smokingroom  alton waited a moment and then moved somewhat stiffly towards a low stairway which led to a broad landing that was draped and furnished as an annex to an upper room  one or two of the company were seated there and he hoped they would not notice him for while he could walk tolerably well upon the level a stairway presented a difficulty  he had all his life been a vigorous man and because of it was painfully sensitive about his affliction  just then mrs forel came out upon the landing and when the girl she spoke to turned  alton saw that alice deringham was looking down on him  for a moment there was a brightness in his eyes but it faded suddenly and while his knee bent under him he set his lips as with pain  then he stumbled and clung to the balustrade  for a moment he dare not look up and when he did so there was a flush on his forehead which slowly died away as he saw the face of the girl  she had also laid her hand as if for support upon the balustrade for it was unfortunate she had not been told that one effect of altons injury would be permanent  at the commencement of their friendship she had been painfully aware of what she considered his shortcomings but these had gradually become less evident and something in the mans forceful personality had carried her away  possibly though she may not have realized it his splendid animal vigour had its part in thisand now dismay and a great pity struggled within her  it was especially unfortunate that when alton looked up the consternation had risen uppermost for the mans perceptions were not of the clearest then and he saw nothing of the compassion but only the shrinking in her eyes  his face grew a trifle grey as he straightened himself with a visible effort and limped forward for he was one who could make a quick decision while to complete his bitterness thorne came up behind him and slipped an arm beneath his shoulder  you seem a little shaky ill help you up he said  an axecut the effect will probably soon wear off  alton understood that thorne was talking to cover any embarrassment he may have felt but was not especially grateful just then  no he said a rifleshot  he fancied that thorne was a trifle astonished and remembered seaforths story but they had gained the head of the stairway now and he looked at alice deringham as he added and the effect will not wear off  thorne passed through with the others into the lighted room and alton stood silent before the girl  she was a trifle pale and though the pity for him was there it is possible that she had understood him and she was very proud  thus the silence that was perilous lasted too long and her voice was a trifle strained in place of gentle as she said i am so sorry  alton who dared not look at her now bent his head  you are very kindstill it cant be helped he said  i think mrs forel is coming back for you  somebody is going to sing  their hostess approached the doorway and alice deringham found words fail her as she watched the man though she knew that the silence was horribly eloquent  it was alton who broke it  you had better go in  iand he smiled bitterlywill wait until the music commences and they cannot notice me  the girl could stay no longer though at last words which would have made a difference to both of them rose to her lips but alton waited until he could slip into the room unnoticed and heard very little of the music  during it mrs forel managed to secure a few words with thorne  you seem to have made friends with rancher alton she said  thorne smiled a little  yes he said  of course i know little about him but i think that is a man one could trust  the lady nodded for he had given her an opportunity  you know more about his partner  thornes manner appeared to change a trifle which mrs forel of course noticed  yes he said  the lady thoughtfully smoothed out a fold of her dress  well she said with western frankness i want to know a little about him too  thorne smiled as he saw there was no evading the issue  so i surmised from what your husband asked me  seaforth was considered a young man of promise when i knew him in england and his family is unexceptional his father however lost a good deal of money which presumably accounts for charley having turned canadian rancher  mrs forel turned so that she could see her companion  that is not what i mean and i think i had better talk quite straight to you  now i like mr seaforth and mr alton too and as jack is mixed up in some business of theirs and they are going to stay down in vancouver we shall probably see a good deal of them  jack however is sometimes a little hasty in making friends and i want to know the other reason that brought mr seaforth out from the old country  you fancy there is one thorne said quietly  yes  lieutenant atkinson made a little blunder one night when he spoke of him  atkinson never had very much sense thorne said dryly  i however fancied a man took his standing among you according to what he did in this country  yes said mrs forel  the trouble is that the man who has crossed the line once may do so again  well you see who these people are and if he meets them here it means that i vouch for him  thorne sighed  if atkinson has blundered i am afraid that i must speak  now i dont think you need be afraid of seaforth crossing that line again  he was not worse than foolish and somebody victimized him but he has had his punishment and borne it very wellwhile if you knew the whole story you would scarcely blame him  and that is all you can tell me  yes said thorne very quietly  still i can add that if charley ever comes back to the old country iand my mother and sisterswould be glad to welcome him  that i think should be sufficient said mrs forel who was acquainted with commander thornes status in the old country  it was a little later when alton glanced towards thorne who was talking to alice deringham  i could get on with that man he said you knew him charley  oh yes said seaforth with a curious expression  he is a very good fellow and has distinguished himself several times  somebody left him a good deal of money lately  alton seemed to sigh  well he said slowly he is to be envied they wouldnt have much use for him in your navy if he was a cripple  the party was breaking up before alton had speech with alice deringham again and as it happened the girl had just left commander thorne alton spoke with an effort as one going through a task  i never thanked you yet for what you did for me he said  the girl smiled though her pulses were throbbing painfully  it was very little  no said alton gravely  i think i should not have been here now if you had not taken care of me and im very grateful  stilland he glanced down with a wry smile at his knee which was bent a trifleit was unfortunate you and the doctor did not get me earlier  there are disadvantages in beingall ones lifea cripple  as fate would have it they were interrupted before miss deringham could answer and alton limped down the stairway very grim in face while thorne appeared sympathetic when he overtook him  that wound of yours is troubling you he said  yes said alton dryly im afraid it will  now i was a trifle confused when you helped me  did i tell you how i got it  thorne remembering seaforths story answered indifferently i concluded it was an axecut  he passed on but alton had quick perceptions and made a little gesture of contentment  he is almost good enough anyway he said wearily  when all the guests had gone deringham came upon his daughter alone i noticed mr alton was not effusive he said  no said the girl languidly though there was a curious expression in her eyes  i do not remember that he told much beyond the fact that he would be a crippleall his life  he mentioned it twice     chapter xxvi  without counting the cost  there had been a revival of speculation in industrial enterprise and it was unusually late at night when miss townshead rose wearily from the table she had been busy at  her eyes ached her fingers and arms were cramped but that did not distress her greatly for townshead needed many comforts and she was earning what would have been considered in england a liberal salary  it was very quiet in the room at the top of the towering building where however another young woman who as it happened was jealous of her companions progress still sat writing and a light blinked in the adjoining one across the passage in which one of the heads of the firm would probably remain most of the night  trade is spasmodic in the west and those who live by it work with feverish activity when the tide is with them  youre through said miss holder  well if you can wait ten minutes ill come along with you  nellie townshead was not especially fond of her companion but at that hour the streets were lonely and she sat down again when she had put on her hat and jacket  while she waited a little bell began to ring and miss holder rose with an impatient exclamation  get your pencil nellie she said as she took the telephonic receiver down from the hook  miss townshead took a sheet of paper from a case and waited until her companion spoke again  oh yes im here  a little late to worry tired folks isnt it  no  mr hallams away just now  wire from somasco just come inand were to let him have it as soon as we can oh yes i understand you  platinum galena cyanide alton oxide in a vise  youve got that nellie  do i know when hallam will get it  no i dont  goodnight  now a man would probably have at once enclosed the message in an envelope but a western business lady not infrequently takes a kindly interest in the private concerns of her employer especially if they are not quite clear to her  accordingly miss holder sat down and read over the message after which she shook her head  i wonder what its all about and i dont like that hallam she said hes an insect  a crawling one with slimy feet and to pin a big diamond in front of one as he does is horrible taste  give me the book nellie  it reads like our cypher  oh yes  instructions to hand  no legal improvements done and claim unrecorded  will relocate now weve nothing that silver stands for and it reads quite straight  will relocate the silver claim as soon as prospecting is possible  alton cannot take action  he means hes got him in a vise  miss holder crossed the landing and tapped at the door of the adjoining room while nellie townshead walked to the window and looked down on the city  it stretched away before her silent for once under its blinking lights sidewalk and pavement lying empty far down beneath the mazy wires and towering buildings but she saw little of it as she glanced towards the block where the somasco consolidated had their offices  the message had troubled her for she recalled many kindnesses shown to her and her father by the owners of somasco ranch she also owed one of them a reparation for she had seen the man who miscarried the message in vancouver and knew that the delay when the ranch was sold was not altons fault  nor had she forgiven hallam for the greed and cunning which had effected her fathers ruin and now it seemed that he held alton of somasco and his partner in his grip  that there was treachery at work she felt sure and grew hot with indignation as she determined that if she could prevent it neither altonnor his partnershould suffer  it might have occurred to a man that what she contemplated implied a breach of confidence but nellie townshead was a highspirited girl and only realized that hallam was about to wrong her friends just then  there would also be no difficulty in warning him for alton had taken over the office of the somasco consolidated on his arrival at vancouver and while she considered the question a voice came out of the adjoining room  hallams at westminster and it will have to wait until he comes round in the morning  dont stay any longer and take miss townshead with you  its later than i fancied  five minutes afterwards the two girls went out into the silent streets and miss townshead who left her companion at the corner of one of them turned round again and walked back somewhat slowly part of the way she had come  she did not notice that miss holder had also turned and was watching her for she realized for the first time that what she was about to do admitted of misconception  still remembering how hallam had tricked her father she went on and only stopped for a moment when she entered the great building in the upper part of which was the office of the somasco consolidated  it was very silent  the rooms which had hummed with voices all day long were shut and one blinking light emphasized the darkness of the big empty corridor scarcely a sound reached her from the city but she had seen that two windows high up were lighted and went up the stairway resolutely  the warning could be delivered in less than a minute and she fancied that alton would not be alone while she knew that the conventionalities as understood in england are almost unknown in the west  as it happened alton who though miss townshead did not know this lived in the room adjoining his office was busy about the stove just then  in those days when vancouver had more inhabitants than it could well find room for and its hotels overflowed single men taking their meals in the public restaurants lived as best they could over their stores and offices or in rude cabins and shanties flung up anywhere on the outskirts of the city while it is not improbable that a good many of them live in much the same fashion now  alton had however missed the six oclock supper for reasons which the sheaf of papers on his desk made plain and was then engaged in cooking something in a fryingpan  a portable cedar partition partly shrouded the little table set out with a few plates and the stove while his old workeddeerhide slippers and loose jacket indicated that the man was just then not so much in his place of business as at home  he had been busy in the city and at his desk for ten hours that day for the somasco products were becoming known and men had been toiling in the valley driving roads and building a new sawmill in the frost and snow  part of altons business in the city was to raise the money that was needed to maintain them and already he could foresee that if the time of prosperity was delayed it might go hardly with the somasco company  he had laid down the fryingpan and was shaking a pot of strong green tea when there was a tapping at the door which opened while he wondered whether there would be time for him to alter his attire  then he stood up with the teapot in his hand and made a little whimsical gesture of dismay as miss townshead stood before him  she coloured a trifle but took courage at altons soft laugh for it was clear that he was as yet only concerned about the plight in which she had found him  alton she remembered had not been brought up conventionally in england and she knew his wholesome simplicity  im very glad to see you but if id known who was there id have fixed the place up before you got in he said  sit right down beside the stove  nellie townshead stood still a moment but she was tired and the night was cold so she took the chair he drew forward and then shook her head as he laid a cup before her  its hortons tea and bad at that but it will help us to fancy ourselves back in the bush he said  your father is keeping all right  the girl made a little gesture of impatience  yes she said  i am almost afraid i am doing wrong but i felt i must warn you  now dont ask me any questions but take it as a fact that hallam has sent up somebody to locate your silver as soon as it can be done  he seems to consider he has you at a disadvantage because you have not put in your legal improvements  alton thrust his chair back and clenched one hand while the girl noticed with relief that he had almost forgotten her  hallam he said and stopped a moment while his voice was harsh as he continued going to restake my claim  well there is time still in hand and he cant do it yet  now  the girl stopped him with a gesture  you must ask me nothing she said  you can understand what i told you  a slow glow crept into altons eyes  oh yes its all quite plain he said  when you find a mineral claim you have got to record it in fifteen days or it goes back to the crown and i couldnt do that you see because i was lying for weeks at somasco  well while the claim is unrecorded anybody can jump it but i couldnt get back up there through the snow and didnt figure hallams man knew just where to find it  now youve told me well get in ahead of him yet and the man he sends up there will have his journey for nothing  do you know that what you have done means just everything to somasco  alton stopped suddenly and there was consternation in the girls face as she glanced at him  i think theres somebody coming he said slowly  now there was still just time for alton to have shut the outer door but he remembered for the first time that the girls visit at that hour might be considered unusual and it appeared probable that she would not approve of the action while having as yet only dealt with men his usual quick decision deserted him  he glanced once from his companion to the partition and the door of the inner room and shook his head then he sprang forward towards the outer door forgetting that he was lame  that however did not alter the fact and as he stumbled a little the tray on the table he struck went down with a crash scattering its contents about the room while before he reached the door it swung open and a man stood smiling in the opening  hello  i seem to have scared you he said  got anything you dont want folks to know about in here  the stranger moved forward another step and then stopped abruptly with a little gasp as his glance took in the overturned tray scattered crockery and the rigid figure of the girl standing with a flushed face beside the stove  then he glanced at alton and noticing the old jacket and deerhide slippers appeared to have some difficulty in checking a smile for this was a young man who knew nothing of the simple strenuous life of the bush but a good deal about the underside of that of the cities  ill come back in business hours tomorrow he said  sorry to disturb you but i hadnt a minute all day and there was a question i figured we could best talk over quietly  then you had better start in with it said alton quietly  this lady who came here on business is just going  of course said the stranger  i think i have had the pleasure of meeting her  he turned with a little smile which broadened into a grin alton found intolerable for there was a patter of feet on the stairway and when he looked round except for himself and alton the room was empty  the fact is im awfully sorry he said  but how was i to know  the veins were swollen on altons forehead and his eyes halfclosed now he said sternly i dont want to hear any more of that  i think i told you the lady you saw here came in a few minutes ago on an affair of business  it was unfortunate that alton had a difficult temper and his visitor no discretion for there are men in whom western directness degenerates into effrontery  of course said the latter  my dear fellow you neednt protest considering the connection between her employers and hallam who is scarcely a friend of yours that is especially likely  alton stood very straight looking at the speaker in a fashion which would have warned any one who knew him  i figure you cant help being a fool but i want to hear you admit that youre sorry for it he said  he spoke very quietly but it was unfortunate for both of them that the other man who was growing slightly nettled did not know when to stop  i told you i was sorryi looked in at an inopportune timealready and ill forget it right off he said  now that should content anybody because there are folks who would think the story too good to be lost  he got no further because alton stepped forward and seized him by the collar which tore away in his grasp  then there was a brief scuffle a scattering of papers up and down the room and alton stood gasping in the doorway while his visitor reeled down the first flight of stairs and into the wall at the foot of it  alton glanced down at him a moment and seeing he was not seriously hurt flung the door to with a bang that rolled from corridor to corridor through the great silent building before he turned back into the disordered room with a little laugh  ive fixed that fellow anyway and now id better go through those plans until i simmer down he said  he picked up the overturned table and his scattered supper while it was characteristic of him that when an hour later he rolled up a sheet of milldrawings in a survey plotting of the somasco valley he had forgotten all about the incident which was however not the case with the other man  in another twenty minutes he was also fast asleep and because men commence their work betimes in that country had disposed of several carloads of somasco produce before he breakfasted next morning  during the day he noticed that some of the younger men he met smiled at him curiously but attached no especial meaning to it  alton had taught himself to concentrate all his faculties upon his task and he worked in the city as he had done in the bush with the singleness of purpose and activity that left no opportunity of considering side issues  he had also as usual a good deal to do buyers of dressed lumber cattle and ranching produce to interview shippers of horses to bargain with railroad men and politicians to obtain promises of concessions from and men who had money to lend to interest  the latter was the most difficult task and now and then his face grew momentarily grave as he remembered the burdens he had already laid upon his ranch and the somasco consolidated  still what were working for is bound to come and well hold on somehow until it does he said to forel who occasionally remonstrated with him  when youve helped me to put the new loan through ill bring charley or the other man down and go up and relocate the claim after the late snowfall nobody could get through the ranges now but tom and i could make our way when it wouldnt be possible to any of hallams men  possibly because he had been successful hitherto alton was slightly oversanguine and apt to make too small allowance in his calculations for contingencies in which human foresight and tenacity of purpose may not avail  it happened in the meanwhile though he was of course not aware of this that deringham had an interview with hallam in the smokingroom of the big cpr hotel  they did not enter it together for deringham was sitting there when hallam came in about the time the atlantic express was starting which accounted for the fact that there was nobody else present  deringham appeared a trifle too much at his ease though his face was pale for he had not departed from veracity when he informed forel that his heart had troubled him after listening to seaforths story  he nodded to hallam and picked out a fresh cigar from the box upon the table before he spoke  it is fine weather he said  oh yes said hallam dryly  still i guess you didnt ask me to come here and talk about the climate  no and deringham glanced at his cigar  i meant to tell you that the little speculation you recently mentioned does not commend itself to me  in fact i have decided that we can have no more dealings of any description together  no said hallam with a little brutal laugh  dollars running out  deringham glanced at him languidly  as you know that is not the reason  now i do not ask for a return of the money you obtained from mebut i want the thing stopped immediately  hallam poured out a glass of wine  you will have to put it straight  well said deringham if you insist  i am sincerely sorry i ever saw or heard of you  you of course remember the conditions on which i made that deal with you  i desired mr alton kept away from somascofor a time and now i want a definite promise from you that he will be free from any further molestation  then said hallam with a grin whats your programme if i dont agree  you would put the police on to me  no said deringham making the best play he could though he realized the weakness of his hand  that would not appear advisableor necessary  it would be simpler to warn my kinsman  hallam laid his hand upon the table and deringham noticed that it was coarse and illshaped but suggested a brutal tenacity of grasp  bluff with nothing behind it  you dont take me that way he said now ill put my cards right down in front of you  alton is not a fool and you couldnt tell him anything he doesnt know already  the trouble is he can prove nothing  he has a tolerably short temper and one day he most hammered the life out of another man in the somasco mill  that man didnt like him before and its quite possible he fell foul of alton after it but where does that take in me  got hold of that havent you  well then theres just this difference between you and me  i could tell alton one or two things about you he didnt know  i would be willing to take my chance of his believing you said deringham  hallam laughed  for a man of business you have a plaguy bad memory now it seems to me quite likely that the man i talked about has had quite enough of fooling with alton and well let what you asked for go at that because theres something else were coming to  there was a cheque you gave me and i had who it was drawn by and payable to put down on the slip when i passed it through my bank  now ive got that slip and after id had a talk with him alton wouldnt wonder what you gave me all those dollars for  deringham was silent almost a minute for he knew his opponent had seen the weak point  then he said if i admitted that you were right  hallam raised his big hand and pressed his thumb down slowly and viciously on the table  it dont need admitting  ive got you there he said  still i dont know that i want to squeeze you well i once kept alton out of somasco to please you and now i want you to keep him right here in vancouver for a while  i could not do it  well said hallam grinning if you couldnt i figure your daughter could  deringham had all along been struggling with a sense of disgust and now his anger mastered him  it was however the rage of a weak man which is not far removed from fear  you infernal scoundrel he said  hallam laughed brutally  that may do you good and it makes no difference to me he said  i want alton to stop here just three weeks from today  hell stay without pressing for two of them i thinkand youve got to keep him during the third one  theres nothing going to hurt him but it wouldnt be wise to fool things you understand  he took up his hat as he spoke and moved towards the door while deringhams eyes blazed when it closed behind him  damn him he said almost choked with impotent fury and then sat down limply with a face that grew suddenly blanched  his hand shook as he seized his glass and some of the wine he needed was spilled upon the table for his eyes grew dim as the faintness came upon him deringham had been recommended a rest from all excitement and business anxieties before he sailed from england and passion was distinctly injudicious considering the condition of one of his organs     chapter xxvii  the force of calumny  as hallam had surmised one or two affairs of importance detained alton in vancouver  the winter had been exceptionally rigorous and he knew that the claim was guarded securely by frost and snow  having also he fancied effectually silenced his indiscreet visitor by flinging him downstairs he thought no more about that affair and spent one or two evenings pleasantly at forels house where alice deringham greeted him with slightly reserved cordiality  she fancied she understood his reticence on the memorable evening when he had stumbled on the stairway and was not altogether displeased by it  he had it seemed been oversensitive for he was but slightly lame while she had reasons for surmising that he would realize there was no great necessity for the selfsacrifice in time  alice deringham was not unduly vain but she knew her power and alton had in his silence betrayed himself again and again  still it seemed only fitting that he should make the first advances now the moment when she might have done so had passed  she also fancied she understood the motive which prompted his answer when her father spoke to him respecting carnaby  i cant go over now he said  your lawyers and agents can look after the place a little longer and i neednt worry if youre content with them  anyway all of it does not belong to me and we will see what we can fix up between us when i go over by and by  this was pleasant hearing to deringham who commenced to hope that he would be able to give a satisfactory account of his stewardship when the time came and winced at the recollection of the folly which had placed him in hallams grasp  of late his health had given way again and that served as an excuse for remaining at vancouver which he had scarcely the courage to leave  affairs were in this condition when miss deringham sat listening to the conversation of other visitors in the house of a friend of mrs forels one afternoon  now and then a veiled allusion reached her and at last she glanced inquiringly at her hostess  the lady smiled deprecatingly and shook her head  it is really indiscreet of helen but she seems to believe it is true she said these things do happen even in the old country  alice deringham laughed  i am afraid i cannot controvert you if that is uncomplimentary because i dont know what you are alluding to  her hostess looked thoughtful  then you havent heard it yet she said  well i am not the one to tell you and it is quite possible they havent got the story correctly  miss deringham was interested but she asked no more questions and had changed her place when she once more heard a subdued voice she recognized behind a great lacquered screen  one would be sorry for hettie forel but her husband was always a little unguarded  opened his house to everybody you know  it was the big bushman i saw there said another person and alice deringham felt a curious little quiver in her fingers as she waited the answer  yes  hettie will feel it  she made such a fuss of him but it maynt have been his fault altogether  he is quite a goodlooking man if he is a trifle lame and the girl may have thrown herself at him  they sometimes do  alice deringham set her lips and turned her head away from her companion as one of the voices continued  hettie has not heard it yet and tom did not seem sure about it when he told me  in fact forel brought the man over to see us the night before but it is quite evident now the girl had been living there  yes tom heard he had rooms behind his office  miss deringham had recovered her outward serenity and the flush had faded from her face leaving it very colourless as she turned to her companion  you heard that woman she said  the lady beside her nodded though there was a little pink tinge in her cheeks  i am sorry that you did my dear  alice deringham stood up and looked down at her with a sparkle in her eyes  i know she said that it cannot be true  we must hope so said her companion who appeared distinctly uncomfortable  still the story is being told all over the city and several of the houses forel took the man to are closed against him already  alice deringham seemed to shiver a little  butit is impossible  her companion shook her bead  my husband is a member of the company which employed miss townshead and as the mans business affairs were antagonistic to theirs she was dismissed immediately  alice deringham found it very difficult to conceal the effect of this last blow and was turning away when two women rose from a divan behind the screen  the tea is cold  shall i ask for some more for you said one of them  pleased to see you again miss deringham  she got no further for the girl who looked her full in the face passed on and the other woman flushed a trifle  im afraid she must have heard you said somebody  miss deringham is i believe a connection of altons and hettie forel hinted there was something more than that between them  it would be an especially suitable match because of some property in the old country  the lady she spoke to smiled somewhat sourly  then one would be a trifle sorry for the rancher she said  it cost miss deringham a good deal to talk to her hostess until she could depart without attracting attention and she walked back to forels house with a blaze in her eyes  as yet she could not think connectedly for the astonishment had left no room for more than vague sensations of disgust and anger and a horrible rankling of wounded pride  mrs forel as it happened was busy and the girl slipped away to a room that was seldom occupied and sat there in the gathering darkness staring at the fire  the story was she strove to persuade herself utterly impossible for she had probed the mans character thoroughly and seen that it was wholesome through all its cruditiesand yet it was evident the horrible tale must have some foundation because otherwise refutation would be so simple  almost incredible as it was the belief that it was borne out by fact was forced upon her and too dazed to reason clearly she shrank with an overwhelming sense of disgust  she had it seemed wilfully deceived herself and the man was as she had fancied at the beginning without sensibility or refinement brutal in his forcefulness and swayed by elementary passions  then she writhed under the memory of the occasions on which she had unbent somewhat far to him and the recollection of two incidents in the sickroom stung her pride to the quick while when the booming of a gong rolled through the house she rose faint and cold with an intensity of anger that for the time being drove out any other feeling  it would have gone very hardly with alton had chance afforded her the means of punishing him just then  as fate would have it the opportunity was also given her for that evening deringham who had heard nothing of the story was able to secure a few minutes alone with his daughter  he was she noticed looking unusually pale and ill and that reminded her that he owed all his anxieties to alton  our kinsman is going back to somasco very shortly and then on into the ranges  i wish he could be prevented he said  the girl laughed a little  i think it would be difficult to prevent mr alton doing anything he had decided on  yes said deringham  he can be exasperatingly obstinate butand i put it franklyhe might listen to you  the journey he contemplates would be apt to prove perilous at this season  alice deringham looked at her father with a smile the meaning of which he could not fathom  he did not know that she had of late been disturbed by unpleasant suspicions concerning his connection with hallam  i fancy you are mistaken  you are of course influenced by a desire for his safety  deringham winced for he recognized the tone of sardonic scepticism but he was horribly afraid of hallam and could not afford to fail  well he said with a gesture of weariness i am afraid i must make an admission i am hemmed in by almost overwhelming anxieties and i have come to no understanding yet with alton respecting carnaby  now if disaster overtook him in the ranges it would entail an investigation of the carnaby affairs and the withdrawal of a good deal of money from my companies which would seriously hamper me  i have once or twice had to slightly exceed my duties as trustee and alton would approve of steps i have taken which a lawyer or accountant would consider irregular  of course if you had any knowledge of business i could make it more clear to you but i can only tell you that i am anxious about altons safety for my own sake as well as his  alice deringham turned towards him with a trace of impatience  we may as well be honest and i fancy mr alton is used to risks she said quietly  whether he encounters more than usual just now or otherwise is absolutely no concern of mine  deringham saw the change in her and wondered but resolved to profit by it  i want him kept here a little longer  it is important to me he said  the girl saw the hand of hallam in this and surmised that it would not be to altons advantage if he postponed his journey but she was vindictively bitter against him then and glanced at her father inquiringly  it was evident that he was anxious and ill and she was sensible of a pity that had yet a trace of contempt in it for him  still i do not see how i could induce him to remain she said  well said deringham slowly there is a way  forel will be here in a minutebut if you would listen to me  deringham seemed to find a difficulty in commencing and there was a curious expression in his restless eyes while once or twice he stopped and proceeded somewhat inconsequently  he had made tools of a good many men and befooled the public without any especial scruples but there was a shred of pride left him and this was the first time he had stooped to drag his daughter into his schemes  his story lacked plausibility and the girl was not deceived but he was her father and it was his cause she was asked to further against the man who had humiliated her and dispossessed him  she glanced away from him when he had finished but her voice was quietly even  i think i shall be sorry for it ever afterwards but i will do what you ask she said  deringham who was slightly bewildered by something in her attitude sighed with relief and then turned with the grotesque resemblance of a smile in his face to greet forel who came in  gillard has been called away south on business and has sent me word he can let me have the places at the operahouse for both nights he said  no doubt you have seen the great man in england with his regular company but a treat of the kind is appreciated here and gillard bought up a row of places the best in the house  my wife is wondering who she should ask and would like to know if miss deringham has any preference  deringham glanced at his daughter and then smiled at his host  one feels a little diffident about returning a favour at somebody elses expense but my kinsman alton was very kind to us in the bush he said  forel appeared a trifle embarrassed and alice deringham felt her neck grow warm as she watched him  we can talk about it later but i scarcely think mr alton would come just now if he was asked he said  the girl turned away for she could comprehend forels discomfiture while as they followed him her father touched her  get mr alton there on the second night and that is all i ask he said  it was two days later when alton returned to his office in a somewhat uncertain temper  he had called at forels house the previous evening and been informed that mrs forel was not at home though the blaze of lights and music made it evident that she was entertaining a good many guests  he had also waited a considerable time for a banker who had been apparently willing to make him certain advances a few days earlier and when he came to complete the transaction raised wholly unexpected difficulties  afterwards he called upon a dealer in tools and sawmill machinery who after professing his willingness to deal with him on usual easy terms demanded a cheque with the order  alton fancied he recognized the hand of hallam in this but there was also something else which troubled him  some of the men he had business with had been a trifle abrupt in their greetings and others smiled sardonically when they saw him  as he strode down the corridor the keeper of the building signed to him  there was a young man here asking for you he said  told me he was mr townshead and hed be back again  alton had scarcely reopened his office when a produce broker he had dealings with came in  ive worked off the first two carloads and you can send some more along he said  now its not quite my business but if youll not stand out about the usual commission i can put you on to a man who wants a hundred fat cattle  its a deal said alton glancing thoughtfully at his visitor whom he considered an honest man  now i think you know a good deal about all that goes on in this city  oh yes said the other man i have to  glad to be of any use to you i can  well said alton ive noticed men smiling at me kind of curiously and i want to know right off whats the meaning of it  theres nothing especially humorous about me  you dont know and his visitor appeared to reflect when alton shook his head  then to put it straight there are folks who would not believe you no stop a little i mentioned nothing about myself  have you done anything lately that might have hurt the susceptibilities of mr cartier  alton laughed grimly  yes he said i hope so  i hove him out of this place one night and he fell downstairs  well said the other man smiling that accounts for a good deal do you happen to be on good terms with mr hallam  cartier is  no said alton dryly i dont  when mr hallam and i feel at peace one of us will be dead  now this thing is getting a little more clear to me  i wasnt willing to believe all i heard anyway  that said alton does not concern me  the question is what did you hear  the other man appeared embarrassed and sat silent a space  i think its only right that you should know he said  wellaccording to cartierthere was a lady here when he came in close on midnight and he gave folks the impression that she stayed here altogether  that wouldnt possibly have counted for so much but it also got about that she made use of her place to give you information that was worth a good deal about the business of hallam and the folks she worked for  altons face grew almost purple but the dark hue faded and left it unusually pale again  that he said very slowly is a damnable lie the lady alluded to was here once only and for at the most three minutes  the other man grew a trifle uneasy under his gaze  of course he said your word will do for me  still she was here you seeand its difficult to rub out a lie with that much behind it  im afraid youll find it stick to you both like glue especially as her employers turned the girl out immediately  anyway ill do what i can for you and now about that other carload and the cattle  alton brought his hand down crashing on the table  the cattle  oh get out and come back tomorrow or next month when i feel less like killing somebody  the other man appeared quite willing to accept his dismissal and alton vacantly noticed that a black stream of ink was trickling across the table  mechanically he dabbled his handkerchief in it and then flung it and the inkvessel into the grate after which he sat still with a black stain upon the cheek that rested on his fist  the plucky little souland theyve turned her out he said  lord but somebody has got to pay for this  he did not move for at least ten minutes while the clamour of the city vibrated through the silent room and when his first anger passed away became sensible of a great pity for the girl who had risked so much for him  it appeared only too probable that because of the modicum of truth it was founded on the lie would stick to both of them and now when it was too late alton regretted his folly  he had been fully justified in kicking cartier out of his rooms but he knew that everything that is legitimate is not advisable and groaned as he saw what the story must cost the defenceless girl who had a living to earn and her father to maintain  there was so far as he could see no way out of the difficulty yetand the one that concerned himself was almost as formidable for he knew alice deringhams pride and the damning fact remained that he could not deny the whole story  he had flung himself back wearily in his chair when there was a step in the passage and a young man came in  he walked straight forward and stood with one hand on altons table looking down on him with wonder and anger in his face  his eyes were unusually bright and there was a great contusion on his forehead  jack said alton simply  well sit down there and ill try to talk to you  this is a devlish mess ive got into  only heard about it ten minutes ago  jack townshead did not move at all  ill stand in the meantime he said harshly  unfortunately there are more concerned than you  yes said alton wearily  dont rub it in  i know  who was it told you  thats beyond the question said the lad  still last night one of our men whod been down here came in and was telling the story in the boys sleepingshed  i knocked him downthat is i meant to and started out by the first train  im at the mine on the south road now  you havent been home  no said townshead grimly  i came straight to you and in the first place youre coming with me everywhere to deny this story  alton sat very still for a space and the lad seemed to quiver as he watched him  i cantthat is not all of it  every trace of colour faded from jack townsheads face  good lord damn you altonit cant be true  alton rose up slowly and stretched his hand out while the veins swelled out on his forehead  then he dropped it again  youll be sorry for this by and by jack he said  dont you know your sister betteryou fool  now sit down there and ill tell you everything  the lad was evidently spirited but he was a trifle awed by what he saw in altons eyes and did as he was bidden  the hoarse voice he listened to carried conviction with it but his face was almost haggard when the story was concluded  now said alton very slowly thats all and for your sisters sake you dare not disbelieve me  jack townshead groaned  thank god he said with a tremor in his voice  but harry what is to be done  i simply cant tell the old manand theres nellie  you cant deny sufficient to be any goodand the cursed thing will kill her  now im trying not to blame youbut there must be a way of getting out somehowand its for you to find it  alton leaned upon the table a trifle more heavily his eyes halfclosed and one hand clenched  yes he said slowly  there is a wayand im beginning to see it now  get your hat jack and in the first place well go right along and see mr cartier  the lad rose and then possibly because he was overstrung and needed relief in some direction laughed harshly  i think you had better wash your face before you go he said  twenty minutes later they entered an office together and alton signed to a clerk  tell mr cartier im wanting to see him right now he said  you know who i am  the man smiled for he probably also grasped the purport of altons visit  then you had better come back in a week he said  he went across to victoria yesterday  that said alton grimly was wise of him  they went out and the lad glanced at his companion  it is of the least importance  there is more to be done  yes said alton simply  you have my sympathy jack but just now i cant do with too much of you  go right awayto anywhere and dont come back until youre wanted  ive got to think how i can best do the thing thats right to everybody     chapter xxviii  alton finds a way  daylight was fading and it was growing dim in the little upper room where miss townshead sat alone  the front of the stove was however open and now and then a flicker of radiance fell upon the girl and showed that her eyes were hazy and there were traces of moisture on her cheek  her patience had been taxed to the uttermost that day but townshead who had spent most of it in querulous reproaches had gone out and his daughter was thankful to be alone at last for the effort to retain a show of composure had become almost unendurable  it was with a sinking heart she glanced down across the roofs of the city into the busy streets where already the big lights were blinking and remembered all she had borne with there during the last few days somebody it seemed had industriously spread the story of her dismissal and a refusal had followed every application she made for employment but while that alone was sufficient to cause her consternation the halfcontemptuous pity of her former companions and the fashion in which one or two of them had avoided her were almost worse to bear and sitting alone in the gathering darkness the girl flushed crimson at the memory  there was also the grim question by what means she could stave off actual want to grapple with and to that she could as yet find no answer while her eyes grew dim as she glanced about the little room  townshead had changed his quarters and many of the trifles that caught his daughters glance had cost her a meal or hours of labour with the needle after a long day in the city but they made the place a home and she knew what it would cost her to part with them  twice she had raised her head and straightened herself with an effort while a flicker of pride and resolution crept into her eyes only to sink back again limply in her chair when there was a tapping at the door and she rose as some one came into the room  then she set her lips and stood up very straight as she saw that it was alton  i could find nobody about and there was no answer when i knocked he said  so i just came in  the girl moved a little so that she could see his face in the light from the stove and it was quietly stern but the movement had served two purposes for her own was now invisible  and you fancied you could dispense with common courtesy in my case she said  alton made a little grave gesture of deprecation  i wanted to see youvery muchbut please sit down  nellie townshead took the chair he drew out and was glad that it was in the shadow for alton stood leaning against the windowcasing looking down on her with grave respect and pity in his face  i am a little lameas you may have heard he said as though to explain his attitude  yes said the girl whose composure returned as she saw that he was temporizing  i am sorry  well said alton quietly so am iespecially just nowbut i did not come to talk to you about my injury  nellie townshead appeared very collected as she glanced in his direction for she had a good courage and had been taught already that when an issue is unavoidable it is better to face it boldly  one would scarcely have fancied that was your object  no said alton very quietly  now i am just a plain bush rancher and dont know how to put things nicely but i dont know that theres any disrespect in a straight question and i came to ask if you would marry me  the girl was mistress of herself and the mans naive directness was in a fashion reassuring  she was also for a moment very angry  it is a little sudden is it not she said  did i ever give you any cause for believing that i would  no said alton i dont think you did  nellie townshead afterwards wondered a little at her composure and temerity but she fancied she knew what had prompted the man and because it hurt her horribly all the pride she had came to her assistance and in place of embarrassment she was sensible of a desire to test him to the uttermost  then she said one should have a reason for asking such a question and at least something to urge in support of it  alton moved forward and leaned over the back of her chair where because he did most things thoroughly he attempted to lay one hand caressingly on her hair  miss townshead however moved her head suddenly and the man drew back a pace with a flush in his face  it is very lonely up at the ranch and i have begun to see that i have been missing the best of life  mine is too grim and bare and i want somebody to brighten and sweeten it for me  the girl was very collected  what she had borne during the last few days had turned her gentleness into bitterness and anger  thus it was with a curious dispassionate interest she would have been incapable of under different circumstances she continued to try the man realizing that though it was no doubt unpleasant to him there was one great reason which precluded the possibility of his suffering as he would otherwise have done  but you are going to live in the city now she said  yes said alton gravely  that is why i want you more  you see i know so little and there is so much you could teach me  i want somebody to lead me where i could not otherwise go though i know it is asking a great deal while i can give so little  this the girl realized was though somewhat impersonal wholly genuine  the tone of chivalrous respect rang true and she could comprehend the halfinstinctive straining after an ideal by one whose belief in her sex was if slightly crude almost reverential  it touched her though she knew that to benefit him it could only be offered to one woman and she was not that one  and that is all she said  of course said alton too decisively because he remembered as miss townshead quite realized that the other reason must always remain hidden  this was also as balm to her pride and there was a trace of a smile in her eyes  it is as you appear to understand very little  well said alton who seemed to take courage now when i see your meaning there is a trifle more  again he moved a pace and the girl fancied he would have laid his hand upon her shoulder  no she said decisively  alton sighed and his face became impassive but it seemed to the girl that there was relief in it  i think i could be kind to you and make things smooth for you he said very simply  i should always look up to you and i wouldnt ask for very muchonly to see you happy  he stopped apparently for inspiration and nellie townshead smiled a little  do you think that last was wise  alton turned towards her with a little glint in his eyes and the girl who knew his temperament felt that she had gone far enough  he had borne it very well and it seemed to her that other men might have handled the situation which was difficult less delicately  i asked you a question and it seems to me that it still waits an answer  the girl rose and stood looking at him with a little colour in her cheeks and a flash in her eyes but there was that in her attitude which held alton at a distance  if you were not the man you are and i was a little weaker i should have said yes she said  as it isthere is nothing that would induce me to marry you  it was almost dark now and nellie townshead could not see her companions face but she was no longer careful to keep her own in the shadow even when the radiance from the stove flickered about the room  will you not think it over he said very quietly  i know how unfit i am for youand i am a cripplebut  the light was now more visible in nellie townsheads eyes but her voice was gentle  no she said there are two very good reasons why it is impossibleand you know one of them  now do you believe i do not know what brought you here today  i think i have been trying to tell you said alton sturdily  if you fancy it was anything else you are wrong  the girl shook her head  you are a good man harry alton but not a clever one  only that it would have been a wrong to you you would almost have persuaded meby your silence chiefly  still you must go away and never speak of this again  alton stood still a moment glancing at her with pity and a great admiration  the girl was good to look upon he knew her courage and now as she flung all that he could offer her away and stood alone and friendless with the world against her but undismayed all his heart went out to her and what he had commenced from duty he could almost have continued from inclination  please listen just a little and ill be quite frank he said  you told me there were two reasons  possibly the girl read what was passing in his mind for she smiled curiously  i think you had better gonowand leave me only a kindly memory of you  do you think i should be content to takethe second place she said  nothing that you could tell me would remove one of the obstacles and you will be grateful presently  when that time comes be wise and dont ask for less than everything  alton said nothing further and when his steps rang hollowly down the stairway the girl sat down and sighed  then she laughed a curious little laugh and stopped to brush the tears from her eyes  as it happened while nellie townshead sat alone in the darkness miss deringham was writing a note to alton  spoiled sheets of paper were scattered about the table and though there was nobody to see it the girls face was flushed as she glanced down at the last one  the message it bore was somewhat laconic and ran we are going to the operahouse on thursday and as there is a place not filled i would like to see you there before you start for the ranges if you know of no reason why you should not come  she gave it to a maid and sat still until she heard a door swing to then rose swiftly and ran down the stairway  she met the maid at the foot of it and said breathlessly i want to add something to the letter  its too late miss said the maid who was a recent importation from britain  i gave it john the chinaman and he went off trotting as usual  i couldnt overtake him  alice deringham smiled a little though her voice belied her as she said it is of no importance  i can write another  she knew however that no second message she could send would repair what she had done for alton had timed his departure for the ranges next day and several must elapse before thursday came  he would she also felt assured not fail to come  miss deringham was justified for a few days later seaforth stood waiting in the snow with a packhorses bridle in his hand and several brawny men with heavy packs slung about them close by when tom of okanagan drove into the clearing as fast as his smoking team could haul the jolting wagon  you can sling all those things down again he said  thomson rode in with a wire from the railroad and harrys not coming  not coming said seaforth bewilderedly as he opened the message weve no time to losenow  then he crumpled the strip of paper angrily  well push on slowly boys until he comes up with us but you had better wait for him tom he said and added half aloud the devil take all women  miss deringham went to the operahouse on thursday with a somewhat distinguished party and though a storm of applause greeted the eminent english dramatist and the play was a popular one saw very little of him or the first act of it  then when the glitter of lights filled the building as the curtain went down she looked about her with veiled expectancy  she knew alton of somasco and that if he intended to keep the assignation he would then come when everybody could see him  she had also surmised correctly for just then alton who had shouldered his way through a group in the corridor moved down it under a blaze of light his head erect and his face somewhat grim as he saw the smiles and glances of disapproval of those who made way for him as the rancher who was fighting hallam and the capitalists behind him he was already known in that city and the story that the woman who was spoken of with him had assisted him from the beginning by betraying the secrets of those who employed her at his instigation had spread and told against him  alton saw it all and did not for a moment turn aside so long as the smiles and whispers were directed at him but he stopped and waited leaning on a chair some distance behind the spot where forels party were until the curtain rose again  the next act commenced as he knew with a night scene and while most of the audience had no eyes for any one but the great tragedian he moved forward quickly and alice deringham turned her head a trifle as a shadowy form slipped into the vacant place beside her  she could scarcely see the man and was not certain that she desired to but she would have known who he was had he been wholly invisible  it is you she said softly  i knew that you would come  yes said alton  you asked me to but now i know that i should not have done so  and that i should not have asked you said alice deringham  you should have been on your journey already  alton laughed a little  that was not what i meantas of course you know he said  still i wanted to see youand i had to come  why  alton was silent a little  it may be the last time  alice deringham shivered  but there is no reason  noand yes said alton grimly  iand it is due to you and another to tell you thishave done no wrong but there are reasons why i should not intrude myself into your company and i am going back up there into the snow tomorrow  but said the girl feeling horribly guilty there are times when ones friends can do a good deal for one  alton seemed to laugh a trifle bitterly  yes he said  still i do not care to trouble mine in that direction  one must stand alone now and then and things have not been going well with me lately  i had another blow today  i asked miss townshead to marry meand she would not  alice deringham said nothing for a space and then her voice was different  there was no shade of expression in it  and you are going back to look for the silver tomorrow  i hope you will be successful  thank you said alton  it would mean a good deal to everybodyand now i think i have already stayed too long  alice deringham heard the creaking of a chair and when she looked round he had gone but she said very little to any one when the curtain came down again while alton turning in a doorway for a moment set his lips as he caught the gleam of her hair  i think i have done the right thing all round but it was condemnably hard he said as he went down the corridor  by chance he came face to face with forel a few moments later and both men stopped  i am glad i found you said alton  it is only fitting to tell you that for a minute or two i joined your party  forel looked uncomfortable  to be frank there are unpleasant tales about you and while they neednt interfere with business one has to he said and stopped  alton nodded  you neednt be too explicit  the tales so far as you have heard them are not true  i tell you so on my word of honourand i want you to show that you believe me by finding miss townshead something to do  you can draw on me for the salary if its necessary  forel who was a goodtempered man flushed a little  if there was anything in the stories i should take this very ill  of course said alton  i shouldnt have objected if you had knocked me down but as i see you are not quite sure yet for just five minutes you have got to listen to me  forel did so and nodded when alton concluded i think you should do what i want you to because in the first place it will give you very little trouble and if you cant take my word so far im not fit to be trusted with your interests in the big deal we have in hand  and in the second said forel who stood to benefit considerably by the success of the somasco consolidated dryly  alton laughed  i think it would be more tasteful to leave that unexpressed because its connected with the other one he said  well said forel frankly i should have doubted what you have told me had it come from most other men but in this case i will see what i can do  we are as it happens in want of somebody at westminster and ill send them down a line tomorrow  thanks said alton with a little sigh of relief  now i think ive straightened up everything and i can go back to the ranges contented     chapter xxix  the price of delay  it was raining with pitiless persistency when alton and tom of okanagan came floundering down into the river valley  the roar of the canon rose in great reverberations from out of the haze beneath them and all the pines were dripping while the men struggled wearily kneedeep in slush of snow  the spring which lingers in the north had come suddenly and a warm wind from the pacific was melting the snow so that the hillsides ran water and the torrents that had burst their chains swirled frothing down every hollow  the men were chilled to the backbone for it had rained all day and they had passed several nights sheltered only by the pines  garments and boots were sodden and altons face was set and drawn for though he could now walk without much visible effort upon the level a journey through the ranges of that country would at any season test the endurance of the strongest wholelimbed man and his forced march had only been accomplished by stubborn determination and disregard of pain still it was not physical distress alone which accounted for his gravity  he had put off his journey to the latest moment and now when time was scanty the weather promised to further delay him  they had stopped a moment breathless when okanagan broke the silence  plenty water  im figuring well find charley seaforth somewhere here he said  the jumpers would have it drier if they headed out from lower down the railroad over the bench country  alton nodded as he listened to the roar of the river which warned him that their road up the valley would be almost impassable  it cant be helped he said and tom of okanagan who saw how grim his face had grown understood the reason  if hallams emissaries had gone up before them any further delay might cost alton the mine  nothing was said for another minute and then okanagan pointed to a dim smear of vapour below them that was a little bluer than the mist  smoke  charleys held up by the river he said  they went on in moody silence knowing that where the hardy ranchers seaforth had with him had failed there was little probability of any man forcing a passage and presently the smell of burning firwood came up to them through the rain  then a red flicker appeared and vanished amidst the dusky trunks and in another few minutes alton was shaking his comrades hand  the faces of both of them were unusually grave and there was dejection in the growl of greeting from the men who sat half seen amidst the smoke watching them  thats the whole of us said seaforth who noticed his comrades glance  we cant get on  how long have you been here said alton with significant quietness  two days  its unfortunate you didnt come earlier harry because we could have got right through a week ago  was it the leg that kept you  no said alton with a little mirthless laugh it wasnt the leg  i should have come but one cant always do two things at once and i had to choose  ive a good deal to tell you  seaforth glanced sharply at his comrade  i fancied you had  you are not the man i left at vancouver harry  well you will be hungry and suppers almost ready  it was several hours later and the men in the bigger tent were fast asleep when seaforth and alton sat swathed in clammy blankets under a little canvas shelter  the drip from the great branches above beat upon it and the red light of the snapping fire shone in upon the men neither of them had spoken for some time but at last alton laid down his pipe  this is a thing i wouldnt tell to any man if it could be helped but as you will hear it told the wrong way when you get back to the city you have got to know he said  id have been where i was wanted if it hadnt happened and now i cant help feeling i have given you and the rest away  it hurts me charley but what could i do  it would have been worse to let two women suffer for my condemned folly  seaforth was in no mood for laughter but his eyes twinkled faintly two of them  you have been getting on tolerably fast down there harry  alton stopped him with a gesture  my tempers not what it was a few weeks ago he said  now you sit still and listen to me  he had scarcely commenced his story when the smile died out of seaforths eyes  he seemed to listen with breathless intentness and his voice shook a little as he said and you asked her to marry you did you think for a moment that she would  alton appeared to consider  i didnt think at all he said  it seemed the one thing i could do and i did it  the city hasnt made much difference in you said seaforth watching his comrade intently  it must have been a load off your mind when she refused you  alton straightened himself a little  i dont like the way you put it charley  whoever gets miss townshead will have a treasure  the girls good all through  now i think ive told you everything and i dont ask if you believe me  there was a flicker of warmer colour under seaforths bronze and a curious glint in his eyes  yes he said slowly i think she is too good even for you and you have done all that any one could have expected of you without keeping up the farce any longer  i am glad you did not ask if i believed youbecause i could scarcely have forgiven you that question  do you think i dont knowboth of youbetter  the last words were a trifle strained and alton stared at his comrade in bewildered astonishment for seaforth had betrayed himself in his passion  then there was silence for a full minute until he said very quietly  and i never guessed  no said seaforth still a trifle hoarsely  and now i think you know  alton nodded and there was a very kindly smile in his eyes  yes im beginning to understanda good deal he said  im very glad for there are not many girls like miss townshead in the dominion  charley youre a lucky man but why have you been so long over it  it never struck me that you were bashful  seaforth smiled mirthlessly  if you will listen a few minutes you will see how fortunate i am  you never asked me what brought me out from the old country harry  alton gravely pressed his arm  there are times when one must talk go on if it will do you good he said  it was not an uncommon story seaforth told that night and alton who had heard it slightly varied several times already could fill up the gaps when his comrade ceased and the drip from the branches splashing upon the canvas replaced his disjointed utterance  seaforth was very young when it happened and the woman older than him  now you see what kept me silent  it wasnt a nice thing to tellyou he said  alton glanced at him with grave sympathy and then stared at the fire and what became of her  i saw her picture oncein a twentyfive cent album he said  a woman of that kind would know what she was about  seaforth smiled wryly  i was not the only fool he said  when id flung away everything a richer man came along  alton was silent a space  three thousand pounds he said is a good deal even in the old country  yes said seaforth wearily though it goes a very little way as i spent it it is and ive been paying it back at first a few dollars at a time ever since i came out to the dominion  you see the old man paid off everything though i know now money was very scarce with him then and ive wondered sometimes how far it helped to break him  he died soon after the crash cameand the girls had nothing  i think you told me your sisters were married now  yes said seaforth flora sent me back the last exchange somewhat indignantly which was why i was able to take my share in the consolidated  still all that is a little outside the question isnt it  alton smiled at his partner and laid a sinewy hand on his shoulder i wouldnt worry too much about it charley he said  you were a young fool but you have lived it down and theres the room there has always been for a good many more like you in the dominion  look round in high places and youll see themgood men and better than they might have been but for that little tripup when they were young  yes ive wondered where your dollars went toand im glad we have done so well now i know  you can stand straight up charley and face the world again  seaforth laughed wryly  the trouble is that it isnt the world i care about he said  no said alton  well for one has to do the square thing i think id chance telling somebody the story you told methough of course youd have to put parts of it differently  seaforth made a little gesture of despondency  im afraid i havent the courage andwith all that behind me  itisbehind said alton  and somehow i fancy it would only be fair to give the person it might concern the opportunity of hearing you  seaforth appeared to check a groan  there are things that one can never quite rub out  i was twentythree then and now when it is five years ago and she is alone in that horrible city i must keep silent still  harry its almost unendurable but because i must tell that story to speak now would be to throw my last chance away  alton nodded with grave sympathy  yes i think youre right and you must wait  well its time to turn in  with the first of the daylight were going on again  he was asleep in another ten minutes but seaforth lay awake shivering under his clammy blankets most of the night and rose aching when he heard his comrades voice through the patter of the rain in the misty darkness of the early morning  they made four miles that day and floundered waistdeep in water amidst the boulders during most of it the hillsides above them were steep and almost unclimbable and no man could have driven a canoe upstream amidst the grinding icecake which cumbered the river that was frozen still in its slower reaches  there they found better travelling through the slush that covered the rotten ice but those reaches were few and short and they went back to the boulders when the swollen river burst its bonds again  it came down in savage tumult between the rocks whose heads just showed above the foam and its banks were further cumbered by a whitened driftwood frieze over which the men must clamber warily clawing for a foothold on the great battered trunks or smashing through a tangle of brittle limbs  at times they were stopped altogether by a maze of washedup timber no man could struggle through and the axes were plied for an hour or more before they went on again  the second day was like the first one though their toil was if anything more arduous still and on the evening of the fourth they came worn out dripping and dejected to a spot where the valley narrowed in  a strip of forest divided the rock from the river on the opposite shore but between them and it a confusion of froth and foam swirled down while the hillsides seemed to vibrate with the roar of the rapid  one glance sufficed to show that the crossing was wholly impossible for either beast or man  on their side of the river a wall of rock hemmed the little party in and even seaforth wondered while okanagan growled halfaloud when alton kneedeep in water plodded steadily on  there was not more than another hours daylight and seaforth remembered that the gorge extended for a league or so while the flood had spread across it in front of them but he knew his comrade and said nothing  presently he slipped from a boulder and sank almost shoulderdeep in a whirling pool but somebody grabbed his arm and after a breathless flounder he felt the shingle under him and the froth lapped only to his knee  then they crawled amidst the driftwood which washed up and down beneath them tearing garments and lacerating limbs until they stood once more panting on dry shingle with a broad stretch of froth before them and the light growing dim  the river had spread from side to side of the constricted valley and the crash of the ice it brought down rang hollowly from rock to rock until it was lost high up amidst the climbing pines  it seemed to seaforth that to go on was impossible and he glanced at his comrade anxiously alton stood alone upon a driftwood trunk his figure silhouetted in rigid outline against the whiteness of the foam for his drenched garments clung in sodden folds to every curve of it  his face was as immobile in its wet grimness save for the smouldering glow in his eyes and there was a low growl of halfarticulate expostulation from those about him as he turned and pointed to the river  what are you stopping for  the silvers yonder and theres our road he said  none of them protested  they knew no rancher or prospector in the province could traverse the road he pointed to but in their long grapple with the forest they had not infrequently attempted things that appeared beyond the power of man and speech seemed useless when the river would answer for them  therefore when alton once more took to the water they followed him bracing overtaxed muscle against the tireless stream until the man who pressed on a dozen yards in front went down  then while seaforth held his breath there was a cry from okanagan who clutched at an arm that rose from the flood  seaforth had his hand next moment somebody clung to him and they went downstream together for a space with the shingle slipping beneath them and their burdens dragging them down panting floundering choking but still holding on until they found a foothold in the slack of an eddy and seaforth saw that alton was on his feet again  his hat had gone and there was a red gash on his forehead from which the blood ran down  he said nothing until they stood less than kneedeep when seaforth glanced at him  you will be contented now he said  yes said alton with hoarse breathlessness  im beaten  well well go back and make a traverse across the ranges  seaforth glanced for a moment at the slope of rock that ran up into the dimness above him  here and there it afforded a foothold to a juniper or stunted pine but that was all and there was a gleam of slushy snow high up above it where though the pitch was flatter the firs could scarcely climb  whether any man could reach those heights or cross them through the melting drifts he did not know but at the best the journey would cost a day for every hour it would have done had it been possible to follow the valley  you know what day it is he said  yes said alton very quietly  if hallams men are up there it will be too late when we get through  that means tolerably bad times for somasco  i said seaforth wasnt exactly thinking about somasco  altons face was very grim  well he said dryly it means a good deal less to one of us than it would have done a few weeks ago  they went back and it was dark when they camped in the dripping undergrowth but while seaforth fancied that alton did not sleep that night he was the first upon his feet when they rose in the darkness of the morning and commenced the slow ascent  there was no man in the party who did not feel that the journey would be useless but they went on nevertheless hewing a path through thickets crawling up steep rock faces on hands and knees and wading through the drifts to the waist in melting snow  so with toil incredible they left the leagues behind one and when they were fortunate two to the day and evening was at hand when at last they came scrambling down from fir to fir into the rainswept valley  there was nothing visible beneath them but a haze of falling water and the tops of dripping trees but alton stooped now and then as though listening and seaforth could guess at the torments of suspense he was enduring  we shall know in a few more minutes he said  i can see the river now  go on said alton hoarsely  oh get on  five minutes had scarcely passed when they stopped again and the men stared at each other in silence as a thudding sound came up to them through the rain  it was just distinguishable and they might be mistaken but a full minute went by before one of them glanced at alton  he stood very still with one knee bent a trifle leaning against a pine until the sound grew plainer and was followed by a voice  were too late but well go down and see it out he said  ten minutes later they plodded into the glare of a fire and stopped wornout and dripping in front of a rude bark shelter  a few men were scattered about it eating their evening meal and for a moment or two they stared at the newcomers silently until alton stepped forward and stood where all could see him hatless and tattered with a clotted bandage about his head  what are you doing on my claim he said  a big man rose up slowly with an axe in his hand and pointed to a board with rough letters cut in it nailed to a tree  it may have been yours one time  its ours now he said  theres no getting over the laws of this country  seaforth expected an outbreak and heard a growl from his comrades who commenced to close in behind him but alton only closed one hand a little  wheres the man who brought you here he said  gone out said the other to record the claim  now we dont want any unpleasantness but the mine is ours and there are enough of us to keep it you see  come in and have some supper and take it reasonably  alton looked at him for a space out of halfclosed eyes and the man appeared to grow uneasy  you condemned jumper  these are honest men he said pointing to those who followed him  well go back and camp up yonder boys  it was close on midnight when seaforth crept up to alton who lay huddled against a cedar in the smoke of the fire  his face showed drawn and puckered in the flickering light  dont take it too hard harry he said  alton smothered a groan  im feeling very mean tonight he said lord what a mess ive made of everything  every ranch in somasco mortgaged to the last rod the new mill not finished roads half made and not another dollar to be had in the city  and theres not a man or woman who believed in me but ive dragged them down  i think said seaforth they believe in you still  you did all that any man could have done harry  no said alton  i stayed down in vancouver when i should have been here  that can never be quite wiped outbut what could i do  seaforth laid his hand on his comrades shoulder  dont worry too much about what is done with but look forward  youll find your friends behind you yet  alton shook off his grasp  my friends  ive done them harm enough but you are right  this thing isnt finished yet  seaforth smiled a little  that is a good deal better harry  one wins at the last round now and then  alton looked at him steadily  you dont understand  all that was worth winning has gone alreadybut hallam must fight  seaforth saw the smouldering fire in the halfclosed eyes and the instinctive closing of the lean hard fingers and went back to his lair in the wet undergrowth contented  hallam had won hitherto but he knew his comrade and the struggle was not over yet     chapter xxx  seaforths reinstatement  there is on the road between vancouver and new westminster a strip of primeval bush  beyond it the fraser meadows stretch open to wind and sun westwards to the sea but beneath the great black pines it is dim and shadowy and seaforth was glad of that as he stood leaning against a hemlock one sunny afternoon  he would have found the task he had undertaken almost impossible in the glare of the white road that ran straight under the open sky but the stillness of that green realm of shadow where all things were softened in the faint halflight had made it a trifle easier  also the essence of the spring which had come suddenly was in the scent of pine and cedar and it had given him courage and set his pulses throbbing faster  it is possible that the man did not realize all the influences that upheld him then but something that sprang from the steaming earth and the life that was stirring in every towering pine reacted upon him and he gathered hope when he saw the reflex of it in the eyes of his companion  she sat a pace or two apart from him on a cedartrunk and a dusty bicycle rested against the farther end of it  the dust was also thick upon her simple dress and the cotton gloves that lay in her hands  her fingers had tightened upon them and there was a flush in her cheeks when for a moment she glanced at the man  his face was a trifle colourless but the girl looked aside again as she saw the tense anxiety in his eyes  and that is all he said with a little tremble in his voice  you will think it is horribly too much  nellie townshead glanced away into the shadows of the bush and there was pain and a trace of shrinking in her face but it had vanished when she turned again and her voice had a little imperious ring  and what made you tell me now  seaforth spread his hands out with a little deprecatory gesture  i expected this  the story i have told you should have shown you what i amand while i wanted to tell it earlier i was afraid  the colour was a trifle plainer in the cheeks of the girl and her voice slightly more imperious still  that leaves the question unanswered  i still want to know what gave you the courage now  seaforth understood her and knew her pride  i think harry gave me some of it  you see i never had a great deal  harry said miss townshead with a trace of astonishment that was not quite free from disdain  seaforth moved his head  yes he said  what i have told you i told him and he seemed to think that one could liveeven that kind of thingdown  he is you see a somewhat exacting man and that gave me the hope that you would be as merciful  still you have not answered me  seaforth flushed a little  i know what you meanbut would even what i have told you warrant you thinking that of me  i must know said the girl  seaforth was silent a moment  there is a distinctionbut it is difficult to draw he said  well i could not bear to think of you struggling on down here alone with everything against you  there were times when it almost maddened me and at last though i knew it might cost me all i hoped for i had to speak  the girls face softened  and there was nothing else  you did not think thatbecause of anything which had happenedi should be more apt to listen  seaforth was usually undemonstrative in bearing and speech but he stood up stiffly and his voice was a trifle strained  that is what i have been trying to make clear and i can only give you my word that i did not he said  if i had had more courage i would have told you that story long ago  nellie townsheads eyes were very gentle now  i felt i must make quite sure because had it been otherwise i should never have forgiven you  and said seaforth slowly you can forgive the rest  i can make no protestations but if i have gone straight in this country it was you who helped me and i should never have gone down into the mire if i had known you in the other one  and now i have nothing not even moderate prosperity to offer you  you think that would have counted said the girl  no said seaforth quietly not with you  it is because i have so little to offer i venture to ask so much  all the giving must be done by you  seaforth had though not an eloquent man pleaded his cause efficaciously for although his words might have been better chosen the inference behind them was plain and while parts of his story had brought the colour to the cheeks of his companion his blameless life in canada was a very acceptable offering since he owed it to her  it is pleasant to feel oneself a refining influence but it was not gratified vanity which stirred the girl  she had a wide charity and was one of those whose mission is to give without looking for a return she rose up slowly and stood before him with eyes that had grown a trifle hazy  all that counts the most is yours still she said  and as to the resti think it is done with charley  you have lived it down  seaforth stretched out his hands and drew her to him  god bless you my dear but you are wrong he said all i had was yours two years ago  it was some little time later when a creaking wagon swung round a bend of the road and the bronzed rancher on the drivingseat laughed softly to himself as he saw miss townshead sitting demurely but with downcast face on one end of the cedar and seaforth who appeared suspiciously unconcerned at least six feet away  that was not just how he had seen them when with the soft dust muffling the rattle of wheels he and his team came out of the shadows which hung athwart the bend  the wagon was old and weatherscarred the harness rudely patched with hide but it is possible there was room in the life of strenuous toil the bushman lived for the romance that brightens everything and he shouted a mirthful greeting to them as he whipped his team  then as the wagon jolted on out under the sombre archway into the brightness of the sun there came drifting back to them the refrain of a song  it was one sung often in the bush of that country at the time and the two who sat listening in the green stillness that sunny afternoon grasped the verity that underlay its crude sentimentality  shorn of its harshness by the distance the voice rang bravely through the thud of hoofs and rattle of wheels and there was in the halfheard words and jingling rhythm what there was in the sunshine and scent of steaming earth the life and hope of the eternal spring  seaforth laughed a little as he stretched his hand out to the girl but the light which shone back at him from her eyes was softer than that of mirth  i think that man knows what we know he said  come out into the sunlight  the world is not what it was an hour ago  they were plodding down the dazzling road one on either side of the dusty bicycle under the open sky when he spoke again  all this makes me sorry for harry  yes said the girl reflectively for she saw there was more to follow  seaforth bent his head  he has so little now  hallam has beaten us all round and harrys face takes my sleep away  everything he hoped for has been taken from him and he is lame you see  nellie townshead glanced at him swiftly  one would scarcely notice it  you have something in your mind charley  seaforths face was troubled as he answered her  it is a little difficult to put into words and if it was anybody else than harry i would not try  still alice deringham is almost as much to him as you are to meand i dont think she knows the truth you see  nellie townshead flushed a little and there was a trace of anger in her eyes  if miss deringham is punished for her wicked pride what is that to you  nothing said seaforth quietly  stillbecause of what i saw at the ranchi am sorry for her and harry who has been a very good friend to me is being punished too  we have so much you and i and he has nothing now  the girl did not answer him for at least a minute and appeared concerned about something that rattled in the bicycle  then she stopped and looked up at the man with a great tenderness in her eyes  you want to tell her  well it will be very difficult but i will do it for you  seaforth stooped and kissed the little ungloved hand on the bicycle reverentially  i dont know how i asked you and knowing how much has been given me i am almost afraid he said  nellie townshead smiled at him but she said nothing further until they parted and seaforth turned back towards vancouver city  he was brimming over with goodwill to everybody when he reached it and as it happened found storekeeper horton who came down there occasionally waiting for him  horton was by no means a genius or well versed in legal procedure but he had a ready wit and seaforth felt prompted to tell him the story of their first disastrous march which alton had hitherto but partially narrated though he suppressed its final incident  horton listened gravely with his most magisterial air  harrys no fool but he dont know everything he said  now i see where you and me can take a hand in  yes said seaforth thoughtfully  horton nodded  it was damer who recorded your claim  damer said seaforth  that was the man harry pitched into the river at somasco  horton chuckled  youre right  harrys just a trifle too handy at slinging folks into rivers and down stairways  well the fellow was hanging round my store and i thought i knew him and wasnt sure but when i saw his name down on the crown mining record that fixed me  now youre quite ready you and tom to swear to the story you told me  of course but still i dont see  hortons eyes twinkled  you will presently  thats where being a magistrate comes in  im going to take hold of damer for horsestealing  a thought came swiftly into seaforths mind and he smote the table but i cant swear it was damer  you would never convict him  horton laughed the bushmans almost silent laugh  i dont know that i want to  anyway i can keep on remanding him and when i sent him up for trial it would be a ranchers jury  thats going to give us a pull on mr hallam who is standing in somewhere behind the whole thingand i kind of fancy theres another man with him  seaforths face grew grave  then as harry wouldnt like it and theres nothing in it id get rid of that fancy  now of course you know what you can do but isnt it playing a little too much into your own hand  and you see folks might get talking about the thing  horton put on his most impressive air  theres justice by statute and theres equity as well as a lot more you never heard about said he  seaforth could not check his smile  and which of them is what were going to do  this said horton solemnly isall of them  its the square thing is there any reason why a man shouldnt do what is right because it suits him  anyway it neednt worry you because you can just sit up and watch the circus begin  just one question  was damer the man who rode out for the railroad one snowy night shortly before i started after harry  horton nodded and wondered a little at the change in his companion for there was a little flash in seaforths eyes and his voice had a ring  then he said grimly im going to take a hand in but there are several good reasons why we should not tell harry  it was a week later when forel came home one night looking somewhat anxious and depressed  he said little during the evening meal but after it spoke to his wife alone and mrs forel came upon alice deringham soon after she left him  im not going to get the new ponies after all she said  poor tom has been unfortunate again  i am sorry said alice deringham  you mean in the city  yes said mrs forel with a little sigh  he is always a trifle sanguine and he put a good many dollars into a venture mr alton recommended  tom expected a good deal from itbut the dollars have all gone  alice deringham did not look at the speaker  they have lost the money  well said mrs forel i believe they will do  i dont understand all of it but tom tells me that he cant see any hope for alton unless a new railroads built or the government does something for the somasco country and that does not seem likely  please tell me all you know  mrs forel looked thoughtful  it isnt a great deal  the land and ranches up at somasco are not worth very much just now but alton persuaded tom they would be presently and he helped alton to borrow more dollars from everybody who would lend them  then they built mills and things which will not be much use to anybody unless a railroad comes in  the people would only lend him the money for a little while and alton had hoped to pay them out of a silver mine but hallam it seems has been working against him and got somebody to relocate the mine because alton did not get there in time  now unless alton and his company can pay those dollars back the other people will take all he has away from him and if the railroad is ever built it is they or hallam who has been trying to buy the mortgages from them who will benefit  but said alice deringham how was it that mr alton did not make sure of the mine  that is just what puzzles tom  he stayed down here too long and then there was a flood or something that delayed him  still if he had gone when he intended he would have been in time  mrs forel glanced at her companion curiously but the girl sat very still with her face turned aside  it was almost a minute before she spoke again  and mr alton takes it hardly  tom doesnt seem to know  alton he thinks must be beaten but he told him he meant holding on until the last dollar had gone  after all i cant help feeling sorry for him  it must be hard to get oneself crippled and then lose everything while tom declares there was nothing in that other affair about the girl  alice deringham said nothing but mrs forel saw the blood creep into the polished whiteness of her neck and wished that she would look up the girls rigid stillness was she fancied a trifle unnatural and suggested that there was a good deal behind it  well she said presently that is all i know and i think tom is waiting for me  mrs forel went away and alice deringham sat where she had left her white in face now with something that was not wholly unlike horror in her eyes  and she said i kept him  half an hour passed and she did not move  anger against her father and horror of herself were held in check as yet by a tense anxiety as to the end of the struggle she had plunged the man who loved her in she could picture him standing with his grave quietness face to face with ruin and holding on until the last faint hope had gone  still it seemed almost impossible that he should be beaten and the curious confidence she had had in him reasserted itself and crept as a ray of brightness into the darkness of her humiliation  that might be borne or grappled with afterwards if alton came out triumphant but in the meanwhile she dare not think of herself or what she had done presently there was a tapping at the door and a maid came in  theres a ladymiss townsheadwaiting to see you miss she said  now alice deringham was the reverse of a timid woman but for a few moments she felt her courage fail  every instinct in her shrank from that meeting but the maid had no cause to suspect it when she rose languidly and followed her  the interview was not of long duration and nobody ever heard all that passed between the two but when seaforth who had been waiting anxiously handed miss townshead into the cars her eyes were misty  was it very hard he said  no the girl said slowly not after the beginning  i was angry when i went in and i came away only sorry for her  there is a great deal more that is lovable in miss deringham than i ever fancied there could be  yes said seaforth sapiently  but its much better when theres nothing else which is the case with somebody i know  i like my gold free from alloy  it was the next day when deringham found his daughter alone in the sunny corner of the verandah  he carried a handful of papers and the girl noticed that while he looked ill and haggard there was relief in his face  it was however with a vacant curiosity she waited for him to speak for she had risen heavyeyed and listless after a sleepless night  deringham leaned against the balustrade in front of her and appeared to find it somewhat difficult to begin  i have just spent an hour with mr alton and a lawyer and have something of importance to tell you he said  i am listening said the girl languidly though deringham fancied there were signs of a sudden intentness in her face  we will commence at the beginning  alton appears to have been doubtful respecting his right to carnaby and seems to have felt in the first place that it would not be fitting for him to receive as a favour what was his fathers by right  i do not know that many men would have regarded it in that light  i think said the girl with a little quickening of her pulses that mr altons view was right  well said deringham with a little smile that seemed to indicate that the point was not important that brings us to his other motive which displays a very creditable feeling  tristan alton as you know only relented upon his deathbed when as i pointed out to our kinsman his senses were in the opinion even of those who signed his will a trifle clouded and alton was reluctant to profit by a halfdelirious fancy which deprived us or to be more literal you of what was virtually your own  as i told him no man in the possession of all his wits would have made such a will and there was a probability that it could he successfully contested  then i think you blundered father said the girl  deringham raised his hand as though to indicate that he did not purpose to discuss the question  i have been trying to show you that alton never regarded carnaby as his  you follow me  no  i go farther said the girl with a curious smile  all that you have told me was quite clear to me some while ago  now we come to the present  alton has proved to myself and the lawyer that he is solvent  that is if he sold everything he could just pay his debts but because he does not intend to sell he stands figuratively speaking with his back to the wall and appears to consider that financial ruin may overtake him  that being so he has while he has the power made over all his rights in carnaby to you  alice deringham rose up with a little gasp quivering  father she said in a strained voice i dont think i can forgive you  deringham smiled deprecatingly  i think that is beside the point he said  it seems to me that alton has acted most becomingly and if he survives his difficulties we could of course come to some amicable understanding with him respecting the partition of the property  the girls face grew a trifle plainer for one word had an ominous ring  there is more than you have told me and once more it struck her that deringham was curiously haggard  well he said life is always a trifle uncertain and alton has twice met with disaster in the ranges  the girl stood still looking at him steadily with a vague terror in her eyes  then she said slowly and i am the mistress of all the carnaby property  it is mine to do what i like with  i could borrow money upon it or sell it  under conditions said deringham with a little smile of relief though his face grew clouded again  alton has made it yours almost too absolutely  alice deringham did not remember what next passed between them or how she dismissed her father but presently she sat alone staring down across the blue inlet with eyes that saw nothing  she was numbly sensible of a horrible humiliation but that troubled her the least alton was standing with his back to the wall and in some vague peril of his life and it was she who had helped to betray him  she almost hated her father and she loathed herself and yet a ray of hope shone through her fears  carnaby was wholly hers and with it she held the power to help him  that something which would test her courage to the uttermost must be done before he would accept help from her she knew but the pride which had been a curse to her was in the dust and when the vague project slowly grew into shape she rose and sought forel she was very composed in speech and bearing but when the merchant heard what she asked him he gasped with astonishment  i want it done as soon as possible she said     chapter xxxi  the third time  horton was essentially practical and once he saw his way usually set about the following of it without any of the misgivings which might have proved a hindrance to more intellectual men  there were however times when seaforth wondered uneasily whether he was doing well but he decided that as the outlook could not be much more unfavourable any variation would almost of necessity be an improvement and that one could not afford to be overscrupulous in a struggle with a man of hallams description  accordingly he hoped for the best and resigned himself to horton who grew more assured of the beneficence and legality of his proceedings during the journey to somasco where seaforth accompanied him and as soon as he arrived there sent round demanding the attendance of all the ranchers in that vicinity at his store in the name of the law  he however contrived that the summons should not reach the few who having refused to join the somasco consolidated were suspected of complicity with hallam until it was too late and though seaforth ventured a few protestations appeared perfectly contented with himself  im put right here to scare off malefactors and encourage honest men and im doing it the best way i can he said  the ranchers came as did captain andersen the venerable scandinavian constable whose duties had hitherto consisted in keeping his neighbours gardens free of depredating hogs and improving his own land  horton also made a speech to them and appeared somewhat offended when some of them broke into the bushmans silent chuckle  we have he said no use for fooling  this is the most serious and solemn kind of thing  oh yes said one of the assembly  thats just what its going to be if damers friends stand by him  damer isnt going to come along to prison because andersen tells him  horton regarded the speaker with a gravity that was tempered by semicontemptuous pity  then he said because im going to swear you in as special constables you and the boys will make him  there was another lapse into halfaudible laughter and one of the men touched seaforths shoulder  im wondering what harry would think of this said he  it would sound kind of curious in the old country  seaforth smiled as he made a little gesture of resignation  the point is that he doesnt know  anyway we havent done much to be proud of while we acted sensibly and now and then foolishness seems to pay as well as wisdom  well said the other grinning i wouldnt call old horton a fool altogether  horton interrupted him by calling up six of the biggest men and very gravely swearing them in after which he produced a paper  this he said is a warrant for the apprehension of one roger damer for horsestealing and all you have to do is to go up and get him  you will meet here at daylight tomorrow every man with a horse and provisions but while ill do the best i can for you im not quite sure the government will pay for them  once more there was soft laughter but early next morning six silent men whose bronze faces bore no trace of merriment now rode out of the settlement with rifles slung behind them and four more followed later leading heavilyladen horses by the bridle  time was not of vital importance and though all of them were at home in the bush they prospected for the easiest road which led them through valleys few men of their race had ever set foot in before  twice a few of the siwash who come down the rivers with the spring awoke when the moon was in the sky and heard a trampling of horses high up amidst the pines that shut in a lonely valley and once a solitary prospector camping close beneath the snow rose drowsily beside his fire and wondered whether he was dreaming as he saw a line of mounted men with rifles flit by and vanish beyond a black hill shoulder  they rode in silence and save for the muffled ring of iron and faint jingle of steel he could have taken them for disembodied spirits in place of living men  horton however had in him a trace of the general and did what his mind could grasp with a grim thoroughness while as the result of it there was blank astonishment one morning in a mining camp as he and the men who followed him appeared as by magic from amidst the pines surrounding it  they were also armed and the miners who rose from their breakfast stared at them motionless in silence that is all save one who slipped into a tent and afterwards out through the back of it  horton however saw him and his command was to the pointstop him  there was a rustle of branches and tom of okanagan rose out of the thicket the fugitive had almost gained with a rifle in his hand  he laughed somewhat grimly as he said stop right where you are  then there was for a space a somewhat impressive tableau that had in it humorous as well as tragic possibilities  hallams men had doubtless been chosen because of qualities which are more tolerated farther south than they are in that country but they had nothing handy to enforce their protests with beyond their camp utensils and it did not appear advisable to make a move in search of more effective weapons  accordingly they stood silent with the smoke drifting about them all save one of them who with impotent fury in his face backed step by step into the opening before their shanty as tom of okanagan beckoned him  nobody else moved at all for hortons company were commandingly posted beneath the surrounding pines and there was a grim twinkle in the eyes of one who carried a rifle and had risen out of the undergrowth between the shovels and axes and their legitimate owners  how long the spectacle would have lasted seaforth did not know but at last the man who had backed away before okanagan tripped on a tent line and went down headlong  that broke the silence and the big man who had on a previous occasion spoken with alton stepped forward  now what the  is all this about he said  stand back said horton solemnly as he drew out a paper  its the hand of the law  heres a warrant for roger damer and its his body weve come for  you will put the handcuffs on him constable andersen and if he tries to stop you tom has full authority to pound the wickedness out of him  hold on said the big man  thats your way of it  now has it struck you that there are things we might do  oh yes said horton with undiminished gravity  youre going to stop where you are like lawful citizens because there are enough of us to make you if you dont want to  the argument was incontrovertible and there was only a growl of protest as the venerable scandinavian did his duty  then while two men stood on guard over their prisoner horton turned for the last time to the miners  im kind of sorry i dont know quite enough about you to take the rest of you along he said  still if i can find out anything well come back for you again  well boys well be going  hitch that lariat on to the prisoners wrists and keep a good hold on it constable andersen  nothing more was said for hortons men marched out of camp as silently as they had come and it was only when the pines had closed about them that a hoarse laugh went back in answer to the volley of vituperation that rose out of the hollow behind them  damer spoke no word to any man all that day or the next but when they camped on the second night high up on the hillside he signed to seaforth who passed the fire where he lay a little apart from the rest  somebody is going to be sorry for this he said  now a sensible man would wonder what you expect to make by it  you mean that we cant connect you with the horsestealing  yes said the man if there was any  now there are men behind me who will make you and horton very sorry you ever fooled with me  seaforth smiled outwardly and with his eyes for he surmised that the prisoner was willing to bargain for his freedom but his lips were set and he found it difficult to restrain the rage that welled up within him  well he said i dont know that it is of any great importance whether we do or not  it will be enough to hold you by until we find out all that happened one snowy night when somebody fixed a lariat across a trail and there was another affair up in the bush  the light of the fire was on them and the mans face betrayed him though his words were bold enough  you dont take me with a hand like that  seaforth trembled a little as his anger shook him for he had seen enough  i think you are the man we want he said  he had desired to make quite certain and succeeded but he afterwards regretted it for the effect of that speech upon the prisoner who did not answer him was considerably more than he had anticipated  the man who appeared as seaforth decided later suspiciously cowed and dejected said nothing to any of his captors all next day and lay down at night in apathetic sullenness but when the rancher who slept beside him awoke in the morning he had gone and by way of ironical farewell somebody had hung a pair of rusty handcuffs whose snapspring was evidently defective upon a neighbouring tree  one man had kept watch beside the fire which he had left for a few minutes to bring in more wood and another by the horses but while neither of them had seen or heard anything the fact that their captive was no longer with them remained and halfanhour spent in very pointed and personal recriminations did nothing to solve the mystery  it was horton who terminated the discussion  weve no use for more talking boys he said  the man was here last night and he isnt now and it dont count for very much how he got away  head right away for the railroad two of you  another two will strike for the pass in the main divide and if you get through quick enough youll turn him off into the back country  the rest of you will stop right here and help okanagan to pick up his trail  there was a hurried saddling of horses four mounted men went crashing through the undergrowth downhill at the risk of neck and limbs and an hour later seaforth and okanagan stopped a few moments breathless beside a frothing stream  hell have gone this way for the river sure said the latter  you can tell horton to send thomson and andersen across to watch the canon  seaforth looked at the bushman and his face was curiously grim  you know who he is tom  we must have him at any cost and i think it is my fault he got away  okanagan laughed a little almost silent laugh that had no mirth in it if the boys can head him off from the railroad ill find him sure he said  oh yes i think i know him  when we get him im figuring well find the marks of harrys knife on him  okanagan found the trail again lower down the valley and he and another tireless man headed for the river through a country no horse could traverse all that day leaving seaforth behind them wornout at noon  he sat down to wait for horton considerably disturbed in mind and his anxieties would not have been diminished had he known that alton was starting for somasco by the atlantic express that afternoon  it was next day when alton reached the settlement and found the few women there in a state of excitement while when he had heard their story he borrowed the best horse he could find and rode out at a gallop towards the ranges  he had also spent several days in the bush without finding any trace of the party when he camped one evening on the edge of one of the many deep ravines the torrents wear out of the hillsides it stretched a dim shadowy chasm across his path and looking down he could faintly see the firs that clung here and there to the sides of it loom faintly black through the drifting mist  it was too dark to seek for a way of descending or round the head of it and he decided to remain where he was until the morning  twenty minutes sufficed to make his simple camp and he sat with his back to a cedartrunk and a can of green tea beside him while the shadows crept higher up the hillsides and night tame down to meet them out of the dimness of the east  the fire crackled joyously  there was hope in all the smells of spring and the stir of life in every growing thing while the chill that came down from the white peaks fired the blood like wine but alton sighed as he glanced up at the stars above him and his face was sombre  there was it seemed no possibility of the railroad being built to somasco he could only see disaster in front of him and knew that with the hope of prosperity a brighter one had gone  he would be a poor man and was a cripple andfor he had not forgotten his deficienciescould have laughed at the folly which had led him to grasp at that which could never be his  then his slow enduring stubbornness came to his help again as he remembered that there yet remained to him the fight with hallam  i was a fool  she only wanted to be kind he said  still he groaned in a fit of passion as the memory of one moment at midnight in somasco ranch returned to him for all his pulses throbbed feverishly as he felt in fancy the warm white arm steal round his neck  i must have dreamt itwith the rest he said  and if i didnt that was enough to remember  god bless her for her gentleness  again he flung the memories from him with an effort that brought a dew to his face but the conflict which must be fought every day was over and he stretched his long limbs amidst the soft cedartwigs and lay down to sleep with a stolid acquiescence that if wholly free from bitterness was but little brightened by the victory  the mans life had been a struggle almost since its beginning and he was stubborn but his own headstrong passions had been the most obdurate enemy he had ever brought into subjection  sleep came and brought him forgetfulness  the fire sank to a lambent flicker above the whiteflecked embers the pines sang their mystic songs about him as a little breeze awoke and their soft sighing was answered by the growl of the torrent far down in the ravine  now and then the horse stamped restlessly and tugged at the lariat that was pegged down within reach of altons arm and once came up and looked down on him  alton usually slumbered lightly in the bush but mans primitive instincts reassert themselves in the wilderness and because it is possible that his senses were not wholly dormant and there was some subtle sympathy between him and the beasts that served him he did not awaken  then the horse grew restless and pricked its ears stood still snorting and backed away to the length of its tether as a face looked out from the undergrowth  the sinking light of the fire was on it and it was an evil face with the stamp of hunger on it and malevolence in the staring eyes  again the horse snorted and trembled as an arm was thrust out of the bushes and something glinted in the hand but alton still lay motionless with the pack saddle under his shoulders  then a man crawled clear of the undergrowth rose up and stooped over the lariat with a knife in his hand  he needed a horse badly and one stroke with the blade would give him one but he needed food and a saddle almost as much and moving forward a few paces gazed at the sleeping man  he saw the pack that had been seized to the saddle and guessed that there were several days provisions inside it while a wolfish gleam came into his eyes as he straightened himself and stood very still listening  his garments hung in thornrent rags about him weariness was in his very attitude but his face had written on it the cunning and courage of desperation for he had been hunted by tireless men who were then close behind him and had travelled for the most part starving and without sleep  with a good horse and provisions he could yet escape his enemies and the man looked scarcely human as he stood watching the sleeper with a sullen glow in his eyes  there was nothing audible but the sighing of the pines and the faint sound of breathing and moving a pace nearer he stopped again  the man he watched was very still but a little breeze fanned the fire and when the flickering radiance passed across his face the watcher almost betrayed himself with a cry as he recognized him  there was only one course open to him now and with the muscles of his right arm contracting and the lean soilstained fingers he had clawed his way up the ravine with closing on the knife he crept forward another pace he had no great fear of anything horton and the ranchers could do without the help of this man who could condemn him and he knew his capabilities  now one swift thrust would silence him forever and once he could reach the railroad there was a man who for his own sake would help him safely out of the country with as many dollars as he might demand  still he slipped out of the firelight next second and the knife shook a little in his hand  alton had lain with his right arm under him and the starched shirt he had worn when he left the city showing white where the jacket and blanket had fallen apart but now the arm was stretched across his body  still his eyes were closed and the man who surmised that he must have moved while he glanced at the provisions closed with him swiftly crouching  he stopped again stooping further for the arm and blanket were in the way and he knew he might have no opportunity for a second thrust  something must be risked and moving his eyes from the sleepers face he endeavoured to draw the blanket gently aside  that was a blunder for the soilstained fingers had scarcely touched the fabric when a fist was dashed full in his face and as he staggered backwards something hove itself partly upright and fell upon him after that neither of them knew all that had happened but the knife fell from a hand whose wrist yielded under a crushing grasp and was kicked away and trampled on  then breathing stertorously they reeled into a fir and the assailants hand was free again while stones rattled beneath them as alton halfsuffocated flung him almost at arms length from him  then the ground seemed to slip away beneath him and he wound an arm about his adversary as he smote again  faint as he was with the blow alton did not however strive to shake him off now but grappled with him the more closely and next moment they had rolled crashing through a juniper  then the other man came down undermost and struck a stone there was a swift glissade over rattling shingle and through smashing undergrowth and alton lay still alone while something rolled on down the slope beneath him until hearing a splash below he rose with a little hoarse cry and swung himself off the ledge which had arrested him  he rolled over several times but came down as he discovered later whole in limb for he could think of nothing then as he groped in and out amidst the pools and boulders for his enemy  when he found him the man lay with his face apparently in the water and only moaned a little when alton shook him  then suddenly his passion fell from him and with a gentleness that was in no way akin to pity he dragged the limp body from the water and sat down to wait for morning with the wet head upon his knee  the morning was also a very long while coming but at last when the stars were paling and the dark pines slowly grew into shape and form there was a sound of footsteps on the heights above and a voice he recognized came down  come right along  heres his fire but the man has gone  charley cried alton and there was an exclamation of astonishment followed by a scrambling and presently seaforth stopped with a little gasp by his comrade  altons face showed drawn and grey in the creeping light and there was another more blanched one in the wet fern beside him  good lord said seaforth  whats the meaning of this harry  look at him said alton gravely  you should know him  i think this is the third time  damer said seaforth hoarsely  we were trailing him and knew he couldnt be far off when we saw your fire  we took it for his  is he dead  no said alton gravely i hope not  we have some use for him  go back and get the lariat and well try to heave him up     chapter xxxii  alton holds his hand  it was very quiet and somewhat chilly in the little back room of hortons hotel when damer who lay on a trestlecot moved his head a trifle and made a feeble sign  the fire had sunk in the stove and it was then towards two oclock in the morning when mans vitality is at its lowest  the young doctor horton had brought in from a distant settlement shivered a little as he rose and stooped over the bed  damer glanced at him out of glazing eyes and made a faint gesture  i have no use for you he said  its alton i want  the doctor crossed over to horton who sat in a corner  if there is anything you want to ask him lose no time he said  the man cant last until the morning  well said horton gravely it would be a favour if you went down for neilson the surveyor  hes sitting up waiting  you see we want some witnesses not connected with the thing in case hes going to tell us anything  harry youd better talk to him  alton crossed the room and sat down by the bed  he had as it happened come out almost scatheless from the fall into the ravine which was not the case with his assailant who had been carried down to the settlement with the life just clinging to his crushed body  all that was possible had been done for him and now alton waited with intense suspense with something akin to compassion in his eyes and his anger diverted from the dying wretch to the man who had made use of him  youre going to talk he said  well its only square to warn you that it will be all put down  damer glanced at horton who sat with a pen in his hand and a paper on his knee and from him to the surveyor holding one or two government appointments who came quietly in  thats all right he said very slowly  well i wanted to kill you but i dont know that ive a great deal against you now  you and the boys did what you could for me and it was a man in the city who held me to it  oh yes hes sitting down there raking in the dollars and dont care two cents that the man he sent up to make them is dying here  the things not square anyway  alton was sensible of a faint disgust but he remembered that he could not afford to be fastidious because the men he had drawn into his venture must stand or fall with him  we want to know who he is he said  there was a glimmer of malice in damers face  well he said and the strained voice grew clearer it was hallam of the tyee  there was something i did that gave him a pull on me and that man has no mercy for anybody  alton heard the scratching of hortons pen  and hallam hired you to murder me  yes and damer glanced at horton  you have got that down  at first he only hired me to go up to somasco and watch you while i worked for you  youre a tolerably smart man harry alton but its kind of curious you didnt know me  alton stared at the drawn face with a bewildered expression and then moved a trifle in his chair  good lord he said  black nailers partner  well i didnt see you that oftenand it was dark when  damers face went awry with pain but his gesture implied comprehension  yes he said feebly  when you got him with the axe  nailer had been on the whisky and that gun of his was a little stiff on the magazinespring but he was the best partner i ever had and i left a good claim behind when you and the boys chased me right out of that part of washington  now youve got the beginning  give me a little more brandy  the doctor came forward softly and held a glass to the cracked lips then lifted the dying man a little  after that there was silence for at least five minutes and alton sat rigidly still choking down his fierce impatience as he saw his last hope slipping away from him  then he drew in his breath with a quivering sigh as the feeble voice commenced again  get it down  you havent much time  hortons pen scratched and spluttered as sinking now and then almost beyond hearing the disjointed words fell from the lips that could scarcely frame them but it was nevertheless with a horrible vividness that damer told his story and those who sat listening gasped with relief when at last it was finished and everything was plain  then he signed to the doctor who raised his head a trifle and once more held a glass to his lips  read it  i want to see youve got it straight he said  for a space hortons voice rose and fell monotonously as he read in haste  then he approached the bed with the paper and the dying man seized the pen he traced a few straggling characters upon the document and let it fall again watched with strained impatience while horton and the surveyor signed and then turned his head from the light  now he said i guess ive fixed the man who held the whip over me up quite tight  it was probably ten minutes before he moved again and then he signed to alton very feebly with his fingers while a curious look that afterwards puzzled the rancher who could not forget it crept into his eyes  there was vindictiveness in it but whether there was more than this he could never tell  theres just another thing he said in a hoarse strained whisper as alton bent over him  come nearera little nearer still  now there was another man as well as hallam  alton glancing round saw that the others had not heard and stooped a trifle further as the cracked lips moved again  nobody caught what damer told him but when he straightened himself again his face was white and grim and he went out without a word to any one  then the flicker of a smile came into the eyes of the dying man and he moved his head so that his face was hidden  the doctor crossing over softly looked down on him and signed to the others that they might leave the room  he may last an hour or two but i dont think he will speak again he said  in the meanwhile alton strode with hands clenched into the shadows of the silent pines  he had long been troubled by vague suspicions and had driven them away but he could not doubt what damer had told him and groaned as he stood face to face with the verity  he had been too proud to stoop at any time to take an unfair advantage of an enemy but he could not lightly forget a wrong and there was a trace of stubborn vindictiveness within him  hallam had brought him down to ruin and thrice struck at his life by treachery and now damers testimony had placed his enemy in his hand  he had but to close it and crush him but he also realized with fierce anger what this would cost him for hallam had it seemed protected himself effectively  if he dragged hallam down deringham must fall with him and while that consideration alone would not have stayed him in spite of the curious pride of race and family which he had become sensible of of late it was evident that his daughter must suffer too  she had done no wrong and alton who thought of her with a great tenderness dare not contemplate all that the revelation would cost her  it would have been bitter to let his enemy go free had he stood alone but that was he realized what no man can do and there were behind him with their future linked to his the ranchers of somasco whose safety demanded that he should put it out of hallams power to do them a further injury  it would also be so simple  he had but to hold his hand and horton would take all the action that was needful  then it became more plain to him that even at the cost of his loyalty to his comrades he could not allow the woman he loved to suffer with the guilty  he knew her pride and that the blow would crush her but again through all his pity for her a gust of rage shook him and he ground the soft cedartwigs viciously beneath his heel  he could not face the thought of the womans humiliation  everything must go his pride his faith his vengeance before that came about and he stopped in his restless pacing and leaned against a pine as the conflicting emotions gave place to a quiet resolution  at last he could see the stars between the great branches high above him and shivered a little as a chilly breeze sighed across the silent bush  something in its stillness reacted upon him and the last trace of his passion melted away  if he did wrong he alone would be responsible and at least his enemys daughter should not suffer  walking very slowly he went back to the hotel and found horton writing  he glanced at alton curiously and then answered the unasked question  yes he said hes out on the trail now and one would kind of wonder where it was taking him  where have you been all this time harry  how long have i been said alton  two hours anyway  well you neednt tell me if you dont want to but its quite easy to see that something is worrying you  alton concealed his astonishment  ive had things to think about said he  wasnt there a paper you took from damer  oh yes and horton flung him several crumpled sheets across nothing much to be made of that  it has been given him to send cipher telegrams with  alton glanced at the paper with apparently vague curiosity but his brain was busy and he had a good memory  i think id let the folks in vancouver have it he said with a yawn now i want a few hours rest because were going back at sun up to restake the claim  horton looked thoughtful  im not quite sure you could hold it  it hasnt been declared open  alton laughed a little  well i think i can he said  damer hadnt got his patent anyway and its scarcely likely that the man who sent him will protest against me  then he slowly strolled away but once the door closed behind him moved with quick resolute steps to his room  there he sat busy with pen and paper for several minutes and then descending softly found okanagan in the store  get your horse as quietly as you can and ride in to the railroad with this message as if the devil was after you he said  okanagan stretched himself sleepily  hortons sending in at sun up  yes said alton dryly  i want my message on the wires some hours before his but nobody need know of it beyond you and me  okanagan nodded and in another five minutes alton looked into the room where horton was still writing  i fancied i heard somebody riding down the trail but its not quite easy being a magistrate and my heads got kind of mixed said the latter  still ive nearly got this thing fixed and if the folks down in vancouver dont fool over it when hallam hears whats happened to his partner hell be under lock and key  oh yes said alton  well hope for the best though that mans kind of slippery  in the meanwhile tom of okanagan was riding at a gallop down the trail with the thin mist whirling by him and the stars above him growing dim and there were several leagues between him and the settlement when daylight crept slowly into the valley  thus it happened that hortons dispatches to the police at vancouver were not the first that left the station and that evening deringham who was sitting with his daughter on the verandah of forels house turned from the girl with a little closing of his lips as he saw hallam coming up the pathway  his movements suggested nervous haste and though he was usually neat in dress his unbuttoned coat had evidently been flung on while the glance he cast behind him towards the wharf where one of the sound steamers was about to sail savoured of apprehension  this did not escape alice deringham  mr hallam seems to be in a hurry she said  i wish he had not come now because i do not like that man and you have not been well lately you will not let him disturb you  deringham rose and looked down on her with a curious little smile  i dont know that it can be helped but i am no more pleased to see mr hallam than you seem to be he said  for a moment and though the breach between them had not been healed the girls heart smote her  deringham had beguiled her into an action whose memory would she fancied always retain its sting but he was her father and seemed very worn and ill  also some instinctive impulse prompted her to detain him  father she said pleadingly dont see him  go in at once and i will tell him that quietness is necessary to you  deringham had almost yielded to the hand upon his arm when hallam glanced in their direction and signed to him  then he shook off the girls grasp and she shivered a little for no apparent reason as they went in together  there was nobody else about for mrs forel and her husband had gone down to the city and she sat alone on the verandah while a murmur of voices reached her through an open window  though his words were inaudible her father appeared to be expostulating  then he came out and as she noticed there was an unusual pallor in his face and that his hands were trembling she remembered he had looked as he did then once before when a partial failure of the hearts action had almost cost him his life  you must send mr hallam away at once she said  deringham made a gesture of impatience  i shall be rid of him altogether in a few more minutes  you have some money by you  yes said the girl  i am not fond of going to the bank and got mr forel to change my english cheque into currency but why do you want it  hallam has to catch the steamer and the banks are shut  dont ask questions now but get me the money quick  alice deringham went in and returned with a little satchel  this is all i have and i dont feel very willing to lend it mr hallam she said  deringham took the satchel from her and moved away then as though acting under impulse he stopped and looked back at her  thank you my dear he said with a curious gentleness  it has relieved me of a good deal of anxiety  he went away and alice deringham hearing the door close behind him wondered a little  when she next looked up she saw hallam swinging with hasty strides down the road and a little later the roar of a whistle rang about the pines as a big white steamer moved out into the inlet  a cloud of yellow vapour rolled from her funnel there was a frothing wash beneath her towering sides and the girl watched her languidly until the pines which shroud the narrows shut the great white fabric from her sight and left only a moving trail of smoke  then she felt happier  the steamer had at least taken hallam away and her father was not now the courtly though somewhat reserved gentleman who had treated her with indulgent kindness until hallam crossed his path  it was a fine evening and she sat still on the verandah wondering how the rift had imperceptibly widened between them until again the blood crept to her forehead as she remembered that it was at his instigation she had detained alton  still though she realized that this could not be wholly forgotten she took her part of the blame and felt sorry for the harassed man whose anxieties were intensified by his solicitude for her welfare  he was in difficulties his health was failing and she decided upon an attempt at reconciliation  the respect she had cherished for him could never be quite restored but she could be a more sympathetic daughter and help him to bear his troubles  then as she glanced down across the inlet with eyes that grew softer forel and his wife came up through the garden  still alone he said  where is your father  i think he is in your room said the girl  mr hallam came in to see him  hallam  now i wonder said forel and stopped but alice deringham had seen his face and being a woman took instinctive warning  i dont think he wanted anything of importance and he was only in a minute or two she said  they went in together but forel was behind the girl when she pushed open a door and then stopped just inside it  deringham was sitting before a table and there was something that perplexed her in his attitude  he seemed curiously still and his head had fallen forward  father she said and her heart beat a trifle faster for deringham did not move  his face was not visible and moving forward she grew suddenly faint and cold as she touched his shoulder  there was no response from the man and she now noticed that he seemed huddled together but she saw nothing more for just then a hand was laid upon her arm  shaking off the grasp she turned and saw her growing horror reflected in forels face  you must come away my dear he said hoarsely  alice deringham shivered but she stood very straight a moment staring down with dilated eyes at the grim figure in the chair  touch him  speak to him she said in a voice that set forels nerves on edge and then as the last faint hope died away stretched out her hands with a little halfchoked cry  come away said forel very huskily  he was sensible that the girls hand was very cold as he drew her from the room but he left her with his wife on the verandah and then went back hastily  forel was a kindly man but he knew that speculation in western mines has its underside and it was for the girls sake he stripped off the top sheet of the blottingpad which had a recent impression on it and afterwards poured the remaining contents of a wineglass out into the stove  then he glanced all round the room before he went out to send for a doctor  it was an hour later when he found his wife alone  how is she he said  mrs forels eyes were hazy  i think she has given way at lastit was awful at first when she would only sit and look at me she said and then her voice sank a little how did it happen tom  heart disease said forel  the doctor is quite sure of that  but said mrs forel what brought it on  well said forel slowly anything that upsets one is apt to prove perilous in cases like his and i rather fancy that deringham had a quarrel with hallam  they had dealings together and i think deringham must have lost a good deal of money  you will not however mention it to anybody  mrs forel looked at her husband curiously no of course she said i wish i knew what to do for the girl     chapter xxxiii  miss deringhams confession  several weeks had passed since deringhams funeral when one evening forel sitting alone on his verandah saw alton coming up the pathway his face was once more bronzed by wind and sun but it had not wholly lost the sombreness forel had noticed when he had last seen him in vancouver  im glad to see you forel for ive just come in from victoria and theres a good deal i want to know he said  you generally do and forel became suddenly grave  you heard what happened to your kinsman  yes said alton  it was some time before i got your letter  i was back up there at the mine you know  very sudden wasnt it  forel nodded  still it was not altogether astonishing  the doctor had warned him a few days before it happened that any unusual exertion or excitement might prove perilous  and so far as you know was there anything of that kind  ford watched his companion closely as he answered  i have told nobody else but hallam called here and saw him shortly before it happened  altons face remained impassive but his voice was not quite in accordance with it as he said the police have no word of him  forel smiled  as there cannot well be a prosecution without a prisoner they are somewhat reticent  still hallam caught the sound steamer and late that night one of the officers came round here while i was eventually able to glean a few details  the steamer had called at one or two ports before they got the wires and while the american police might have shadowed him you cannot arrest a canadian across the frontier until you get your papers through  by the time that was done there was no trace of hallam  still im a little puzzled because he seems to have cleared out at a moments notice and its difficult to see who could have warned him  forel fancied that alton seemed relieved  he has gone anyway he said  still if he had only time to catch the steamer the banks would be closed and he couldnt go very far without dollars  they generally want two signatures to a cheque in a concern like his  forel looked alton steadily in the face  i happen to know that he took a good big cheque with him and it was negotiated in tacoma he said  it has transpired since that his partner was away that day and his chequebook not available  altons eyes closed a trifle and though he made no other sign forel saw that the shot had reached its mark  then he said slowly i would rather you didnt mention it  hallam is scarcely likely to venture back again  no said forel  there were i fancy things his partners didnt know but when he had gone they commenced inquiring and it is currently believed that what they discovered slightly astonished them then there was an indignation meeting of the tyee shareholders and talk about prosecuting the accountant  there was relief in altons face which softened suddenly as he said and how is miss deringham  forel smiled  i fancied you were about to ask that question first he said  the girl seemed to take it very hard and at last i sent my wife and her away up to the hotel in the rockies  hettie has persuaded her to stay on here and i expect them home very shortly  but she would be wanted at carnaby said alton  well said forel once more watching him i believe the lawyers wrote for her but she seems to have a horror of the place and hettie dare scarcely mention it to her  ill tell you nothing more until youve had dinner  forel adhered to his resolution and it was more than an hour later when he returned to the subject as they sat cigar in hand on the verandah watching the lights of the vessels blink across the inlet we are going to keep miss deringham as long as we can he said  she has no kinsfolk she thinks much of in england and hettie is very fond of her  did i tell you that thorne called upon her  no said alton with a curious vibration in his voice  well said forel i meant to  no doubt he felt it his duty but hettie seemed to fancy there was something else  still i think she was mistaken because he said goodbye to us when he went away and we heard since that he had sailed for another station  he was a good man said alton gravely  forel glanced at him curiously  women are subject to such fancies and hettie had another once he said  in fact i think she was quite sorry when it apparently came to nothing  alton laughed mirthlessly  wasnt it a trifle foolish of mrs forel miss deringham is a lady of position in the old country and i a bush rancher standing on the brink of ruin and a cripple  of course said forel you know best  still i cant help fancying you are unduly proud of your affliction because it is scarcely perceptible to other people while miss deringham has not a great deal to maintain her position with  you see the death duties are heavy in the old country and from the letters she has shown me deringham appears to have involved the estate considerably during his stewardship  alton laid down his cigar  it seems to me that we are taking a liberty in discussing miss deringhams affairs he said dryly  well said forel with a little smile you have a good deal to tell me  alton nodded  i went back to the mine after damers death he said got there just before sun up and we had our stakes in before hallams men quite realized what we were after  of course there was a circus but we had expected it and fixed things accordingly  hallams men went out and i came down to see the crown people in victoria  two or three of the others however called on the nearest recorders at the same time as me  we came down in the same cars you see  have we any chance at all said forel  alton smiled dryly  i left okanagan and seaforth with enough of the boys to hold the claim sitting tight he said  talked to the chiefs in victoria and showed them damers testimony  they told me that nobody had a patent and that everything that had been done was informal and because they would probably have to submit the case to ottawa it would take time for them to come to a decision  and now for somasco  the new mills finished but it has got to live on the local demand and just now there isnt any  were half through with the desiccatory but as it seems the government will not make us roads the california people with their cheap transport will beat us easily  ive got thirty men chopping out a new trail one could haul a loaded wagon on and dont quite know how to pay them  weve raised a piece of the cannery but for want of dollars dont go on and to put it straight unless that railroad comes in somasco will be busted when the loans come due  well said forel ive some news for you  one of my clients who seems to think a good deal of the future of somasco offers dollars enough to help you considerablyin fact half as much again as you were asking for lately  altons face brightened and then grew clouded again  the other folks have security and as i dont know that we have anything we could offer this one im not sure it would be square he said  the dollars said forel are now in my hands and i fancy that if you will go through the books with me tomorrow we can find something that would figure as security  in fact the lender left me a tolerably wide discretion and would almost as soon i sank the dollars to take a share of the profits as put them out on loan  alton appeared astonished  considering our present credit that is somewhat curious  there it is anyway said forel smiling  there are it seems still people who believe in somasco and you but well see what we can fix up tomorrow  alton stood up and straightened himself to his full height while his voice trembled a little as he said then i think whoever it is is going to save us yet  forel made no answer but he fancied that his client would have been contented had she seen how alton seemed to shake off the grim hopelessness that had been too apparent through all his resolution  it was with a lighter heart that alton went away and having little leisure or inclination for company he did not go back to his friends house until the evening of mrs forels return  the sun had dipped behind the pines when he reached it and forel and his wife sat with alice deringham upon the verandah for which the girl was grateful because the presence of others rendered their conventional greetings easier and she at once shrank from and desired an interview with alton alone  by and by it however happened that forel who may have received a warning from his wife remembered that he had some business to attend to while mrs forel went away as she explained to instruct the chinese cook and alice deringham was left face to face with a task that now appeared almost impossible  she could not commence it directly  and now i want you to tell me all about somasco she said  alton leaned with his back against a pillar looking down on her and the girl who lay in a long chair wished that she had chosen a position where the light did not fall so directly upon her  that was in one respect curious because she had taken considerable pains with her toilet and knew that the sweeping lines of the long black dress became her  its sombreness also emphasized the ivory whiteness of her neck and hands while the pallor and weariness of her face awoke a tenderness that was far more than pity in the man  he caught the glint of the lustrous redgold hair as she moved her head a trifle and then turned his eyes away with a little restless movement that did not escape his companion  we may hold the mine after all he said  yes said alice deringham with an evident eagerness which puzzled him  that is very good news  and your other difficulties  you see i made mr forel talk about them occasionally  the interest that this implied was not lost upon the man but he glanced away again  they are less than they were he said gravely  still i dont know that you would care to hear about these things  that is not very friendly said alice deringham with a little smile  alton glanced down at her in swift surprise and then his face became a mask again  well he said slowly when i think we would have been beaten without it somebody lent us enough dollars to carry us through it sounds very simple but it has made a new man of me  to have dragged down all the men who trusted me would have hurt me horribly  and this loan or whatever it is will prevent that happening  it was opportune  yes and a little glow came into altons eyes  it was very opportune  you were not so laconic at the ranch said the girl who smiled at him  once upon a time you would tell me all about your plans  the man seemed to quiver as he met her gaze and then slowly straightened himself  i have been taught a good deal since then and know what an egotistical fool i was he said  still this loan makes too great a difference to me to be expressed in words  you can scarcely understandi think no woman couldwhat it is to feel utterly beaten  still said alice deringham with a little flash in her eyes i dont think you ever quite felt that and now you will have everything you hoped for again  altons fingers closed suddenly as he looked down on the gleaming hair and whiteness of the neck beneath it for the girls face had been turned from him  no he said slowly  i wanted so much you see  and yet you once seemed to think there was nothing impossible to the man who was resolute enoughand i fancied you were right said the girl  still the things one used to admire occasionally lose their value  she glanced at him a moment and was afraid to look again  the mans face was very grim but she had seen what was in his eyes and waited almost breathless until he stooped and laid his hand upon her shoulder  will you look up and tell me that again he said  alice deringham was never quite sure whether she looked up or not but she felt her cheeks glowing and the mans hand tighten on her shoulder ii cant she said  perhaps her voice betrayed her for alton had evidently flung restraint to the winds  then he said with the quietness which she knew was most often a mask for his vehemence i have something to tell you  it cost alice deringham an effort she remembered all her life but she shook off his grasp and stopped him with a little imperious gesture no she said you must listen  go back to the rail  alton stood a moment irresolute the veins on his forehead swollen and passion in his eyes  then he stretched out his hand with a little laugh and miss deringham knew that unless she used all her strength that tale would never be told  she rose up and stood looking at him very statuesque and cold now in the long trailing dress  alton let his hand drop and bent his head  i am only a bushman and i am sorry he said  now you will sit down again  it was evident that he had put a stern restraint upon himself but the girl knew that he would listen  i have a confession to make she said quietly  you will remember the sale of townsheads ranch but you do not know i kept back the message miss townshead sent you  alton laughed a little  nothing would convince me of it  the man who should have brought it was not sober  he told me himself  alice deringham had not anticipated this and the mans unwavering faith in her was worse to bear than his anger would have been  still the message was plain and i remembered it she said  alton made a little gesture of impatience  no he said resolutely you did not and if you had done you would have had a reason that would have made it right  the girl sat silent a few moments her thoughts in confusion almost angry with the man for his loyalty  but there is more  you were going back into the ranges to relocate the mineand i knew that it would cost you a great deal when i sent the note that stopped you  the bronze faded suddenly in the mans face and there was a dew upon his forehead while the girl felt very faint and cold as she realized how he would feel the blow  yet she could not spare either herself or him and she struck while she had the courage left  i knew you would risk everything if i asked you to and that was why i sent the note  i wanted to hurt you  altons hand tightened upon the balustrade and then turning slowly he paced along the verandah while alice deringham choked back a sob as she noticed that now his steps were uneven  she had accomplished the task that was laid upon her and it only remained for her to keep silence and hide her suffering  in another moment he would descend the verandah stairway and she would never see him again  alton however went past the stairway as though he did not see it moving clumsily with a limp that pained the girl more than his face had done  then he turned and she felt her heart beat faster for there was a change in him when he came back again  he stopped and stood still close by her  you must try to forgive mebut it hurt he said  alice deringham turned her face away from him and for a moment wonder almost drove all other emotion out of her  ii dont understand  it was i who did that horrible thing  then said alton very gravely you were driven to it  my dear you could of your own will do no wrong  again his great faith in her brought the blood to the white face of the girl and her humiliation almost overwhelmed her  still she was determined that he should know all and she struck again  no she said with a cold incisiveness though her voice was faint and strained  i did it because i hated youand longed for any means of punishing you  alton seemed to shiver but his eyes were fixed on her steadily and next moment he had laid his hand upon her shoulder and forced her to look up at him  then we will forget it together he said  there was a mistake somewherefor i do not think you could have hated me  alice deringham made a last struggle it was a very bitter one for she realized the allsufficiency of the love that would believe no evil it is impossible and it will always be she said  will you not see what i am and how very different that is from what you think of me  alton smiled gravely  my dear i want you as you are  how could it make a difference whether you had done right or wrongand i shall still hold you blameless when i know everything  passion was once more kindling in his eyes and alice deringham who saw it rose stiffly upright holding on to her last strength  her face was very weary but there was something in her eyes which restrained the man  i can bear no more she said with a downward glance at the long black dress  have you forgotten  you have shown me what a man can rise to harry alton but i will not wrong you further by marrying you now you must say nothing but out of pity for me go away  the appeal was effective for alton bent his head  i am goingbut there is nothing impossible and i will come back he said and moved slowly towards the stairway  alice deringham watched him cross the garden and then the last vestige of the resolution that had sustained her melted and she went very wearily into the house where as it happened mrs forel was waiting for her  the elder lady asked no questions for she saw her face but drew the girl very gently down beside her  i am sorry my dear she said  alice deringham let her head sink down upon her companions shoulder and sobbed aloud  there can be very few men like harry alton she said disjointedly and because i could not abuse his goodness i sent him away     chapter xxxiv  the consummation  it was hot outside in the noisy streets but the somasco consolidated offices were quiet and cool when alton entertained two of his friends there one afternoon  there is no special sanctity attached to a place of business in the west and nobody who knew alton would have been astonished to find plates of fruit upon the papers which littered his table and a spirit lamp burning on the big empty stove  a very winsome young lady also sat in a loungechair and forel close by glanced at her with a most unbusinesslike twinkle in his eyes seaforth had been married recently and his wife had called in to see so she told alton that he was not working him too hard  you will give mrs charley some tea said alton  your husband madam has been brought up well but there was a time when i had real trouble in teaching him  forel youll find some ice and soda yonder as well as the other things  nellie seaforth laughed a little as she thrust the cup away  no she said i know where that tea comes from and i would sooner have some ice and soda with out the other things  have the strawberries gone up harry  alton nodded  thats a fact and i am very glad he said  you see we are sending out about a ton of them every day and there are none to equal ours in the dominion  still if charley wasnt so lazy hed give you some  cant you find that ice forel  there was a big lump yesterday  that is quite possible said forel dryly but it has gone and it is apparently running out of your plans and estimates now  then you will have to fall back upon hortons tea said alton smiling  nobody knows where he gets it from except that it isnt china but he seems to think its my duty to buy it from him and the rasp of it brings the bush back to me  makes one smell the cedars and see the lake flashing and im very tired of the city  mrs seaforth laughed as she glanced at the bottles forel was pitching out of a box for as yet he had not found one with anything in it  have you a mineral water factory at somasco too she said  not yet said alton gravely  but we may have by and by though some of my partners would have more use for a distillery  were going to have everything that will pay but weve been too busy making roads lately  forel stood up looking a little more thoughtful  you are at any rate running up a confoundedly long bill he said  you will get very few new dresses mrs seaforth unless you make your husband stop him  of course you heard nothing alton from the roads and trails  alton laughed softly  thats where youre wrong  i wrote them wanting to know if they thought it my duty to open up the country for them and i got a letter that the affair is receiving consideration if the bush country members can get the new appropriation through the surveyors going up to look at what weve done  effrontery is the thing that pays said forel  but have you heard from tom  altons face grew a trifle graver  he and more of the boys are sitting on the claim and theres another crowd camped down with stakes ready right in front of him  he tells me he finds it hard to keep his hands off them and id have gone up only that im waiting for the crown folks decision  i think they can only declare the claim open said forel and that being so they couldnt well send you an intimation before they made the fact public  nobody said anything for a little  forel had told them nothing new and they could guess at the suspense alton had been enduring for the decision of the crown authorities meant a good deal to all of them  if the claim were declared open the first man to restake it and get in his papers could take possession  it would be dreadful if harry lost it said mrs seaforth  still i dont think he will  alton laughed a little  i dont mean to if i can help it he said ive had thomson prospecting for the fastest road down and he has found one that is rideable  forel nodded  that reminds he said  hettie wants to get away from the city and i thought of taking her and miss deringham up to somasco you will lend us the house for a week or two  of course said alton  go as soon as its possible  i want a man with a business grip up there  my head will scarcely hold all the things ive been trying to cram into it lately  mrs seaforth glanced at him with a little smile of sympathy for although the somasco affairs looked a little more promising now alton had been doing the work of several men and the strain had told on him she also remembered her husbands sleepless nights  we shall all be glad when the anxiety is over but one cant help thinking that you men have the best of it now and then she said  at least you can workwhile we can only sit still  forel smiled upon her  well he said without reflection there is one woman who has done a good deal for somasco  he saw his blunder next moment for alton rose up suddenly  i would like to hear that again he said  forel was manifestly uncomfortable but he glanced towards mrs seaforth as he said i think charley will back me up  of course said seaforth whose tone however chiefly expressed bewilderment but alton made a little forceful gesture  pshaw he said  youre fooling forel and you would never disclose who your client was that lent us the money  no said forel resolutely  nor do i mean to  sit down again harry and dont get fancying things  alton moved a pace forward with a dark flush in his face  forel he said where did all those dollars come from  forel looked almost abject and in his desperation glanced towards nellie seaforth  i think you had better tell him now she said  you know too said forel  nellie seaforth smiled a little  i think i knew all along she said still charley didnt  he is of course a man  then one of you has got to tell me said alton  nellie seaforth raised her hand with a little imperious gesture  as you know half of it i think you had better hear it all she said well if i had been miss deringham i would have taken that way of giving you back carnaby  it is possible to raise money on an estate in the old country  there was no need of further questions for the answer was written on forels flushed face and alton sat down with his lips firmly set then there was an awkward silence until he spoke again  and i cannot return it  every dollar has been sunk in the mills and roads except what we took up the first loan with  nellie seaforth nodded with a pretty gravity for the bond between them all was stronger than friendship usually is  no she said and i cant help thinking that it is just as well one cannot shirk his responsibilities harry and you are an altonof carnaby  you see nobody could take your inheritance from you nor though you did your best could you give it away and there is i fancy only one meaning to that  fate is too strong for you  you will redeem carnaby again go over there and bewhat you were born to be  altons face was once more flushed and the girl fancied his fingers quivered a little but while he sat silent there was a tapping at the door and an urchin flung a journal into the room  colonist he said and vanished suddenly  forel who appeared glad of the diversion picked up the paper and then stood up  news at last he said excitedly  i fancied we would have had it first but the news agency fellows have beaten us harry its more than probable theyre going to rush the railroad through  altons eyes glittered  great news but it will keep he said  no dont worry over any more of it  look at the notices  forel folded back the sheet  then it rustled in his hand and his voice shook as he read disjointedly vacant crown lands  to all it may concern  mineral claim on left bank headwaters somasco river in unsurveyed territory frontage declared to be  give it to me or get on alton said hoarsely  the paper was shaking visibly  is declared to be on or after 12 pm on the date undermentioned eligible for relocation and forel ended with a little gasp you have lost it harry  alton was on his feet by this time and snatching out his watch  no by the lord he said  ive still rather a better chance than most other men  head straight for the freight traffic man charley and tell him im going up with the fast atlantic freight theyre sending our empty cars back on  forel run across and send in your stenographer  there are lots of things ive got to do and the freight will be going out in an hour or so  nellie seaforth laughed a little  then mr forel will not have time and theres another woman anxious to do a little for somasco  give me a pencil harry and begin right away  alton only flung her a grateful glance and dictated rapidly until seaforth appeared in the doorway flushed with haste when shouting his thanks after him he ran down the stairway  nellie seaforth laughed a little  good fortune go with him  that is altonof somasco she said  i wonder whether he will remember to put on his hat  i dont think its likely said her husband  nellie i cant help wondering if you were right just now  mrs seaforth smiled at him curiously  it was right i did she said possibly the distinction is too fine for you but i think the future will justify me  then she drew off her gloves and endeavoured to remember only that she had been considered a capable business lady  forel went up to somasco next day and one afternoon sat with his wife and miss deringham upon the verandah of hortons hotel  horton himself was pacing up and down and a group of bronzed bush ranchers stood in the dust below  they spoke more rapidly than was usual with them their movements were curiously restless for impassive men and their eyes were fixed upon the shadowy trail that led down the valley beneath the sombre pines  the afternoon was still and a drowsy resinous fragrance hung heavily about the hotel  there was no sound but the low voices and the murmur of sliding water in the distance  alice deringham was pale and very quiet though there was an intentness in her eyes and when horton stopped close by her she looked at him  they have heard nothing yet she said  no said the storekeeper  still some of them should have been here by now  the little nervous tremor in his voice did not escape the girl and though it had all been explained to her before she said then you expect more than mr alton  well said horton who seemed glad to find an outlet in speech i dont quite know  you see there was a man brought a wire in before harry got through and once the claim was posted vacant anybody could stake it  theres a holy crowd of jumpers hanging round the mine and because thered be such a circus nobody could be sure whod got his pegs in first the crown people would probably listen to the man who got through and recorded  oh yes theyll be pounding down the trail as if the devil was after them now but theres none of them got the relays of horses weve fixed up for harry  horton moved away and the girl sat still listening while mrs forel stirred nervously and her husband apparently found it necessary to light his cigar again every now and then  the voices had died away and there was no sound but the faint song of water and the patter of restless feet  how long the silence continued alice deringham did not know but a quiver went through her as a hoarse shout rose up theyre coming  then there was silence again and she watched a bronzed man rubbing down a great black horse whose blood had not come from a cayuse pedigree until a faint drumming grew louder down the trail  it swelled into a sharp staccato and the murmurs commenced again  two of them another man behind  riding like brimstone  can you see them yet  the drumming sound sank and rose again in a confused roar as the horsemen crossed a wooden bridge while alice deringham stood up when once more the voices rose stridently  one of the jumpers first  harrys coming along behind  cayuse played out  lord how theyre riding  then lips were set tight and steady eyes blazed as a man grimed with sweat and dust who reeled in his saddle swept out from the forest on a jaded horse  most of those who watched him had a heavy stake in that race for it was with altons prosperity they must stand or fall but the bushmans code of honour is as high as it is simple and they sprang aside to give the rider a free passage  the man blinked at them in a curious dazed fashion as he rode on the dust whirling behind him and the lather dripping tinged with red from the horses whitened sides  still the drumming behind grew louder and he had scarcely sunk into the shadows when alton stripped to shirt and trousers rode in  he too swayed in the saddle and his face was foul with dust but it was firmly set and there was a glint in his eyes while as he swept out of the shadow of the pines two men led the horse out into the trail  he reined his beast in upon its haunches swung himself down thrust aside the pitcher somebody tendered him and with a swing that rent the white shirt was once more in the saddle  then there was a scattering of the crowd and a shouting broke out  youll have him in a league harry  another horse ready at thomsons ranch  alice deringham held her breath as while a third beat of hoofs grew louder behind alton gathered up the bridle and drove his heels home the horse frightened by the clamour reared almost upright and then backed across the trail while the girl wondered with a tense anxiety whether the man would look up  then for just a second he turned his head and saw her standing on the verandah with a blaze in her cheeks and a dimness in her eyes  off with you harry and remember youre riding for all of us and somasco cried somebody  illustration  remember youre riding for all of us and somasco cried somebody  alton had the beasts head up the trail now but as he sent his heels home he swung up his right hand and the girl smiled down on him bravely out of misty eyes  and for carnaby he cried  i cant be beaten  then the horse shot forward and he was away his torn shirt fluttering as the wind rushed past while alice deringham hastened to the end of the verandah with forel to see the last of him just as another man rode in at a floundering gallop  the trail led straight beneath the pines and her heart throbbed painfully while she watched the second rider closing with the one in front of him until the two figures became blurred before her eyes and she turned suddenly cold  hes fouling him cried somebody and a roar of execrations went up both of them for the same company  the condemned jumpers right across the trail  there was silence once more and the two objects seemed to rush together then another roar went up  down  oh yes the jumpers down  harry rode straight into himthe fool might have known his horse was blown  the other ones used up somascos leading clear again  alice deringham was trembling visibly and knew that mrs forels eyes were upon her but that did not seem to count at all  she could see a figure standing over a fallen horse up the trail while another that had already left it far behind was sinking into the shadow of the pines  the jumper was beaten but alton was riding stillfor somasco and carnabywith a fresh horse beneath him  then she turned to mrs forel with a softness in her eyes which somewhat astonished the elder lady  i should like to go back to somasco now she said  i am a little tired and i know that he will win  a wagon was awaiting them and forel several times came near overturning it in his excitement as he drove them home to the ranch  it was a week later when one evening the leading inhabitants of the district assembled in somasco ranch  those who were married had brought their wives with them and the cook and mrs margery had toiled since morning to set out the table in a fashion befitting the occasion for the chief roads and trails surveyor and a member of the provincial government were to be entertained that evening  the sombre green of cedarsprays relieved the redveined panelling there were flowers and early fruits upon the table and the fragrance of the firs came in through the open windows while when the bronzed men filed in there was expectancy in their steady eyes  several of them had ridden here and there with the surveyor all that day and he had expressed grave approval of all they had shown him  once too he appeared a trifle astonished when pointed out the new road they had driven under altons guidance along the mountain side  it would reduce the distance to the settlement several miles but it had cost many dollars and weeks of perilous toil while the surveyor had only stated that it was well done and the men of somasco had as yet no answer to the important question whether the government would complete what remained unfinished or in any way recompense them  supper was served with as much ceremony as was possible at somasco but the meal was a somewhat silent one  the ranchers were a trifle anxious while the surveyor spoke most to alice deringham who sat next him near the head of the table and the member of the government divided his observations between the wife of a big axeman and mrs forel  all of those present knew that events of great importance to them were happening in the city but save for a brief telegram from alton stating that he had been allowed to record the mine and would return in a day or two they had no authentic news  it was almost a relief when the meal was over and there was a sudden hush of attention as the surveyor rose up  every eye was turned upon the gravefaced gentleman at the head of the table  i have spent a good many years building roads and bridges in various parts of the dominion and have never seen better work than you have shown me today he said  now i dont quite know if you expected me to talk business on this occasion but im going out early tomorrow and i fancy your good ladies are as anxious as you are about the welfare of somasco  a woman with hard brown hands turned in her chair  oh yes she said  we are that anyway and because were most of us working twelve hours every day just for the right to live weve sent out our men to make the roads that are to bring the dollars that will make things easier in  the government dont help us were doing the work ourselves and well go out too with the drill and shovel if the men are beaten  there was a deprecatory murmur that had yet in it grim approval and the surveyor smiled a little  that i think is the spirit which is going to make this province the greatest in the dominion he said  well i may tell you that i was sent up here with a tolerably wide discretion and after seeing the rock cutting by the lake im going to use it now  nothing better has been done in the province and the man who planned it for you had courage as well as genius  it is a most daring and successful piece of engineering  a little flush crept into the bronzed faces and mrs forel noticed the brightness in alice deringhams eyes for the man who had spoken was a famous engineer  well he said gravely we are going to take over that roadas from the beginningand finish it for you  that is you will be paid by the province for every day you spent upon it and i leave it to the man who commenced it to see the work through  his pay orders will be honoured and i should very much like to see and compliment him  a murmur ran along the table for the government pay is good and a roadmaking grant a coveted boon in each lonely valley whose inhabitants are usually glad to keep the work in their own hands  boys said somebody this is what comes of trusting harry  it was a simple speech but the second murmur which followed it and the confidence in the bronzed faces stirred alice deringham  she had been taught a little about these silent men and knew the value of their testimony  the surveyor sat down and the member stood up  i can add a little gentlemen he said  roads are always useful and well give you a good one and if my word goes far enough a grant to cut across trails with and improve your bridges but youre going to have a better one than any you can build  he stopped a moment and there was not a sound in the room  the men sat still as statues the women drew in their breath and the song of the river came in through the windows in slow pulsations  every eye was on the speaker and now and then a hard brown hand quivered a little but in the midst of their suspense there was no man weak enough to ask a premature question  the surveyor smiled a little  gentlemen he said slowly you have all heard conflicting rumours but i have had a message and you can take it as a fact that you will have the steel road very shortly  this time there was a roar that shook the rafters and a rattle of flungback chairs as the men rose to their feet  they had toiled and hoped for this holding on with grim endurance when hope had almost gone and now all that they had looked for was to be given them  there was no man present who did not know that his ranch was worth treble what it had been a few days ago or woman who could not see that henceforward there need be no more ceaseless drudgery  one indeed laughed inanely clasping her hardened hands and a dimness crept into eyes more than one pair of eyes from which the care that had long lurked there had vanished suddenly  then a man swung up a brimming glass  boys he said a trifle hoarsely its only cider this time but you can drink what im going to give you in champagne when the railroads through  heres the man who stood right with us through everything the man who beat off hallam and brought the railroad in  there was a jingle of glasses and the surveyor and the member stood up with the rest while for the men had let themselves go at last a great shout rang out harry alton alton of somasco  then there was silence and while the men stood with flushed faces too stirred as yet to remember that they had done an unusual thing seaforth who had come up on some business from vancouver with his wife moved out a little from the rest  boys he said and his voice shook a little i would have tried to thank you on behalf of the best comrade you or i ever had only that i fancy he will be here in a minute to answer for himself  he stopped abruptly and through the silence that followed all heard a drumming that might have been made by the hoofs of a galloping horse and mrs forel wondered as she glanced at the girl opposite her across the table  alice deringham had like the rest been stirred out of her reticence and now she seemed almost transfigured with the warm flush in her cheeks and the pride discernible through the softness in her eyes  the beat of hoofs stopped presently and a man came hastily through the verandah  alice deringham could not see him but the flush in her cheeks grew deeper for she knew that slightly uneven step  then there was a move towards the door and she sat almost alone at the head of the table knowing that somebody was shouldering his way through those who thronged about him in her direction  still she could not look until a man dropped into the vacant chair beside her  then she saw that alton was glancing down at her with a question in his face  you are pleased that we have won he said  yes said the girl who felt that speech had its limits  i knew you would  alton seemed to sigh with a great contentment  then he said quietly if it was only to hear that i would begin it all again  he had no opportunity for further speech  there were questions to be asked and answers given while it was some hours later and most of the guests had departed when he found alice deringham alone upon the verandah  the moon hung over the cedars on a black hillside the lake flung back its radiance steelily and the stillness was made musical by the sound of falling water  alton had come out from the presence of the surveyor with a glint of triumph in his eyes  there is only one thing wanting to make this the greatest day of my life but without it all the rest counts for nothing  you know what it is he said  yes said alice deringham simply  but why did you not ask for it earlier harry  it would have saved one of us so much  alton laughed a little and glanced down at his knee  well i fanciedbut pshaw i was a fool said he  yes said alice deringham  i think you werefor i was only sorry then  andafter all that has happenedare you not foolish still  i am not the woman you fancy i am harry and you know how i have wronged you  you are the one i want said alton gravely  and i know who it was gave all she had to help me when i was beaten  alice deringham still drew back from him  it was your own and you do not quite know all yet she said  i am a penniless girl  alton laughed exultantly as he stooped and caught her wrist  all that i want the most you give and when you sent me away i knew it was mine he said  but somasco and the silver up yonder is mine too and that when we have redeemed carnaby will be quite enough for two  alice deringham made no further resistance but glanced up into his eyes as he drew her to him and then felt his arm close round her with a great contentment  it was half an hour later when she met nellie seaforth in a corridor and the latter stretched her hands out impulsively and kissed her  you need not tell me and i am very glad she said  of course you will be happy  he is a good man  alice deringham coloured in a fashion nellie seaforth had not believed her capable of and there was a depth of grave tenderness in her eyes  yes she said simply  and because of his goodness i must try to be a better woman  she passed on and nellie seaforth who found her husband smiled at him  it has all come right and i dont think harry will be sorry though he might have been had it happened earlier she said  that strikes me as a little mixed said seaforth dryly  mrs seaforth shook her head at him  no  its quite plain she said  i think miss deringham has been taught a good deal and whatever she may have been she will only be lovable as mrs alton  seaforth smiled gravely  now i understandfellowfeeling prompts me to and of course you
