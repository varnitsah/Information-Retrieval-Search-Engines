campaign  the posting of the five armies this winterfive of them in germany not counting the russians who have vanished to cimmeria over the horizon for their months of restis something wonderful and strikes the picturesque imagination such a chain of posts for length if for nothing else from the centre of bohemia eastward dauns austrians are spread all round the western silesian border and the southeastern saxon waited on by prussians in more or less proximity next are the reichsfolk scattered over thuringen and the franconian countries fronting partly into hessen and duke ferdinands outskirtsthe main body of duke ferdinand is far to westward in munster country vigilant upon contades with the rhine between contades and soubiseadjoining on the reichsfolk are these two french armies soubises some 25000 in frankfurtems country between the mayn and the lahn with its back to the rhine then contades onward to maes river and the dutch borders with his face to the rhineand duke ferdinand observant of him on the other side that is the cordon of posts or winterquarters this year from the giant mountains and the metal mountains to the oceanto the mouth of rhine may we not say and back again to the swiss alps or springs of rhine that upperrhine country being all either french or austrian and a basis for soubise archenholtz i 306 not to speak of ocean itself and its winged warfleets lonesomely hovering and patrolling or of the americas and indies beyond  this is such a chain of mutually vigilant winterquarters says archenholtz as was never drawn in germany or in europe before chain of about 300000 fighting men poured out in that lengthy manner taking their winter siesta there asleep with one eye open till reinforced for new business of death and destruction against spring pathetic surely as well as picturesque three campaigns there have already been sighs the peaceable observer three campaigns surely furious enough eleven battles in them stenzel v 185 this i

rossbachmust there still be others then to the misery of poor mankind thus sigh many peaceful persons not considering what are and have been the rages the iniquities the loud and silent deliriums the mad blindnesses and sins of mankind and what amount of calcining these may reasonably take not calcinable in three campaigns at all it would appear four more campaigns are needed then there will be innocuous ashes in quantity and a result unexpected and worth marking in worldhistory  it is notably one of friedrichs fond hopesof which he keeps up several as bright cloudhangings in the haggard inner world he now hasthat peace is just at hand one right struggle more and peace must come and on the part of britannic george and him repeated attempts were madeone in the end of this year 1759but one and all of them proved futile and unless for accidental reasons need not be mentioned here many men in all nations long for peace but there are three women at the top of the world who do not their wrath various in quality is great in quantity and disasters do the reverse of appeasing it  the french people as is natural are weary of a war which yields them mere losses and disgraces war carried on for austrian whims which likewise seem to be impracticable think they and their bernis himself minister of foreign affairs who began this sad frenchaustrian adventure has already been remonstrating with kaunitz and grumbling anxiously could not the swedes or somebody be got to mediate such a war is too ruinous hearing which the pompadour is shocked at the favorite creature of her hands hastens to dismiss him be cardinal then you ingrate of a bernis disappear under that red hatand appoints in his stead one choiseul known hitherto as stainville comte de stainville french excellency at vienna but now made duke on this promotion duc de choiseul minister of foreign affairs 11th november 1758 barbier iv 294 who is a lorrainer or semiaustrian by very birth and probably much fitter for the place a swift impetuous kind of man this choiseul who is still rather young than otherwise plenty of proud spirit in him of shifts talent of the reckless sort who proved very notable in france for the next twenty years  french trade being ruined withal money is running dreadfully low but they appoint a new controllergeneral a m de silhouette who is thought to have an extraordinary creative genius in finance had he but a fortunatuspurse how lucky were it with fortunatus silhouette as purseholder with a fiery young choiseul on this hand and a fiery old belleisle on that pompadour meditates great things this yearinvasions of england stronger german armies better german plans and slashings home upon hanover itself or the vital pointand flatters herself and her poor louis that there is on the anvil for 1759 such a french campaign as will perhaps astonish pitt and another insolent king very fixed fell and feminine is the pompadours humor in this matter nor is the czarinas less so but more if possible unappeasable except by death imperial maria theresa has masculine reasons withal great hopes too of late of the wars ending till flat impossibility stop it there is no likelihood  to pitt this campaign 1759 in spite of bad omens at the outset proved altogether splendid but greatly the reverse on friedrichs side to whom it was the most disastrous and unfortunate he had yet made or did ever make pitt at his zenith in public reputation friedrich never so low before nothing seemingly but extinction near ahead when this year ended the truth is apart from his specific pieces of illluck there had now begun for friedrich a new rule of procedure which much altered his appearance in the world thrice over had he tried by the aggressive or invasive method thrice over made a plunge at the enemys heart hoping so to disarm or lame him but that with resources spent to such a degree is what he cannot do a fourth time he is too weak henceforth to think of that  prussia has always its king and his unrivalled talent but that is pretty much the only fixed item prussia versus france austria russia sweden and the german reich what is it as a field of supplies for war except its king these are failing year by year and at a rate fatally swift in comparison friedrich cannot now do leuthens rossbachs farshining feats of victory which astonish all the world his fine prussian veterans have mostly perished and have been replaced by new levies and recruits who are inferior both in discipline and native qualitythough they have still people say a noteworthy taste of the old prussian sort in them and do in fact fight well to the last but it is observable says retzow somewhere and indeed it follows from the nature of the case that while the prussian army presents always its best kind of soldiers at the beginning of a war austria such are its resources in population always improves in that particular and its best troops appear in the last campaigns in a word friedrich stands on the defensive henceforth disputing his ground inch by inch and is reduced more and more to battle obscurely with a hydracoil of enemies and impediments and to do heroisms which make no noise in the gazettes and alas which cannot figure in history eitherwhat is more a sorrow to me here  friedrich say all judges of soldiership and human character who have studied friedrich sufficiently is greater than ever in these four years now coming berenhorst in kriegskunst retzow c and this i have found more and more to be a true thing verifiable and demonstrable in time and placethough unluckily for us hardly in this time or this place at all a thing which cannot by any method be made manifest to the general reader who delights in shining summary feats and is impatient of tedious preliminaries and investigationsespecially of maps which are the indispensablest requisite of all a thing in short that belongs peculiarly to soldierstudents who can undergo the dull preliminaries most dull but most inexorably needed and can follow out with watchful intelligence and with a patience not to be wearied the multifarious topographies details of movements and manoeuvrings year after year on such a theatre of war what is to be done with it here if we could by significant strokes indicate under features true so far as they went the great wide fireflood that was raging round the world if we could carefully omitting very many things omit of the things intelligible and decipherable that concern friedrich himself nothing that had meaning if indeed but it is idle preluding forward again brave reader under such conditions as there are  friedrichs winter in breslau was of secluded silent sombre character this time nothing of stir in it but from work only in marked contrast with the last and its kindly visitors and gayeties a friedrich given up to his manifold businesses to his silent sorrows i have passed my winter like a carthusian monk he writes to dargens i dine alone i spend my life in reading and writing and i do not sup when one is sad it becomes at last too burdensome to hide ones grief continually and it is better to give way to it by oneself than to carry ones gloom into society nothing solaces me but the vigorous application required in steady and continuous labor this distraction does force one to put away painful ideas while it lasts but alas no sooner is the work done than these fatal companions present themselves again as if livelier than ever maupertuis was right the sum of evil does certainly surpass that of goodbut to me it is all one i have almost nothing more to lose and my few remaining days what matters it much of what complexion they be breslau 1st march 1759 to dargens oeuvres de frederic xix 56  the loss of his wilhelmina had there been no other grief has darkened all his life to friedrich readers are not prepared for the details of grief we could give and the settled gloom of mind they indicate a loss irreparable and immeasurable the light of life the one loved heart that loved him gone his passionate appeals to voltaire to celebrate for him in verse his lost treasure and at least make her virtues immortal are perhaps known to readers

friedrich too well feels it such all winter he dwells internally on the sad matter though soon falling silent on it to others  the war is ever more dark and dismal to him a wearing harassing nearly disgusting task on which however depends life or death this year he expects to have 300000 enemies upon him and is with his utmost effort getting up 150000 to set against them of business in its many kinds there can be no lack in the intervals he also wrote considerably one of his pieces is a sermon on the last judgment handed to reader de catt one eveningto de catts surprise and to ours the

with excellent insight brevity modesty is on tactics reflexions sur la tactique in oeuvres de frederic xxviii 153166properly it might be called serious very private thoughts thrown on paper and communicated only to two or three on the new kind of tactics necessary with those austrians and their allies who are in such overwhelming strength to whose continual sluggishness and strange want of concert to whose incoherency of movements languor of execution and other enormous faults we have owed with some excuse for our own faults our escaping of destruction hithertobut had better not trust that way any longer fouquet is one of the highly select to whom he communicates this piece adding along with it in fouquets case an affectionate little note and in spite of poverty some newyears gift

december 1758 with fouquets answer 2d january 1759 in oeuvres de frederic xx 114117 fouquet much admires the new tactical suggestionsseems to think however that the certainly practicable one is in particular the last that of improving our artillery to some equality with theirs for which as may appear the king has already been taking thought in more ways than one  finance is naturally a heavy part of friedrichs problem the part which looks especially impossible from our point of vision in friedrichs country the war budget does not differ from the peace one neither is any borrowing possible that sublime art of rolling over on you know not whom the expenditure needful or needless of your heavyladen self had not yetthough england is busy at itbeen invented among nations once or perhaps twice from the stande of some willing province friedrich negotiated some small loan which was punctually repaid when peace came and was always gratefully remembered but these are as nothing in face of such expenses and the thought how he did contrive on the finance side is and was not a little wonderful an ingenious predecessor whom i sometimes quote has expressed himself in these words  such modicum of subsidy he is speaking of the english subsidy in 1758 how useful will it prove in a country bred everywhere to spartan thrift accustomed to regard waste as sin and which will lay out no penny except to purpose i guess the prussian exchequer is by this time much on the ebb idle precious metals tending everywhere towards the meltingpot at what precise date the friedrichwilhelm balustrades and enormous silver furnitures were first gone into dryasdust has not informed me but we know they all went as they well might to me nothing is so wonderful as friedrichs budget during this war one day it will be carefully investigated elucidated and made conceivable and certain to mankind but that as yet is far from being the case we walk about in it with astonishment almost were it possible with incredulity expenditure on this side work done on that human nature especially british human nature refuses to conceive it never in this world before or since was the like the friedrich miracles in war are great but those in finance are almost greater let dryasdust bethink him and gird his flabby loins to this enterprise which is very behooveful in these californian times  the general secret of prussian thrift i do fear is lost from the world and how an army of about 200000 in field and garrison could be kept on foot and in some ability to front combined europe on about three million sterling annually 25 million thalers3150000 pounds that is the steady warbudget of those years remains to us inconceivable enoughmournfully miraculous as it were and growing ever more so in the nuggetgenerations that now run meanwhile here are what hints i could find on the origins of that modest sum which also are a wonder preuss ii 388392 stenzel v 137141  the hoarded prussian moneys or treasures two of them kleine schatz grosse schatz which are rigidly saved in peace years for incidence of war being nearly run out there had come the english subsidy this with saxony and the home revenues and remnants of schatz had sufficed for 1758 but will no longer suffice next to saxony the english subsidy 670000 pounds due the second time this year was always friedrichs principal resource and in the latter years of the war i observe it was nearly twice the amount of what all his prussian countries together in their ravaged and wornout state could yield him in and after 1759 besides home income which is gradually diminishing and english subsidy which is a steady quantity friedrichs sources of revenue are mainly two  first there is that of wringing money from your enemies from those that have deserved ill of yousuch of them as you can come at enemies open or secret even illwishers we are not particular provided only they lie within armslength under this head fall principally three countries and their three poor populations in lieu of their governments saxony mecklenburg or the main part of it mecklenburgschwerin and anhalt from these three there is a continual forced supply of money and furnishings their demerits to friedrich differ much in intensity nor is his wringing of themwhich in the cases of mecklenburg and saxony increases year by year to the nearly intolerable pitchquite in the simple ratio of their demerits but in a compound ratio of that and of his indignation and of his wants  saxony as prime author of this war was from the first laid hold of collared tightly pay the shot then what you can in the end it was almost what you cannot as to mecklenburgschwerin the grudge against prussia was of very old standing some generations now and the present duke not a very wise sovereign more than his ancestors had always been ill with friedrich willing to spite and hurt him when possible in reichs diet he of all german princes was the first that voted for friedrichs being put to ban of the reichhe and his poor people know since whether that was a wise step the little anhalt princes too all the anhalts dessau bernburg cothen zerbst perhaps the latter partially excepted for a certain russian ladys sake had voted or at least had ambiguously halfvoted in favor of the ban and done other unfriendly things and had now to pay dear for their bits of enmities poor souls they had but one vote among them all fourand they only half gave it tremulously pulling it back again i should guess it was their terrors mainly and overreadiness to reckon friedrich a sinking ship and to leap from the deck of himwith a spurn which he took for insolent the anhaltdessauers particularly who were once of his very army half prussians for generations back he reckoned to have used him scandalously ill  this year the requisition on the four anhaltswhich they submit to patiently as people who have leapt into the wrong shipis in precise tale of money 330000 thalers about 50000 pounds recruits 2200 horses 1800 in saxony besides the fixed taxes strict confiscation of meissen potteries and every royalty there were exacted heavy contributions more and more heavy from the few opulent towns chiefly from leipzig which were wrung out latterly under great severitieschief merchants of leipzig all clapt in prison kept on breadandwater till they yieldedas great severities as would suffice but not greater which also was noted unfortunate chief merchants of leipzigwith bruhl and polish majesty little likely to indemnify them unfortunate country altogether an intelligent saxon who is vouched for as impartial bears witness as follows and this i know that the oppressions and plunderings of the austrians and reichsfolk in saxony turned all hearts away from them and it was publicly said we had rather bear the steady burden of the prussians than such help as these our pretended deliverers bring stenzel citing from kriegskanzlei which i have not v 137 n whereby on the whole the poor country got its back broken and could never look up in the world since resource first was abundantly severe  resource second is strangest of alland has given rise to criticism enough it is no other than that of issuing base money mixing your gold and silver coin with copperthis one grieves to say is the second and extreme resource a rude methodwould we had a betterof suspending cashpayments and paying by banknotes instead thinks friedrich i suppose from his prussian mints from his saxon which are his for the present and from the little anhaltbernburg mint of which he expressly purchased the sad privilegefor we are not a coiner we are a king reduced to suspend cashpayments for the time being friedrich poured out over all germany in all manner of kinds huge quantities of bad coin this so long as it would last is more and more a copious fountain of supply this for the first time has had to appear as an item in warbudget 1759 and it fails in no following but expands more and more it was done through ephraim the not lovely berlin jew whom we used to hear of in voltaires timethrough ephraim and two others ephraim as president in return for a net sum these shall have privilege to coin such and such amounts so and so alloyed shall pay to general tauentzien army treasurer at fixed terms the sums specified go and do it our mintofficers sharply watching you mintofficers and general tauentzien with a young herr lessing as his chief clerk of whom the king knows nothing go ye unlovely and ephraim and company are making a great deal of money by the unlovely job ephraim is the pair of tongs the hand and the unlovely job are a royal mans alas yes and none of us knows better than king friedrich perhaps few of us as well how little lovely a job it was how shockingly unkingly it wasthough a practice not unknown to german kings and kinglets before his time and since down almost to ours in stenzel v 141 enumeration of eight or nine unhappy potentates who were busy with it in those same years in fact these are all unkingly practicesand the english subsidy itself is distasteful to a proud friedrich but what in those circumstances can any friedrich do  the first coinages of ephraim had it seems in them about 37ths of copper something less than the half and more than the thirdyour gold sovereign grown to be worth 28s 6d but yearly it grew worse and in 1762 english subsidy having failed matters had got inverted and there was three times as much copper as silver commerce as was natural went rocking and tossing as on a sea under earthquakes but there was always ready money among friedrichs soldiers as among no other nor did the common people or retail purchasers suffer by it hah an ephraimite they would say grinning not illhumoredly at sight of one of these pieces some of which they had more specifically named bluegowns owing to a tint of blue perceivable in spite of the industrious plating in real silver or at least boiling in some solution of it these they would salute with this rhyme then current       von aussen schon van innen schlimm       von aussen friedrich von innen ephraim       outside noble inside slim       outside friedrich inside ephraim  by this time whatever of money from any source can be scraped together in friedrichs world flows wholly into the armychest as the real citadel of life in these latter years of the war beginning i could guess from 1759 all civil expenditures and wages of officials cease to be paid in money nobody of that kind sees the color even of bad coin but is paid only in paper assignments in promises to pay after the peace these paper documents made no pretence to the rank of currency such holders of them as had money or friends and could wait got punctual payment when the term did arrive but those that could not suffered greatly having to negotiate their debentures on ruinous termssometimes at an expense of threefourthsi will add friedrichs practical schedule of amounts from all these various sources and what friedrichs own view of the sources was when he could survey them from the safe distance  schedule of amounts say for 1761 to make up the twentyfive million thalers necessary for the army there are       from our prussian countries ruined harried as thalers       they have been 4 millions only       from saxony and the other wringings  7 millions       english subsidy 4 of good gold becoppered       into double 8        from ephraim and his farm of the mint       munzpatent  7   in sum twentysix millions leaving you one million of marginand always a plenty of cash in hand for incidental sundries preuss ii 388  friedrichs own view of these sad matters as he closes his history of the sevenyears war at berlin 17th december 1763 is in these words may heaven grantif heaven deign to look down on the paltry concerns of menthat the unalterable and flourishing destiny of this country preserve the sovereigns who shall govern it from the scourges and calamities which prussia has suffered in these times of trouble and subversion that they may never again be forced to recur to the violent and fatal remedies which we lon have been obliged to employ in maintenance of the state against the ambitious hatred of the sovereigns of europe who wished to annihilate the house of brandenburg and exterminate from the world whatever bore the prussian name oeuvres de frederic v 234     of the smallwar in spring 1759 there are five disruptions of that grand cordon februaryapril and ferdinand of brunswick fights his battle of bergen april 13th  friedrich being denied an aggressive course this year by no means sits idly expectant and defensive in the interim but all the more vigorously as is observable from february onwards strikes out from him on every side endeavoring to spoil the enemys magazines and cripple his operations in that way so that there was all winter through a good deal of smallwar some of it not small of more importance than usualchiefly of friedrichs originating with the above view or of ferdinand his allys on a still more pressing score and on the whole that immense austrianfrench cordon which goes from the carpathians to the ocean had by no means a quiet time but was broken into and violently hurled back in different parts some four or even five attacks upon it in all three of them by prince henriin two of which duke ferdinands people cooperated the business being for mutual behoof these latter three were famous in the world that winter and indeed are still recognizable as brilliant procedures of their kind though except dates and results we can afford almost nothing of them here these three intended chiefly against reichs people and their posts and magazines fell out on the western and middle part of the cordon another attack was in the extreme eastward and was for friedrichs own behoof under fouquets managementintended against the austrianmoravian magazines and preparations but had little success still another assault or invasive outroad northward against the russian magazines there also was of which by and by besides all which and more memorable than all duke ferdinand for vital reasons of his own fought a battle this spring considerable battle and did not gain it which made great noise in the world  it is not necessary the reader should load his memory with details of all these preliminary things on the contrary it is necessary that he keep his memory clear for the far more important things that lie ahead of these and entertain these in a summary way as a kind of foreground to what is coming perhaps the following fractions of note which put matters in something of chronological or synoptical form will suffice him or more than suffice he is to understand that the grand tug of war this year gradually turns out not to be hereabouts nor with daun and his adjacencies at all but with the russians who arrive from the opposite northern quarter and that all else will prove to be merely prefatory and nugatory in comparison  january 2d 1759 frankfurtonmayn though it is a reichstadt finds itself suddenly become french prince de soubise lies between mayn and lahn with his 25000 beautifully safe and convenientthough ill off for a placeofarms in those parts opulent frankfurt on his right how handy would that be were not reichs law so express marburg giessen are outposts of his on which side one of ferdinands people prince von ysenburg watches him with an 8 or 10000 capable of mischief in that quarter  on the eve of newyears day or on the auspicious day itself soubise requests of the frankfurt authorities permission for a regiment of his to march through that imperial city to which by law and theory the imperial city can say yes or no but practically cannot without grave inconvenience say other than yes though most frankfurters wish it could yes answer the frankfurt magnates yes surely under the known conditions tuesday january 2d about 5 in the morning while all is still dark in frankfurt regiment nassau appears accordingly at the sachsenhausen gate townguard people all ready to receive it and escort it through and is admitted as usual quite as usual but instead of being escorted through it orders in calm peremptory voice the townguard to ground arms with calm rapidity proceeds to admit ten other regiments or battalions six of them german seizes the artillery on the walls seizes all the other gatesand poor frankfurt finds itself tied hand and foot almost before it is out of bed done with great exactitude with the minimum of confusion and without a hurt skin to anybody the inhabitants stood silent gazing the townguard laid down their arms and went home totally against law but cleverly done perhaps soubises chief exploit in the world certainly the one real success the french have yet had  soubise made haste to summon the magistrates law of necessity alone most honored sirs reichs law is clear against me but all the more shall private liberties religions properties in this imperial freetown be sacred to us defence against any aggression and the strictest discipline observed depend on me i bid youand kept his word to an honorable degree they say or in absence made it be kept during the four years that follow most frankfurters are at heart antifrench but soubises affability was perfect

less soubise like broglio began with rossbach soubise ends with frankfurt for the present where broglio also gains his chief laurels as will shortly be seen frankfurt is a great gain to france though an illicit one it puts a bar on duke ferdinand in that quarter secures a startingpoint for attacks on hessen hanover for cooperation with contades and the lower rhine it is the one success france has

errand we lately spoke of under the head of breakage secondnamely to clear his right flank and scare the reich well off him while he should be marching on frankfurt all which henri assisting from the distance the hereditary prince performed to perfectionand was back april 8th in excellent time for the battle  ferdinand stayed hardly a day in fulda ranking himself and getting on the road did his long march of above 100 miles without accident or loss of timeof course scaring home the broglio outposts in haste enough and awakening broglios attention in a high degreeand arrives thursday april 12th at windecken a village about fifteen miles northeast of frankfurt where he passes the night under arms intending battle on the morrow broglio is all assembled 35000 strong his assailant with the hereditary prince come in counts rather under 30000 broglio is posted in and on both sides of bergen a highlying village directly on ferdinands road to frankfurt windecken is about fifteen miles from frankfurt bergen about sixidle tourists of our time on their return from homburg to that city leave bergen a little on their left the ground is mere hills woody dales marshy brooks broglios position with its village and hill and ravines and advantages is the choicest of the region and broglios methods procedures and arrangements in it are applauded by all judges  friday 13th april 1759 ferdinand is astir by daybreak comes on along one of those woody balleys pickeering reconnoitringin the end directly up the hill of bergen straight upon the keypoint it is about 10 am when the batteries and musketries awaken there very loud indeed for perhaps two hours or more prince von ysenburg is leader of ferdinands attacking party their attack is hot and fierce and they stick to it steadily though gardenhedges orchards and impediments are many and broglio with much cannon helping makes vigorous defence these ysenburgers fought till their cartridges were nearly spent and ysenburg himself lay killed but could not take bergen nor could the hereditary prince who in aid of them tried it in flank with his own usual impetuosity rekindling theirs and at first with some success but was himself taken in flank by broglios reserve and obliged to desist no getting of bergen by that method  military critics say coolly you should have smashed it well with cannon first which ferdinand had not in stock here and especially have flung grenadoes into it till it was well in flame impossible otherwise mauvillon ii 19 the ysenburgers and hereditary prince withdraw no pursuit of them or almost less than none for the one or two french regiments that tried it against order nearly got cut up broglio like a very daun at kolin had strictly forbidden all such attempts on no temptation quit your ground  the battle after this lay quiet all afternoon ferdinand still in sight motioning much to tempt french valor into chasing of him but all in vain broglio though his subalterns kept urging remonstrating was peremptory not to stir whereupon towards evening across certain woody heights perhaps still with some hope of drawing him out ferdinand made some languid attempt on broglios wing or wingsand this also failing had to give up the affair he continued cannonading till deep in the night withdrew to windecken and about two next morning marched for homestill with little or no pursuit but without hope of frankfurt henceforth and in fact has a painful summer ahead  ferdinand had lost 5 cannon and of killed and wounded 2500 the french counted their loss at about 1900 mauvillon ii 1019 tempelhof iii

sleepless kind which is not the best kind sometimes a very bad kind the fame of friedrich invites such people from all sides of the world and this was no doubt a sensible help to himbut enough of all this  here surely is abundance of preliminary smallwar on the part of a friedrich reduced to the defensivefouquets sequel hinted at above was to this effect on fouquets failing to get hold of the moravian magazines and returning to his post at leobschutz a certain rash general deville who is austrian chief in those parts hastily rushed through the jagerndorf hills and invaded fouquet only for a few days and had very bad success in that bit of retaliation the king who is in landshut in the middle of his main cantonments hastened over to leobschutz with reinforcement to fouquet in the thought that a finishingstroke might be done on this devilleand would have done it had not the rash man plunged off again may 1st or the night before homewards at full speed so that friedrich likewise at full speed could catch nothing of him but merely cannonade him in the passes of zuckmantel and cut off his rearguard of croats poor forlorn of croats whom he had left in some bushy chasm to gain him a little time and then to perish if they must as tempelhof remarks tempelhof iii 56 upon which friedrich returned to landshut and fouquet had peace again  it was from this landshut region where his main cantonments are that friedrich had witnessed all these inroads or all except the very earliest of them the first erfurt one and the wobersnowsulkowski he had quitted breslau in the end of march and gone to his cantonments quickened thither probably by a stroke that had befallen him at griefenberg on his silesian side of the cordon at griefenberg stood the battalion duringshofen with its colonel of the same namegrenadier people of good quality perhaps near 1000 in whole which battalion general beck after long preliminary study of it from his bohemian sidemarching stealthily on it

friedrichs arrival he has been in that region ever sincein landshut for the last week or two and returns thither after the deville affair  and at landshutwhich is the main pass into bohemia or from it and is the grand observatorypoint at presenthe will have to remain till the first days of july almost three months watching and waiting on the tedious daun who has the lifting of the curtain this year daun had come to jaromirtz to his cantonments march 24th almost simultaneously with friedrich to his expecting friedrichs invasion as usual long days sat daun expecting the king in bohemiathere goes he at last thought daun on prince henris late flamy appearance there breakage third we labelled itand daun had hastily pushed a division thitherward doublequick to secure prag but found it was only the magazines above four millions worth 600000 pounds counting the thalers into sterling above four millions worth of bread and forage gone to ashes and the very boats burnt well the poor reichsfolk or our poor auxiliaries to them will have empty haversacksbut it is not prag thinks daun  at what exact point of time daun came to see that friedrich was not intending invasion and would on the contrary require to be invaded i do not know but it must have been an interesting discovery to daun if he foreshadowed to himself what results it would have on him taking the defensive then and what is to become of ones cunctatorship in that case yes truly cunctatorship is not now the trade needed there is nothing to be made of playing fabiuscunctatorand dauns fame henceforth is a diminishing quantity the books say he wasted above five weeks in corresponding with the russian generals in fact he had now weeks enough on hand being articulately resolved and even commanded by kriegshofrath to do nothing till the russians came upand also inarticulately and by command of nature to do as little as possible after this year and indeed all years following the russians are to be dauns best card  waiting for three months here till the curtain rose it was friedrich that had to play cunctator a wearisome task to him we need not doubt but he did it with anxious vigilance ever thinking daun would try something either on prince henri or on him and that the play would begin but the play did not there was endless scuffling and bickering of outposts much hitching and counterhitching along that bohemiansilesian frontierdaun gradually hitching up leftwards northwards to be nearer his russians friedrich counterhitching and in the end detaching against the russians as they approached in actuality the details of all which would break the toughest patience not till july came had both parties got into the lausitz daun into an impregnable camp near marklissa in gorlitz country friedrich opposite and eastward of him into another at schmottseifenstill after which as the russians still were not come the hitching if we could concern ourselves with it the maze of strategic shuffling and counterdancing as the russians get nearer will become more intricate than ever  except that of general beck on battalion duringshofenif that was meant as retaliatory and was not rather an originality of becks who is expert at such strokesdaun in return for all these injurious assaults and breakages tried little or no retaliation and got absolutely none deville attempted once as we saw loudon once as perhaps we shall see but both proved futile for the present absolutely none next year indeed loudon on fouquet at landshutbut let us not anticipate just before quitting landshut for schmottseifen

bohemian border where we flung a score of cannon volleys into theinto the derriere of him and everybody returned home in schoning ii 65 9th june 1759  perhaps the only points now noticeable in this tedious landshut interim are two hardly noticed then at all by an expectant world the first is that in the kings little inroad down to trautenau just mentioned four cannon drawn by horses were part of the kings fighting gearthe first appearance of horse artillery in the world a very great invention says the military mind guns and carriages are light and made of the best material for strength the gunners all mounted as postilions to them can scour along over hill and dale wherever horse can and burst out on the sudden where nobody was expecting artillery devised in 1758 ready this year four light sixpounders tried first in the kings raid down to trautenau june 29th30th only four pieces as yet but these did so well there were yearly more imitated by the austrians and gradually by all the world seyfarth ii 543  the second fact is that herr guichard author of that fine book on the warmethods of the greeks and romans is still about friedrich as he has been for above a year past if readers remember and during those tedious weeks is admitted to a great deal of conversation with the king readers will consent to this note on guichard and this shall be our ultimatum on the wearisome three months at landshut  major quintus icilius guichard is by birth a magdeburger age now thirtyfour a solid staid man with a good deal of hard faculty in him and of culture unusual for a soldier a handy sagacious learned and intelligent man whom friedrich in the course of a years experience has grown to see willingly about him there is something of positive in guichard of stiff and as it were gritty which might have offended a weaker taste but friedrich likes the rugged sense of the man his real knowledge on certain interesting heads and the precision with which the known and the not rightly known are divided from one another in guichard  guichards business about the king has been miscellaneous not worth mention hitherto but to appearance was well done of talk they are beginning to have more and more especially at landshut here in these days of waiting a great deal of talk on the wars of the ancients guichards book naturally leading to that subject one night datable accidentally about the end of may the topic happened to be pharsalia and the excellent conduct of a certain centurion of the tenth legion who seeing pompeys people about to take him in flank suddenly flung himself into oblique order schrage stellung as we did at leutheu thereby outflanking pompeys people and ruining their manoeuvre and them a dexterous man that quintus icilius the centurion observed friedrich ah yes but excuse me your majesty his name was quintus caecilius said guichard no it was icilius said the king positive to his opinion on that small point which guichard had not the art to let drop though except assertion and counterassertion what could be made of it there or of what use was it anywhere  next day guichard came with the book what book nobody would ever yet tell me and putting his finger on the passage see your majesty quintus caecilius extinguished his royal opponent hm answered friedrich sowell you shall be quintus icilius at any rate and straightway had him entered on the army books as major quintus icilius his majorship is to be dated 10th april 1758 to give him seniority and from and after this 26th may 1759 he is to command the late du vergers freebattalion all which was donethe waroffices somewhat astonished at such advent of an antique roman among them but writing as bidden the hand being plain and the man an undeniable article onward from which time there is always a battalion quintus on their books instead of battalion du verger by degrees two batallions quintus and at length three and quintus become a colonelat which point the war ended and the three freebattalions quintus like all others of the same type were discharged this is the authentic origin of the new name quintus which guichard got to extinction of the old substantially this as derived from quintus himselfthough in the precise details of it there are obscurities never yet solved by the learned nicolai for example though he had the story from quintus in person who was his familiar acquaintance and often came to see him at berlin does not with his usual punctuality say nor even confess that he has forgotten what book it was that quintus brought with him to confute the king on their iciliuscaecilius controversy nicolai only says that he for his part in the fields of roman literature and history knows only three quintusiciliuses not one of whom is of the least likelihood and in fact in the above summary i have had to invert my nicolai on one point to make the story stick together nicolai anekdoten vi 129145  quintus had been bred for the clerical profession carefully at various universities leyden last of all and had even preached as candidate for licensei hope with moderate orthodoxythough he soon renounced that career exchanged it for learned and vigorous general study with an eye to some college professorship instead he was still hardly twentythree when in 1747 the new stadtholder prince of orange whom we used to know who had his eye upon him as a youth of merit graciously undertook to get him placed at utrecht in a vacancy which had just occurred therewhither the prince was just bound on some ceremonial visit of a high nature the glad quintus at that time guichard and little thinking of such an alias hastened to set off in the princes train but could get no conveyance such was the press of people all for utrecht and did not arrive till next dayand found quarter with difficulty in the garret of some overflowing inn  in the lower stories of his inn solitary guichard when night fell heard a specific gaudeamus going on and inquired what it was a company of professors handselling a newly appointed professorappointed as the next question taught to the very chair poor quintus had come for serene highness could not help himself the utrechters were so bent on the thing quintus lay awake all night in his trucklebed and gloomily resolved to have done with professorships and become a soldier if your serene highness do still favor me said quintus next day i solicit as the one help for me an ensigns commissionand persisted rigorously in spite of all counsellings promises and outlooks on the professorial side of things so that serene highness had to grant him his commission and quintus was a soldier thenceforth fought more or less in the sad remainder of that cumberlandsaxe war and after the peace of 1748 continued in the dutch service where loath to be idle he got his learned books out again and took to studying thoroughly the ancient art of war after years of this it had grown so hopeful that he proceeded to a book upon it and by degrees determined that he must get to certain libraries in england before finishing in 1754 on furlough graciously allowed and continued he came to london accordingly finished his manuscript there printed at the hague 1757 memoires militaires sur les c a la haye 1757 2 vols 4towas in the 5th edition when i last heard of it and new war having now begun went over probably with english introductions as volunteer to duke ferdinand by duke ferdinand he was recommended to friedrich the goal of all his efforts as of every vagrant soldiers in those timesand here at last as quintus icilius he has found permanent billet a battalion and gradually three battalions and will not need to roam any farther  they say what is very credible that quintus proved an active stout and effectual soldier in his kind and perhaps we may hear of some of his smallwar adventures by and by that he was a studious hardheaded wellinformed man and had written an excellent book on his subject is still abundantly clear readers may look in the famous gibbons autobiography or still better in the guichard book itself if they want evidence the famous gibbon was drilling and wheeling very peaceably indeed in the hampshire militia in those wild years of european war hampshire militia served as key or glossary in a sort to this new book of guichards which gibbon eagerly bought and studied and it was guichard alias quintus icilius who taught gibbon all he ever knew of ancient war at least all the teaching he ever had of it for his renowned decline and fall see gibbons works 4to london 1796 memoirs of my life and writings i 97 and extraits de mes lectures ii 5254 of dates may 14th26th 1762during which days gibbon is engaged in actual reading of the memoires militaires and already knows the author by his alias of quintus icilius a man of eminent sagacity and insight who was in the dutch and is now i believe in the prussian service  it was in the last days of june that daun after many litchings got into more decisive general movement northward and slowly but steadily planted himself at marklissa in the lausitz upon which after some survey of the phenomenon friedrich got to schmottseifen opposite him july 10th friedrich on noticing such stir had ridden down to trautenau june 29th30th new horseartillery attending to look closer into dauns affairs and seeing what they were had thereupon followed above a month before this friedrich had detached a considerable force against the russiansgeneral dohna of whom in next chapterand both daun and he again sit waiting till they see farther rapid friedrich is obliged to wait watching daun and the dohnarussian adventure slow daun will continue to wait and watch there long weeks and months after that is settled that and much else fully to his mind each is in his impregnable camp and each daun especially has his divisions and detachments hovering round him near or far on different strategic errands each maincamp like a planet with various moonsmarklissa especially a kind of sun with planets and comets and planetary moonsof whose intricate motions and countermotions mostly unimportant to us we promised to take no notice in face of such a crisis just at hand  by the 6th of july slow daun had got hitched into his camp of marklissa and four days after friedrich attending him was in schmottseifen where again was pause and there passed nothing mentionable even on friedrichs score and till july was just ending the curtain did not fairly rise panse of above two weeks on friedrichs part and of almost three months on dauns marklissa an impregnable camp is on the lausitz border with saxony silesia bohemia all converging hereabouts and brandenburg itself in the vicinitythere is not a better place for waiting on events here accordingly till well on in september daun sat immovable not even hitching nowonly shooting out detachments planetary cometary at a great rate chiefly on his various russian errands  daun as we said had been uncomfortably surprised to find by degrees that invasion was not friedrichs plan this year that the dramatic parts are redistributed and that the playing of fabiuscunctator will not now serve ones turn daun who may well be loath to believe such a thing clings to his old part and seems very lazy to rise and try another in fact he does not rise properly speaking or take up his new part at all this year and all the following he waits carefully till the russian lion come will then endeavor to assistor even do jackal which will be safer still the russians he intends shall act lion he himself modestly playing the subaltern but much safer part diligent to flatter the lion will provide him guidances and fractional sustenances in view of the coming hunt will eat the lions leavings once the prey is slaughtered this really was in some sort dauns yearly game so long as it would last  july ending and the curtain fairly risen we shall have to look at friedrich with our best eyesight preparatory to which there is on friedrichs part ever since the middle of june this antirussian dohna adventure going onof which at first and till about the time of getting to schmottseifen he had great hopes great though of late rapidly sinking againinto which we must first throw a glance as properly the opening scene  fouquet has been left at landshut should the daun remnants still in bohemia think of invading fouquet is about rooting himself rather firmly into that important post fortifying various select hills round landshut with redoubts curtains communications so as to keep ward there inexpugnable to a much stronger force there for about a year with occasional short sallies on errands that arise fouquet sat successfully vigilant resisting the devilles becks harsches protecting glatz and the passes of silesia in about a year we shall hear of his fortunes worsening and of a great catastrophe to him in that landshut post  friedrich allowed the reichsfolk two good months after all that flurrying and havoc done on them before they could show face in saxony they did take about that time and would have taken more had not prince henri been called away by other pressing occasions in friedrichs own neighborhood and saxony for a good while end of june to beginning of september been left almost bare of prussian troops which encourages the reichs army to hurry afield in very unprepared conditionstill rather within the two months end of july light people of them push across to halberstadt or halle country and are raising contributions and plundering diligently if nothing else of which we can take no notice farther if the reader can recollect it well if not also well the poor reichs army nominally makes a figure this year but nominally only the effective part of it now and henceforth being austrian auxiliaries and the reichs part as flaccid and insignificant as ever  prince henris call to quit saxony was this daun among the numerous detachments he was making of which we can take no notice had shot out two rather of cometary type to use our old figurewhich every reader must try to keep in mind two detachments very considerable haddick who grew at last to 20000 and loudon 16000 who are hovering about mysteriously over the lausitzintending what their intention friedrich thinks especially haddicks intention may be towards brandenburg and even berlin wherefore he has summoned henri to look after it henri resting in cantonments about tschopau and dresden after the late fatigues and idle for the moment hastens to obey and is in bautzen neighborhood from about the end of june and onward sufficiently attentive to haddick and loudon who make no attempt on brandenburg having indeed as friedrich gradually sees and as all of us shall soon see a very different object in view      chapter iigeneral dohna dictator wedell battle of zullichau  the russian lion urged by vienna and versailles made his entry this year earlier than usualcoming now within wind of marklissa as we seeand has stirred daun into motion daun and everybody from the beginning of april the russians hibernating in the interior parts of poland were awake and getting slowly under way april 24th the vanguard of 10000 quitted thorn june 1st vanguard is in posen followed by a first division and a second each of 30000 they called it soltikof crossing the weichsel with 100000 men but exclusive of the cossack swarms there were not above 76000 regulars nor was soltikof their captain just at first our old friend fermor was and continued to be till soltikof in a private capacity reached posen june 29th and produced his new commission at fermors own request as fermor pretendedwho was skilled in petersburg politics and with a cheerful face served thenceforth as soltikofs second  at posen as on the road thither they find sulkowskis and the other burnt provenders abundantly replaced it is evident they intend in concert with daun to enclose friedrich between two fires and do something considerable whether on brandenburg or silesia is not yet known to friedrich friedrich since the time they crossed weichsel has given them his best attention and more than once has had schemes on their magazines and themonce a new and bigger scheme actually afoot under wobersnow again our antisulkowski friend but was obliged to turn the force elsewhither on alarms that rose he himself cannot quit the centre of the work his task being to watch daun and especially should daun attempt nothing else to prevent junction of soltikof and him  daun still lies torpid or merely hitching about but now when the russians are approaching posen and the case becomes pressing friedrich as is usual to him draws upon the antiswedish resource upon the force he has in pommern that is to say orders general dohna who has the swedes well driven in at present to quit stralsund country to leave the ineffectual swedes with some very small attendance and to marchwith certain reinforcements that are arriving wobersnow already hulsen with 10000 out of saxony in few daysdirect against the russians and at once go in upon them try to burn their magazines again or equally good to fall vigorously on some of their separate divisions and cut them off in the vagrant stateabove all to be vigorous be rapid sharp and do something effectual in that quarter these were dohnas instructions dohna has 18000 hulsen with his 10000 is industriously striding forward from the farther side of saxony wobersnow with at least his own fine head is already there friedrich watching in the antijunction position ready for the least chance that may turn up  dohna marched accordingly but was nothing like rapid enough an old man often in ill health too and no doubt plenty of impediments about him he consumed some time rallying at stargard twelve days more at landsberg on the warta settling his provision matters in fine did not get to posen neighborhood till june 23d three weeks after the russian vanguard of 10000 had fixed itself there and other russian parties were daily dropping in dohna was 15000 a wobersnow with him had he gone at once on posen as wobersnow urged it is thought he might perhaps have ruined this vanguard and the russian magazine which would have been of signal service for the remaining campaign but he preferred waiting for hulsen and the 10000 who did not arrive for seven or eight days more by which time soltikof and most of the russian divisions had got inand the work was become as good as hopeless on those languid terms dohna did try upon the magazine said to be ill guarded in some suburb of posen crossed the warta with that view found no magazine recrossed the warta and went manoeuvring about unable to do the least good on soltikof or his magazines or operations friedrich was still in landshut region just about quitting itjust starting on that little trautenau expedition with his four pieces of horseartillery june 29th when the first ill news of dohna came in which greatly disappointed friedrich and were followed by worse instead of better  the end was soltikof being now all ready winded himself out of posen one day veiled by cossacks and to dohnas horror had got or was in the act of getting between dohna and brandenburg which necessitated new difficult manoeuvres from dohna soltikof too can manoeuvre a little soltikof edges steadily forward making for crossenonoder where he expects to find austrians haddick and loudon if friedrich could yet guess it with 30000 odd especially with provision which is wearing scarce with him twice or so there was still a pretty opportunity for dohna on him but dohna never could resolve about it in time back and ever back goes dohna facing soltikof but always hitching back latterly in brandenburg ground the russians and hehaving no provision he either in fine july 17th one week after friedrich had got to schmottseifen dohna finds himself at the little town of zullichau barely in time to snatch it before soltikof could within thirty miles of crossen and nothing but futility behind and before tempelhof iii 7888  heldengeschichte v 835847  we can imagine friedrichs daily survey of all this his gloomy calculations what it will soon amount to if it last he has now no winterfeld schwerin no keith retzow moritzwhom has he his noblest captains are all gone he must put up with the less noble one wedell lieutenantgeneral had lately recommended himself to the royal mind by actions of a prompt daring the royal mind disgusted with these dohna hagglings and in absolute necessity of finding somebody that had resolution and at least ordinary prussian skill hoped wedell was the man and determined the crisis being so urgent to send wedell in the character of alterego or with the powers of a roman dictator as the order expressed it given in preuss ii 207 208 in stenzel v 212 other particulars dictator wedell is to supersede dohna shall go at his own swift pace fettered by nobodyand at all hazards shall attack soltikof straightway and try to beat him you are grown too old for that intricate hard work go home a little and recover your health the king writes to dohna and to the dohna army obey this man all and sundry of you as you would myself the mans private order being go in upon soltikof attack him straightway let us have done with this wriggling and haggling date of this order is camp at schmottseifen 20th july 1759 the purpose of such highflown title and solemnity of nomination was mainly it appears to hush down any hesitation or surprise among the dohna generals which as wedell was the youngest lieutenantgeneral of the army might otherwise have been possible  wedell furnished with some small escort and these documents arrives in camp sunday evening 22d julypoor dohna has not the least word or look of criticism and every general suppressing whatever thoughts there may be prepares to yield loyal obedience to dictator wedell wobersnow was the far better soldier of the two murmured the opposition party then and long afterwards retzow call the more as wobersnows behavior under it was beautiful and his end tragical as will be seen wobersnow i perceive to have been a valiant sharpstriking man with multifarious resources in his head who had faithfully helped in these operations and i believe been urgent to quicken them but what i remember best of him is his hasty admirable contrivance for fieldbakery in pressing circumstancesthe substance of which shall not be hidden from a mechanical age  you construct six slight square iron frames each hinged to the other each say two feet square or the breadth of two common tiles and shaped on the edges so as to take in tilestiles are to be found on every human cottage this iron frame when you hook it together becomes the ghost of a cubic box and by the help of twelve tiles becomes a compact fieldoven and you can bake with it if you have flour and water and a few sticks the succinctest oven ever heard of for your operation done and your tiles flung out again it is capable of all folding flat like a book retzow ii 82 n never till now had wobersnows oven been at fault but in these polish villages all of mere thatched hovels there was not a tile to be found and the bakery with astonishment saw itself unable to proceed  wedell arrived sunday evening 22d july had crossed oder at tschischerzigsome say by crossen bridge no matter which dohnas camp is some thirty miles west of crossen in and near the small town called zullichau where his headquarter is in those dull peaty countries on the right which is thereabouts the northern not eastern bank of oder between the oder and the warta some seventy miles southbyeast of landsberg and perhaps as far southwest of posen thither has dohna now got with his futile manoeuvrings soltikof drawn up amid scrubby woods and sluggish intricate brooks is about a mile to east of him  poor dohna demits at once and i could conjecture vanishes that very night glad to be out of such a thing painfully has dohna manoeuvred for weeks past falling back daily only anxious latterly that soltikof who daily tries it do not get to westward of him on the frankfurt road and so end this sad shuffle soltikof as yet has not managed that ultimate fatality dohna by shuffling back does at least contrive to keep between frankfurt and himwill not try attacking him much as wobersnow urges it has agreed twice or oftener on wobersnows urgency yes yes we have a chance dohna would answer only let us rest till tomorrow and be fresh by which time the opportunity was always gone again  wedell had arrived with a grenadier battalion and some horse for escort had picked up 150 russian prisoners by the way retzow has understood he came in with a kind of state and seemed more or less inflated conscious of representing the kings person and being a roman dictatorthough it is a perilously difficult office too and requires more than a letter of instructions to qualify you for it this is not leonidas wedell whom readers once knew poor leonidas is dead long since fell in the battle of sohr soon after the heroic feat of ziethens and his at elbeteinitz defence of elbe against an army this is leonidass elder brother friedrich had observed his fiery ways on the day of leuthen hah a new winterfeld perhaps thought friedrich all the winterfeld i now havewhich proved a fond hope wedells dictatorship began this sunday towards sunset and lastedin practical fact it lasted one day     dictator wedell fights his battle monday 23d july 1759 without success  monday morning early wedell is on the heights reconnoitring soltikof cannot see much of him the ground being so woody does see what he takes to be soltikofs left wing and judges that soltikof will lie quiet for this day which was far from a right reading of soltikof the fact being that soltikof in long columns and divisions beginning with his right wing was all on march since daybreak what wedell took for soltikofs left wing being soltikofs rearguard and baggage waiting till the roads cleared wedell having settled everything on the above footing returns to zullichau about 10 oclock and about 11 soltikof miles long disengaged from the bushy hollows makes his appearance on the open grounds of palzig he sure enough though wedell can hardly believe itfive or six miles to northeast yonder tramping diligently along making for crossen and the oder bridgeand is actually got ahead of us at last  this is what wedell cannot suffer cost what it may wedells orders were in such case attack the russians wedell instantly took his measures not unskilfully say judgesthough the result proved disappointing and wobersnow himself earnestly dissuaded too questionable i should doubt soltikof is 70000 and has no end of artillery we are 26000 and know not if we can bring a single gun to where soltikof is tempelhof iii 132134  wedells people have already of their own accord got to arms again stand waiting his orders on this new emergency no delay in wedell or in them may not it be another rossbach if we are lucky thinks wedell cannot we burst in on their flank as they march yonder those awkward fellows and tumble them into heaps the differences were severalfold first that friedrich and seidlitz are not here many brave men we have and skilful but not a master and man like these two secondly that there is no janus hill to screen our intentions but that the russians have us in full view while we make ready thirdly and still more important that we do not know the ground and what hidden inaccessibilities lie ahead this last is judged to have been the killing circumstance between the russians and us there is a paltry little brook or line of quagmire scarcely noticeable here but passable nowhere except at the villagemill of kay by one poor bridge there and then farther inwards as shelter of the russians there is another quaggy brook branch of the above which is without bridge altogether hours will be required to get 26000 people marched up there not to speak of heavy guns at all  the 26000 march with their usual mathematical despatch manteuffel and the vanguard strike in with their sharpest edge foot and horse direct on the head of the russian column manteuffel leading on so soon as his few battalions and squadrons are across head means brain or life to this russian column and these manteuffel people go at it with extraordinary energy the russian head gives way infantry and cavalrytheir cavalry was driven quite to rear and never came in sight again after this of manteuffel but the russians have abundance of reserves also of room to manoeuvre inno lack of ground open and ground defensible palzig village and churchyard for exampleabove all they have abundance of heavy guns  well in recoil from manteuffel and his furies the beaten russians succeed in forming a long line behind palzig village with that second slighter or branch quagmire between them and us they get the village beset and have the churchyard of it lined with batteriessay seventy guns manteuffel unsupported has to fall backunwillingly and not chased or in disordertowards kaymill again where many are by this time across hulsen with the centre attacks now as the vanguard had done with a will he too wobersnow all manner of people attack time after time for about four hours coming and it proves all in vain on that churchyard and new line without cannon we are repulsed torn away by those russian volcanobatteries never enough of us at once  hulsen wobersnow everybody in detail is repulsed or finds his success unavailing poor wobersnow did wonders but he fell killed gone he and has left so few of his like a man that could ill be spared at presentday is sinking we find we have lost in killed wounded and prisoners some 6000 men about sunsetflaming july sun going down among the moorlands on such a scenewedell gives it up retires slowly towards kay bridge slowly not chased or molested soltikof too glad to be rid of him soltikofs one aim is and was towards crossen towards austrian junction and something to live upon soltikofs loss of men is reckoned to be heavier even than wedells but he could far better afford it he has gained his point and the price is small in comparison next day he enters crossen on triumphant terms  poor wedell had returned over kaymill bridge in the nighttime after his defeat on the morrow tuesday 24th day of soltikofs glad entry wedell crosses oder at tschischerzig the old place of sunday evening lastin how different a humor this timeand in a day more posts himself opposite to crossen bridge five or six miles south and again sits watchful of soltikof there at crossen triumphant soltikof has found no austrian junction nor anything additional to live upon a very disappointing circumstance to soltikof austrian junction still a problem then a thing in the air and perhaps the king of prussia taking charge of it now soltikof more and more impatient after waiting some days decided not to cross oder by that bridgeshy of crossing anywhere think the french gentlemen montazet montalembert to the king of prussias side stenzel iv 215 indistinct and giving a wrong citation of montalembert ii 87 which is not unlikely though the king is above 100 miles off him and has daun on his hands certain enough keeping the river between him and any operations of the king soltikof set out for frankfurt forty or fifty miles farther down in the hope probably of finding something of human provender withal july 30th one week after his battle the vanguard of him is there  thus in two days or even in one has wedells dictatorship ended easy to say scoffingly would it had never begun friedrich knows that and wedell knows itafter the event everybody knows it friedrich said nothing of reproachful the reverse ratheri dreaded something of the kind it is not your fault to wedell from the king schmottseifen july 24th 1759 in schoning ii 118ordered wedell to watch diligently at crossen bridge and be ready on farther signal the wedell problem in such ruined condition has now fallen to friedrich himself  this is the battle of zullichau afternoon of 23d july 1759 the beginning of immense disasters in this campaign battle called also of kay and of palzig those also being main localities in it it was lost not by fault of wedells people who spent themselves nobly upon it nor perhaps by fault of wedell himself but principally if not solely by those two paltry brooks or threads of quagmire one of which turns kaymill memorable brooks in this campaign 1759 tempelhof iii 125131  close in the same neighborhood there is another equally contemptible brook making towards oder and turning the socalled krebsmuhle which became still more famous to the whole european public twenty years hence krebsmuhle crabmill as yet quite undistinguished among mills belonging to a dusty individual called miller arnold with a dusty son of his own for millers lad was it at work this day or had the terrible sound from palzig quenched its clacking  some three weeks ago 4th6th july there occurred a sudden sharp thing at havredegrace on the french coast worth a word from us in this place the montazets montalemberts watching messaging about in the austrianrussian courts and camps assiduously keeping their soltikofs in tune we can observe how busy they are soubise with his invasion of england all the french are very busy they have conquered hessen from duke ferdinand and promise themselves a glorious campaign after that seizure of frankfurt soubise intent on his new enterprise is really making ardent preparations at vanues in the morbihan such rendezvousing and equippingespecially at havre no end of flatbottomed boats getting built and much bluster and agitation among the weaker sorts in both nations whereupon  july 1st just in the days while friedrich was first trying horse artillery rearadmiral rodney sails from portsmouth with a few frigates and six bombketches

flatbottomed manufactories as was quite surprising fiftytwo incessant hours of it before he thought poor havre had enough poor havre had been on fire six times the flat manufactory unquenchable i know not how many all the inhabitants off in despair and the garrison building this battery to no purpose then that no salvation for them but in rodneys mortars getting too hot he had fired of shells 1900

fancied all their ships employed in distant partsrides there with a channel fleet of formidable nature and the previous question always is cannot we beat hawke can we or will not he perhaps go of himself when the rough weather comes     chapter iiifriedrich in person attempts the russian problem not with success  before wedells catastrophe the affair of those haddickloudon detachments had become a little plainer to friedrich the intention he begins to suspect is not for berlin at all but for junction with soltikofat crossen or wherever it may be this is in fact their real purpose and this beyond almost berlin itself it is in the highest degree important to prevent important and now as if become impossible  prince henri had come to bautzen with his army specially to look after loudon and haddick and he has all this while had finck with some 10000 diligently patrolling to westward of them guarding berlin he himself watching from the southern sidewhere as on the western there was no danger from them some time before wedells affair friedrich had pushed out eugen of wurtemberg to watch these people on the eastern sidesuspicious that thitherward lay their real errand eugen had but 6000 and except in conjunction with finck and henri could do nothingnor can now when friedrichs suspicion turns out to be fatally true friedrich had always the angry feeling that finck and prince henri were the blameworthy parties in what now ensued that they who were near ought to have divined these peoples secret and spoiled it in time not have left it to him who was far off and so busy otherwise to the last that was his fixed private opinion by no means useful to utterespecially at present while attempting the now very doubtful enterprise himself and needing all about him to be swift and zealous this is one of friedrichs famous labors this of the haddickloudon junction with soltikof strenuous short spasm of effort of about a weeks continuance full of fiery insight velocity energy still admired by judges though it was unsuccessful or only had half success difficult to bring home in any measure to the mind of modern readers so remote from it  friedrich got the news of zullichau next day july 24thand instantly made ready the case is critical especially this haddickloudon part of it add 30 or 36000 austrians to soltikof how is he then to be dealt with a case stringently pressingand the resources for it few and scattered for several days past haddick and loudon under him whose motions were long enigmatic have been marching steadily eastward through the lausitzwith the evident purpose of joining soltikof unless wedell could forbid wedell ahead was the grand oppositionfinck henri wurtemberg as good as uselessand wedell being now struck down these austrians will go especially loudon will at a winged rate they are understood to be approaching sagan country happily as yet well to westward of it and from sagan town well northwestwardbut all accounts of them are vague dim they are an obscure entity to friedrich but a vitally important one sagan town may be about 70 miles northward of where friedrich now is from sagan were they once in the meridian of sagan their road is free eastward and northwardto crossen is about 60 miles northbyeast from sagan to frankfurt near 100 north sagan is on the bober bober in every event is between the austrians and their aim  friedrich feels that however dangerous to quit dauns neighborhood he must he in person go at once and who in the interim will watch daun and his enterprises friedrichs reflections are well in the crisis of the moment saxonythough there already are marauding bodies of reichsfolk in itmust still be left to itself for a time or cannot finck and his 10000 look to it henri with his army now useless at bautzen shall instantly rendezvous at sagan his army to go with me against the russians and their haddickloudons henri to schmottseifen instead of me and attend to daun henri i have no other left finck and his 10000 must take charge of saxony such charge as he canhow lucky those spring forays which destroyed the reichs magazines whereby there is no reichs army yet got into saxony nothing but preliminary pulses and splashings of it none yet nor like to be quite at once that is friedrichs swift plan  henri rose on the instant as did everybody concerned july 29th henri and army were at sagan army waiting for the king henri so far on his road to schmottseifen he had come to sagan by almost the rapidest marches ever heard ofor ever till some others of henris own which he made in that neighborhood soon punctual he to his day as are eugen of wurtembergs people and all detachments and divisions friedrich himself arrives at sagan that same 29th about midnightand finds plenty of work waiting no sleep these two nights past and none coming just yet a most swift rendezvous the speed of everybody has been and needs still to be intense  this rendezvous at saganintersection of henri and friedrich bound different roads the brothers i think did not personally meet henri having driven off for schmottseifen by a shorter roadwas sunday july 29th following which are six days of such a hunt for those austrian reynards as seldom or never was most vehement breathless baffling hunt half of it spent in painfully beating cover in mere finding and losing not rightly successful after all so that on the eighth day hence august 6th at mullrose near frankfurt 80 miles from sagan there is a second rendezvousrendezvous of wedell and friedrich who do not now intersect but meet after the hunt is doneand in the interim there has been a wonderful performance though an unsuccessful friedrich never could rightly get hold of his austrians once only at sommerfeld a long march northwest of sagan he came upon some outskirts of them and in general in those latter eight days especially in the first six of them there is in that kotbussagan country such an intersecting checking pushing and multifarious simmering of marches on the part of half a dozen strategic entities friedrich the centre of them asas i think nobody but an express soldierstudent well furnished with admiration for this particular soldier would consent to have explained to him one of the maziest most unintelligible whirls of marching inextricable sword dance or dance of the furiesfive of them that is the correct number haddick loudon friedrich wurtemberg wedelland it is flung down for us all in a huddle in these inhuman books which have several errors of the press too let no man rashly insist with himself on understanding it unless he have need humanly pulled straight not inhumanly flung down at random here the essentials of it arein very brief state  sagan monday 30th july friedrich is at sagan since midnight last busier and busier beating cover as we termed it and getting his hounds his new henriarmy in leash endeavoring especially to get tidings of those austrian people who are very enigmaticloudon a dexterous manand have hung up such a curtain of pandours between friedrich and them as is nearly impenetrable in the course of this monday friedrich ascertains that they are verily on the road coming eastward for sommerfeldthence for crossen he needs no ghost to tell him wherefore  tuesday sagan to naumburg tuesday before daybreak friedrich too is on the road northwestward in full march towards naumburg on bober meaning to catch the bridge from them there march of the swiftest he himself is ahead as usual with the vanguard of horse he reaches naumburg northward a march of 20 miles finds not haddick or loudon but a detachment of theirs which he at once oversets with his cavalry and chasesmarking withal that westward is the way they run westward and that we are still ahead thank heaven  before his infantry are all up or are well rested in naumburg friedrich ascertains on more precise tidings that the austrians are in sommerfeld to westward again a 20 miles and judges that no doubt they will bear off more to leftward by guben probably and try to avoid himunless he can still catch them in sommerfeld about nightfall he marches for sommerfeld at his swiftest arrives wednesday early findsalas  sommerfeld wednesday morning august 1st friedrich finds that loudon was there last nightpreterite tense alas the question now being where is he in fact loudon had written yesterday to daun letter still extant sommerfeld july 31st that being swift and light consisting of horse for most part he may probably effect junction this very nightbut has altered his mind very much on sight of these fugitives from naumburg since and has borne off more to leftward straight north now and at a very brisk pace being now all of horseand has an important conference with haddick at guben when they arrive there not in sommerfeld thinks friedrich earnestly surveying through this slit he has made in the pandour veil gone to guben most likely bearing off from us to leftwardwhich was the fact though not the whole fact and indeed the chase is now again fallen uncertain and there has to be some beating of covers for one thing he learns today august 1st that the russians are gone to frankfurt follow them you wedellorders friedrich them we shall have to go intohowever this hunt end  to markersdorf thursday august 2d friedrich takes the road for guben reaches markersdorf twenty miles march still seven or eight from guben falls uponwhat phenomenon is this the austrian heavy train mealwagons not a few and a regiment of foot in charge of itbut going the wrong way not towards the russians but from them what on earth can this be this is haddickif friedrich could yet clearly know ithaddick and train who for his own part has given up the junction enterprise at guben some hours ago he had conference with loudon and this was the conclusion arrived at impossible with that king so near you herr loudon push on without heavy baggage and with the cavalry altogether you can get in almost 20000 strong i with the infantry with the meal and heavy guns will turn and make for the lausitz again  this mysterious austrian train going the wrong way friedrich attacks whatever it be hoping i suppose it might be the austrians altogether chases it vigorously snatches all the mealwagons and about 1000 prisoners uncertain still what it isif not the austrians altogether to his sorrow he finds on pushing farther into it that it is only haddick and the infantry that loudon with the 20000 horse will have gone off for frankfurtirretrievably ahead the swift loudonever careering northward all this while since that afternoon at sommerfeld when the fugitives altered his opinion a now unattainable loudon in the course of thursday night friedrich has satisfied himself that the loudon junction is a thing as good as donein effect loudon did get to frankfurt morning of august 3d and joined the russians there and about the same time or only a few hours sooner friedrich by symptoms has divined that his hunt has ended in this rather unsuccessful way and that chasing of haddick is not the road to go tempelhof iii 135139  not haddick now with or without their austrians it shall be the russians now two days ago wednesday as was mentioned before sight of those enigmatic mealwagons friedrich had learned that the russians were to be in frankfurt again and had ordered wedell to march thitherward at any rate which wedell is doing all this thursday and the four following days as does likewise from and after friday august 3d 1 am hunt then over friedrich himselfrenouncing haddick and the hunt straight towards frankfurt thenceforth headquarters beeskow that night next night mullrose whither wedell is appointed within twelve miles of frankfurt this is the end of friedrichs sore chase and march burnt deeply into his own weary brain if ours still refuse it admittance here of utterly fatigued tone is a note of his chiefly on business to minister finkenstein indeed there are within the next ten days three successive notes to finkenstein which will be worth reading in their due places this is the first of them  the king to graf von finkenstein at berlin  beeskow 3d august1759  i am just arrived here after cruel and frightful marchings checks himself however there is nothing desperate in all that and i believe the noise and disquietude this hurlyburly has caused will be the worst of it show this letter to everybody that it may be known the state is not undefended i have made above 1000 prisoners from haddick all his mealwagons have been taken finck i believe will keep an eye on him and secure berlin from attempts of his this is all i can say  tomorrow i march to within two leagues of frankfurt to mullrose namely katte the minister who has charge of such things must send me instantly two hundred wispels say tons of meal and bakers one hundred to furstenwalde i shall encamp at wulkow i am very tired for six nights i have not closed an eye farewellf  during the above intricate wardance of fivethe day while friedrich was at sommerfeld the day before he came in sight of haddicks mealwagons going the wrong roadthere went on at minden on the weser three hundred miles away a beautiful feat of war in the highest degree salutary to duke ferdinand and britannic majestys ministry feat which requires a word from us here a really splendid victory this of minden august 1st french driven headlong through the passes there their conquest of hanover and weser country quite exploded and flung over the horizon and duke ferdinand relieved from all his distresses and lord of the ascendant again in those parts highly interesting to friedrichespecially to prince henri whose apprehensions about ferdinand and the old richelieu hastenbeckhalberstadt time returning on us have been very great and who now at schmottseifen fires feudejoie for it with all his heart this is a battle still of some interest to english readers but can english readers consent to halt in this hot pinch of the friedrich crisis and read the briefest thing which is foreign to it alas i fear they canand will insert the note here  battle of minden wednesday august 1st 1759ever since bergen things have gone awry with ferdinand and in spite of skilful management of hard struggles and bright sparkles of success he has had a bad campaign of it the french it would seem are really got into better fighting order belleisles exertions as warminister have been almost wonderfulin some respects too wonderful as we shall hearand broglio and contades in comparison with clermont and soubise have real soldier qualities contades across rhine again in those weser countries who is skilful in his way and is pricked on by emulation of broglio has been spreading himself out steadily progressive there while broglio pushing along from frankfurtonmayn has conquered hessen is into hanover on the edge of conquering hanoverwhich how is ferdinand to hinder ferdinand has got two if not three armies to deal with and in number is not much superior to one if he run to save hanover from broglio he loses westphalia osnabruck his magazine munster lippstadtcontades if left to himself will take these after short siege and will nestle himself there and then advance not like a transitory feverfit but like visible death on hanover ferdinand rapid yet wary manoeuvred his very best among those interests of his on the left bank of weser but after the surprisal of minden from him brilliantly done by broglio and the aid of a treacherous peasant especially after the capture of osnabruck his outlooks are gloomy to a degree and at versailles and at minden where contades has established himself the conquest of hanover beautiful counterweight to all ones losses in america or elsewhere is regarded as a certainty of this year  for the last ten days of july about minden the manoeuvring especially on ferdinands part had been intense a great idea in the head of ferdinand more or less unintelligible to contades contades with some 30000 which is the better half of his force has taken one of the unassailablest positions he lies looking northward his right wing on the weser with posts to minden minden perhaps a mile northeastward there on his left impassable peatbogs and quagmires in front a quaggy river or impassable black brook called the bastau coming from the westward which disembogues at minden sketch of plan p 238there lies contades as if in a rabbithole say military men for defence if that were the sole object no post can be stronger contades has in person say 30000 and round him on both sides of the weser are broglio with 20000 besides other divisions i know not how many besieging munster capturing osnabruck our hay magazine attempting lippstadt by surprise to no purpose and diligently working forward day by day to ferdinands ruin in those minden regions three or four divisions busy in that mannerand above all we say he has broglio with a 20000 on the right or east bank of the weserwho if ferdinand quit him even for a day seems to have hanover at discretion and can march any day upon hanover city where his light troops have already been more than once why does nt ferdinand cross weser recross weser coerce broglio back and save hanover cry the gazetteers and a public of weak judgment pitts public is inclined to murmur about ferdinand pitt himself never ferdinand persists in sticking by minden neighborhoodand in a scarcely accountable way manoeuvring there shooting out therefrom what mischief he

miles off broglio and he see clearly till we can get a new magazine much nearer hanover or at lowest can clear out these people from infesting us here there is no moving northward to both contades and broglio that is an evident thing the corollary to which is they must fight ferdinand must watch lynxlike till a chance turn up of beating him in fight that is their outlook and ferdinand knows it isand manoeuvres accordingly military men admire much not his movements only but his clear insight into contadess and broglios temper of mind and by what methods they were to be handled they and his own affairs together and brought whither he wanted them in mauvillon ii 4144 minute account of all that  this attempt on gohfeld was a serious mischief to contades if it succeeded but the detaching of the prince of brunswick on it and weakening ones too weak army what a rashness what an oversight thinks contades as ferdinand wished him to do is our skilful enemy in this extreme embarrassment losing head then look at his left wing yonder general wangenheim sitting behind batteries in his village of todtenhausen looking into minden from the northwangenheims left leans on the weser yes but wangenheims right observe has no support within three miles of it tear wangenheim out ferdinands flank is bare these things seemed to contades the very chance he had been waiting for and brought him triumphantly out of his rabbithole into the heath of minden as ferdinand hoped they would do  and so tuesday evening july 31st things being now all ripe upwards of 50000 french are industriously in motion contades has nineteen bridges ready on the bastau brook in front of him tattoo this night in contadess camp is to mean general march march all of you across these nineteen bridges to your stations on the plain or heath of minden yonderand be punctual like the clock broglio crosses weser by the town bridge ranks himself opposite todtenhausen and through the livelong night there is on the part of the 50000 french a very great marching and deploying contades and broglio together are 51400 foot and horse ferdinands entire force will be near 46000 but on the day of battle he is only 36000having detached the hereditary prince on gohfeld in what view we knowthe battle of minden called also of tonhausen meaning todtenhausen which hereupon fell out has still its fame in the world and i perceive is well worth study by the soldier mind though nothing but the rough outline of it is possible here  ferdinands posts extend from the weser river and todtenhausen round by stemmern holzhausen to hartum and the bog of bastau the chief part of him towards bastauin various villages and woody patches and favorable spots all looking in upon minden from a distance of five or seven miles forming a kind of arc with minden for centre he will march up in eight columns of course with wide intervals between themwide but continually narrowing as he advances which will indeed be ruinous gaps if ferdinand wait to be attacked but which will coalesce close enough if he be speedy upon contades for contadess line is also of arclike or almost semicircular form behind it minden as centre minden which is at the intersection of weser and the brook his right flank is on weser broglio versus wangenheim the extreme right his left with infantry and artillery rests on that black brook of bastau with its nineteen bridges as the ground on both wings is rough not so fit for cavalry contades puts his cavalry wholly in the centre they are the flower of the french army about 10000 horse in all firm open ground ahead of them there with strong batteries masses of infantry to support on each flank batteries to ply with crossfire any assailant that may come on broglio we said is right wing strong in artillery and infantry broglio is to root out waugenheim after whichor even before which if wangenheim is kept busy and we are nimblewhat becomes of ferdinands left flank with a gap of three miles between wangenheim and him and 10000 chosen horse to take advantage of it had the french been of prussian dexterity and nimbleness in marching it is very possible something might have come of this latter circumstance but ferdinand knows they are not and intends to take good care of his flank  contades and his people were of willing mind but had no skill in marchiug up and once got across the bastau by their nineteen bridges they wasted many hourstoo far am i not far enough too close not close enoughand broiled about in much hurry and confusion all night fight was to have begun at 5 in the morning broglio was in his place silently looking into wangenheim by five oclock but unfortunately did nothing upon wangenheim not ready you i see except cannonade a littleand indeed all through did nothing still not ready you others which surely was questionable conduct though not reckoned so at versailles when the case came to be argued there as to the contades people across those nineteen bridges they had a baffling confused night and were by no means correctly on their ground at sunrise nor at 7 oclock nor at 8 and were still mending themselves when the shock came and time was done  the morning is very misty but ferdinand has himself been out examining since the earliest daybreak his orders last night were cavalry be saddled at 1 in the morninghaving a guess that there would be work as he now finds there will from 5 am ferdinand is issuing from his camp flowing down eastward beautifully concentric closing on contades horse not in centre but english infantry in centre six battalions or six regiments by english reckoning right opposite those 10000 horse of contadess the sight of whom seems to be very animating to them the english cavalry stand on the right wing at the village of hartum lord george sackville had not been very punctual in saddling at 1 oclock but he is there ranked on the ground at 8in what humor nobody knows sulky and flabby i should rather guess english tourists idle otherwise may take a look at hartum on the south side as the spot where a very ugly thing occurred that day  soon after 8 the fight begins attack by certain hessians on hahlen and its batteries attempt to drive the french out of hahlen as the first thingwhich does not succeed at once indeed took three attacks in all and perhaps looks rather tedious to those six english battalions ferdinands order to them was you shall march up to attack you six on sound of drum but it seems they read it by sound of drum beating our own drums yes of courseand being weary of this hahlen work or fancying they had no concern with it strode on doublequick without waiting for hahlen at all to the horror of their hanoverian comrades who nevertheless determined to follow as second line the contades crossfire of artillery battery of 30 guns on one flank of 36 on the other does its best upon this forwardminded infantry but they seem to heed it little walk right forward and to the astonishment of those french horse and of all the world entirely break and ruin the charge made on them and tramp forward in chase of the same the 10000 horse feel astonished insulted and rush out again furiously charging the english halt and serry themselves no fire till they are within forty paces and then such pouring torrents of it as no horse or man can endure rally after rally there is on the part of those 10000 mass after mass of them indignantly plunges onagain ever again about six charges in allbut do not break the english lines one of them regiment mestredecamp raised to a paroxysm does once get through across the first line but is blown back in dreadful circumstances by the second after which they give it up as a thing that cannot be done and rush rearward hither thither the whole seventyfive squadrons of them and between their two wings of infantry are seen boiling in complete disorder  this has lasted about an hour this is essentially the soul of the fightthough there wanted not other activities to right of it and to left on both sides artilleries going at a mighty rate on both wings and counterartilleries superlative practice by captain phillips on our right wing broglio cannonading wangenheim very loudly but with little harm done or suffered on their right wing wangenheim is watchful of that gap between ferdinand and him till it close itself sufficiently their rightwing infantry did once make some attempt there but the prussian horsealways a small body of prussians serve in this allied armyshot out and in a brilliant manner swept them home again  plan of battle herepage 239  artillery and that pretty charge of prussian horse are all one remembers except this of the english and hanover foot in the centre an unsurpassable thing says tempelhof though it so easily might have been a fatalwhich has set contadess centre boiling and reduced contades altogether to water as it were contades said bitterly i have seen what i never thought to be possiblea single line of infantry break through three lines of cavalry ranked in order of battle and tumble them to ruin stenzel v 204  this was the feat this hours work in the centre the essential soul of the fightand had lord george sackville general of the horse come on when galloped for and bidden here had been such a ruin say all judges as seldom came upon an army lord georgeeverlasting disgrace and sorrow on the name of himcould not see his way to coming on delayed haggled would not even let granby his lieutenant come not for a second adjutant not for a third never came on at all but rode to the prince asking how am i to come on who with a politeness i can never enough admire did not instantly kill him but answered in mild tone milord the opportunity is now past whereby contades escaped ruin and was only beaten by about 10 in the morning all was over when a mans centre is gone to water no part of him is far from the fluid state contades retreated into his rabbithole by those nineteen bridgeswell tormented they say by captain phillipss artillery till he got beyond the knolls again broglio who had never been in musketfire at all but had merely barked on wangenheim all morning instead of biting covered the retreat and withdrew into minden and we are a beaten armythanks to lord george not an annihilated one our loss being only 7086 with heavy guns

difficult country the westphalian gates so called fatal to varuss legions long ago contades got under way that very night lost most of his baggage all his conquests that shadowconquest of hanover and more than all his glories versailles shrieking on him resign you let broglio be chiefand on the whole jumbled homeward hither and thither gravitating towards the rhine nothing but wesel to depend on in those parts as heretofore broglio retreated frankfurtway also as usual though not quite so far and at versailles had clearly the victory zealous belleisle could not protect his contades it is not known whether he privately blamed contades or blamed broglio for loss of minden zealous old man what a loss to himself withal had minden been that shadowconquest of hanover is quite vanished and worse in ferdinands spoil were certain letters from belleisle to contades inculcating strange thingsfor example il faut faire un desert du pays all hessen i think lest ferdinand advance on you devant larmee

weeks following  ignominious sackville was tried by courtmartial cashiered declared incapable of again serving his majesty in any military capacityperhaps a mild way of signifying that he wanted the common courage of a soldier zealous majesty always particular in soldier matters proclaimed it officially to be a sentence worse than death and furthermore with his own royal hand taking the pen himself struck out sackville from the list of privycouncillors proper surely and indispensableand should have been persisted in like fate which in a new reign it was not for the rest there was always and is something of enigma in sackvilles palpably bad case it is difficult to think that a sackville wanted common courage this sackville fought duels with propriety in private life he was a surly domineering kind of fellow and had no appearance of wanting spirit it is known he did not love duke ferdinand far from it may not he have been of peculiarly sour humor that morning the luckless fool sulky against ferdinand and his saddling at one oclock sulky against himself against the world and mankind and flabbily disinclined to heroic practices for the moment and the moment came and the man was not there except in that foggy flabby and forever ruinous condition archenholtz alone of writers judges that he expressly wanted to spoil the battle of minden and ferdinands reputation and to get appointed commander in his stead wonderful but may have some vestige of basis too true this sackville was as fit to lead the courses of the stars as to lead armies but such a sackville has ambition and what is fatally more peculiar to him a chance for unfolding itany blockhead has an ambition capable if you encourage it sufficiently of running to the infinite enough of this particular blockhead and may it be long before we see his like again  the english cavalry was in a rage with sackville of the english infantry historians say what is not now much heard of in this country that these

accident on landing the regiment of grenadiers which crossed below the falls having so soon as landed rushed off on the redoubt there on their own score without waiting for the two brigades that were to cross and cooperate above the falls which cut wolfe to the heart and induced him especially as the tide was making again to give up the enterprise altogether and recall everybody while it was yet

the poor city thrown into consternation by actual advent or as good as advent of the russians on the crossen road close by coming come and they did undeniably appear next morning in force on the opposite eastern or kunersdorf side of the river on the top of the oderdam there and demanded instant admission under penalty of general death by fire  within the town stood major arnim a veteran of those parts with 400 militia these with their muskets and with two cannon are the only defence of frankfurt the town has gates but its walls i doubt are mainly gardenwalls and housewalls on the eastern side the river especially if you have cannon on the bridge gives it something of protection but on the western and all other sides it is overhung by heights this frankfurt like its bigger namesake on the mayn is known as a busy trading place its fairs much frequented in those eastern parts and is believed by the russians to be far richer than it is the reader as there happens to be ocular testimony extant johann zudwig kriele schlacht bei kunersdorf mit c berlin 1801 kriele was subsequent pastor in the parish an excellent intelligent man has compiled in brief form with an elaborate chart too a clear account of everything in the battle and before and after it may like to see a little how they behaved there  arnim taking survey of the russian party values it or what he can see of it at 1000 they really were 6000 keeps his drawbridge up and answers stoutly enough no upon which from the oderdam there flies off one fiery grenado one and no morewhich alighted in the house of mrs thielicke a bakers widow who was standing at the doorkilled poor mrs thielicke blew the house considerably to wreck but did not set fire to it amim all the magistrates entreating him for the love of heaven to leave them is secretly shoving off his two cannon to the northern gate and in fact is making his packages with full speed push for custrin thinks arnim and save selves and cannon since no good is to be done here  it was about 11 am when the thielicke grenado fell obstinate arnim would by no means go only packed all the faster a second summons came still no for the third and last time the russians then summon grenadoes a hundred more of them lie ready unless we will we will o merciful servant of czarish majesty passionately signify the magistrates but arnim is still negative still keeps the bridge up one of the hundred does go by way of foretaste this lighted near the ober kirche in the chimney of the town musikus brought the chimney crashing down on him fancy a

withdrawal proposes amim no you to be prisoners of war town at czarish majestys discretion never answers arnim to the outward eargo oh for the love of heaven go cry all official people  arnim deaf to clamor but steadily diligent in getting ready does at last go through the lebus suburb quick march steady yet at his best steptaking the townkeys in his pocket and leaving the drawbridge up one is sorry for poor arnim and his 400 militia whose conduct was perfect under difficulties and alarms but proved unsuccessful the terrified magistrates finding their keys gone and the conflagrative russians at their gates got blacksmiths on the instant smote down by chisel and mallet the locked drawbridge smote open the gates enter o gracious sirs and may czarish majesty have mercy on us so that arnim had small start for marchers on foot and was overtaken about halfway would not yield still though the odds were overwhelming drew himself out on the best ground discoverable made hot resistance hot and skilful but in vain about six in the evening arnim and party were brought back prisoners to frankfurt againself surviving men cannons and all self in a wounded stateand were locked in various brewhouses little of careful surgery i should fear poor arnim man could do no more and he has been unfortunate  it is by no means our intention to describe the iliad of miseries the agitations terrors and disquietudes the tribulation and utter harrowing to despair which poor frankfurt underwent incessantly from that day forward for about five weeks to come the furnishings of victual russian stock quite out were to an inconceivable amount surrender of arms of linens cloths of everything useful to a hungry army above all things of horses so that at last there were but four horses left in all frankfurt andbut we must not go into details  on the second day besides all this what will be significant of it all there was exacted ransom of 600000 thalers 90000 pounds or you shall be delivered to the cossacks frankfurt has not above 12000 inhabitants within its bounds here is a sudden polltax of 7 pounds 10s per head frankfurt has not such a sum the most rigorous collection did not yield above the tenth part of it and more than once those sanguinary vagabonds were openly drawn out pitchlink in hand the 90000 pounds or civic presidency office in frankfurt was not a bed of roses the poor magistrates rushed distractedly about wrung out moneys to the last drop moneys and in the end plate from those that had it went in tearful deputation to general soltikofa severe proud kind of man capable perhaps of being flatteredwho usually locked them up instead magistrates were locked in russian ward at one time for almost a week sat in the blazing sun if you try for the shade of a tree the sentry handles arms upon youand were like to die to me kriele it is a miracle how the most of us lived nay we never really wanted food so kind was providence so generous our poor neighbors out of all the towns round the utmost of money that could be raised was 6000 pounds nothing but some little of plate and our bill for the remainder soltikof a high kind of gentleman saw at last how it stood let the magistrates out of ward sent back the platenothing of thatnay czarish majesty was herself generous and forgave the bill on our petition next year cossacks indeed were a plunderous wild crew but the russians kept them mostly without the gates the regular russians were civil and orderly officers and mengreatly beyond the austrians in behavior kriele schlacht bei kunersdorf pp 115 in compressed state by these few traits conceive frankfurt this now forgotten in most books is a background on which things were transacted still memorable to everybody  friday august 3d general loudon came to hand arrived early in the guben or western suburb his 18000 and he in high spirits naturally and somewhat exultant to have evaded friedrich but found a reception that surprised him the russians had been living in the hope of junction but still more vividly in that of meal auxiliaries humphonly 18000 of them how much welcomer had been as many hundredweights of meal loudon had pushed his baggage direct into frankfurt and likewise a requisition of such and such proviants weights of meal and the like in exuberant amount to be furnished straightway by the city neither of which procedures would the russians hear of for a moment out with you said they roughly to the baggagepeople quarter in the guben suburb or where you like not here and with regard to the requisition of proviant they answered in a scornful angry key proviant you too without it you have not brought us meal according to covenant instead of meal you bring us 18000 new eaters most of them on horsebacksatan thank you from frankfurt be very certain you can get no ounce of meal frankfurt is our own poor mealbag dreadfully scanty stay outside and feed where and how you can  all this loudon though of hot temper easily capable of rising to the fierce point had to endure in silence for the common interest loudons own table is furnished from frankfurt no other austrian mans all others have to shift how they can sad requisitioning needed and sad plunder to supplement it the austrian behavior was very bad say the frankfurters in particular they had burnt gradually all the cornmills in the country within many miles not one mill standing when they left usand four horses all the conveyance power we had soltikof lodges in great pomp much soldiery and cannon parading before his doors not an undignified man or an inhuman or essentially foolish but very high in his ways and distasteful to austrian dignitaries  the russian army lies mainly across oder encamped on the judenberg and eastward there along the heights near three miles to kunersdorf and beyond they expect friedrich at the gates of frankfurt shortly know well that they cannot defend frankfurt they calculate that friedrich will attack them in their judenberg encampment but hope they are nearly ready for him there loudon from the guben suburb will hasten across at any momentwelcome on such fighting occasion though ill seen when the question is of eating the russians have their wagenburg on an island southward farther up the river they have three pontoon bridges leading thither a free retreat should they be beaten and in the mean while are intrenching themselves as only daun wouldcannon and redoubts all round those heightsand except it be screwing frankfurt to do its impossible duty and carting provender with all the horses except four have not much farther to do but wait till the king come which will be speedily it is probable  wednesday august 8th russian and austrian generals a cheerful party of them had rendezvoused at fischers muhle a mill not yet burnt and a pleasant tavern as well in one of the prettiest valleys in the western environsintending to dine there and have a pleasant day but the millers boy runs in upon them wideeyed himmel und erde prussian hussars it was in verity prussian hussars the king of prussia with them in person he is come out reconnoitringthe day after his arrival in those parts the pleasuring generals russian and austrian sprang to horseback at their swiftesthope of dinner gone futile except to the intervening prussian hussarsand would have all been captured but for that millers boy whose mill too was burnt before long this gallop home of the undined generals into frankfurt was the first news we poor frankfurters had of the kings arrival  the king has been punctual to his reckoning he picked up wedell at mullrosenot too cordial to wedells people none of you speak to those beaten wretches ordered he till perhaps they wipe off their zullichau stain on the 7th friedrich advanced to frankfurt neighborhood took camp between wulkow and lebusand has just been out reconnoitring and has raised fancy what emotion in poor frankfurt lying under its nightmare next day august 9th from wulkowlebus hand we of frankfurt heard a great firing cannonsalvos musketvolleys nothing of fight the russian officers told us it is the king of prussia doing joyfire for minden of which we till now knew nothing  friedrich on survey of this russianaustrian army some 90000 in number with such posts artilleries advantages judges that he counting only 40000 is not strong enough and indeed had so anticipated and already judged and accordingly has finck on march hitherward againberlin must take its risk saxony must shift for itself in the interim finck is due in two daysnot here at lebus precisely but at another place appointed finck will raise him to 50000 and then business can begin contrary to russian expectation friedrich does not attack frankfurt seems quite quiet in his cantonmentshe is quietly if one knew it making preparations farther down the river about reitwein between this and custrin there arrangements are proceeding by no means of a showy sort  the russianaustrian army quits frankfurt leaving only some hundreds of garrison loudon moves across soltikof across to the oderdam and farther and lie powerfully intrenched on those kunersdorf heights and sandy moorlands which go eastward at rightangles to oderdam one of the strongest camps imaginable all round there to beyond kunersdorf and back again near three miles each way they have a ring of redoubts and artillery without end and lie there in order of battle or nearly so ready for friedrich when he shall attack through frankfurt or otherwise they face to the north reitwein way as it happens to their rear and indeed to their front only not so close are woods and intricate wilds loudon has the left flank that is to say loudons left hand is towards the oderdam and frankfurt he lies at the rothe vorwerk red grange a farmstead much mentioned just now rather to northwestward of the jew hill and jew churchyard judenberg and judenkirchhof likewise much mentioned and in advance of the general mass soltikofs headquarter i rather understand is on the right wing probably in kunersdorf itself or beyond that village there at least our highly important russian right wing is there elaborately fortified and half a mile farther endson the edge of steep dells the russian brink of which is strongly fringed with cannon while beyond on the farther brink they have built an abatis so making assurance doubly sure looking to the northward all these 90000 their left rather southward of frankfurt bridge over which friedrich will probably arrive leftward somewhat to rearward they have bridges of their own should anything sinister befall three bridges which lead into that oder island and the russian wagenburg there  august 10th finck punctual to time arrives in the neighborhood of reitwein which is some ten miles down stream from lebus from frankfurt perhaps fifteen friedrich the same day is there before him eager to complete the bridges and get to business one bridge is of pontoons one of oderboats floated up from custrin bridges are not begun till nightfall lest eyes be abroad are ready in the minimum of time and so during the same night of the 10th all the infantry with their artilleries and battlefurnitures pour over in two columns the cavalry at the due point of time riding by a ford short way to the right and at four in the gray of the august morning saturday 11th august 1759 all persons and things find themselves correctly across ranked there in those barren muchindented pasturegrounds of goritz or of oetscher intending towards kunersdorf ready for unfolding into order of battle there they leave their heavy baggage at goritz wunsch to guard the bridges and it and in succinct condition are all under way at one in the afternoon we are got to leissow and bischofsee scrubby hamlets as the rest all are not above two miles from kunersdorf the august day is windless shiny sultry man and horse are weary with the labors and with the want of sleep we decide to bivouac here and rest on the scrubby surface heather or whatever it is till tomorrow  finck is vanguard ahead short way and with his left on a bit of lake or bog the army is in two lines with its right on leissow and has cavalry in the kind of wood which there is to rear friedrich having settled the positions rides out reconnoitring hither thither over the heights of trettin the day being still hot he suffers considerably from thirst it is our one anecdote in that arid tract at last a peasant does bring him direct from the fountain a jug of pure cold water whom lucky man the king rewarded with a thaler and not only so but the man being intelligent of the localities took with him to answer questions readers too may desire to gain some knowledge of the important ground now under survey  frankfurt a very ancient town not a very beautiful says my note stands on an alluvium which has been ground down from certain clay hills on the left bank of oder it counted about 12000 inhabitants in friedrichs time has now perhaps about 20000 not half the bulk of its namesake on the mayn but with three great fairs annually and much trade of the rough kind on this left or west bank of oder the country is arable moderately grassy and umbrageous the prospect round you not unpleasant but eastward over the river nothing can be more in contrast oder is of swift current of turbid color as it rolls under frankfurt bridgewooden bridge with dam suburb at the enda river treeless desolate as you look up and down which has evidently often changed its course since grinding down that alluvium as site for frankfurt and which though now holding mainly to northward is still given to be erratic and destructive on the eastern low groundshad not the frankfurters built an oderdam on that side a broad strong earthmound running for many miles and confining its floods beyond the dam there are traces of an old oder alte oder and in fact oder in primeval and in recent time has gone along manystreamed indenting quarrying leaving lakelets quagmires miscellaneous sandy tumult at a great rate on that eastern shore making of it one of the unloveliest scenes of chaotic desolation anywhere to be met withfallen unlovelier than ever in our own more recent times  what we call the heights of kunersdorf is a broad chain of knolls coming out at rightangles or as a kind of spur from the eastern high grounds direct towards oder and frankfurt millhill muhlberg is the root or easternmost part of this spur from the muhlberg over kunersdorf to oderdam which is the whole length of the spur or chain of knolls will be little short of four miles the breadth of the chain is nowhere one milewhich is its grand defect as a camp too narrow for manoeuvring in here atop and on the three sides of this block of knolls was fought the furious battle of kunersdorf to be fought tomorrow one of the most furious ever known a block of knolls memorable ever since  to all appearance it was once some big island or chain of islands in the oder deluges it is still cut with sudden hollowskuhgrund cowhollow tiefe weg deep way and westernmost of all and most important for us here hohle grund big hollow let us call it loudons hollow people subsequently called itand is everywhere strangely tumbled up into knolls blunt or sharp the work of primeval oder in his rages in its highest knollsof which let readers note specially the spitzberg the muhlberg the judenbergit rises nowhere to 150 feet perhaps the general height of it may be about 100 on each side of it especially on the north the country is of most intricate character bushy scraggy with brooklets or muddy oozings wandering about especially with a thing called the hunerfliess henfloss which springs in the eastern woods and has inconceivable difficulty to get into oderif it get at all this was a sore floss to friedrich tomorrow henfloss struggles painfully meandering and oozing along the northern side sometimes close sometimes not of our chain of knolls along the south side of it in our time through the middle of it goes the highway to reppen from that highway will his attack come thought the russians always till today on the north to leissow to trettin where friedrich is now on survey go various wheeltracks but no firm road a most intricate unlovely country withered bentgrasses heath perhaps gorse and on both sides a great deal of straggling forestwood reaching eastward and especially southward for many miles  for the rest to our illluck in this place the battlefield of kunersdorf has had a peculiar fate in the world that of being blown away by the winds the then scene of things exists no longer the descriptions in the old books are gone hopelessly irrecognizable in our time there is not anywhere a tract more purely of tumbled sand than all this between kunersdorf and dam vorstadt and you judge without aid of record or tradition that it is greatly altered for the worse since friedrichs timesome rabbitcolony or other the like insignificancy eating out the roots till all vegetation died and the wind got hold and set it dancingand that in 1759 when russian human beings took it for a camp it must have been at least coherent more or less covered held together by some film of scrubby vegetation not blowing about in every wind as now kunersdorf stands with its northern end pushed into that kuhgrund cowhollow which must then have been a grassy place eastward of kunersdorf the ground has still some skin of peat and sticks together but westward all that three miles it is a mere tumult of sandhills tumbled about in every direction so diligent have the conies been and then the winds no gullet or definite cut or hollow now traceable anywhere but only an endless imbroglio of twisted sandheaps and sandhollows which continually alter in the windstorms sand wholly andexcept the strong paved highway that now runs through it to reppen meseritz and the polish frontier and is strongly paved till it get through kunersdorfchaotic wholly a scene of heaped barrenness and horror not to be matched but in sahara the features of the battle quite blown away and indecipherable in our time  a hundred years ago it would have some tattered skinof peat of heather and dwarf whins with the sand cropping out only here and there so one has to figure it in soltikofs daybefore the conies ruined it which was not till within the last sixty years as appears krieles book in 1801 still gives no hint of change the kuhgrund which now has nothing but dry sand for the most industrious ruminant is still a place of succulence and herbage in krieles time deep way where at one point two carts could not pass was not yet blown out of existence but has still a well in it for kriele hohle grund since called loudons hollow with the jew hill and jew churchyard beyond seem tolerable enough places to kriele probably not unlike what the surrounding country still is a country of poor villages and of wild ground flat generally and but tolerably green with lakelets bushes scrubs and intricate meandering little runlets and oozelets and in general with more of forest so called than now isthis is kunersdorf chain of knolls soltikofs intrenched camp at present destined to become very famous in the world after lying so long obscure under oder and its rages tourists note autumnn 1852  from the knolls of trettin that saturday afternoon friedrich takes view of the russian camp all lying bright enough there from muhlberg to judenberg convenient to our glass between us and the evening sun batteries most abundant difficulties great soltikof just ahead here 72000 loudon at the red grange yonder on their extreme left with 18000 more an uncommonly strong position for 90000 against 50000 one thing strikes friedrich on front in this northern side close by the base of the russian camp runsfor the present away from oder but intending to join it elsewherea paltry little brook henfloss so called with at least two successive mills on it kleine muhle grosse muhle and on the northern shore of it spilling itself out into a wet waste called elsbruch alder waste which is especially notable to friedrich alder waste watery scrubby no passage there thinks friedrich which his peasant with the waterjug confirms tell me however inquires friedrich with strictness from the red grange yonder where general loudon is if you wished to get over to the hohle grund or to the judenberg would you cross that henfloss it is not crossable your majesty one has to go round quite westward by the dam what from rothe vorwerk to big hollow no passage say you no crossing none your majesty insists the peasantwho is not aware that the russians have made one of firm trestles and logs and use it daily for highway there an error of some interest to friedrich within the next twentyfour hours  friedrich himself does not know this bit of ground but there is with him besides the peasant a major linden whose regiment used to lie in frankfurt of whom friedrich makes minute questioning linden answers confidently has been over all this tract a hundred times but knows it only as a hunter says tempelhof tempelhof iii 186 not as a soldier which he ought to have done his answers are supposed to have misled friedrich on various points and done him essential damage friedrichs view of the case that evening is by no means so despondent as might be imagined he regards the thing as difficult not as impossibleand one of his anxieties is that he be not balked of trying it straightway retiring to his hut in bischofsee he makes two dispositions of admirable clearness brevity and calculated for two contingencies given in tempelhof iii 182 183 that of the enemy retaining his now posture and that of the enemy making off for reppenwhich latter does not at all concern us as matters turned of the former the course will unfold itself to us in practice shortly at 2 am friedrich will be on foot again at 3 on march againthe last phenomenon at bischofsee this night is some sudden glare of disastrous light rising over the woodsrussians burning kunersdorf as neighbors are sorry to hear that is the finale of much russian rearranging and tumbling this day that barbarous burning of kunersdorf before going to bed tomorrow various other poor villages got burnt by them which they had better have left standing  the russians on hearing that friedrich was across at goritz and coming on them from the north side not from frankfurt by the reppen highway were in great agitation not thrown into terror but into manifold haste knowing what hasty adversary there was endless readjustments they have to make a day of tumultuous business with the russians this saturday 11th when the news reached them they inverted their front say all the books but friedrichs own not coming by the reppen highway then think they and thereupon changed rear to front as at zorndorf but more elaboratelywhich i should not mention were it not that hereby their late right wing on the muhlberg has in strict speech become their left and there is ambiguity and discrepancy in some of the books should any poor reader take to studying them on this matter changed their front which involves much interior changing readjusting of batteries and the like that of burning kunersdorf was the barbaric winding up of all this barbaric and in the military sense absurd poor kunersdorf could have been burnt at any moment if needful and to the russians the keeping of it standing was the profitable thing as an impediment to friedrich in his advance there they have laid it flat and permeable ashes all of itexcept the church only which is of stone not so combustible and may have uses withal has perhaps served as temporary lockup prison for the night to some of those frankfurt deputations and their troublesome wailings and may serve as temporary hospital tomorrow who knows  readjustments in the russian camp were manifold but these are as nothing in the tumultuous business of the day carting of their baggage every article of value to that safe wagenburg in the river driving of cattlethe very driving of cattle through frankfurt endless herds of them gathered by the cossacks from far and wide lasted for fourandtwenty hours oxen in frankfurt that day were at the rate of ten shillings per head often enough you were offered a fullgrown young steer for a loaf of bread nay the cossacks when there was absolutely no bidder would slaughter down the animal leave its carcass in the streets and sell the hide for a tympffivepence very bad silver at present never before or since was seen in frankfurt such a saturday for bellowing and braying and raging and tumulting all through the day and through the night ushering in such a sunday too  sunday about 3 in the morning friedrich is on march againrussians still in their place and disposition first not second at all to be our rule of action friedrich in two columns marches off eastward through the woods as if for reppen quite away from the russians and their muhlberg but intending to circle round at the due point and come down upon their right flank there left flank as he persists to call it out of the woods and clasp it in his arms in an impressive unexpected way in two columns which are meant as usual to be the two lines of battle seidlitz with chosen cavalry is at the head of column first and will be left wing were we on the ground eugen of wurtemberg closing the rear of column first will he or finck and he together be right wing that is the order of marchorder of battle we shall find had to alter itself somewhat for reasons extremely valid  finck with his 12000 is to keep his present ground to have two good batteries got ready each on its knoll ahead which shall wait silent in the interim finck to ride out reconnoitring with many general officers and to make motions and ostentations in a word to persuade the russians that here is the main army coming on from the north all which finck does avoiding as his orders were any firing or serious commencement of business till the king reappear out of the woods the russians give finck and his general officers a cannon salvo here and there without effect and get no answer the king does not see his way then after all think the russians their cossacks go scouring about on the southern side burn schwetig and reipzig without the least advantage to themselves most of the cavalry and a regiment or two of excellent austrian grenadiers are with loudon near the red grange in front of the russian extreme leftbut will have stept over into big hollow at a moment of crisis  the kings march through the forest of reppen was nothing like so expeditious as had been expected there are thickets intricacies runlets boggy oozes indifferent to one man well mounted but vitally important to 30000 with heavy cannon to bring on boggy oozings especiallythere is one dirty stream or floss hunerfliess henfloss which wanders dismally through those recesses issuing from the far south with dirty daughters dismally wandering into it and others that cannot get into it being of the lake kind these in their weary circling recircling course towards oderfaule laacke foul lake lithermere as it were foul bridge swines nook schweinebuckt and many othersoccasion endless difficulty whether major linden was shot that day or what became of him after i do not know but it was pity he had not studied the ground with a soldiers eye instead of a hunters plumping suddenly at last upon henfloss itself friedrich has to turn angularly angularly which occasions great delay the heavy cannon wallguns brought from custrin have twelve horses each and cannot turn among the trees but have to be unyoked reyoked turned round by handin short it was eight in the morning before friedrich arrived at the edge of the wood on the klosterberg walckberg and other woody bergs or knolls within reach of muhlberg and behind the preliminary abatis there abatis which was rather of service to him than otherwiseand began privately building his batteries  at eight oclock he with column first which is now becoming line first centre of line first if we reckon finck as rightwing is there busy in that manner column second which was to have been rear line is still a pretty way behind and has many difficulties before it gets into kunersdorf neighborhood or can having wriggled itself into a kind of leftwing cooperate on the russian position from the south side on the north side finck has been ready these five hoursfriedrich speeds the building of his batteries silent too the russians have not yet noticed us by degrees the russians do notice something shoot out cossacks to reconnoitre cossacks in quantity who are so insolent and venture so very near our gunners on the north battery give them a blast of satisfactory grapeshot one and then another four blasts in all satisfactory to the gunner mindtill the kings self with a look with a voice came galloping silence will you the russians took no offence still considering finck to be the main thing and friedrich some scout partytill at last  halfpast eleven everything being ready on the walck hill friedrichs batteries opened there in a sudden and volcanic way volcanically answered by the russians as soon as possible who have 72 guns on this muhlberg and are nothing loath upon whom fincks battery is opening from the north withal friedrich has 60 cannon hereabouts on the walckberg on the little spitzberg called seidlitz hill ever since all playing diligently on the head and south shoulder of this muhlberg while fincks battery opens on the north shoulder could he but get near enough volcanic to a degree all these nor are the russians wanting though they get more and more astonished tempelhof who was in it says he never except at torgau next year heard a louder cannonade loud exceedingly and more or less appalling to the russian imagination but not destructive in proportion the distance being too considerable1950 paces at the nearest as tempelhof has since ascertained by measuring friedrichs two batteries however as they took the russians in the flank or by enfilade did good execution the russian guns were illpointed the russian batteries wrongbuilt batteries so built as did not allow them sight of the hollow they were meant to defend tempelhof iii 186 187  after above half an hour of this friedrich orders storm of the muhlberg forward on it with what of enfilading it has had eight grenadier battalions a chosen vanguard appointed for the work names of battalions all given and deathless in the prussian warannals tramp forth on this service cross the abatis which the russian grenadoes have mostly burnt down into the hollow steady as planets with a precision and coherency says tempelhof which even on the paradeground would have deserved praises once well in the hollow they suffer nothing though the blind russian fire going all over their heads rages threefold suffered nothing in the hollow nor till they reached almost the brow of the muhlberg and were within a hundred steps of the russian guns these were the critical steps these final ones such torrents of grapeshot and musketshot and sheer death bursting out here at last upon the eight battalions as they come above ground who advanced unwavering all the fasterspeed ones only safety they poured into the russian gunners and musketry battalions one volley of choicest quality which had a shaking effect then with level bayonets plunge on the batteries which are all empty before we can leap into them artillerymen musketeer battalions all on wing general whirlpool spreading and so in ten minutes the muhlberg and its guns are ours ever since zorndorf an idea had got abroad says tempelhof that the russians would die instead of yielding but it proved far otherwise here down as far as kunersdorf which may be about a mile westward the russians are all in a whirl at best hanging in tatters and clumps their officers struggling against the flight mixed groups you would see huddled together a hundred men deep the russian left wing is beaten had we our cannon up here our cavalry up here the russian army were in a bad way  this is a glorious beginning completed i think as far almost as kunersdorf by one oclock and could the iron continue to be struck while it is at whiteheat as now the result were as good as certain that was friedrichs calculation but circumstances which he had not counted on some which he could not count on sadly retarded the matter his left wing rear line which should now have been left wing from southward his right wing from northward and finck farther west were now on the instant to have simultaneously closed upon the beaten russians and crushed them altogether the right wing conquerors of the muhlberg are here but neither finck nor the left can be simultaneous with them finck and his artillery are much retarded with the flosses and poor single bridges and of the left wing there are only some vanguard regiments capable of helping who drove out the russians from kunersdorf churchyard as their first featno main body yet for a long while such impediments such intricacies of bog and bush the entire wing does at last get to the southeast of kunersdorf free of the wood but finds contrary to linden with his hunter eye an intricate meshwork of meres and straggling lakes two of them in the burnt village itself no passing of these except on narrow isthmuses which necessitate change of rank and rechange and our left wing cannot with all its industry march up that is arrive at the enemy in fighting line without the painfulest delays  and then the getting forward of our cannon on the muhlberg itself the seventytwo russian guns owing to difference of calibre or artillerymen know what cannot be used by us a few light guns tempelhof to one of them a poor four in all with perhaps 100 shot to each did by the kings order hasten to the top of the muhlberg and never did tempelhof see a finer chance for artillery than there soft sloping ground with russians simmering ahead of you all the way down to kunersdorf a mile long by horizontal pointing you had such reboundings ricochets and carried beautiful execution tempelhof soon spent his hundred shots but it was not at once that any of our sixty heavy guns could be got up thither twelve horses to each fancy it and what baffling delays here and elsewhereand how the russian whirlpool was settling more and more in the interim and had in part settled in part got through to the rear and been replaced by fresh troops  friedrichs activities and suppressed and insuppressible impatiences in this interval are also conceivable though not on record for us the swiftest of men tied down in this manner with the blaze of perfect victory ahead were the moments not running out slower or faster he thinks i suppose the victory is his and that he must possess his soul till things do arrive it was in one and more of those embargoed intervals that he wrote to berlin preuss ii 212 n which is waiting as if for life or death the issue of this scene sixty miles distant russians beaten rejoice with me four successive couriers i believe with messages to that effect and at last a fifth with dolefully contrary news  in proportion as the cannon and other necessaries gradually got in the fight flamed up from its embers more and more and there ensuedthe russians being now ranked again fronting eastward now in many lines and very fiercea second still deadlier bout friedrich furiously diligent on their front and right flank finck from the alder waste battering and charging uphill and under difficulties from those flosses and single bridges on their left flank this too after long deadly efforts on the prussian part ended again clearly in their favor their enemies broken a second time and driven not only out of kunersdorf and the kuhgrund but some say almost to the foot of the judenbergwhat can only be very partially true broken portions of the russian left flanksome of fincks people in their victorious wrath may have chased these very far but it is certain the general russian mass rallied again a long way short of the judenbergthough the ground being all obliterated by the rabbits and the winds nobody can now know with exactitude where  and indeed the battle from this point onwards becomes blurred and confused to us only its grosser features visible henceforth where the big spitzberg was so terribly important soon nobody can now tell me except from maps londons motions too are obscure though important i believe his grenadiers had not yet been in the fire but am certain they are now come out of big hollow fresh for the rescue and have taken front rank in this second rally that is made loudons cavalry loudon himself has in hand and waits with them in a fit place he has 18000 fresh men and an eye like few others on a field of war loudons 18000 are fresh of the prussians that can by no means be said i should judge it must be 3 of the afternoon the day is windless blazing one of the hottest august days and nobody for twelve hours past could command a drink of water very fresh the poor prussians cannot be they have done two bouts of excellent fighting tumbled the russians well back stormed many batteries and taken in all 180 cannon  at this stage it appears finck and many generals seidlitz among the others were of opinion that in present circumstances with troops so tired and the enemy nearly certain to draw off if permitted here had been enough for one day and that there ought to be pause till tomorrow friedrich knew well the need of rest but friedrich impatient of things halfdone especially of russians halfbeaten would not listen to this proposal which was reckoned upon him as a grave and tragic fault all the rest of his life though favorable judges who were on the ground tempelhof for one tempelhof iii 194 are willing to prove that pausing hereat the point we had really got to a little beyond the kuhgrund namely and not a couple of miles westward at the foot of the jew hill where vague rumor puts uswas not feasible or reasonable friedrich considers with himself our left wing has hardly yet been in fire calls out the entire left wing foot and horse these are to emerge from their meshwork of lakes about kunersdorf and bear a hand along with us on the russian front hereespecially to sweep away that raging battery they have on the big spitzberg and make us clear of it the big spitzberg lies to south and ahead of the russian right as now ranked fatally covers their right flank and half ruins the attack in front big spitzberg is blown irrecognizable in our time but it was then an allimportant thing  the leftwing infantry thread their lakelabyrinth the soonest possible have to rank again on the hither side under a tearing fire from that spitzberg can then at last and do storm onwards upwards but cannot with their best efforts take the spitzberg and have to fall back under its floods of tearing caseshot and retire out of range to friedrichs blank disappointment try it you then seidlitz you saved us at zorndorf seidlitz though it is an impossible problem to storm batteries with horse does charge in for the russian flank in spite of its covering battery but the torrents of grapeshot are insufferable the seidlitz people torn in gaps recoil whirl round and do not rank again till beyond the lakes of kunersdorf seidlitz himself has got wounded and has had to be carried away  and in brief from this point onwards all goes aback with the prussians more and more repeated attempts on that spitzberg battery prove vain to advance without it is impossible friedrichs exertions are passionate almost desperate rallying animating newordering everywhere in the hottest of the fire thrice he personally led on the main attack he has had two horses shot down under him mounting a third this too gets a bullet in an artery of the neck and is about falling when two adjutants save the king in his waistcoatpocket some small gold case etui has got smitten flat by a bullet which would otherwise have ended matters the people about him remonstrate on such exposure of a life beyond value he answers curtly we must all of us try every method here to win the battle i like every other must stand to my duty here these and a second brief word or two farther on are all of articulate that we hear from him this day  friedrichs wearied battalions here on the heights while the spitzberg to left goes so ill fight desperately but cannot prevail farther and in spite of friedrichs vehement rallyings and urgings gradually lose groundback at last to kunersdorf and the kuhgrund again the loudon grenadiers and exclaimed masses of fresh russians are not to be broken but advance and advance fancy the panting deathlabors and spasmodic toilings and bafflings of those poor prussians and their king nothing now succeeding the deathagony now come all hearts growing hopeless only one heart still seeing hope the spitzberg is impossible tried how often i know not finck from the alder waste with his infantry attacks and again attacks without success let the cavalry go round then and try there seidlitz we have not you eugen of wurtemberg lead them eugen leads them cuirassiers or we will forget what round by the eastern end of the muhlberg then westward along the alder waste finally southward against the russian flank himself foremost and at the gallop for chargingeugen looking round finds his men all gone and has to gallop the other way gets wounded to boot puttkammer with hussars then tried it puttkammer was shot dead and his hussars too could do nothing  back slowly back go the prussians generally nothing now succeeds with them back to the kuhgrund again fairly over the steep brow there the russians serrying their ranks atop rearranging their many guns there once more rose frightful struggle desperate attempt by the fordone prussians to retake that height lasted fifteen minutes line to line not fifty yards asunder such musketryour last cartridges withal ardent prussian parties trying to storm up few ever getting to the top none ever standing there alive one minute this was the deathagony of the battle loudon waiting behind the spitzberg dashes forward now towards the kuhgrund and our left flank at sight of which a universal feeling shivers through the prussian heart hope ended thenand their solid ranks rustle everywhere and melt into one wild deluge ebbing from the place as fast as it can  it is towards six oclock the sweltering sun is now fallen low and veiled gray evening sinking over those wastes ny atil donc pas un bougre de boulet qui puisse matteindree is there no one b of a ball that can reach me then exclaimed friedrich in despair such a day he had never thought to see the pillar of the state the prussian army itself gone to chaos in this manner friedrich still passionately struggles exhorts commands entreats even with tears children dont forsake me in this pinch kinder verlasset heute mich euren konig euren vater nicht kriele p 169but all ears are deaf on the muhlberg one regiment still stood by their guns covering the retreat but the retreat is more and more a flight no prussian army was ever seen in such a state at the bridges of that henfloss there was such a crowding all our guns got jammed and had to be left 165 of them of various calibre and the whole of the russian 180 that were once in our hands had the chase been vigorous this prussian army had been heard of no more but beyond the muhlberg there was little or no pursuit

poor frankfurt tremulously thanking heaven for him and for such an omen in spite of their wagenburg and these pontoonbridges it appears there would have been no retreat for the russians except into wunschs cannon wagenburg way latish in the afternoon there was such a scramble of runaways and retreating baggage all was jammed into impassability scarcely could a single man get through in case of defeat the russian army would have had no chance but surrender or extermination tempelhof iii 194 in retzow ii 110 is some dubious traditionary stuff on the matter at dark however wunsch had summons so truculent in style he knew what it meant and answering in words peremptorily no with a like emphasis privately got ready again and at midnight disappeared got to reitwein without accident  friedrich found at oetscher nothing but huts full of poor wounded men and their miseries and surgerieshe took shelter himself in a hut which had been plundered by cossacks in the past days but which had fewer wounded than others and could be furnished with some bundles of dry straw kriele has a pretty anecdote with names and particulars of two poor lieutenants who were lying on the floor as he entered this hut they had lain there for many hours the surgeons thinking them desperate which friedrich did not ach kinder alas children you are badly wounded then ja your majesty but how goes the

nation fallen prisoners made the queens soirees the finest in the world for splendor and variety at that time rodenbeck i 390 c c  one other note we save for the sake of poor major kleist poet of the spring as he was then called a valiant punctual soldier and with a turn for literature as well who wrote really pleasant fine things new at that time and rapturously welcome though too much in the sentimental vein for the times which have followed major kleistthere is a general kleist a colonel kleist of the green hussars called grune kleist a terrible cutting fellowthis is not grune kleist this is the poet of the spring whose fate at kunersdorf made a tragic impression in all intelligent circles of teutschland here is krieles note abridged  christian ewald von kleist poet of the spring a pommern gentleman now in his fortyfourth year was of fincks division had come on after those eight battalions took the first russian battery that is muhlberg and had been assisting with zeal at the taking of three other batteries regardless of twelve contusions which he gradually got at the third battery he was farther badly hurt on the left arm and the right took his colonels place nevertheless whom he now saw fall led the regiment muthig forward on the fourth battery a caseshot smashed his right leg to pieces he fell from his horse hour not given shall we say 3 pm sank exclaiming kinder my children dont forsake your king and fainted there was carried to rear and leftward laid down on some dry spot in the elsbruch not far from the kuhgrund and a surgeon brought the surgeon while examining was torn away by caseshot kleist lay bleeding without help a friend of his pfau who told kriele one of fincks generals came riding that way kleist called to him asked how the battle went uncommonly glad to hear we are still progressive pfau undertook and tried his utmost for a carriage to kleist did send one of fincks own carriages but after such delays that the prussians were now yielding poor kleists had become russian ground and the carriage could not get in  kleist lay helpless no luck worse than his in the evening cossacks came round him stript him starknaked threw him face foremost into the nearest swampy place and went their way one of these devils had something so absurd and tenierslike in the face of him that kleist in his pains could not help laughing at remembrance of it in the night some russian hussars human and not cossack found kleist in this situation took him to a dry place put a cloak over him kindled a watchfire for themselves and gave him water and bread towards morning they hastened away throwing an 8groschen stuck ninepenny piece shilling say halfcrown on his cloakwith human farewell but cossacks again came again stript him naked and bare towards noon of the 13th kleist contrived to attract some russian cavalry troop passing that way and got speech of the captain one fackelberg a german who at once set about helping himand had him actually sent into frankfurt in a carriage that evening to the house of a professor nikolai where was plenty of surgery and watchful affection after near thirty hours of such a lair his wounds seemed still curable there was hope for ten days in the tenth night 22d23d august the shivered pieces of bone disunited themselves cut an arterywhich after many trials could not be tied august 24th at two in the morning he diedgreat sorrow august 26th there was soldiers funeral poor kleists coffin borne by twelve russian grenadiers very many russian officers attending who had come from the camp for that end one russian staffofficer of them unbuckling his own sword to lay on the bier as there was want of one king friedrich had kleists portrait hung in the garnison kirche freemason lodge in 1788 set up a monument to him kriele pp 3943which still stands on the frankfurt pavement and is now in sadly ruinous state  the prussian loss in this battle was besides all the cannon and fieldequipages 6000 killed 13000 wounded of which latter 2000 badly who fell to the russians as prisoners in all about 19000 men nor was the russian loss much lighter of russians and austrians together near 18000 as tempelhof counts which will not surprise your majesty reports soltikof to his czarina who are aware that the king of prussia sells his defeats at a dear rate and privately soltikof was heard to say let me fight but another such victory and i may go to petersburg with the news of it myself with the staff in my hand the joy at petersburg striving not to be braggart or immodest was solemn steady and superlative a great feat indeed for russia this victory over such a kingthough a kind of grudge that it was due to loudon dwelt in spite of loudons politic silence on that point unpleasantly in the background the chase they had shamefully neglected it is said certain russian officers who had charge of that business stept into a peasants cottage to consult on it contrived somehow to find tolerable liquor there and sat drinking instead preuss ii 217     chapter vsaxony without defence schmettau surrenders dresden  friedrichs despair did not last quite four days on the fourth dayday after leaving reitweinthere is this little document which still exists of more comfortable tenor my dear majorgeneral von wunschyour letter of the 16th to lieutenantgeneral von finck punctually

18 finding that except tottleben warily reconnoitring with a few cossacks no russians showed themselves at reitwein that the russians were encamping and intrenching on the winehills south of frankfurt not meaning anything immediatehe took heart again ranked his 23000 sent for general kleist from pommern with his antiswedish handful leave the swedes alone as usual in time of crisis considered that artilleries and furnishings could come to him from berlin which is but 60 miles that there still lay possibility ahead and that though only a miracle could save him he would try it to the very last  a great relief this of coming to oneself again till death thenrage on ye elements and black savageries friedrichs humor is not despondent now or afterwards though at this time it is very sad very angry and as it were scorning even to hope but he is at all times of beautifully practical turn and has in his very despair a sobriety of eyesight and a fixed steadiness of holding to his purpose which are of rare quality his utterances to dargens about this time and onwardbrief hints spontaneous almost unconsciousgive curious testimony of his glooms and moody humors of which the reader shall see something for the present he is in deep indignation with his poor troops among other miseries actual running away he will have it to be and takes no account of thirst hunger heat utter weariness and physical impossibility this lasts for some weeks but in general there is nothing of this injustice to those about him in general nothing even of gloom is manifested on the contrary cheerfulness brisk hope a strangely continual succession of hopes mostly illusorythough within there is traceable very great sorrow weariness and misery a fixed darkness as of erebus is grown habitual to him but is strictly shut up little of it shown to others or even in a sense to himself he is as a traveller overtaken by the night and its tempests and raindeluges but refusing to pause who is wetted to the bone and does not care farther for rain a traveller grown familiar with the howling solitudes aware that the stormwinds do not pity that darkness is the dead earths shadowa most lone soul of a man but continually toiling forward as if the brightest goal and haven were near and in view  once more the world was certain of friedrichs ruinfriedrich himself we have seen certain of it for some few desperate hoursbut the world and he as had been repeatedly the worlds case were both disappointed intrinsically there could be little doubt but friedrichs enemies might now have ruined him had they been diligent about it now again and now more than ever they have the winningpost in sight at small distance is the goal and purpose of all these four years battlings and marchings and ten years subterranean plottings and intriguings he himself says deliberately they had only to give him the finishing stroke coupdegrace oeuvres de frederic v 20 but they never gave him that stroke could not do it though heartily desirous which was and is matter of surprise to an observant public  the cause of failure may be considered to have been in good part daun and his cunctations dauns zeal was unquestionable ardent and continual is dauns desire to succeed but to try it at his own risk was beyond his power he expected always to succeed by help of others and to show them an example and go vigorously to work himself was what he never could resolve on could play only fabius cunctator it would seem and never was that part less wanted than now under such a chief figure the incoherency of action instead of diminishing as friedrich had feared rose daily towards its maximum and latterly became extreme the old lernean hydra had many heads but they belonged all to one body the many heads of this antifriedrich hydra had withal each its own body and separate set of notions and advantages friedrich was at least a unity his whole strength going one way and at all moments under his own sole command the value of this circumstance is incalculable this is the savingclause of pitt and his england pitt also a despotic sovereign though a temporary one this second only to friedrichs great gifts from nature and the noble use he makes of them is above all others the circumstance that saved him in such a duel with the hydras  on the back of kunersdorf accordingly there was not only no finishing stroke upon friedrich but for two months no stroke or serious attempt whatever in those neighborhoods where friedrich is there are four armies hereabouts the grand russian hanging by frankfurt friedrich at furstenwalde whitherward he marched from reitwein august 16th at furstenwalde or farther south guarding berlinthen unhurt yet by battle of any kind there are the grand daunish or marklissa army and prince henris of schmottseifen of which latter two the hitchings and manoeuvrings from time to time become vivid and never altogether cease but in no case come to anything above two months scientific flourishing of weapons strategic counterdancing but no stroke struck or result achieved except on dauns part irreparable waste of timeall readers would feel it inhuman to be burdened with any notice of such things one march of prince henris which was of a famous and decisive character we will attend to when it comes that is were the end of september at hand the rest must be imagined as a general strategic dance in those frontier partssilesia to rearward on one side the lausitz and frankfurt on the otherand must go on silently for most part in the background of the readers fancy indeed saxony is the scene of action friedrich henri soltikof daun comparatively inactive for the next six weeks and more  some days before kunersdorf daun personally with i will forget how many thousands had made a move to northward from marklissa 60 miles or so through sagan country and lies about priebus waiting there ever since priebus is some 40 miles north of gorlitz about 60 west of glogau south of frankfurt 80 this is where the mastersmith having various irons in the fire may be handiest for clutching them out and forging at them as they become successively hot daun as mastersmith has at least three objects in view the first is as always reconquest of silesia this is obstructed by prince henri who sits watchful on the threshold at schmottseifen yonder the second is as last year capture of dresden which is much the more feasible at presentthere being except the garrisons no prussian force whatever in saxony and a reichs army now actually there at last after its long haggling about its magazines and above all a friedrich with his hands full elsewhere to keep friedrichs hands fullin other words to keep the russians sticking to himthat is the third object or indeed we may call it the first second and third for daun is well aware that unless soltikof can manage to keep friedrich busy silesia saxony and all else becomes impossible  ever since the fortunate junction of loudon with soltikof daun has sat and still sits expectant elaborately calculative gathering magazines in different parts planting outparties this way that way with an eye to these three objects all or eachespecially to the third object which he discerns to be all and each daun was elaborately calculative with these views but to try any military action upon prince henri for example or bestir himself otherwise than in driving provender forward and marching detachments hither and thither to the potentially fit and fittest posts was not in dauns wayso much the worse for daun in his present course of enterprise  prince henri had lain quiet at schmottseifen waiting his brothers adventure did not hear the least tidings of him till six days after kunersdorf and then only by rumor hideous and though still dubious too much of it probable on the very day of kunersdorf henri had begun effecting some improvements on his right flankalways a sharply strategic most expert creatureand made a great many motions which would be unintelligible here detailed every fibre of them as is the soulconfusing custom there in tempelhof iii 228 et seq henri feels now that upon him lies a world of duties and foremost of all the instant duty of endeavoring to open communication with his brother many marches in consequence much intricate marching and manoeuvring between daun and him of which when we come to henris great march of 25th september there may be again some hint  for the present let readers take their map and endeavor to fix the following dates and localities in their mind here in summary are the kings various marches and two successive encampments two only during those six weeks of forced inaction while he is obliged to stand watching the russians and to witness so many complicacies and disasters in the distance which he struggles much and fruitlessly to hinder or help  encampment 1st furstenwalde august 18th30th friedrich left reitwein august 16th 17th he is at madlitz note to wunsch written there which we read 18th to furstenwalde and encamp furstenwalde is on the spree straight between frankfurt and berlin 25 miles from the former 35 from the latter here for near a fortnight at first much in alarm about the russians and berlin but gradually ascertaining that the russians intend nothing  in effect all this while soltikof lay at lossow 10 miles south of frankfurt with his right on oder totally motionless inactive except listening often rather gloomily to dauns and montalemberts suasive eloquences and advicesand once august 22d in the little town of guben holding conference with daun of which by and by in consequence of which august 28th soltikof and his russians and austrians got under way again southward but only a few marches first to mullrose then to lieberosewhom the instant he heard of their movements friedrich august 30th hastened to follow but had not to follow very far whereupon ensues  encampment second waldau till september 15th august 30th friedrich we say rose from furstenwalde hastened to follow this russian movement and keep within wind of it up the valley of the spree first to mullrose neighborhood where the russians loitering some time spoiled the canallocks of the friedrichwilhelm canal if nothing morethence to lieberose neighborhood waldau the kings new place of encampmentwaldau with spree forest to rear of it silent both parties till september 15th when soltikof did fairly march not towards berlin but quite in the opposite direction  by the middle of september when the russians did get on foot and moved eastward especially on and after september 25th when henri made his famous march westward then it will behoove us to return to friedrich and these localities for the present we must turn to saxony where and not here the scene of action is take farther only the following bits of note which will now be readable first these utterances to dargens direct glimpses into the heavyladen indeed hagridden and nearly desperate inner man of friedrich during the first three weeks after his defeat at kunersdorf   the king to marquis dargens at berlin six notes  1 madlitz road from reitwein to furstenwalde 16th august 1759 we have been unfortunate my dear marquis but not by my fault the victory was ours and would even have been a complete one when our infantry lost patience and at the wrong moment abandoned the field of battle the enemy today is on march to mullrose to unite with haddick not to mullrose for ten days yet haddick had already got united with them the russian infantry is almost totally destroyed of my own wrecks all that i have been able to assemble amounts to 32000 men with these i am pushing on to throw myself across the enemys road and either perish or save the capital that is not what you you berliners will call a deficiency of resolution  for the event i cannot answer if i had more lives than one i would sacrifice them all to my country but if this stroke fail i think i am clearscores with her and that it will be permissible to look a little to myself there are limits to everything i support my misfortune courage not abated by it but i am well resolved after this stroke if it fail to open an outgate for myself that small glass tube which never quits me and no longer be the sport of any chance  2 furstenwalde 20th august remain at berlin or retire to potsdam in a little while there will come some catastrophe it is not fit that you suffer by it if things take a good turn you can be back to berlin from potsdam in four hours if illluck still pursue us go to hanover or to zelle where you can provide for your safety  i protest to you that in this late action i did what was humanly possible to conquer but my peopleoh your majesty  3 furstenwalde 21st august the enemy is intrenching himself near frankfurt a sign he intends no attempt if you will do me the pleasure to come out hither you can in all safety bring your bed with you bring my cook noel and i will have you a little chamber ready you will be my consolation and my hope  this daylet readers mark the circumstancefriedrich in better spirits detaches wunsch with some poor 6000 to try if he can be of help in saxony where the reichs army now arrived in force and with nothing whatever in the field against them is taking all the northward garrisontowns and otherwise proceeding at a high rate too possibly with an eye towards dresden itself wunsch sets out august 21st tempelhof iii 211 and we shall hear of him in those saxon countries before long  4 furstenwalde 22d august yesterday i wrote to you to come but today i forbid it daun is at kotbus he is marching on luben and berlin nothing like so rashfly these unhappy countriesthis news obliges me again to attack the russians between here and frankfurt you may imagine if this is a desperate resolution it is the sole hope that remains to me of not being cut off from berlin on the one side or the other i will give the discouraged troops some brandyalasbut i promise myself nothing of success my one consolation is that i shall die sword in hand  5 same place and day after a letter from dargens you make the panegyric mon cher of an army that does not deserve any the soldiers had good limbs to run with none to attack the enemy alas your majesty after fifteen hours of such marching and fighting  for certain i will fight but dont flatter yourself about the event a happy chance alone can help us go in gods name to tangermunde since the royal family went dargens and many berliners are thinking of flight to tangermunde where you will be well and wait there how destiny shall have disposed of us i will go to reconnoitre the enemy tomorrow next day if there is anything to do we will try it but if the enemy still holds to the winehills of frankfurt i shall never dare to attack him  no the torment of tantalus the pains of prometheus the doom of sisyphus were nothing like what i suffer for the last ten days from kunersdorf till now when destruction has to be warded off again and the force wanting death is sweet in comparison to such a life have compassion on me and it and believe that i still keep to myself a great many evil things not wishing to afflict or disquiet anybody with them and that i would not counsel you to fly these unlucky countries if i had any ray of hope adieu mon cher  four days after august 25th from this same furstenwalde the russians still continuing stagnant friedrich despatches to schmettau commandant of dresden by some industrious hand for the roads are all blocked a second letter that dresden is of the highest moment that in case of siege there relief wunsch namely and perhaps more that may follow is on the road and that schmettau must defend himself to the utmost let us hope this second missive may counteract the too despondent first which we read above should that have produced discouragement in schmettau second letter is given in schmettaus leben pp 436 437dargens does run to wolfenbuttel stays there till september 9th nothing more from friedrich till 4th september when matters are well cooled again  6 waldau 4th september i think berlin is now in safety you may return thither the barbarians russians are in the lausitz i keep by the side of them between them and berlin so that there is nothing to fear for the capital the imminency of danger is past but there will still be many bad moments to get through before reaching the end of the campaign these however only regard myself never mind these my martyrdom will last two months yet then the snows and the ices will end it oeuvres de frederic xix 78 82 83 85 86  thus at furstenwalde then at waldau keeping guard forlorn but resolute against the intrusive russianaustrian deluges friedrich stands painfully vigilant and expectantstill for about a fortnight more with bad news coming to him latterly as we shall hear he is in those old moorland wusterhausen countries once so well known under far other circumstances thirty years ago in fine afternoons we used to gallop with poor duhan de jandun after schooltasks done towards mittenwalde furstenwalde and the furzy environs far and wide at home our sister and mother waiting with many troubles and many loves and papa sleeping panlike under the shadow of his big treethirty years ago ah me gone like a dream is all that and there is solitude and desolation and the russianaustrian deathdeluges instead these i suppose were friedrichs occasional remembrances silent always in this locality and time the sorrows of werter of the giaour of the dyspeptic tailor in multifarious forms are recorded in a copious heartrending manner and have had their meed of weeping from a sympathetic public but there are still a good few sorrows which lie wrapt in silence and have never applied there for an idle tearlet us look now into dauns side of things  daum after negotiation has an interview with soltikof at guben august 22ddaun who had moved to priebus with a view to be nearer soltikof had scarcely got his tent pitched there august 13th when a breathless horseman rode in with a note from loudon dated the night before king of prussia beaten to the very bone beyond mistake this timeutterly ruined if one may judge what a vision of the promised land delighted daun moves forward one march to triebel on the morrow to be one march nearer the scene of glory and endeavor to forge this biggest of the hot irons to advantage  at triebel soltikofs own account elucidated by oral messengers eyewitnesses and in short complete conspectus of this ever memorable victory await the delighted daun who despatches messengers one and another lacy the first not succeeding quite to congratulate with enthusiasm the most illustrious of generals who has beaten king friedrich as none else ever did or could beaten to the edge of extinctionespecially to urge him upon trampling out this nearly extinct king before he gleam up again soltikof understands the congratulations very well but as to that of trampling out snorts an indignant negative nay you why dont you try it surely it is more your business than my imperial mistresss or mine we have wrenched two victories from him this season kay and kunersdorf have killed near the half of us go you in and wrench something this is soltikofs logic which no messenger of dauns lacy or another aided by never such melodies and suasions from montalembert and loudon who are permanently diligent that way can shake  and truly it is irrefragable how can daun if himself merely speculative calculative hope that soltikof will continue acting men who have come to help you in a heavy job of work need example if you wish me to weep be grieved yourself first of all soltikof angrily wipes his countenance at this point and insists on a few tears from daun without metaphor soltikof has shot away all his present ammunition his staff of bread is quite precarious in these parts and soltikof thinks always is it my business then or is it yours  soltikof has intrenched himself on the winehills at lossow comfortably out of friedrichs way and contiguous to oder and the provisionroutes sits there angrily deaf to the voice of the charmer nothing to be charmed out of him but gusts of indignation instead of consent a proud highgoing indignant kind of man with a will of his own and sees well enough what is what in all this symphony of the lacys the montalemberts and surrounding adorers montalembert who is here this season our french best man unprofitable swedes must put up with an inferior hand is extremely persuasive tries all the arts of french rhetoric but effects nothing to let the austrians come in for the finishing strokeexcellence it will be to let them gain in history a glory which is of your earning daun and austria not soltikof and russia will be said to have extinguished this pestilent king whom history will have to remember choiseuls letter not duc de choiseul but comte now minister at vienna to montalembert vienna 16th august and montalemberts answer lieberhausen means lieberose 31st august 1759 in montalembert correspondance ii 5865 with all my heart answers soltikof i make the austrians and history perfectly welcome monsieur my ammunition is in posen my bread is fallen scarce in frankfurt can you find me one horse more indignant soltikof is not to be taken by chaff growls now and then if you stir him to the bottom why should we who are volunteer assistants take all the burden of the work i will fall back to posen and home to poland and east preussen if this last much longer  austria has a good deal disgusted these soltikofs and russian chief officerswho are not so stupid as austria supposes austrias steady wish is let them do their function of catspaw for us we are here to eat the chestnuts not if we can help it to burn our own poor fingers for them after every campaign hitherto austria has been in use to raise eager accusations at petersburg and get the apraxins fermors into trouble this is not the way to conciliate russian general officers austria taught probably by daun now tries the other tack heaps soltikof with eulogies flatteries magnificent presents all which soltikof accepts but with a full sense of what they mean an unmanageable soltikof his answer alwaysyour turn now to fight a victory i

as the crowning one  the reichs army though it had been so tumbled about in spring with such havoc on its magazines and preparations could not wait to refit itself except superficially and showed face over the mountains almost earlier than usual the chance was so unique a saxony left to its mere garrisonsas it continued to be for near two months this year on such golden opportunity the reichs armyfirst in light mischievous precursor parties who roamed as far as halle or even as halberstadt then the army itself well or ill appointed under generalissimo the prince von zweibruckdid come on winding through thuringen towards the northwestern towns various austrian auxiliarycorps making appearance on the dresden side eight austrian regiments as a permanency are in the reichs army itself commander or part commander of the eight is what alone i find noteworthy in them herr general thomas von blonquet irish by nation says a footnote seyfarth ii 831 nsure enough some adventurous thomas plunket visible this once soldiering in those circumstances never heard of by a sympathetic reader before or after it was while the king was hunting the haddickloudon people in sagan country in such vehement fashion that zweibruck came trumpeting into saxonyking prince henri and everybody well occupied otherwise far away  the reichs army has a camp at naumburg rossbach neighborhood and has light troops out in halle neighborhood which have seized halle are very severe upon halle and other places thereabouts till chased away august 7th the reichs army begirt leipzig summoned the weak garrison there it is a town capable of ruin but not of defence freewithdrawal proposes the reichs armyand upon these terms gets hold of leipzig for the time being leipzig torgau wittenberg in a fortnight or less all the prussian posts in those parts fall to the reichs army its marchings and siegings among those northwestern places not one of them capable of standing above a few days siege are worth no mention except to parish history enough that by little after the middle of august zweibruck had got all these places freewithdrawal the terms for all and that except it be the following feature in their siege of torgau feature mainly biographic and belonging to a certain colonel wolfersdorf concerned there is not one of those sieges now worth a moments attention from almost any mortal this is the torgau featurefeature of human nature soldiering under difficulties  colonel von wolfersdorf beautifully defends himself in torgau august 9th14th two days after leipzig was had there appeared at torgau a body of pandours 2000 and more who attempted some kind of scalade on torgau and its small garrison of 700 or sowhere are a magazine a hospital and other properties not capable by any garrison of standing regular siege but important to defend till you have proper terms offered the multitudinous pandours if i remember made a rush into the suburbs in their usual vociferous way but were met by the 700 silent prussianssilent except through their firearms and fieldpiecesin so eloquent a style as soon convinced the pandour mind and sent it travelling again and in the evening of the same day august 9th colonel wolfersdorf arrives as new commandant and with reinforcements small though considerable in the circumstances  wolfersdorf one dimly gathers had marched from wittenberg on this errand the whole force in torgau is now of about 3000 still with only fieldcannon but with a captain over themwho as is evident sets himself in a very earnest manner to do his utmost in defence of the place next morning reichs general kleefeld cloverfield with 6 or 8000 pandour and regular summons wolfersdorf surrender instantly or we will expect you answers wolfersdorf whereupon same morning august 10th general storm storm no 1 beautifully handled by wolfersdorf who takes it in rear to its astonishment as well as in front and sends it off in haste on the morrow saturday a second followed and on sunday a third both likewise beautifully handled this third storm readers see was sunday august 12th a very busy stormful day at torgau hereand also for some others of us during the heats of kunersdorf over the horizon far away wolfersdorf tumbles back all storms furthermore makes mischievous sallies a destructive skilled person altogether prompt fertile in expedients and evidently is not to be managed by kleefeld so that prince von stolberg second to supreme zweibruck himself has to take it in hand and  monday 13th at break of day stolberg arrives with a train of battering guns and 6000 new people summons wolfersdorf no as before storms him a fourth time likewise no as before attacks thereupon his elbe bridge and his redoubt across the river finds a wolfersdorf party rush destructively into his rear there and has to withdraw and try battering from behind the elbe dam continues this violently for about two hours till again wolfersdorf whose poor fieldpieces the only artillery he has cannot reach so far with leaden balls the iron balls are done and the powder itself is almost done manages by a flank attack to quench this also which produces entire silence and considerable private reflection on the part of indignant stolberg stolberg offers him the favorablest terms devisable withdraw freely with all your honors all your properties only withdraw which wolfersdorf his powder and ball being in such a state of ebb and no relief possible agrees to with stipulations very strict as to every particular in anonymous of hamburg iii 350 the capitulation august 14th given in extenso  colonel von wolfersdorf withdraws also beautifully august 15th accordingly wednesday august 15th at eight in the morning wolfersdorf by the elbe gate moves out across elbe bridge and the redoubt which is on the farther shore yonder near this redoubt stolberg and many of his general officers are waiting to see him go he goes in state flags flying music playing battalion hessencassel followed by all our packages hospital convalescents kings artillery and whatever is the kings or ours marches first next comes as rearguard to all this battalion grollmannalong

every true prussian to do the like jagers hussars a ducat for every traitor you shoot down continues wolfersdorf and punctually paid it afterwards unable to prevent an almost total dissolution of

prussian service as then offered him and this is his style of keeping it a decidedly clever soldier and comes out henceforth more and more as suchunhappily not for long was taken at maxen he too as will be seen rose in after times to be lieutenantgeneral and a man famous in the prussian military circles but given always they say to take the straight line or shortest distance between self and

first weeks of august there have been austrian detachments wehlas corps brentanos corps entering saxony from the northeast or daunward side and posting themselves in the strong points looking towards dresden waiting there till the reichs army should capture its leipzigs torgaus wittenbergs and roll forward from northwest to all which it is easy to fancy what an impetus was given by kunersdorf and august 12th the business after that going on doublequick and pointing to immediate practical industry on dresden the reichs army hastens to settle its northwestern towns puts due garrison in each leaves a 10 or 12000 movable for general protection in those parts and august 23d marches for dresden there are only some 15000 left of it now almost half the reichs army drunk up in that manner were not daun now speeding forth his maguire with a fresh 12000 who is to command the wehlas and brentanos as well and in effect to be austrian chief and as regards practical matters manager of this important enterpriseallimportant to daun just now schmettau in dresden sees clearly what mischief is at hand  to daun this siege of dresden is the alpha to whatever omegas there may be he and his soltikof are to sit waiting this and can attempt nothing but eating of provender till this be achieved as the siege was really important though not quite the alpha to all omegas and has in it curious points and physiognomic traits we will invite readers to some transient inspection of itthe rather as there exist ample contemporary narratives diariums and authentic records to render that possible and easy in tempelhof iii 210216222 complete and careful narrative in anonymous of hamburg iii 371377 express daybook by some eyewitness in dresden  ever since the rumor of kunersdorf says one diarium compiled out of many in the last two weeks of august schmettaus need of vigilance and diligence has been on the increase his outlooks becoming grimmer and grimmer he has a poorish garrison for number 3700 in all schmettaus leben by his son p 408 and not of the best quality deserters a good few of them willing enough for strokes fighting fellows all and of adventurous turn but uncertain as to loyalty in a case of pinch he has endless stores in the place for one item almost a million sterling of ready money poor schmettau if he knew it has suddenly become the leonidas of this campaign dresden its thermopylae andbut readers can conceive the situation  august 20th schmettau quits the neustadt or northern part of dresden which lies beyond the river unimportant that and indefensible with garrison not adequate schmettau will strengthen the riverbank blow up the stone bridge if necessary and restrict himself to dresden proper the court is here schmettau does not hope that the court can avert a siege from him but he fails not to try in that way too and may at least gain time  august 25th he has a mine put under the main arch of the bridge mine illmade uncertain of effect reports the officer whom he sent to inspect it but it was never tried the mere rumor of it kept off attacks on that side same day august 25th schmettau receives that unfortunate royal missive tempelhof iii 208 schmettaus leben p 421 has august 27th written in the dark days of reitwein morrow of kunersdorf 14th or 13th august which we read above that there is another letter on the road for him indicating relief shall be tried is unknown to schmettau and fatally continues unknown while schmettau is reading this august 25th general wunsch has been on the road four days wunsch and wolfersdorf with about 8000 at their quickest pace and in a fine winged frame of mind withal are speeding on will cross elbe at meissen tomorrow nightdid schmettau only know people say he did in the way of rumor understand that kunersdorf had not been the fatal thing it was thought and that efforts would be made by a king like his in his place one might have at least shot out a spy or two but he did not then or afterwards  already ever since the arrival of wehla and brentano in those parts he has been laboring under many uncertainties too many for a leonidas hanging between yes and no even about that of quitting the neustadt for example carrying over portions of his goods but never heartily the whole unable to resolve now lifting visibly the bridge pavement then again visibly restoring itand i think though the contrary is asserted he had at last to leave in the neustadt a great deal of stores horseprovender and other not needful to him at present or impossible to carry when dubiety got ended he has put a mine under the bridge but knows it will not go off  schmettau has been in many wars but this is a case that tries his soldier qualities as none other has ever done a case of endless intricacyif he be quite equal to it which perhaps he was not altogether nobody ever doubted schmettaus high qualities as a man and captain but here are requisite the very highest and these schmettau has not the result was very tragical i suppose a pain to friedrich all his life after and certainly to schmettau all his this is saturday night 25th august before tuesday week september 4th there will have sad things arrived irremediable to schmettau had schmettau decided to defend himself dresden had not been taken what a pity schmettau had not been spared this missive calculated to produce mere doubt whether he could not and should not after a ten days of inquiry and new discernment have been able to read the kings true meaning as well as the kings momentary humor in this fatal document there is no deciding sure enough he did not read the kings true meaning in it but only the kings momentary humor did not frankly set about defending himself to the deathor seeing in that way whether he could not defend himselfwith a good capitulation lying in the rear after he had  sunday august 26th trumpet at the gates messenger from zweibruck is introduced blindfold brings formal summons to schmettau summons duly truculent resistance vain the more you resist the worse it will beand there is a worst that of being delivered to the croats and massacred every man of which why should i speak especially if in anything you fail of your duty to the kurprinz electoral prince and heirapparent poor crookbacked young gentleman who has an excellent sprightly wife a friend of friedrichs and daughter of the late kaiser karl vii whom we used so beautifully imagine what your fate will beto which schmettau answers can durchlaucht think us ignorant of the common rules of behavior to persons of that rank for the rest durchlaucht knows what our duties here are and would despise us if we did not do themand in short our answer again is in polite forms pooh pooh you may go your way upon which the messenger is blindfolded again and schmettau sets himself in hot earnest to clearing out his goods from the neustadt building with huge intertwisted crossbeams and stone and earthmasses a battery at his own end of the bridge batteries on each side of it below and abovelocks the gates and is passionately busy all sundaythough divine service goes on as usual  hardly were the prussian guns got away when croat people in quantity came in and began building a battery at their end of the bridge the main defencework being old prussian mealbarrels handily filled with earth if you fire one cannonball across on us said schmettau i will bombard the neustadt into flame in few minutes i have only to aim at our hay magazine yonder be warned nor did they once fire from that side electoral highness withal and royal palace being quite contiguous behind the prussian bridgebattery electoral highness and household are politely treated make polite answer to everything intend going down into the apotheke kitchen suite or vaulted part of the palace and will lodge there when the cannonade begins  this same sunday august 26th maguire arrived and set instantly to building his bridge at pillnitz a little way above dresden at uebigau a little below dresden the reichsfolk have another reichsfolk zweibruck in person come all in on wednesday post themselves there to north and west of the city what is more important the siegeguns a superb stock are steadily floating through the pirna regions hitherward get to hand on friday next the fifth day hence tempelhof p 210 korbitz halfway out to kesselsdorf is durchlauchts headquarterchief general is durchlaucht conspicuously he at least in theory and shall have all the glory though maguire glancing on these cannon were it nothing more has probably a good deal to say maguire too i observe takes post on that north or kesselsdorf side contiguous for the head general wehla and brentano post themselves on the south or upstream side it is they that hand in the siegeguns batteries are already everywhere marked out 13 cannonbatteries and 5 howitzer in short from the morrow of that truculent summons monday morning to thursday there is hot stir of multifarious preparation on schmettaus part and continual pouring in of the hostile force who are also preparing at the utmost thursday the siege if it can be called a siege begins gradually and as follows  thursday morning august 30th schmettau who is night and day palisading the river and much elsediscloses that is break of day discloses on his part to the dresden public a huge gallows black huge of impressive aspect labelled for plunderers mutineers and their helpers anonymous of hamburg iii 373 the austrian heavy guns are not yet in battery but multitudes of loose croat people go swarming about everywhere and there is plentiful firing from such artilleries as they have this same thursday morning two or three battalions of them rush into the pirna suburb attack the prussian guardparties there schmettau instantly despatches captain kollas and a trumpetdurchlaucht have the goodness to recall these croat parties otherwise the suburb goes into flame and directly on arrival of this messenger may it please durchlaucht for we have computed the time and will not wait beyond what is reasonable for his return zweibruck is mere indignation and astonishment will burn halle burn quedlinburg berlin itself and utterly ruin the king of prussias dominion in generalthe rejoinder to which is burning of pirna suburb as predicted seventy houses of it this evening at six oclock  onward from which time there is on both sides especially on schmettaus diligent artillery practice cannonade kept up wherever schmettau can see the enemy busy enemy responding with what artillery he hasnot much damage done i should think though a great deal of noise and for one day saturday september 1st our diarist notes not safe to walk the streets this day but in effect the siege as they call itwhich fell dead on the fifth day and was never well aliveconsists mainly of menace and countermenace in the way of bargainmaking and negotiationand so far as i can gather that superb park of austrian artillery though built into batteries and talked about in a bullying manner was not fired from at all  schmettau affects towards the enemy and towards himself i dare say an air of iron firmness but internally has no such feelingcalls a council of war and the like council of war on sight of that kings missive confirms him with one voice surely surely excellenz no defence possible which is a prophecy and a fulfilment both in one why schmettau did not shoot forth a spy or two to ascertain for him what or whether nothing whatever was passing outside dresden i never understand beyond his own walls the world is a vacancy and blank to schmettau and he seems content it should be so  sunday september 2d though schmettaus cannonade was very loud and had been so all night divine service was held as usual streets safe againaustrians i suppose not firing with cannon about 4 pm after a great deal of powder spent general maguire stepping out on elbe bridge blows or beats appeal three times wishes a moments conversation with his excellency granted at once witnesses attending on both sides defence is impossible in the name of humanity consider urges maguire defence to the last man of us is certain answers schmettau from the teeth outwardsbut in the end engages to put on paper in case he by extremity of illluck have at any time to accept terms what his terms will inflexibly be upon which there is armistice till tomorrow and maguire i doubt not reports joyfully on this feeling of the enemys pulse zweibruck and maguire are very well aware of what is passing in these neighborhoods general wunsch back at wittenberg by forced marches blew it open in an hour and are growing highly anxious that dresden on any terms were theirs  monday september 3d the deathday of the siege an uncommonly busy daythough armistice lasted perfect till 3 pm and soon came back more perfect than ever a siege not killed by cannon but by medical industry let us note with brevity the successive symptoms and appliances about seven in the morning maguire had his messenger in dresden your excellencys paper ready nearly ready answers schmettau we will send it by a messenger of our own and about eleven of the day maguire does get itthe same captain kollas whose name we recollect handing it in and statuelike waiting answer pshaw this will never do ejaculates maguire terms irrationally high captain kollas knows nothing of what is in the paper and is charged only to bring a written answer from excellenz excellenz before writing will have to consult with durchlaucht can however as if confidentially and from feelings of friendship can assure you sir on my honor that the garrison will be delivered to the croats and every man of it put to the sword the garrison will expect that wird das erwarten said kollas statuelike and withdrew with the proper bow tempelhof iii 211 something interesting to us in these military diplomatic passages with their squareelbowed fashions and politeness stiff as iron  not till three of the afternoon does the written answer reach schmettau such terms never could be acceptedgood answers schmettau to our last breath no others will be offered and commences cannonading again not very violently but with the order go on then night and day  about 10 at night general guasco a truculent kind of man whom i have met with up and down but not admitted to memory beats appeal on the bridge inform the commandant that there will now straightway 13 batteries of cannon and 5 ditto of howitzers open on him unless he bethinks himself which dreadful message is taken to schmettau wish the gentleman goodevening orders schmettau and say we will answer with 100 guns upon which guasco vanishesbut returns in not many minutes milder in tone requests a sight of that written paper of terms again there it still is answers schmettau not altered nor ever shall be and there is armistice againand the siege as turns out has fired its last shot and is painfully expiring in paroxysms of negotiation which continue a good many hours schmettau strives to understand clearly that his terms of the kings own suggesting as schmettau flatters himself are accepted nor does durchlaucht take upon him to refuse in any point but he is strangely slow to sign still hoping to mend matters  much hithering and thithering there was till 4 next morning durchlaucht has important news from torgau at that moment till 11 next day till 4 in the afternoon and laterguasco and others coming with message after message hasty and conciliatory durchlaucht at such a distance his signature not yet come but be patient all is right upon my honor very great hurry evident on the part of guasco and company but nothing suspected by schmettau till dusk or darkness threatening now to supervene maguire and schmettau with respective suites have a conference on the bridgerain falling very heavy durchlauchts signature maguire is astonished to say has not yet come hut maguire pledges his honor that all shall be kept without chicane and adds what to some of us seemed not superfluous afterwards i am incapable of acting falsely or with chicane in fact till 9 in the evening there was no signature by durchlaucht but about 6 on such pledge by maguire of his hand and his honor the siege entirely gave up the ghost and dresden belonged to austria tuesday evening 4th september 1759 sun just setting could anybody see him for the rain  schmettau had been overhasty what need had schmettau of haste the terms had not yet got signature perfection of settlement on every point nor were they at all well kept when they did considerable flurry temporary blindness needless hurry and neglect of symptoms and precautions must be imputed to poor schmettau whose troubles began from this moment and went on increasing the austrians are already besetting elbe bridge rooting up the herringbone balks and approaching our blockhousesooner than was expected but that is nothing on opening the pirna gate to share it with the austrians friedrichs spy sooner had not been possible to the man was waiting who handed schmettau that second letter of friedrichs courage there is relief on the road poor schmettau  what captain kollas and the prussian garrison thought of all this they were perhaps shy of saying and we at such distance are not informedexcept by one symptom that of colonel hoffman schmettaus second whose indignation does become tragically evident hoffman a rugged prussian veteran is indignant at the capitulation itself doubly and trebly indignant to find the austrians on elbe bridge busy raising our balks and battery how is this sir inquires he of captain sydow who is on guard at the prussian end how dared you make this change without acquainting the second in command order out your men and come along with me to clear the bridge again sydow hesitates haggles indignant hoffman growing loud as thunder pulls out a pistol fatallooking to disobedient sydow who calls to his men or whose men spring out uncalled and shoot hoffman downsend two balls through him so that he died at 8 that night with noise enough then and afterwards was drunk said schmettaus people friedrich answered on report of it i think as hoffman did if he was drunk it is pity the governor and all the garrison had not been so to have come to the same judgment as he ps in autograph of letter to schmettau waldau 11th september 1759 preuss ii urkundenbuch p 45 friedrichs unbearable feelings of grief and indignation in regard to all this dresden matterwhich are not expressed except coldly in business formcan be fancied by all readers one of the most tragical bits of illluck that ever befell him a very sore stroke in his present condition a signal loss and affront and most of all unbearable to think how narrowly it has missed being a signal triumphmissed actually by a single hairsbreadth which is as good as by a mile or by a thousand miles  soon after 9 oclock that evening durchlaucht in person came rolling through our battery and the herringbone balks to visit electoral highnesswhich was not quite the legal time either durchlaucht had not been half an hour with electoral highness when a breathless courier came in general wunsch within ten miles took torgau in no time as durchlaucht well knows for a week past and will be here before we sleep durchlaucht plunged out over the herringbone balks again which many carpenters are busy lifting and the electoral highnesses in like manner hurry off to toplitz that same night about an hour after what a tuesday night poor hoffman is dead at 8 oclock the saxon royalties since 11 are galloping for pirna for toplitz durchlaucht of zweibruck we saw hurry off an hour before themcapitulation signature not yet dry and terms of it beginning to be broken and wunsch reported to be within ten miles  the wunsch report is perfectly correct wunsch is at grossenhayn this evening all in a fiery mood of swiftness his people and heand indeed it is by chance one of wolfersdorfs impetuosities that has sent the news so fast wunsch had been as swift with torgau as he was with wittenberg he blew out the poor reichs garrison there by instant storm and packed it off to leipzig under charge of an officer and trumpethe had greatly against his will to rest two days there for a few indispensable cannon from magdeburg cannon once come wunsch burning for deliverance of dresden had again started at his swiftest monday 3d september death day of the siege very early  he is under 8000 but he is determined to do itand would have done it think judges half thinks zweibruck himself such a fire in that wunsch and his corps as is very dangerous indeed at 4 this morning zweibruck heard of his being on march numbers uncertainnumbers seemingly not the important pointblows any number of us about our businessand since that moment zweibruck has driven the capitulation at such a pace though the flurried schmettau suspected nothing  afternoon of tuesday 4th wunsch approaching grossenhayn had detached wolfersdorf with 100 light horse rightwards to grodel a boating village on elbe shore to seek news of dresden also to see if boats are procurable for carrying our artillery up thither at grodel wolfersdorf finds no boats that will avail but certain boatpeople new from dresden report that no capitulation had been published when they left but that it was understood to be going on new spur to wolfersdorf and wunsch wolfersdorf hears farther in this village that there are some thirty austrian horse in grossenhaynpossible these may escape general wunsch thinks wolfersdorf and decides to have them takes thirty men of his own orders the other seventy to hold rightward gather what intelligence is going and follow more leisurely and breaks off for the grossenhayndresden highway to intercept those fellows  getting to the highway wolfersdorf does see the fellows sees alsowith what degree of horror i do not knowthat there are at least 100 of them against his 30 horror will do nothing for wolfersdorf nor are his other 70 now within reach putting a bold face on the matter he commands stentorlike as if it were all a fact grenadiers march dragoons to right forwards wheel hussars forward marchand does terrifically dash forward with the thirty hussars or last item of the invoice leaving the others to follow the austrians draw bridle with amazement fire off their carbines take to their heels and do not stop for more wolfersdorf captures 68 of them for behoof of grossenhayn and sends the remaining 32 galloping home tempelhof iii 214 who bring the above news to durchlaucht of zweibruck 12000 of them may it please your durchlaucht such the accounts we hadfancy poor schmettaus feelings  on the morrow dresden was roused from its sleep by loud firing and battle audible on the north side of the river before daybreak and all day it is wunsch impetuously busy in the woody countries there durchlaucht had shot out generals and divisions brentano wehla this general and then that to intercept wunsch these the fiery wunschalmost as if they had been combustible material coming to quench firerepels and dashes back in a wonderful manner general after general of them and is lord of the field all daybut cannot hear the least word from dresden which is a surprising circumstance  in the afternoon wunsch summons maguire in the neustadt will answer you in two hours said maguire wunsch thereupon is for attacking their two pontoon elbebridges still resolute for dresdenand orders wolfersdorf on one of them the uebigau bridge who finds the enemy lifting it at any rate and makes them do it faster but night is now sinking from schmettau not a word or sign silence over there all day not a single cannon to or from say wunsch and wolfersdorf to one another schmettau must have capitulated conclude they and withdraw in the nighttime still thunderous if molested bivouac at grossenhayn after twentyfour hours of continual march and battle not time even for a snatch of food bericht von der action des generalmajors von wunsch bey reichenberg den 5

relieved wunsch takes the road again two marches each of twenty miles reaches torgau late takes post in the ruins of the north suburb finds he must fight kleefeld refreshes his men with a keg of wine per company surely a judicious step and sends to wolfersdorf who has the rearguard be here with me tomorrow at 10 wolfersdorf starts at 4 is here at 10 and wunsch having scanned kleefeld and his

forbidding could not save dresden but he is here lord of the northern regions againnothing but leipzig now in the enemys handand can await finck who is on march with a stronger party to begin business here it is reckoned there are few more brilliant little bits of soldiering than this of wunschs all the more as his men for most part were not prussian but miscellaneous foreign spirits of uncertain fealty roving fellows of a fighting turn attracted by friedrichs fame and under a captain who had the art of keeping them in tune wunsch has been soldiering in a diligent though dim miscellaneous way these fiveandtwenty years fought in the old turk wars under disastrous seckendorfwunsch a poor young wurtemberg ensign visibly busy there 17371739 as was this same schmettau in the character of staffofficer far enough apart from wunsch at that timefought afterwards in the bavarian service in the dutch at roucoux at lauffeld again under disastrous people could never under such find anything but subaltern work all this while was glad to serve under the eye of friedrich as colonel of a free corps which he has done with much diligence and growing distinction till now at the long last his chance does come and he shows himself as a real general possibly a high career lying aheada man that may be very valuable to friedrich who has now so few such left fate had again decided otherwise for wunsch in what way will be seen before this campaign ends an infernal campaign according to friedrich cette campagne infernale  finck whom friedrich had just detached from waldau september 6th with a new 8 or 6000 to command in chief in those parts and along with wunsch put dresden out of risk as it werefinck does at least join wunsch as we shall mention in a little and these two with such wolfersdorfs and people under them did prove capable of making front against reichsfolk in great overplus of number nor are farther sieges of those northern garrisons but recaptures of them the news one hears from saxony henceforthonly that dresden is fatally gone irrecoverably as turned out and in that unbearable manner here is the concluding scene  dresden saturday september 8th exit schmettau a thousand times over schmettau must have asked himself why was i in such a hurry without cause for it i only maguire having causethe capitulation had been ended in a huddle without signature an

inspection there was incredible waste schmettau protesting and above half of the new uniforms were lost to us our 80 pontoons which were expressly bargained for are brazenly denied us 20 of them are

prussians five deep a double rank of austrians ranged on each side in espalier they call itespalier with gaps in it every here and there to what purpose is soon evident the march was so disposed likewise for a purpose that all along there were one or two companies of prussian foot and then in the interval carriages cannon cavalry and hussars schmettaus carriage is with the rearguard madam

that elaborate courtcoat and flowing periwig with this specific borck old as the devil whom i have had much trouble to identify forming visible part of this dismal procession the bright eye of borck not smiling as usual but clouded though impassive but that of borck or his limners is not the point  the prussians have been divided into small sections with a mass of baggagewagons and cavalry between every two and no sooner is the mass got in movement than there rises from the austrian part and continues all the way loud invitation whosoever is a brave saxon a brave austrian reichsman come to us gaps in the espalier dont you see and schmettau in the rear with baggage and cavalry interveningnobody can reach schmettau here is a way of keeping your bargain the prussian officers struggle stoutly but are bellowed at struck at menaced by bayonet and bulletnone of them shot i think but a good several of them cut and woundedthe austrian officers themselves in passionate points behaving shamefully yes shoot them down the were it nothing else heretic dogs and being throughout evidently in a hot shivery frame of mind forgetful of the laws seldom was such a procession spite rage and lawless revenge blazing out more and more on the whole there deserted through those gaps of the espalier about half of the whole garrison on madam schmettaus hammercloth there sat in the schmettau livery a hardfeatured man recognizable by keen eyes as lately a nailer of the nailer guild here who had been a spy for schmettau and brought many persons into trouble him they tear down and trample

seyfarth beylagen ii 611621 in  heldengeschichte c c  schmettaus protest against all this is vehement solemnly circumstantial but except in regard to the trampled nailer zweibruck on that point heartily sorry for the insult to your excellencys livery and here the man is with a thousand apologies schmettau got no redress nor had friedrich any now or henceforth friedrich did at once more to testify his disgust than for any benefit order schmettau halt at wittenberg not at magdeburg as was pretended to be bargained dismiss your escort of austrians there bid them home at once and out of your sight schmettau himself he ordered to berlin to idle waiting never again employed schmettau for sixteen years that they lived together never saw his face more  schmettaus illfortune was much pitied as surely it deserved to be by all men about friedrichs severity there was and still occasionally is controversy held into which we shall not enter for yes or for no you are like the rest of them writes friedrich to him when the moment comes for showing firmness you fail in it waldau 10th september 1759 in preuss ii urkunden p 44 friedrich expects of others what all soldiers professand what is in fact the soul of all nobleness in their tradebut what only friedrich himself and a select few are in the habit of actually performing tried by the standard of common practice schmettau is clearly absolvable a broken veteran deserving almost tears but that is not the standard which it will be safe for a king of men to go by friedrich i should say would be ordered by his office if nature herself did not order him to pitch his ideal very high and to be rather rhadamanthine in judging about it friedrich was never accused of overgenerosity to the unfortunate among his captains  after the war schmettau his conduct still a theme of argument was reduced to the invalid list age now sixtyseven but health and heart still very fresh as he pleaded complaining that he could not live on his retiring pension of 300 pounds a year be thankful you have not had your head struck off by sentence of courtmartial answered friedrich schmettau after some farther troubles from court quarters retired to brandenburg and there lived silent poor but honorable for his remaining fifteen years madam schmettau came out very beautiful in those bad circumstances cheery thrifty full of loyal patience a constant sunshine to her poor man whom she had preceded out of dresden in the way we saw schmettau was very quiet still studious of war matters see leben by his son captain schmettau a modest intelligent book pp 440447 sent the king oncein 1772 while polish prussia and how it could be fortified were the interesting subjecta journal which he had elaborated for himself of the marches of karl twelfth in west preussen which was well received apparently the king not angry with me farther thought schmettau a completely retired old man studious socialthe best men of the army still his friends and familiarsnor in his own mind any mutiny against his chief this also has its beauty in a human life my friend so long as madam schmettau lived it was well after her death not well dark rather and growing darker and in about three years schmettau followed 27th october 1775 whither that good soul had gone the elder brotherwho was a distinguished academician as well as feldmarschall and negotiatorhad died at berlin in voltaires time 1751 each of those schmettaus had a son in the prussian army who wrote books or each a short book still worth reading bavarian war of 1778 by the

a march of fifty hours the russians cannot find lodging in silesia  the eyes of all had been bent on dresden latterly and there had occurred a great deal of detaching thitherward and of marching there and thence as we have partly seen and the end is dresden and to appearance saxony along with it is dauns has not daun good reason now to be proud of the cunctatory method never did his game stand better and all has been gained at other peoples expense daun has not played one trump card it is those obliging russians that have played all the trumps and reduced the enemy to nothing only continue that wise courseand cart meal with your whole strength for the russians  safe behind the pools of lieberose friedrich between them and berlin lie those dear russians extending daun and they like an impassable military dike with spurs of outposts and cunningly devised detachments far and widefrom beyond bober or utmost crossen on the east to hoyerswerda in elbe country on the westdike of eighty miles long and in some eastern parts of almost eighty broad so elaborate is dauns detaching quality in cases of moment the kings broken army on one side of us calculates daun prince henris on the other incommunicative they reduced to isolation powerless either or both of them against such odds they shall wait there please heaven till saxony be quite finished zweibruck and our detachments and maguires let them finish saxony while soltikof keeps the king busy saxony finished how will either prince or king attempt to recover it after which silesia for usand we shall then be near our magazines withal and this severe stress of carting will abate or cease in fact these seem sound calculations friedrich is 24000 henri 38000 the military dike is of austrians 75000 of russians and austrians together 120000 daun may fairly calculate on succeeding beautifully this year saxony his altogether and in silesia some glogau or strong town taken and russians and austrians wintering together in that country  if only daun do not too much spare his trump cards but there is such a thing as excess on that side too and perhaps it is even the more ruinous kindand is certainly the more despised by good judges though the multitude of bad may notice it less daun is unwearied in his vigilantes in his infinite cartings of provision for himself and soltikoflong chains of magazines big and little at guben at gorlitz at bautzen zittau friedland and does aided by french montalembert all that man can to keep those dear stupid russians in tune  dauns problem of carting provisions and guarding his multifarious posts and sources of meal and defence is not without its difficulties especially with a prince henri opposite who has a superlative manoeuvring talent of his own and an industry not inferior to dauns in that way accordingly ever since august 11th13th when daun moved northward to triebel and henri shot out detachments parallel to him to secure the bober and our right flank and try to regain communication with the kingstill more ever since august 22d when daun undertook that onerous cartage of meal for soltikof as well as self the manoeuvring and mutual fencing and parrying between henri and him has been getting livelier and livelier fain would daun secure his numerous roads and magazines assiduously does henri threaten him in these points and try all means to regain communication with his brother daun has magazines and interests everywhere henri is everywhere diligent to act on them  daun in person ever since kunersdorf time has been at triebel henri moved to sagan after him but has left a lieutenant at schmottseifen as daun has at marklissahere are still new planets and secondary ditto with revolving moons in short it is two interpenetrating solar

businessand not knowing it is not he of all solecisms in this world the most flagrantought to study out of tempelhof and the books but which except in its results no other reader could endure the result we will make a point of gathering carefully riddled down there are withal in the details five or six little passages which have some shadow of interest to us these let us note and carefully omit the rest  of fouquet at landshut fouquet was twice attacked at landshut but made a lucky figure both times attack first was by deville attack second by harsch early in july not long after friedrich had left for schmottseifen rash deville a rash creature and then again a laggard swift where he should be slow and vice versa again made trial on landshut and fouquet but was beautifully dealt with taken in rear in flank or i forget how taken but sent galloping through the passes again with a loss of many prisoners most of his furnitures and all his presence of mind whom daun thereupon summoned out of those parts hitherward to marklissa with your corps leave fouquet alone hofbericht von den unternehmungen des fouquetschen corps im julius 1759 in seyfarth beylagen ii 582586  after which fouquet things being altogether quiet round him was summoned with most part of his force to schmottseifen left general goltz a man we have met before to guard landshut and was in fair hopes of proving helpful to prince henriwhen harsch harsch by himself this time not harsch and deville as usual thought here was his opportunity and came with a great apparatus as if to swallow landshut whole so that fouquet had to hurry off reinforcements thither and at length to go himself leaving stutterheim in his stead at schmottseifen goltz however with his small handful stood well to his work and there fell out sharp fencings at landshutespecially one violent attack on our outposts the austrians quite triumphant till a couple of cannon open on them from the next hilltill some violent werner or other charge in upon them with prussian hussarsa desperate tussle that special one of werners not only sabres flashing furiously on both sides but butts of pistols and blows on the face tempelhof iii 233 31st august till in short harsch finds he can make nothing of it and has taken himself away before fouquet come this goltz here playing antiharsch is the goltz who with winterfeld schmettau and others was in that melancholy zittau march of the prince of prussias in 1757 it was goltz by whom the king sent his finishing compliment you deserve all of you to be tried by courtmartial and to lose your heads goltz is mainly concerned with fouquet and silesia in late times and we shall hear of him once again fouquet did not return to schmottseifen nor was molested again in landshut this year though he soon had to detach for the kings use part of his landshut force and had other silesian business which fell to him  fortress of peitz the poor fortress of peitz was taken againdo readers remember it on the day of zorndorf last year this year a fortnight after kunersdorf the same old halfpay gentleman with his fiveandforty invalids have again been set adrift with the honors of war poor old creatures lest by possibility they afflict the dear russians and our mealcarts up yonder tempelhof iii 231 27th august i will forget who took peitz perhaps haddick of whom we have lately heard so much he was captor of berlin in 1757 did the inroad on berlin that yearand produced rossbach shortly after peitz if he did peitz was haddicks last success in the world haddick

ordered to saxony against wunsch and finckand readers know already what he made of these two in the action at korbitz september 21stand shall hear soon what befell haddick himself in consequence  colonel hordt is captured it was in that final marching of soltikof to lieberose that a distinguished exswede colonel hordt of the free corps hordt was taken prisoner at trebatsch hanging on soltikofs

was carried to petersburg lay twentysix months and three days in solitary durance there and we may hear a word from him again  ziethen almost captured prince henri in the last days of august marched to sagan in person tempelhof iii 231 29th august ziethen along with him multifariously manoeuvring to regain communication with the king of course with no want of countermanoeuvring of vigilant outposts cunningly devised detachments and assiduous small measures on the part of daun who one day had determined on a more considerable thing that of cutting out ziethen from the sagan neighborhood and would have done it they sayhad not he been too cunctatory september 2d ziethen who is posted in the little town of sorau had very nearly been cut off in sorau westward daunward of sagan a short days march there sat ziethen conscious of nothing particularwith daun secretly marching on him daun in person from the west and two others from the north and from the south who are to be simultaneous on sorau and the zietheners a welllaid scheme likely to have finished ziethen satisfactorily who sat there aware of nothing but it all miswent daun on the road noticed some trifling phenomenon prussian party of horse or the like which convinced his cautious mind that all was found out that probably a whole prussian army instead of a ziethen only was waiting at sorau upon which daun turned home again sorry that he could not turn the other two as well the other two were stronger than ziethen could they have come upon him by surprise or have caught him before he got through a certain pass or bit of bad ground with his baggage but ziethen by some accident or by his own patrols got notice loaded his baggage instantly and was through the pass or half through it and in a condition to give stroke for stroke with interest when his enemies came up nothing could be done upon ziethen who marched on he and all his properties safe to sagan that nightowing to dauns overcaution and to ziethens own activity and luck tempelhof iii 233  all this was prior to the loss of dresden during the crisis of that when everybody was bestirring himself prince henri made extraordinary exertions much

austrians which goes from bober river eastward post after post to hoyerswerda westward eighty miles along the lausitzbrandenburg frontier rooting itself through the lausitz into bohemia and the sources of its meal friedrich and he cannot communicate except by spies the first jager or regular express from the king arrived september 13th ib iii 207 but both are of one mind both are on one problem what is to be done with that impassable dikeand cooperate sympathetically without communicating what follows bears date after the loss of dresden but while henri still knew only of the siegethat jager of the 13th first brought him news of the loss  a day or two after ziethens adventure henri quits sagan to move southward for a stroke at the bohemianlausitz magazines a stroke and series of strokes september 8th ziethen and in fouquets absence at landshut stutterheim are pushed forward into the zittau country first of all upon friedlandthe zittau friedland for there are friedlands many september 9th stutterheim summons friedland gets it gets the bit of magazine there and next day hastens on to zittau is refused surrender of zittau learns however that the magazine has been mostly set on wheels again and is a stage forward on the road to bohemia whitherward stutterheim quitting zittau as too tedious hastens after it and next day catches it or the unburnt remains of it a successful stutterheim nor is ziethen idle in the mean while ziethen and others whom no deville or austrian party thinks itself strong enough to meddle with prince henri being so near  here is a pretty tempest in the heart of our bohemian mealconduit continue that and what becomes of soltikof and me daun is off from triebel country to this dangerous scene indignantly cashiers deville why did not you attack these ziethen people had not you 10000 sir cashiers poor deville for not attackingdoes not himself attack but carts away the important gorlitz magazine to bautzen which is the still more important one sits down on the lid of that according to wont shoots out odonnell an irish gentleman devilles successor and takes every precaution prince henri in presence of odonnell coalesces again walks into gorlitz encamps there on the landskron and other heights moys hill one of them poor winterfelds hilland watches a little how matters will turn and whether daun severely vigilant from bautzen seated on the lid of his magazine will not perhaps rise  first and last daun in this business has tried several things but there was pretty much always and emphatically there now is only one thing that could be effectual to attack prince henri and abolish him from those countriesas surely might have been possible with twice his strength at your disposalthis though sometimes he seemed to be thinking of such a thing daun never would try for which the subsequent facts and all good judges were and are inexorably severe on daun certain it is no rashness could have better spilt dauns game than did this extreme caution     daun soltikof and company again have a colloquy bautzen september 15th after which everybody starts on his special course of action  soltikofs disgust at this new movement of dauns was great and indignant instead of going at the king and getting some victory for himself he has gone to bautzen and sat down on his mealbags meal is it to be a mere fighting for meal i will march tomorrow for poland for preussen and find plenty of meal and would have gone they say had not mercury in the shape of montalembert with his most zealous rhetoric intervened and prevailed with difficulty one hour of personal interview with excellency daun urges montalembert one more no answers soltikofalas then send your messenger to which last expedient soltikof does assent and despatches romanzof on the errand  september 15th at bautzen at an early hour there is meeting accordingly not romanzof soltikofs messenger alone but zweibruck in person daun in person and most

perceive thither by a wide sweep northward which they think will be safer upon which friedrich also rises follows with another kind of speed than soltikofs and by one of his swift clutchings lays hold of sagan which he if soltikof has not sees to be a keypoint in this operation easy for soltikof to have seized this keypoint key of the real road to glogau easy for loudon and the new 10000 to have rendezvoused there but nobody has thought of doing it a few croats were in the place who could make no debate  from sagan friedrich and henri are at length in free communication sagan to the landskron

then push forward again industriously sticking to the flanks of soltikof thrusting out stumblingblocks making his march very uncomfortable  strange to say from sagan while waiting two days for these reinforcements there starts suddenly to view suddenly for friedrich and us an incipient negotiation about peace actual proposal that way or as good as actual so voltaire thinks it on the part of choiseul and france but as yet in voltaires name only by a sure though a backstairs channel of his discovering of which and of the much farther corresponding that did actually follow on it we purpose

has taken leipzig day before yesterday september 13th as daun sorrowfully knows by news come in overnight and six days hence september 21st finck and wunsch together will do their action of korbitz and be sending haddick a bad road these things zweibruck knows only in part but past experience gives him ominous presentiment as it may well do and he thinks decidedly excellenz more austrian troops are indispensable there in fact your excellenzs self were that possible which one feels it is not in the presence of these russians  russians and reichsfolk these are a pair of thumbscrews on both thumbs of daun screwing the cunctation out of him painfully intimating get rid of this prince henri you must you must and in the course of the next eight days daun has actually girt himself to this great enterprise goaded on i could guess by the action of korbitz done on friday thirty hours ago the news of which and that haddick instead of extinguishing finck is retreating from him upon dresdenwhat a piece of news thinks daun you zweibruck haddick maguire and company you are 36000 in saxony finck has not 12000 in the field how is thisand indignantly dismisses haddick altogether go sir and attend to your health tempelhof iii 276 258261 news poignantly astonishing to daun as would seemlike an oxgoad in the lazy rear of daun certain it is daun had marched out to gorlitz in collected form and on saturday afternoon september 22d is personally on the heights not moys hill i should judge but other points of vision taking earnest survey of prince henris position on the landskron there tomorrow morning we attack that camp thinks daun storm prince henri and it be rid of him at any price ib iii 253256 for the march now ensuing iii 228234 241247 for henris anterior movements  tomorrow morning yesbut this afternoon and earlier prince henri has formed a great resolution his plans all laid everything in readiness and it is not here you will find prince henri tomorrow this is his famous march of fifty hours this that we are now come to which deserves all our attentionand all dauns much more prince henri was habitually a man cautious in war not aggressive like his brother but defensive frugal of risks and averse to the lionsprings usual with some people though capable of them too in the hour of need military men are full of wonder at the bold scheme he now fell upon and at his style of executing it hardly was daun gone home to his meditations on the storm of the landskron tomorrow and tattoo beaten in prince henris camp there when at 8 that saturday evening issuing softly with a minimum of noise in the proper marching columns baggagecolumns henri altogether quitted this camp and vanished like a dream into the night men and goods every itemwho shall say whitherward leaving only a few light people to keep up the watchfires and sentrycries for behoof of daun let readers here who are in the secret watch him a little from afar  straight northward goes prince henri down neisse valley 20 miles or so to rothenburg in columns severalfold with much delicate arranging which was punctually followed and in the course of tomorrow prince henri is bivouacked for a short rest of three hourshidden in unknown space 20 miles from daun when daun comes marching up to storm him on the landskron gone veritably but whitherward daun cannot form the least guess daun can only keep his men under arms there all day while his scouts gallop far and widebringing in this false guess and the other and at length returning with the eminently false one misled by some of henris baggagecolumns which have to go many routes that the prince is on march for glogaugone northeast that way went his wagons these we saw with our eyes northeast yes to glogau possibly enough thinks daun or may not he cunning as he is and full of feints intend a stroke on bautzen in my absenceand hastens thither again and sits down on the magazinelid glad to find nothing wrong there  this is all that daun hears of henri for the next four days plenty of bad news from saxony in these four days the finckhaddick action of korbitz a dismal certainty before one startedand haddick on his road to some watering place by this time but no trace of henri farther since that of the wagons wending northeast gone to glogau to his brother no use in pushing him or trying to molest him there thinks daun and waits in stagnant humor chewing the cud of bitter enough thoughts till confirmation of that guess arriveas it never will in this world read an important note  to northward of bautzen forty miles and to westward forty miles the country is all dauns only towards glogau with the russians and friedrich thereabouts does it become disputable or offer prince henri any chance nevertheless it is not to glogau it is far the reverse that the nimble henri has gone resting himself at rothenburg three hours speed is of all things the vitalest prince henri starts again sunday afternoon straight westward this time marches with his best swiftness with his best arrangements through many sleeping villages to klitten not a wakeful one a march of 18 miles from rothenburgdirect for the saxon side of things instead of the silesian as daun had made sure  at klitten monday morning bivouac again for a few hourshas no camp only waits three hours is archenholtzs phrase but i suppose the meaning is waits till the several columns by their calculated routes have all got together and till the latest in arriving has had three hours of restthe earliest having perhaps gone on march again in the interim there are 20 miles farther still straight west to hoyerswerda where the outmost austrian division is forward towards that let us astonish general wehla and his 3000 and our march is over all this too prince henri manages never anything more consummate more astonishing to wehla and his master  wehla and brentano readers perhaps remember them busy from the pirna side at the late siege of dresden siege gloriously done wehla was ordered to hoyerswerda on the northwest frontier brentano to a different point in that neighborhood where brentano escaped ruin and shall not be mentioned but wehla suddenly found it and will require a word wehla of all people on the wartheatre had been the least expecting disturbance he is on the remotest western flank to westward of him nothing but torgau and the finckwunsch people from whom is small likelihood of danger from the eastern what danger can there be a letter of dauns some days ago had expressly informed him that to all appearance there was none  and now suddenly on the tuesday morning what is this prussians reported to be visible in the woods impossible answered wehladid get ready however what he could croat regiments pieces of artillery behind the elster river and on good points laboring more and more diligently as the news proved true but all his efforts were to no purpose general lentulus with his prussians the mute swiss lentulus whom we sometimes meet who has the vanguard this day comes streaming out of the woods across the obstacles cannonades wehla both in front and rear entirely swallows wehla and corps 600 killed the general himself with 28 fieldofficers and of subalterns and privates 1785 falling prisoners to us and the remainder scattered on the winds galloping each his own road towards covert and a new form of life wehla is eaten in this manner tuesday september 25thmetaphorically speaking the march of fifty hours ends in a comfortable twofold meal militarycannibal as well as of common culinary meat and in welldeserved rest tempelhof iii 255 256 seyfarth beylagen c  the turningpoint of the campaign is reckoned to be this march of henris one of the most extraordinary on record prince henri had a very fast march into these silesianlausitz countries early in july seyfarth ii 545 and another very fast from bautzen to intersect with schmottseifen in the end of july but these were as nothing compared with the present tempelhof the excellent solid manbut who puts all things big and little on the same level of detail and has unparalleled methods of arranging what he reckons to be arranging and no vestige of indexis distressingly obscure on this grand incident but at length on compulsion does yield clear account tempelhof iii 253258 in archenholtz it is not dated at all who merely says as follows most extraordinary march ever made went through 50 miles of country wholly in the enemys possession lasted 56 hours in which long period there was no camp pitched and only twice a rest of three hours allowed the troops during the other fifty hours the march day and night continually proceeded ended no date in surprise of general wehla at hoyerswerda cutting up 600 of his soldiers and taking 1800 prisoners kalkreuth since so famous in the antinapoleon wars was the princes adjutant archenholtz i 426  this is probably prince henris cleverest featthough he did a great many of clever and his brother used to say glancing towards him there is but one of us that never committed a mistake a highly ingenious dexterous little man in affairs of war sharp as needles vehement but cautious though of abstruse temper thinskinned capricious and giving his brother a great deal of trouble with his jealousies and shrewish whims by this last consummate little operation he has astonished daun as much as anybody ever did shorn his elaborate tissue of cunctations into ruin and collapse at one stroke and in effect as turns out wrecked his campaign for this year  daun finds there is now no hope of saxony unless he himself at once proceed thither at once thitherand leave glogau and the russians to their luckwhich in such case what is it like to be probably to dauns own view ominous enough but he has no alternative to this pass has the march of fifty hours brought us there is such a thing as being too cunctatory is not there your excellency every mortal and more especially every feldmarschall ought to strike the iron while it is hot the remainder of this campaign we will hope can be made intelligible in a more summary manner     friedrich manages september 24thoctober 24th to get the russians sent home and himself falls lamed with gout  friedrichs manoeuvres against soltikofevery reader is prepared to hear that soltikof was rendered futile by them and none but military readers could take delight in the details two beautiful shortcuts he made upon soltikof pulled him up both times in mid career as with hard checkbit the first time was at zobelwitz september 24th friedrich cut across from sagan which is string to bow of the russian march posted himself on the heights of zobelwitz of baunau milkau at baunau friedrich will write a letter this night if readers bethink themselves milkau is a place he may remember for raindeluges in the first silesian war supra p 323 ib vol vii p 311 let the russians if they now dare try the pass of neustadtel here a fortunate hour when he got upon this ground quartermastergeneral stoffel our old custrin acquaintance is found marking out a camp with a view to that pass of neustadtel tempelhof iii 293 retzow ii 163 is greatly astonished to find the prussian army emerge on him there and at once vanishes with his hussarcossack retinues september 24th it is while prince henri was on the last moiety of his march of fifty hours this severe twitch flung soltikof quite out from glogauwas like to fling him home altogether had it not been for montalemberts eloquencedid fling him across the oder where again thanks to montalembert he was circling on with an eye to breslau when friedrich by the diameter suddenly laid bridges crossed at koben and again brought soltikof to halt as by turnpike suddenly shut must pay first must beat us first  these things had raised friedrichs spirits not a little getting on the heights of zobelwitz he was heard to exclaim this is a lucky day worth more to me than a battle with victory retzow ii 163 astonishing how he blazed out again quite into his old pride and effulgence after this says retzow had been so meek so humbled and even condescended to ask advice or opinion from some about him especially from two captains says the opposition retzow whose heads were nearly turned by this sunburst from on high captain marquart and anotheri believe he did employ them about routes and marking of camps which retzow calls consulting a king fallen tragically scarce of persons to consult all his winterfelds schwerins keiths and council of peers now vanished and nothing but some intelligentlooking captain marquart or the like to consultof which retzow in his splenetic opposition humor does not see the tragedy but rather the comedy how the poor captains found their favor to be temporary conditional and had to collapse again one of them wrote an essay on the coupdoeil militaire over which retzow pretends to weep this was friedrichs marginal note upon the ms when submitted to his gracious perusal you er will do better to acquire the art of marking camps than to write upon the military stroke of eye beautifully written too says retzow but what in the eyes of this king is beautiful writing to knowing your business well no friend he to writing unless you have got something really special and urgent to be written  friedrich crassed the oder twice took soltikof on both sides of the oder cut him out of this fond expectation then of that led him we perceive a bad life latterly the scene was on the right bank sophienthal koben herrnstadt and other poor placeson that big eastern elbow where oder takes his final bend or farewell of poland ground naturally of some interest to friedrich ground to us unknown but known to friedrich as the ground where karl xii gave schulenburg his beating near guhrau while chasing august the strong and him out of poland 12th october 1704 vague account of it dateless and as good as placeless in voltaire charles douse liv iii oeuvres xxx 142145 which produced the beautiful retreat of schulenburg the old feldmarschall schulenburg whom we used to hear of oncewhose nephew a pipeclayed little gentleman was well known to friedrich and us  for the rest i do not think he feels this outmanoeuvring of the russians very hard work already from zobelwitz country 25th september day of henri at hoyerswerda friedrich had written to fouquet with 21000 your beaten and maltreated servant has hindered an army of 50000 from attacking him and compelled them to retire on neusatz evidently much risen in hope and henris fine news not yet come to hand by degrees soltikof rendered futile got very angry especially when daun had to go for saxony meal was becoming impossible at any rate whimpers daun o excellency do but consider with the nobleness natural to you our court will cheerfully furnish money instead of mealmoney my people cannot eat money growled soltikof getting more and more angry threatening daily to march for posen and his own mealstores what a time of it has montalembert has the melancholy loudon with temper so hot  at sophienthal october 10th friedrich falls ill of goutabsolutely lamed for three weeks cannot stir from his room happily the outer problem is becoming easier and easier almost bringing its own solution at sophienthal the lame friedrich takes to writing about charles xii and his military characternot a very illuminative piece on the first perusal but i intend to read it again reflexions sur les talens militaires et sur le caractere de charles xii oeuvres de frederic vii 6988which at least helps him to pass the time soltikof more and more straitened meal itself running low gets angrier and angrier his treatment of the country montalembert rather encouraging is described as horrible one day he takes the whim whim or little more of seizing herrnstadt a small town between the two armies where the prussians have a free battalion the prussian battalion resists drives soltikofs people back never mind think they a place of no importance to us and excellency soltikof has ridden elsewhither by illluck in the afternoon excellency soltikof happened to mention the place again hearing that the prussians still have it soltikof mounts into a rage summons the place with answer still no thereupon orders instant bombardment of it fiery storms of grenadoes for it and has the satisfaction of utterly burning poor herrnstadt the prussian freecorps still continuing obstinate it was soltikofs last act in those parts and betokens a sulphurous state of humor  next morning october 24th he took the road for posen and marched bodily home tempelhof iii 299 291300 general account abundantly minute home verily in spite of montalembert and all men and for me what orders has excellency loudon had anxiously inquired on the eve of that event none whatever answered excellency do your own pleasure go whithersoever seems good to you and loudon had to take a wide sweep round by kalish through the western parts of poland and get home to the troppauteschen country as he best could  by kalish by czenstochow cracow poor loudon had to go a dismal march of 300 miles or morewaited on latterly by fouquet with werner goltz and others on the silesian border whom friedrich had ordered thither for such end whom loudon skilfully avoided to fight having already by desertion and by hardships lost half his men on the road glad enough to get home and under roof with his 20000 gone to 10000 and to make bargain with fouquet truce then through winter neither of us to meddle with the other unless after a fortnights warning given tempelhof iii 328331 november 1st a month before this the king carried on a litter by his soldiers had quitted sophienthal and crossing the river by koben got to glogau rodenbeck i 396 the greater part of his force 13000 under hulsen he had immediately sent on for saxony he himself intending to wait recovery in glogau with this silesian wing of the business happily brought to finis for the present  on the saxon side too affairs are in such a course that the king can be patient at glogau till he get well everything is prosperous in saxony since that march on hoyerswerda henri with his fincks and wunsches beautifully posted in the meissentorgau region no dislodging of him let daun with his big mass of forces try as he may daun through the month of october is in various camps in schilda last of all henri successively in two in strehla for some ten days then in torgau for about three weeks carefully intrenched tempelhof iii 276 281 284 henri in strehla october 4th17th thence to torgau 22d october daun quits his camp of belgern for that of schilda which was his last in those partswhere traces of him will turn up not too opportunely next year daun from whatever camp goes laboring on this side and on that on every side the deft henri is as sharp as needles nothing to be made of him by the cunning movements and contrivances of daun very fine manoeuvring it was especially on henris part a charm to the soldier mindgiven minutely in tempelhof and capable of being followed if you have maps and patience into the last details instructive really to the soldierbut must be almost all omitted here one beautiful slap to duke dahremberg a poor old friend of dauns and ours we will remember action of pretsch they call it defeat almost capture of poor dahremberg who had been sent to dislodge the prince by threatening his supplies and had wheeled accordingly eastward wide away but to his astonishment found after a march or two three select prussian corps emerging on him by front by rear by flank with horseartillery quasimiraculous bursting out on hilltops tooand in short nothing for it but to retreat or indeed to run in a considerably ruinous style poor dahremberg seyfarth beylagen ii 634637 hofbericht von der am 29 october 1759 bey meuro chiefly bey pretsch vorgefallenen action ib ii 543 n on the whole daun is reduced to a panting condition and knows not what to do his plans were intrinsically bad says tempelhof without beating henri in battle which he cannot bring himself to attempt he in all probability will were it only for difficulties of the commissariat kind have to fall back dresdenward and altogether take himself away tempelhof iii 287289  after this sad slap at pretsch daun paused for consideration took to palisading himself to an extraordinary degree slashing the schilda forests almost into ruin for this end and otherwise sat absolutely quiet little to be done but take care of oneself daun knows withal of hulsens impending advent with the silesian 13000november 2d hulsen is actually at muskau and his 13000 magnified by rumor to 20000 hearing of which daun takes the road november 4th quits his gloriously palisaded camp of schilda feels that retreat on dresden or even home to bohemia altogether is the one course left  and now the important bautzen colloquy of saturday september 15th having here brought its three or more courses of activity to a pausewe will glance at the far more important thursday 13th other side the ocean  above quebec night of september 12th13th in profound silence on the stream of the st lawrence far away a notable adventure is going on wolfe from two points well above quebec as a last shift we will try that way with about 5000 men is silently descending in boats with purpose to climb the heights somewhere on this side the city and be in upon it if fate will an enterprise of almost sublime nature very great if it can succeed the cliffs all beset to his left hand montcalm in person guarding quebec with his main strength  wolfe silently descends mind made up thoughts hushed quiet into one great thought in the ripple of the perpetual waters under the grim cliffs and the eternal stars conversing with his people he was heard to recite some passages of grays elegy lately come out to those parts of which says an earwitness he expressed his admiration to an enthusiastic degree ah these are tones of the eternal melodies are not they a man might thank heaven had he such a gift almost as we might for succeeding here gentlemen professor robison then a naval junior in the boat along with wolfe afterwards a wellknown professor of natural philosophy at edinburgh was often heard by persons whom i have heard again to repeat this anecdote see playfair biographical account of professor robisonin transactions of royal society of edinburgh vii 495 et seq next morning thursday 13th september 1759 wolfe with his 5000 is found to have scrambled up by some woody neck in the heights which was not quite precipitous has trailed one cannon with him the seamen busy bringing up another and by 10 of the clock stands ranked really somewhat in the friedrich way though on a small scale ready at all points for montcalm but refusing to be overready  montcalm on first hearing of him had made haste oui je les vois ou ils ne doivent pas etre je vais les ecraser to smash them said he by way of keeping his people in heart and marches up beautifully skilful neglecting none of his advantages has numerous canadian sharpshooters preliminary indians in the bushes with a provoking fire steady orders wolfe from you not one shot till they are within thirty yards and montcalm volleying and advancing can get no response more than from druidic stones till at thirty yards the stones become vocaland continue so at a dreadful rate and in a space of seventeen minutes have blown montcalms regulars and the gallant montcalm himself and their second in command and their third into ruin and destruction in about seven minutes more the agony was done english falling on with the bayonet highlanders with the claymore fierce pursuit rout totaland quebec and canada as good as finished the thing is yet well known to every englishman the military details of it seem to be very ill known witness colonel beatsons otherwise rather careful pamphlet the plains of abraham written quite lately which we are soon to cite farther and they would well deserve describing in the seyfarthbeylagen or even in the tempelhof waycould an english officer on the spot as this colonel was be found to do itdetails are in beatson quite another beatson naval and military history ii 300308 in gentlemans magazine for 1759 the despatches and particulars see also walpole george the second iii 217222 and how wolfe himself died in it his beautiful death  truly a bit of right soldierhood this wolfe manages his small resources in a consummate manner invents contrives attempts and reattempts irrepressible by difficulty or discouragement how could a friedrich himself have managed this quebec in a more artistic way the small battle itself 5000 to a side and such odds of savagery and canadians reminds you of one of friedrichs wise arrangements exact foresight preparation corresponding caution with audacity inflexible discipline silent till its time come and then blazing out as we see the prettiest soldiering i have heard of among the english for several generations amherst commanderinchief is diligently noosing and tying up the french military settlements niagara ticonderoga canada all round but this is the heart or windpipe of it keep this firm and in the circumstances canada is yours  colonel reatson in his recent pamphlet the plains of abrahamwhich especially on the military side is distressingly ignorant and shallow though not intentionally incorrect anywheregives extracts from a letter of montcalms quebec 24th august 1759 which is highly worth reading had we room it predicts to a hairsbreadth not only the way m wolfe if he understands his trade will take to beat and ruin me if we meet in fight but alsowith a sagacity singular to look at in the years 17751777 and perhaps still more in the years 18601863what will be the consequences to those unruly english colonial and other if he beat me here france has lost america utterly thinks montcalm yesand ones only consolation is in ten years farther america will be in revolt against england montcalms style of writing is not exemplary but his power of faithful observation his sagacity and talent of prophecy are so considerable we are tempted to give the ipsissima verba of his long letter in regard to those two pointsthe rather as it seems to have fallen much out of sight in our day  montcalm to a cousin in france  camp before quebec 24th august 1759  monsieur et cher cousinhere i am for more than three months past at handgrips with m wolfe who ceases not day or night to bombard quebec with a fury which is almost unexampled in the siege of a place one intends to retain after taking it will never take it in that way however by attacking from the river or south shore only ruins us but does not enrich himself not an inch nearer his object than he was three months ago and in one month more the equinoctial storms will blow his fleet and him awayquebec then and the preservation of the colony you think must be as good as safe alas the fact is far otherwise the capture of quebec depends on what we call a strokeofhandbut let us take to the original now for prediction first  la prise de quebec depend dun coup de main les anglais sont maitres de la riviere ils nont qua effectuer une descente sur la rive ou cette ville sans fortifications et sans defense est situee les voila en etat de me presenter la bataille que je ne pourrais plus refuser et que je ne devrais pas gagner m wolfe en effet sil entend son metier na qua essuyer le premier feu venir ensuite a grands pas sur mon armee faire a bout portant sa decharge mes canadiens sans discipline sourds a la voix du tambour et des instrumens militaires deranges pa cette escarre ne sauront plus reprendre leurs rangs ils sont dailleurs sans baionettes pour repondre a celles de lennemi il ne leur reste qua fuiret me voila battu sans ressource this is a curiously exact prediction i wont survive however defeat here in this stage of our affairs means loss of america altogether il est des situations ou il ne reste plus a un general que de perir avec honneur mes sentimens sont francais et ils le seront jusque dans le tombeau si dans le tombeau on est encore quelque chose  je me consolerai du moins de ma defaite et de la perte de la colonie par lintime persuasion ou je suis prediction second which is still more curious que cette defaite vaudra un jour a ma patrie plus quune victoire et que le vainqueur en sagrandissant trouvera un tombeau dans son agrandissement meme  ce que javance ici mon cher cousin vous paraitra un paradoxe mais un moment de reflexion politique un coup doeil sur la situation des choses en

hopeless news from the same quarter news of poor wolfes repulse on the other or eastern side of quebec july 31st known to us already not known in england till october 14th heightened by such contrast

despondency to sudden exultation than accident had here prepared to excite the passions of a whole people they despaired they triumphed and they weptfor wolfe had fallen in the hour of victory joy

some kind of friedrich temporary friedrich absolute though of insecure tenure and by a newcastle and the clack of tongues is very great but for pitt there had been no wolfe no amherst duke ferdinand had been the royal highness of cumberlandand all things going round him in st vitus at their old rate this man is a king for the time beingking really of the friedrich typeand rules friedrich himself

meissen country fairly ebbing homeward henri following with hulsen joinednot vehemently attacking the rhinoceros but judiciously pricking him forward daun goes at his slowest step in many divisions covering a wide circuit sticking to all the strong posts till his own time for quitting them slow sullenly cautious like a man descending dangerous precipices back foremost and will not be hurried so it had lasted about a week daun for the last four days sitting restive obstinate but henri pricking into him more and more till the rhinoceros seemed actually about lifting himselfwhen friedrich in person arrived in his brothers camp tempelhof iii 301305  at the schloss of herschstein a mile or two behind lommatsch which is henris headquarter still to westward of meissen daun hanging on seven or eight miles to southeastward ahead loath to go but actually obligedit was there tuesday november 13th that the king met his brother again a king free of his gout in joyful spirits and high of humorlike a man risen indignant once more got to his feet after three months oppressions and miseries from the unworthy too high mourns retzow in a gloomy tone as others do in perhaps a more indulgent one beyond doubt friedrichs farther procedures in this grave and weighty daun business were more or less imprudent of a too rapid and rash nature and turned out bitterly unlucky to him had he left the management to henri sighed everybody after the unlucky event  friedrich had not arrived above fourandtwenty hours when news came in the austrians in movement again actually rolling off dresdenward again haha do they smell me already laughed he well i will send daun to the devilnot adding if i can and instantly ordered sharp pursuitand sheer stabbing with the oxgoad not soft and delicate pricking as henris lately retzow ii 168 tempelhof iii 306 friedrich in fact was in a fiery condition against daun you trampled on me you heavy buffalo these three months but that is over nowand took personally the vanguard in this pursuit and had a bit of hot fighting in the village of korbitz scene of that finckhaddick action 21st september last and of poor haddicks ruin and retirement to the waterswhere the austrians now prove very fierce and obstinate and will not go till well slashed into and torn out by sheer beatingwhich was visibly a kind of comfort to the kings humor our prussians do still fight then much as formerly and it was all a hideous nightmare all that and daylight and fact are come and friedrich is himself again  they say prince henri took the liberty of counselling him even of entreating him leave well alone why run risks said henri daun it was pretty apparent had no outlook at the present but that of sauntering home to bohmen leaving dresden to be an easy prey again and his whole campaign to fall futile as the last had under henris gentle driving he would have gone slower but how salutary if he only went these were henris views but friedrich was not in the slow humor impatient to be in dresden will be quartered there in a week writes he and more at leisure than now wilsdruf 17th november 1759 and still more 19th november friedrich to voltaire in high spirits that way oeuvres de frederic xxiii 66 he is thinking of leuthen of rossbach of campaign 1757 so gloriously restored after ruin and in the fire of his soul is hoping to do something similar a second time that is retzows notion who knows but there may be truth in it a proud friedrich got on his feet again after such usagenay who knows whether it was quite so unwise to be impressive on the slow rhinoceros and try to fix some thorn in his snout or say figuratively to hobble his hindfeet which i am told would have been beautifully ruinous and though riskish was not impossible tempelhof iii 311 c ill it indisputably turned out and we have with brevity to say how and leave readers to their judgment of it  it was in the village of krogis about six miles forward on the meissenfreyberg road a mile or two on from korbitz and directly after the fierce little tussle in that villagethat friedrich his blood still up gave the order for maxen which proved so unlucky to him wunsch had been shot off in pursuit of the beaten austrians but they ran too fast and wunsch came back without farther result still early in the day back as far as krogis where the next headquarter is to beand finds the king still in a fulminant condition none the milder it is likely by wunschs returning without result go straight to general finck bid him march at once orders the king and rapidly gives wunsch the instructions finck is to follow finck and his corps are near nossen some ten miles ahead of krogis some twenty west from dresden there since yesterday stands finck infesting the left or western flank of the austrianswhat was their left and will be again when they call halt and face round on uslet finck now march at once quite round that western flank by freyberg dippoldiswalde thence east to maxen plant himself at maxen a dozen miles south of dresden among the rocky hills and stick diligently in the rear of those austrians cutting off or threatening to cut off their communications with bohemia and block the pirna country for them  friedrich calculates that if daun is for retreating by pirna country this will at lowest be a method to quicken him in that movement or perhaps it may prove a method to cut off such retreat altogether and force daun to go circling by the lausitz hills and wildernesses exposed to tribulations which may go nigh to ruin him that is friedrichs proud thought an unfortunate campaign winding up nevertheless as 1757 did in blazes of success and truly if friedrich could have made himself into two and while flashing and charging in dauns front have been in command at maxen in dauns rearfriedrich could have made a pretty thing of this waxen enterprise and might in good part have realized his proud program but there is no getting two friedrichs finck a general of approved quality he is the nearest approach we can make to a second friedrichand he illluck too superadding itself proves tragically inadequate and sets all the world and opposition retzow exclaiming see pride goes before a fall  at 3 in the afternoon friedrich intensely surveying from the heights of krogis the new austrian movements and positions is astonished not agreeably what still only here herr general by a personal visit from finck finck finds the maxen business intricate precarious wishes farther instructions brings forward this objection and that friedrich at last answers impatiently you know i cant stand making of difficulties er weiss dass ich die difficultaten nicht leiden kann mache dass er fort kommt contrive to get it done with which poor comfort finck has to ride back to nossen and scheme out his dispositions overnight  next morning thursday 15th finck gets on march drives the reichsfolk out of freyberg reaches dippoldiswaldefreyberg is to be my magazine considers finck dippoldiswalde my halfway house four battalions of my poor eighteen shall stand there and secure the mealcarts friday 16th finck has his vanguard wunsch leading it in possession of maxen and the heights and on saturday gets there himself with all his people and equipments i should think about 12000 men in a most intersected intertwisted hill country full of gullets dells and winding brooksit is forecourt of the pirna rocks our celebrated camp of gahmig lies visible to north dohna and the rothwasser bounding us to eastin grim november weather some snow falling or snowpowder alternating with sleet and glazing frosts by no means a beautiful enterprise to finck nor one of his own choosing had one a choice in such cases  to daun nothing could be more unwelcome than this news of finck embattled there at maxen in the inextricable hill country direct on the road of dauns mealcarts and bohemian communications and truly withalwhat daun does not yet hear but can guessthere is gone in supplement or as auxiliary to finck a fierce hussar party under grune kleist their fiercest hussar since mayer died who this very day at aussig burns dauns first considerable magazine and has others in view for the same fate friedrichs second letter to voltaire wilsdruf 19th november 1759 an evident thing to daun that finck being there meal has ceased  on the instant daun falls back on dresden saturday 17th takes post in the dell of plauen plauensche grund an impassable chasm with sheer steeps on both sides stretching southward from dresden in front of the hill country thither daun marches there to consider what is to be done with finck amply safe this position is none better in the world a village plauen and a brook weistritz in the bottom of this exquisite chasm sheer rockwalls on each sidehigh especially on the daun or south sideheadquarters can be in dresden itself room for your cavalry on the plain ground between dresden and the chasm a post both safe and comfortable only you must not loiter in making up your mind as to finck for friedrich has followed on the instant friedrichs headquarter is already wilsdruf which an hour or two ago was dauns at kesselsdorf vigilant ziethen is vanguard so that friedrich looks over on you from the northern brow of your chasm delays are not good near such a neighbor  daunurged on by lacy they sayis not long in deciding that in this strait the short way out will be to attack finck in the hills daun is in the hills as well as finck this plauen chasm is the boundaryditch of the hills daun with 27000 horse and

part of them already to southeastward of finck other part stealing on by the elbe bank thitherward here from three different points of the compass are 42000 these simultaneously dashing in from west north south upon finck may surely give account of his 12000 and him if only we can keep friedrich dark upon it which surely our pandours will contrive to do  finck directly on arriving at maxen had reported himself to the king and got answer before next morning very well but draw in those four battalions you have left in dippoldiswalde hit with the whole of your strength when a chance offers which order finck literally and not too willingly obeys leaves only some light remnant in dippoldiswalde and reinforcement to linger within reach till a certain breadconvoy come to him which will be due next morning monday 19th and which does then safely get home though under annoyances from cannonading in the distance  sunday 18th finck fails not to reconnoitre from the highest hilltop to inquire by every method he finds for certain that the enemy are coming in upon him with his own eyes he sees reichsfolk marching in quantity southeastward by the elbe shore intending towards dohna as is likeand despatched wunsch who accordingly drove them out of dohna of all this finck at once sent word to friedrich who probably enough received the message but who would get no new knowledge from itvigilant ziethen having by austrian deserters and otherwise discovered this of the reichsfolk and furthermore that sincere with 3000 was in motion from the north upon finck sunday evening friedrich despatches ziethens report which punctually came to fincks hand but was the last thing he received from friedrich or friedrich from him the intervening pandours picked up all the rest the ziethen report of two or three lines most succinct but sufficient like a cutting of hard iron is to be read in many books we may as well give the letter and it  friedrichs letter wilsdruf 18th november 1759 my dear generallieutenant von fincki send you the enclosed report from general ziethen showing what is the lie of matters as seen from this side and leave the whole to your disposition and necessary measures i am your wellaffectioned kingf the enclosure is as follows  general ziethens report kesselsdorf 18th november 1759 to your royal majesty send no pronoun i allowed herewith a corporal who has deserted from the austrians he says sincere with the reserve did march with the reichs army but a league behind it and turned towards dippoldiswalde general brentano wehlas old comrade luckier than wehla as this deserter heard last night in dauns headquarterwhich is in the southern suburb of dresden in the countess moschinskas gardenwas yesterday to have been in dohlen looking into our outposts from the hither side of their plauen dell but was not there any longer as our deserter passed and it was said that he had gone to maxen at three in the afternoon tempelhof iii 309  thus curtly is finck authorized to judge for himself in the new circumstances marginally is added in friedrichs own hand er wird entweder mit den reichern oder mit siceren einen gang habeneither with the reichers or with sincere you will have a bout i suppose  map facing page 350 book xix goes here  finck from his own hilltop on sunday and monday sees all this of ziethen and much more sees the vanguard of daun himself approaching dippoldiswalde cannonading his mealcarts as they issue there on all sides his enemies encompassing him like beesand has a sphinxriddle on his mind such as soldier seldom had shall he manoeuvre himself out and march away breadcarts baggages and all entire there is still time and perfect possibility by dippoldiswalde there or by other routes and methods but again did not his majesty expect do not these words a bout still seem to expect a bit of fighting with somebody or other finck was an able soldier and his skill and courage well known but probably another kind of courage was wanted this day of which finck had not enough finck was not king of this matter finck was under a king who perhaps misjudged the matter if finck saw no method of doing other than hurt and bad service to his king by staying here finck should have had the courage to come away and front the kings unreasonable anger expecting redress one day or never any redress that was fincks duty but everybody sees how hard it was for flesh and blood  finck truer to the letter than to the spirit determined to remain did all that monday his best to prepare himself called in his outposts was not i ordered thinks finck too literally and sees his multitudes of enemies settle round himdaun alone has 27000 men who take camp at dippoldiswalde and in sumtotal they are as 4 to 1 of fincka finck still resolute of face though internally his thoughts may be haggard enough doubtless he hopes too that friedrich will do somethingunaware that none of his messages reach friedrich as for daun having seen his people safely encamped here he returns to dresden for the night to see that friedrich is quiet friedrich is quiet enough daun at seven next morning tuesday 20th appeared on the ground again and from all sides finck is assaultedfrom dauns side nearest and soonest with dauns best vigor  dippoldiswalde is some seven miles from maxen difficult hillroad all the way but the steepest straitest and worst place is at reinhartsgrimma the very first hamlet after you are out of dippoldiswalde there is a narrow gullet there overhung with heights all round the roads are slippery glazed with sleet and frost cavalry unroughened make sad sliding and sprawling hardly the infantry are secure on their feet a terrible business getting masses of artillerywagons horse and man through such a pass it is thought had finck garnished this pass of reinhartsgrimma with the proper batteries the proper musketries daun never would have got through finck had not a gun or a man in it had not i order said heagain too literally as it was daun sliding and sprawling in the narrow steeps had difficulties almost too great and they say would have given it up had it not been that a certain major urged can be done excellenz and shall and that the temper of his soldiers was everywhere excellent unfortunate finck had no artillery to bear on dauns transit through the pass nothing but some weak body of hussars and infantry stood looking into it from the hill of hausdorf even these might have given him some slight hindrance but these were played upon by endless pandours issuing from a wood near by with musketries and at length with cannon batteries one and anotherand had to fall back or to be called back to maxen hill where the main force is  in the course of yesterday by continual reconnoitring by austrian deserters and intense comparison of symptoms finck had completely ascertained where the enemys three attacks were to beon maxen from dippoldiswalde trohnitz dohna simultaneously three attacks it appearsand had with all his skill arranged himself on the maxen summits to meet these he stands now elaborately divided into three groups against those three simultaneities forming sadly wide apart one would say for such a force as fincks a very obtuseangled trianglethe obtuse vertex of which if readers care to look on their map is trohnitz the road brentano and sincere are coming on the baseangles maxen and dohna finck expects daun and the reich from trohnitz to maxen is near two miles from maxen to dohna above four at dohna stands wunsch against the reich finck himself at maxen expecting daun as the pith of the whole affair in this triangular way stands finck at the topmost heights of the countrymaxen highest but hausdorf only a little lowerand has not thought of disputing the climb upwards too literal an eye to his orders alas he was not himself king but only kings deputy  the result is about 11 am as i obscurely gather daun has conquered the climb dauns musketries begin to glitter on the top of hausdorf and 26 or 32 heavy cannon open their throats there and the three attacks break loose fincks maxen batteries scarcely higher than dauns and far inferior in weight respond with all diligence the poor regimental fieldpieces helping what they can mutual cannonade very loud for an hour and half terrific but doing little mischief after which dauns musketries the ground now sufficiently clear to daun which are the practical thing begin opening first from one point then from another and there ensues for five hours coming at maxen and at the other two points of fincks triangle such a series of explosive chargings wheelings worryings and intricate deathwrestlings as it would provoke every reader to attempt describing to him except indeed he were a soldier bound to know the defence of posts in which case i could fairly promise him that there are means of understanding the affair and that he might find benefit in it tempelhof iii 307317 journal und nachricht von der gefangennehmung des finckschen corps bey maxen im jahre 1759 seyfarth beylagen ii 637654  dauns grenadiers and infantry generally are in triumphant spirits confident of victory as they may reasonably be fincks people too behave well some of them conspicuously well though in gloomier mood and make stubborn fight successful here and there but as a whole not capable of succeeding by 3 in the afternoon the austrians have forced the maxen post they enter maxen with great shoutings extrude the obstinate prussian remnants and before long have the poor village on fire in every part finck retreating northward to schmorsdorf towards the obtuse angle of his triangle if haply there may be help in that quarter for him daun does not push him much has maxen safely burning in every part  from schmorsdorf finck pushes out a cavalry charge on brentano could we but repulse brentano yonder thinks he i might have those four battalions to hand and try again but brentano makes such cannonading the cavalry swerve to a hollow on their right then find they have not ground and retire quite fruitless fincks cavalry and the cavalry generally with their horses all sliding on the frosty mountaingnarls appear to be good for little this day brentano victorious over the cavalry comes on with such storm he sweeps through the obtuse angle home upon finck and sweeps him out of schmorsdorf village to schmorsdorf hill there to take refuge as the night sinksand to see himself if his wild heart will permit him to be candid a ruined man of the three attacks two have completely succeeded on him only wunsch at dohna stands victorious he has held back the reich all day and even chased it home to its posts on the rothwasser red water multitudinous as it was  fincks mood as the november shadows gathered on himthe equal heart may at least pity poor finck his resolution is fixed cut ourselves through this night dohna is ours other side that red water there are roadsperish or get through and the generals who are rallied now on the heights of falkenhain and bloschwitz midway between maxen and dohna get that order from him and proceed to arrange for executing itthough with outlook more and more desperate as their scouts report that every pass and post on the red water is beset by reichsfolk wunsch with the cavalry he at least may thread his way out under cloud of night by the opposite or daun side calculates finck and wunsch sets out accordingly a very questionable winding subterranean march difficult in the extremethe wearied slipshod horses going at a snails pace and in the difficult passes needing to be dragged through with bridle and even to be left altogetherin which withal it will prove of no use for wunsch to succeed fincks generals endeavoring to rank and rearrange through the night find that their very cartridges are nearly spent and that of men such wounding such deserting has there been they have at this time by precise count 2836 rank and file evidently desperate  at daylight dauns cannon beginning again from the maxen side finck sends to capitulate absolute surrender answers daun prisoners of war and you shall keep your private baggage general wunsch with the cavalry he too must turn back and surrender finck pleaded hard on this last score general wunsch as head of the cavalry is not under me is himself chief in that department but it was of no use wunsch had to return not quite got through dauns lines after such a night and to surrender like everybody else like eight other generals like wolfersdorf of torgau and many a brave officer and man wednesday morning 21st november 1769 it is fincks fourth day on maxen his last in the prussian service  that same wednesday afternoon there were ranked in the grosse garten at dresden of dejected prussian prisoners from maxen what exact number was never known the austrians said 15000 but nobody well believed them their last certain instalment being only in correct numbers 2836 besides the killed wounded and already captured many had deserted many had glided clear off it is judged that friedrich lost by all these causes about 12000 men gone whollywith their equipments and appurtenances wholly which are not worth counting in comparison finck and the other generals 8 of them and 529 officersfinck wunsch wolfersdorf mosel of the olmutz convoy not to mention others of

determinate despatch of business but the king retained a bitter memory of it all his days to finck he was inexorableordered him the first thing on his return from austrian captivity trial by courtmartial which ziethen presiding june 1763 censured finck in various points and gave him in supplement to the austrian detention a years imprisonment in spandau no ray of pity visible for him then

counterseverity and truly it would have been more beautiful to everybody for the moment to have made matters soft to poor finckhad friedrich ever gone on that score with his generals and delegates

than their prussian neighbors this of the tents and six frostbitten battalions guarding them lasted till april an extraordinary obstinacy on the part both of daun and of friedrich alike jealous of even seeming to yield one inch more of ground  the hereditary prince with his 12000 marched home again in february indeed ever after the going into cantonments all use of the prince and his force here visibly ceased and on the whole no result whatever followed those strenuous antagonisms and frozen tents left standing for three months and things remained practically what they were so that as the grand peace negotiations also came to nothing we might omit this of winterquarters altogether and go forward to the opening of campaign fifthwere it not that characteristic features do otherwise occur

loose intercalary chapter may be thrown together here     serene highness of wurtemberg at fulda november 30th 1759 is just about firing victoria and giving a ball to beauty and fashion in honor of a certain eventbut is unpleasantly interrupted  november 21st the very day while finck was capitulating in the hills of maxen duke ferdinand busy ever since his victory at minden did after a difficult siege of munster siege by imhof with ferdinand protecting him get munster into hand again which was reckoned a fine success to him very busy has the duke been industriously reaping the fruits of his victory at minden and this the conclusive rooting out of the french from that westphalian region is a very joyful thing and puts ferdinand in hopes of driving them over the mayn altogether which some think he would have done had not he with magnanimous oblivion of self and wishes agreed to send the hereditary prince and those 12000 to assist in friedrichs affairs looking upon that as the vital point in these allied interests friedrichs attempts we have said turned out impossible nor would the hereditary prince and his 12000 though a good deal talked about in england and elsewhere walpole

majesty be pleased to consent as i dare presume they will the hereditary prince had in his swift way done a thing useful for ferdinand himself and which caused a great emotion chiefly of laughter over

had been so fatherly and really took such pains fatherly stepfatherly you mean and for his own vile uses growled the serenity of wurtembergalways an ominous streak of gloom in that poor man streak which is spread now to whole skies of boiling darkness owing to deliriums there have been enough karl eugen after divorcing his poor wife had distinguished himself by a zeal without knowledge beyond almost all the enemies of friedrichand still continues in that bad line of industry his poor wife he has made miserable in some measure also himself and in a degree his poor soldiers and subjects who are with him by compulsion in this enterprise the wurtembergers are protestants of old type and want no fighting against the protestant hero but much the reverse serene karl had to shoot a good few of these poor people before they would march at all and his procedures were indeed and continued to be of a very crying nature though his poor populations took them silently always something of perverse in this serene highness has it i think by kind  besides his quota to the reich karl eugen has 12000 more on footand it is of them we are treating at present in 1757 he had lent these troops to the empress queen for a consideration it was they that stood on the austrian left at leuthen and were the first that got beaten and had to cease standingas the austrians were abundantly loud in proclaiming to the disgust of serene highness which of you did stand then was it their blame led as they were argued he and next year 1758 after crefeld he took his 12000 to the french subsidy or consideration to be paid in salt it appears oeuvres de frederic v 10 with whom they marched about and did nothing considerable the serenity had pleaded i must command them myself you said belleisle

consent serenity of wurtemberg at that late season took the field accordingly and broglio now has him at fulda to cut off ferdinand from cassel to threaten ferdinands left flank and his provisioncarts

universe differed extremely in many important points from that of dr martin luther but in the vital allessential point what we may call the hearts core of all creeds which are human human and not simious or diabolic the king and the doctor were with their whole heart at one that it is not allowable that it is dangerous and abominable to attempt believing what is not true in that sense friedrich by nature and position was a protestant and even the chief protestant in the world what kind of hero in this big war of his we are gradually learningin which too if you investigate there is

to take shelter in the shoaly coasts and nooks thereabouts which were unknown to hawke and might ruin him if he should pursue the day being short and the weather extremely bad weather itself almost to be called a storm shoreward then eastward every ship became ultimately conflanss plan on the whole it was 2 in the afternoon before hawke with those vanward eight could get clutch of conflans and

this avalanche of impending destructions what can be more surprising than to hear of the editing of poems on his majestys part actual publication of that oeuvre de poesie for which voltaire poor gentleman suffered such tribulation seven years ago now coming out from choice reprint of it not now to the extent of twelve copies for highly special friends but in copious thousands for behoof of mankind at large the thing cost friedrich very little meditating and had become necessaryand to be done with speed  readers recollect the oeuvre de poesie and satirical hits said to be in it at paris about newyears time 1760 some helpful hand had contrived to bring out under the pretended date potsdam a cheap edition of that interesting work oeuvres du philosophe de sanssouci 1 vol 12 mo potsdam paris in truth 1760 merely in the way of theft as appeared to cursory readers to dargens for example his letter to the king oeuvres de frederic xix 138 but in deeper fact for the purpose of apprising

glad of this theft so exquisitely clever is the book but friedrich knows better march 17th when a copy of it came to him friedrich sees well what is meantand what he himself has to do in it he instantly sets about making a few suppressions changes of phrase sends the thing to dargens publish at once with a little prefatory word and at the top of his speed dargens has in three weeks time the suitable avantpropos or avis au libraire circulating in great quantities especially in london and petersburg thief editor has omitted and what is far more has malignantly interpolated here is the poor

read and compared what nobody will now do theme and treatment of theme being both now so heartily indifferent to us  who the perpetrator of this parisian maleficence was remained darkand would not be worth inquiring into at all except for two reasons intrinsically trifling but not quite without interest to readers of our time first that voltaire whom some suspected some never much friedrich that i hear of appears to have been perfectly innocentand indeed had been incapacitated for guilt by schmidt and freytag and their dreadful frankfurt procedures this is reason first poor voltaire mutely asking us not to load him with more sins than his own reason second is that by a singular opportunity there has in these very months spring 1863 a glimmering of light risen on it to this editor illustrating two other points as well which readers here are acquainted with some time ago as riddles of the insignificant sort the demon newswriter with his idea of friedrich and the matinees du roi de prusse readers recollect both those productions both enigmatic as to authorshipbut both now become riddles which can more or less be read  for the surprising circumstance though in certain periods when the realm of very chaos reemerges fitfully into upper sunshine now and then nothing ought to surprise one as happening there is that only a few months ago the incomparable matinees known to my readers five years since has found a new editor and reviver editor illuminated by the secretary of the great napoleon by discovery of manuscripts by the duc de rovigo and i know not what animated also it is said by religious views and in short the matinees is again abroad upon the worldyour london edition twice reprinted in germany by the jesuit party since much good may it do the jesuit partya matinees again in comfortable circumstances as would seem probably the longesteared platitude now walking the earth though there are a good many with ears long unconscious seemingly that it has been killed thrice and four times already and that indeed except in the realm of nightmare it never was alive or needed any killing belief in it doubt upon it i must grieve to inform the duc de rovigo and honorable persons concerned being evidence conclusive that you have not yet the faintest preliminary shadow of correct knowledge about friedrich or his habits or affairs and that you ought first to try and acquire some  to me argument on this subject would have been too unendurable but argument there was on it by persons capable and willing more than one and in result this surprising brandnew london mooncalf of a matinees was smitten through and slit in pieces for the fifth timeas if that could have hurt it much mit der dummheit sings schiller human stupidity is stronger than the very gods however in the course of these new inspections into matters long since obsolete there didwhat may truly be considered as a kind of profit by this resuscitating of the mooncalf matinees upon afflicted mankind and is a net outcome from it real though very smallsome light rise as to the origin and genesis of matinees some twinkles of light and in the utterly dark element did disclose other monstrous extinct shapes looming to right and left of said monster and in a word the authorship of matinees and not of matinees only becomes now at last faintly visible or guessable to one of those industrious matadors as we may call them slayers of this mooncalf for the fourth or fifth time i owe the following note which on verifying i can declare to be trustworthy  the author of matinees it is nearly certain says my correspondent is actually a m de bonnevillecontrary to what you wrote five years ago ad 1858 supra v 165 166 not indeed the bonneville who is found in dictionaries who is visibly impossible but a bonneville of the preceding generation who was marechal de saxes adjutant or secretary old enough to have been the uncle or the father of that revolutionary bonneville marechal de saxe died november 30th 1750 this senior bonneville still a young man had been with him to potsdam on visit there bonneville conscious of genius and now out of employment naturally went thither again lived a good deal there or went between france and there and authentic history knows of him by direct evidence and by reflex the following three facts the second of them itself threefold of which i will distinguish the indubitable from the inferentially credible or as good as certain  1 indubitable that bonneville sold to friedrich certain papers military plans or the like of the late marechal and was paid for them but by no means met the recognition his genius saw itself to merit these things are certain though not dated or datable except as of the year 1750 or 1751 after which for above twenty years bonneville entered upon a series of adventures caliginous underground for most part soldiering in america writing anonymous pamphlets or books roaming wide over the world and led a busy but obscure and uncertain life hanging by berlin as a kind of centre or by paris and berlin as his two centres and had a miscellaneous series of adventures subterranean many of them unluminous all of them not courting the light which lie now in naturally a very dark condition dimly discernible however in the general dusk of bonneville dim and vague of outline but definitely steady beyond what could have been expected it does appear fartherwhat alone entitles bonneville to the least memory here or anywhere in nature now or henceforth  2 inferentially credible that shortly after that first rebuff in potsdam he not another in 1752 was your demon newswriter whom we gazed at some time since devoutly crossing ourselves for a little while  likewise that in 17591760 after or before his american wanderings he the same bonneville as was suspected at the time nicolai ueber zimmermanns fragmente i 181 182 ii 253 254 sketch of what is authentically known about bonneville suspected both of matinees and of the stolen edition stole and edited this surreptitious mischiefmaking oeuvres du philosophe de sanssouci paris or lyon pretending to be potsdam january 1760 which we are now considering encouraged probably enough by choiseul himself who in any case is now known to have been the promoter of this fine bit of mischief choiseuls own note to m de malesherbes directeur de la libraire 10th december 1759 by every method screen the kings government from being suspectedand get the edition out at once published in the constitutionnel  2d december 1850 by m saintebeuve copied in preuss oeuvres de frederic xix 168 nand who may thereupon or may as probably not thereupon if it were of the least consequence to gods or men have opened to bonneville a new military career in america career which led to as good as nothing french soldiering in america being done for in the course of 1760 upon which bonneville would return to his old haunts to his old subterranean industries in paris and berlin  and that finally in 1765 he as was again suspected at the time nicolai ueber zimmermanns fragmente i 181 182 ii 253 254 sketch of what is authentically known about bonneville suspected both of matinees and of the stolen edition he and no other did write those matinees which appeared next year in print 1766 and many times since and have just been reprinted as a surprising new discovery at london in spring 1863  3 again indubitable that either after or before those editorial exploits bonneville had sold the marechal de saxes plans and papers which were already the kings to some second person and been a second time paid for them and was in regard to this swindling exploit found out and by reason of that sale or for what reason is not known was put into spandau and one hopes ended his life there nicolai ubi supraand besides him only the two following references out of half a cartload 1 bachaumont memoires secretes 7th february 1765 see barbier dictionnaire des

time privately did though the austrians privately had no need to do so being already fixed for a negative response to the proposal but hereby rose actual talk of a congress and wagging of diplomatic wigs as to where it shall be in breda said some breda a place used to congresses why not in nanci here said poor old expolish stanislaus alive to the calls of benevolence poor old titular soul others said leipzig others augsburgand indeed in augsburg according to the gazetteers at one time there were upholsterers busy getting ready the apartments so that with such rumor in the diplomatic circles the gazetteer and outer world was full of speculation upon peace and friedrich had lively hopes of it and had been hoping three months before as we transiently saw though again it came to nothing all to nothing and is not in itself worth the least attention from us herea poor extinct fact loud in those months and filling the whole world now silent and extinct to everybodyexcept indeed that it offers physiognomic traits here and there of a certain king and of those about him for which reason we will dwell on it a few minutes longer  nobody in that winter 17591760 could guess where or from whom this big worldinteresting peacenegotiation had its birth as everybody now can when nobody now is curious on the question at sagan in september last we all saw the small private source of it its

excerpts may still have a kind of interest now when the thing corresponded on has ceased to have any to the duchess a nobleminded lady beautifully zealous to help if she could by whose hand these multifarious peacepapers have to pass this is always friedrichs fine style in transmitting them out of many specimens following that of sagan which we gave here are the next three   friedrich to the

its real ownership though the context considerably redeems it therethe prejudice i cant get rid of that in war dieu est pour les gros escadrons  as to voltaire again and the new friedrichvoltaire style of correspondence something more of detail will be requisite ever since the black days of 1757 when poor wilhelmina with rossbach and leuthen still hidden from her in a future gloomy as death desperately brought voltaire to bear upon cardinal tencin in this matter without success there has been a kind of regular corresponding between voltaire and friedrich characteristic on both sides a pair of lovers hopelessly estranged and divorced and yet in a sense unique and priceless to one another the past full of heavenly radiances which issued alas in flames and sooty conflagrations as of erebuslet us forget it and be taught by it the past is painful and has been too didactic to some of us but here still is the present with its future better than blank nothing pleasant to hear the sound of that divine voice of my loved one were it only in commonplace remarks on the weatherperhaps intermixed with secret gibings on myselflet us hear it while we can amid those worldwide crashing discords and piping whirlwinds of war  friedrich sends his new verses or light proses which he is ever and anon throwing off voltaire sends his mostly in print and of more elaborate turn they talk on matters that are passing round them round this king the centre of themfriedrich usually in a rather swaggering way lest his correspondent think of blabbing and always with something of banter audible in himas has voltaire too but in a finer treble tone being always female in this pretty duet of parted lovers it rarely comes to any scolding between them but there is or can be nothing of cordiality nothing except in the mutual admiration which one perceives to be sincere on both sides and also in the mutual practical estrangement nothing more of youespecially of you madamas a practical domestic article  after long reading with historical views in this final section of the friedrichvoltaire correspondence at first so barren otherwise and of little entertainment one finds that this too when once you can read it that is to say when the scene and its details are visible to you becomes highly dramatic shakspeareancomic or more for this is natures self who far excels even shakspeareand that the inextricably dark condition of these letters is a real loss to the ingenuous reader and especially to the student of friedrich among the frequently recurring topics one that oftenest turns up on voltaires side is that of peace oh if your majesty would but make peace does it depend on me thinks friedrich always and is at last once provoked to say so   friedrich to voltaire  reichhennersdorf 2d

that is what persons of my way of thinking will by no means put up with i love peace quite as much as you could wish but i want it good solid and honorable socrates or plato would have thought as i do

strength of friedrichs hopes from this small document of choiseuls was of course ready how welcome every chance of a just peace and agreed to the joint declaration at the hague and took what farther

choiseul never had any serious intention of succeeding light choiseul a clever man but an unwise of the sort called dashing had entertained the matter merely in the optative formand when it came nearer wished to use it for making mischief between pitt and friedrich and for worming out edelsheims secrets if he had anyfor which reason he finally threw edelsheim into the bastille for a few days oeuvres de frederic v 3841 detailed account of the affair  about the end of march i guess it to have been that choiseul by way of worming out poor edelsheims secrets flung him into the bastille for a day or two already in december foregoing we have seen choiseuls blackartist busy upon the stolen edition of friedrichs verses a choiseul full of intrigues adroit enough ambitious enough restlessly industrious in making mischief if there were nothing else to be made who greatly disgusted friedrich now and afterwards  and this was what the grand voltaire pacification came to though it filled the world with temporary noise and was so interesting to voltaire and another what a heartaffecting generosity humility and dulcet pathos in that of the poor mouse gnawing asunder a mesh of the lions net there is a good deal of that throughout on the voltaire sidethat is to say while writing to friedrich but while writing of him to third parties sometimes almost simultaneously the contrast of styles is not a little startling and the beautiful affectionately chirping mouse is seen suddenly to be an injured wildcat with its fur up all readers of voltaire are aware of this and how voltaire handles his luc mysterious nickname for king friedrich  when lucs back is turned for alas there is no man or thing but has its wrong side too least of all a voltairedoing treble voice withal if you consider it in such a duet of estranged lovers suppose we give these few specimenstreble mostly and a few of bass as wellto illustrate the nature of this duet and of the noises that went on round it in a warconvulsed world and first of all concerning the enigma what is luc  what the luc in voltaire is shocking explanations have been hit upon but wagniere wagner an intelligent swiss man voltaires old secretary gives this plain reading of the riddle m de voltaire had at the delices near by ferney till the chateau got built a big ape of excessively mischievous turn who used to throw stones at the passersby and sometimes would attack with its teeth friend or foe alike one day it thrice over bit m de voltaires own leg he had called it luc luke and in conversation with select friends as also in letters to such he sometimes designated the king of prussia by that nickname he is like my luc here bites whoever caresses himin 1756 m de voltaire having still on his heart the frankfurt outrage wrote curious memoires ah yes vie privee and afterwards wished to burn them but a copy had been stolen from him in 1768and they still afflict the poor world  to the same effect speaks johannes von

knowing friendshiphaving such a chance too with some of us     friedrich has sent lord marischal to spain other fond hopes of friedrichs  in the beginning of this year 1759 earl marischal had been called out of his neufchatel stagnancy and launched into the diplomatic field again sent on mission into spain namely the case was this ferdinand vi of spain he who would not pay friedrich the old spanish debt but sent him merino rams and a jar of queendowager snuff had fallen into one of his gloomy fits and was thought to be dyingdid in fact die in a state nearly mad on the 10th august following by treaty of aixlachapelle and by all manner of treaties carlos of naples his halfbrother termagants baby carlos whom we all knew was to succeed him in spain don philip the next brother now of parma and piacenza was to follow as king in naplesceding those two litigious duchies to austria after all friedrich vividly awake to every chance foresaw in case of such disjunctures in italy good likelihood of quarrel there and has despatched the experienced old marischal to be on the ground and have his eyes open marischal knows spain very well and has often said he left a dear old friend there the sun marischal was under way about newyears time but lingered by the road waiting how ferdinand would turnand having withal an important business of his own as he sauntered on did not arrive i think till summer was at hand and his dear old friend coming out in vigor  august 10th 1759 ferdinand died and the same day carlos became king of spain but instead of giving naples to don philip carlos gave it to a junior son of his own and left poor philip to content himself with parma and piacenza as heretofore clear against the rights of austria treaty of aixlachapelle is perfectly explicit on that point will not austria vindicate its claim politicians say austria might have recovered not only parma and piacenza but the kingdom of naples itselfno france at present able to hinder it no spain ever able but austria contrary to expectation would not a country tenacious enough of its rights real and imaginary greedy enough of italy but of silesia much more the matter was deliberated in council at vienna but the result was magnanimously no finish this friedrich first finish this silesia nothing else till that  the marischals legationary function therefore proved a sinecure no carlos needing antiaustrian assistance from friedrich or another austria magnanimously having let him alone doubtless a considerable disappointment to friedrich industrious friedrich had tried on the other side of this affair whether the king of sardinia once an adventurous fighting kind of man could not be stirred up having interests involved but no he too grown old devotional apprehensive held by his rosaries and answered no here is again a hope reasonable to look at but which proves fallacious  marischal continued in spain corresponding sending news the prussian archives alone know what for nearly a couple of years returned april 1762 friedrichs letter to him 10th april 1762 in oeuvres de frederic xx 285 his embassy had one effect which is of interest to us here on his way out he had gone by london with a view of getting legal absolution for his jacobitismso far at least as to be able to inherit the earldom of kintore which is likely to fall vacant soon by blood it is his were the jacobite incapacities withdrawn kintore is a cadet branch of the keiths john younger son of william sixth lord marischal was the first kintore william sixths younger son yesand williams father a man always venerable to me had ad 1593 founded marischal college aberdeenwhere for a few in those stern granite countries the diviner pursuits are still possible thank god and this keith on frugal oatmeal marischalcollege keith or fifth lord marischal was grandfathers grandfather of our potsdam friend who is tenth and last douglass scotch peerage pp 448 et seq 387 et seq honor to the brave and noble now fallen silent under foot not of the nobler in a word the fourth kintore was about dying childless and marischal had come by london on that heritage business  he carried naturally the best recommendations britannic majesty pitt and everybody met him with welcome and furtherance what he wished was done and in such a style of promptness and cordiality pitt pushing it through as quite gained the heart of old marischal and it is not doubted though particulars have not been published that he sent important spanish notices to pitt in these yearsand especially informed him that king carlos and the french bourbon had signed a family compact 15th august 1761 or solemn covenant to stand by one another as brothers which was thenceforth to pitt privately an important fact as perhaps we shall see though to other men it was still only a painful rumor and dubiety whether the old marischal informed him that king carlos hated the english that he never had in his royal mind forgiven that insult of commodore martins watch laid on the table in the bay of naples long ago i do not know but that also was a fact a diligent indignant kind of man this carlos i am told by no means an undeserving king of spain though his portraits declare him an ugly we will leave him in the discreet marischals hands with the dear old friend shining equally on both  singular to see how in so veracious an intellect as friedrichs so many fallacies of hope are constantly entertained war in italy on quarrel with king carlos peace with france and the pompadour by help of edelsheim and the bailli de froulay peace with russia and the infame catin by help of english briberies friedrich sent an agent this winter with plenty of english guineas but he got no farther than the frontier not allowed even to try sometimes as again this winter it is hope of denmark joining him in alarm against the russian views on holstein but that too comes to nothing above all there is perennially budding out yearly the brighter after every disappointment a hope in the grand turk and his adherencies grand turk or failing him the cham of tartaryfor certain some of these will be got to fasten on the heels of austria of russia and create a favorable diversion friedrich took an immense deal of trouble about this latter hope it is almost pathetic to see with what a fond tenacity he clings to it and hopes it over again every new spring and summer preuss ii 121 et seq 292 c schoning ii iii passim  the hope that an infame catin might die some day for she is now deep in chaotic ailments deepish even in brandy seems never to have struck him at least there is nowhere any articulate hint of itthe eagleflight of ones imagination soaring far above such a pettiness hope is very beautiful and even fallacious hope in such a friedrich the one hope that did not deceive him was hope in his own best exertion to the very death and no fallacy ever for a moment slackened him in that stand to thyself in the wide domain of imagination there is no other certainty of help no other certaintyand yet who knows through what pettinesses heaven may send help     chapter ixpreliminaries to a fifth campaign  it was april 25th before friedrich quitted freyberg and took camp not till the middle of june that anything of serious movement came much discouragement prevails in his army we hear and indeed it must be owned the horoscope of these campaigns grows yearly darker only friedrich himself must not be discouraged nor isthough there seldom lay ahead of any man a more dangerouslooking year than this that is now dimly shaping itself to friedrich his fortune seems to have quitted him his enemies are more confident than ever  this year it seems they have bethought them of a new device against him we have 90 million population count they he has hardly 5 in the end he must run out of men let us cease exchanging prisoners with him at jagerndorf in april 1758 just before our march to olmutz there had been exchange not without haggles but this was the last on austrias part cartel of the usual kind values punctually settled a fieldmarshal is worth 3000 common men or 1500 pounds colonel worth 130 men or 65 pounds common man is worth 10s sterling not a high figure archenholtz ii 53 the russians haggled still more no keeping of them to their word but they tried it a second time last year october 1759 and by careful urging and guiding were got dragged through it and the prisoners on both sides sent to their colors again after which it was a settled line of policy no more exchanging or cartelling we will starve him out in that article and had friedrich had nothing but his own 5 millions to go upon though these contributed liberally he had in truth been starved out nor could saxony with mecklenburg anhalt erfurt and their 10000 men a year have supplied himhad not there says archenholtz a man rather fond of superlatives  had not there risen a recruiting system or crimping system the like of which for kind and degree was never seen in the earth before prisoners captive soldiers if at all likely fellows were by every means persuaded and even compelled to take prussian service compelled cudgel in hand says archenholtz who is too indiscriminating i can seefor there were pfalzers wurtembergers reichsfolk who had first been compelled the other way not asked if they wished to serve but dragged to the prussian colors obliged to swear there and fight against their countrymen say at least against their countrymens governors contumacious serene highnesses of wurtemberg mecklenburg and the like wurtemberg we mentioned lately had to shoot a good few of his first levy against the protestant champion before they would march at alli am sorry for these poor men and wish the reich had been what it once was a veracity and practical reality not an imaginary entity and hideously contemptible wiggery as it now is contemptible and hideous as wellsetting itself up on that fundamental mendacity which is eternally tragical though little regarded in these days and which entails mendacities without end on parties concernedbut apart from all this certain it is  the whole german reich was deluged with secret prussian enlisters the greater part of these were not actual officers at all but hungry adventurers who had been bargained with and who for their own profit allowed themselves every imaginable art to pick up men head and centre of them was the prussian colonel colignon one of the freecorps people a man formed by nature for this business what a beautiful manwho gave all the others their directions and taught them by his own example colignon himself in wintertime travelled about in all manner of costumes and characters persuading hundreds of people into the prussian service he not only promised commissions but gave suchnominating loose young fellows laffen students merchants clerks and the like to lieutenancies and captaincies in the prussian army about as likely as in the seraphim and cherubim had they known it in the infantry in the cuirassiers in the hussarsit is all one you have only to choose the renown of the prussian arms was so universal and combined with the notion of rich booty that colignons commissionmanufactory was continually busy no need to provide marchingmoney handmoney shillings for earnest colignons recruits travelled mostly of will and at their own charge in franken in schwaben in the rhine countries a dissolute son would rob his fatheras shopmen their masters tills and managers their cashboxesand hie off to those magnanimous prussian officials who gave away companies like kreutzers and had a value for young fellows of spirit they hastened to magdeburg with their commissions where they were received as common recruits and put by force into the regiments suitable no use in resisting the cudgel and the drillsergeantwho doubts ittill complete submission by this and other methods colignon and his helpers are reckoned to have raised for the king in the course of this war about 60000 recruits archenholtz ii 53  this year daun though his reputation is on the decline lately is to have the chief command as usual the grand army with saxony for field of conquest and the reichsfolk to assist is to be dauns but what is reckoned an important improvement loudon is to have a separate command and army of his own loudon hot of temper melancholic shy is not a man to recommend himself to kriegshofrath people but no doubt imperial majesty has had her own wise eye on him his merits are so undeniable the need of some commander not of the cunctator type is become so very pressing army of silesia 50000 that is to be loudons with 40000 russians to cooperate and unite themselves with loudon and try actually for conquest of silesia this year while daun conquering saxony keeps the king busy  at petersburg versailles vienna much planning there has been and arduous consulting first at petersburg in time and in importance where montalembert has again been very urgent in regard to those poor swedish people and the getting of them turned to some kind of use stettin in conjunction with the swedes oh listen to reason and take stettin would not dantzig by ourselves be the advisable thing answers soltikof dantzig is an important town and the grand baltic haven and would be so convenient for our preussen since we have determined to maintain that fine conquest so thinks czarish majesty as well as soltikof privately though there are difficulties as to dantzig and in fine except colberg over again there can be nothing attempted of sieging thereabouts a siege of colberg however there is actually to be second siegeif perhaps it will prove luckier than the first was two years since naval armament swedishrussian specific land armament wholly russian are to do this second siege at a favorable time except by wishes soltikof will not be concerned in it nor it is to be hoped shall wein such pressure of haste as is probably ahead for us  silesia would be the place for sieges say the vienna people always and imperial majesty is very urgent and tries all methodseloquence flatteries bribesto bring petersburg to that view which is at last adopted heartily by czarish majesty ever ready for revenge on friedrich the more fatal and the more direct the better heartily by her not so heartily by soltikof and her army people who know the austrian habits and privately decide on not picking chestnuts from the fire while the other partys paws keep idle and only his jaws are ready  of smallwar there is nothing or little to be said indeed there occurs almost none roving cossackparties under one tottleben whom we shall hear of otherwise infest pommern bickering with the prussian posts there not ravaging as formerly tottleben being a civilized kind of man one of these called at the castle of schwedt one day found prince eugen of wurtemberg there nearly recovered of his kunersdorf wounds who is a soninlaw of the house married to a daughter of schwedtancestor of the now russian czars too had anybody then known it him these cossacks carried off with them a march or two then taking his bond for a certain ransom let him go bond and bondholder being soon after captured by the prussians eugen paid no ransom so that to us his adventure is without moment though it then made some noise among the gazetteers  two other little passages and only two we will mention which have in themselves a kind of memorability first that of general czetteritz and the manuscript he lost of posts across the elbe i find none mentionable here and believe there is none except only czetteritzs who stands at cosdorf well up towards torgau country as sentry over torgau and the towns there on czetteritz there was in february an attempt made by the active general beck whom daun had detached for that object extremely successful according to the austrian gazetteers but in reality amounting to as good as nothingsurprisal of czetteritzs first vedette in the dawn of a misty february morning february 21st 1760 nonsurprisal of his second which did give fire and alarm whereupon debate and czetteritz springing into his saddle retreat of his people to rearward with loss of 7 officers and 200 prisonersbut ending in readvance with fresh force a few hours after seyfarth ii 655in repulse of beck in recovery of cosdorf and a general state of asyouwere in that part a sputter of postwar not now worth mentioning at allexcept only for one small circumstance that in the careering and swift ordering such as there was on the rearguard especially majorgeneral czetteritzs horse happened to fall whereby not only was the general taken prisoner but his quarters got plundered and in his luggagewhat is the notable circumstancethere was found a small manuscript militairische instrukzion fur die generale such as every prussian general has and is bound to keep religiously secretstands now in oeuvres de frederic xxviii 3 et seq was finished the revisal of it was by the king 2d april 1748 see preuss i 478480 and oeuvres de frederic xxviii preface for endless

napier by his brother london 1857 iii 365 and elsewhereone of the best judges in the world expressing his joy and admiration on discovery of friedrich discovery if you read well which amounts to these instructions and no more  next about a month after we have something to report of loudon from silesia or rather of the enemies he meets there for it is not a victorious thing but it means a starting of the campaign by an austrian invasion of silesia long before sieging time while all these montalembertsoltikof pleadings and counterpleadings hang dubious at petersburg and loudons silesian army is still only in a nascent or theoretic state and only loudon himself is in a practical one  friedrich has always fouquet at landshut in charge of the silesian frontier whose outposts under goltz as head of these stretch by neisse far eastward through the hills to utmost mahren fouquets own headquarter being generally landshut the main gate of the country fouquet long since rooted himself rather firmly into that important post has a beautiful ring of fortified hills around landshut battery crossing battery girdling it with sure destruction under an expert fouquetbut would require 30000 men to keep it instead of 13000 which is fouquets allotment upon whom loudon is fully intending a stroke this year fouquet as we know has strenuously managed to keep ward there for a twelvemonth past in spite often enough of new violent invadings and attemptings violent miscellaneous but intermittent by the devilles and othersand always under many difficulties of his own and vicissitudes in his employment a fouquet coming and going waxing and waning according to the kings necessities and to the intermittency or constancy of pressures on landshut under loudon this year fouquet will have harder times than everin the end too hard but will resist judge how by the following small sample  besides fouquet and his 13000 says my note the silesian garrisons are all vigilant are or ought to be and there are far eastward of him for guarding of the jagerndorftroppau border some 4 or 6000 scattered about under lieutenantgeneral goltz in various hill poststhe chief post of which goltzs own is the little town of neustadt northward of jagerndorf where we have billeted in the old silesian wars goltzs neustadt is the chief and leobschutz southwestward of it under general le grand once the major grant of kolin battle if readers remember him your majesty and i cannot take the battery ourselves is probably the second in importance loudon cantoned along the moravian side of the border perceives that he can assemble 32000 foot and horse that the prussians are 13000 plus 6000 that silesia can be invaded with advantage were the weather come and that in any kind of weather goltz and his straggle of posts might be swept into the interior perhaps picked up and pocketed altogether if loudon were sharp enough swept into the interior goltz was by no means pocketed altogether as he ought to have been  march 13th 1760 loudon orders general muster hereabouts for the 15th everybody to have two days bread and forage and warns goltz as bound in honor excellenz tomorrow is march 14th tomorrow our pleasant time of truce is outthe more the pity for both of us yea my esteemed neighbor excellenz answers goltz with the proper compliments but judges that his esteemed neighbor is intending mischief almost immediately goltz instantly sends orders to all his posts you herr general grant you at leobschutz and all the rest of you make your packages march without delay rendezvous at steinau and upper glogau far different from greatglogau neisseward swift and would have himself gone on the 14th but could nothis poor little bakery not being here nor wagons for his baggages quite to be collected in a momentand it was saturday 15th 5 am that goltz appointed himself to march  the last time we saw general goltz was on the green of bautzen above two years agowhen he delivered that hard message to the kings brother and his party you deserve to be tried by courtmartial and have your heads cut off he was of that sad zittau business of the late prince of prussiasgoltz winterfeld ziethen schmettau and others winterfeld and the prince are both dead schmettau is fallen into disaster goltz is still in good esteem with the king a stalwart swift flinty kind of man to judge by the portraits of him considerable obstinacy of a tacitly intelligent kind in that steady eye in that droop of the eyebrows towards the strong cheekbones plenty of sleeping fire in lieutenantgeneral goltz  his principal force on this occasion is one infantry regiment regiment manteuffelreaders perhaps recollect that stout pommern regiment manteuffel of foot and the little dialogue it had with the king himself on the eve of leuthen goodnight then fritz tomorrow all dead or else the enemy beaten their conduct i have heard was very shining at leuthen where everybody shone and since then they have been plunging about through the deathelement in their old rugged wayand reemerge here into definite view again under lieutenantgeneral goltz issuing from the north end of neustadt in the dim dawn of a cold spring morning march 15th 5 am weather latterly very wet as i learn they intend neisseway with their considerable stock of baggagewagons a company of dragoons is to help in escorting party perhaps about 2000 in all goltz will have his difficulties this day and has calculated on them and indeed at the first issuing here they already are  loudon with about 5000 horsefour regiments drawn up here and by and by with a fifth happily not with the grenadiers as he had calculated who are detained by broken bridges waters all in flood from the rainis waiting for him at the very environs of neustadt loudon by a trumpet politely invites him to surrender being so outnumbered goltz politely thanking disregards it and marches on loudon escorting in an ominous way till at buchelsdorf the fifth regiment best in the austrian service is seen drawn out across the highway plainly intimating no thoroughfare to goltz and pommern loudon sends a second trumpet surrender prisoners honorablest terms keep all your baggage refuse and you are cut down every man you shall yourself hear the answer said goltz goltz leads this second trumpet to the front and in pommern dialect makes known what general loudons proposal is the pommerners answer as one man a no of such emphasis as i have never heard in terms which are intensely vernacular it seems and which do at this day astonish the foreign mind we will for him something wir wollen ihm was but the powers of translation and even of typography fail and feeble paraphrase must give it we will for him something ineffable concoct of a surprisingly contrary kind wir wollen ihm was with ineffable dissyllabic verb governing it growled one indignant pommerner and it ran like filefire along the ranks says archenholtz everybody growling it and bellowing it in fierce bass chorus as the indubitable vote of pommern in those circumstances  loudons trumpet withdrew pommern formed square round its baggage loudons 5000 came thundering in fit to break adamant but met such a storm of bullets from pommern they stopped about ten paces short in considerable amazement and wheeled back tried it again still more amazement the like a third time every time in vain after which pommern took the road again with vanguard rearguard and had peace for certain milesloudon gloomily following for a new chance how many times loudon tried again and ever again at good places i forgetsay six times in all between siebenhufen and steinau in a dirty defile the jewel of the road for loudon who tried his very best there one of our wagons broke down the few to rear of it eighteen wagons and some country carts had to be left standing nothing more of pommern was left there or anywhere near steinau there loudon gave it up as desperate and went his way his loss they say was 300 killed 500 wounded pommerns was 35 killed and above 100 left wounded or prisoners one of the stiffest days works i have known some twelve miles of march in every two an attack pommern has really concocted something surprising and kept its promise to loudon thou knowest what the pommerners can do said they once to their own king an obstinate strongboned heavybrowed people not so
