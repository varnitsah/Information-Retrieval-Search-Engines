suffolk     chapter i  three editors   let the reader be introduced to lady carbury upon whose character and doings much will depend of whatever interest these pages may have as she sits at her writingtable in her own room in her own house in welbeck street lady carbury spent many hours at her desk and wrote many letters wrote also very much beside letters she spoke of herself in these days as a woman devoted to literature always spelling the word with a big l something of the nature of her devotion may be learned by the perusal of three letters which on this morning she had written with a quickly running hand lady carbury was rapid in everything and in nothing more rapid than in the writing of letters here is letter no 1      thursday welbeck street     dear friend     i have taken care that you shall have the early sheets of my two    new volumes tomorrow or saturday at latest so that you may if    so minded give a poor struggler like myself a lift in your next    weeks paper do give a poor struggler a lift you and i have so    much in common and i have ventured to flatter myself that we are    really friends i do not flatter you when i say that not only    would aid from you help me more than from any other quarter but    also that praise from you would gratify my vanity more than any    other praise i almost think you will like my criminal queens    the sketch of semiramis is at any rate spirited though i had to    twist it about a little to bring her in guilty cleopatra of    course i have taken from shakespeare what a wench she was i    could not quite make julia a queen but it was impossible to pass    over so piquant a character you will recognise in the two or    three ladies of the empire how faithfully i have studied my    gibbon poor dear old belisarius i have done the best i could    with joanna but i could not bring myself to care for her in our    days she would simply have gone to broadmore i hope you will not    think that i have been too strong in my delineations of henry viii    and his sinful but unfortunate howard i dont care a bit about    anne boleyne i am afraid that i have been tempted into too great    length about the italian catherine but in truth she has been my    favourite what a woman what a devil pity that a second dante    could not have constructed for her a special hell how one traces    the effect of her training in the life of our scotch mary i trust    you will go with me in my view as to the queen of scots guilty    guilty always adultery murder treason and all the rest of it    but recommended to mercy because she was royal a queen bred born    and married and with such other queens around her how could she    have escaped to be guilty marie antoinette i have not quite    acquitted it would be uninteresting perhaps untrue i have    accused her lovingly and have kissed when i scourged i trust the    british public will not be angry because i do not whitewash    caroline especially as i go along with them altogether in abusing    her husband     but i must not take up your time by sending you another book    though it gratifies me to think that i am writing what none but    yourself will read do it yourself like a dear man and as you    are great be merciful or rather as you are a friend be loving     yours gratefully and faithfully     matilda carbury     after all how few women there are who can raise themselves above    the quagmire of what we call love and make themselves anything    but playthings for men of almost all these royal and luxurious    sinners it was the chief sin that in some phase of their lives    they consented to be playthings without being wives i have    striven so hard to be proper but when girls read everything why    should not an old woman write anything   this letter was addressed to nicholas broune esq the editor of the morning breakfast table a daily newspaper of high character and as it was the longest so was it considered to be the most important of the three mr broune was a man powerful in his professionand he was fond of ladies lady carbury in her letter had called herself an old woman but she was satisfied to do so by a conviction that no one else regarded her in that light her age shall be no secret to the reader though to her most intimate friends even to mr broune it had never been divulged she was fortythree but carried her years so well and had received such gifts from nature that it was impossible to deny that she was still a beautiful woman and she used her beauty not only to increase her influenceas is natural to women who are wellfavouredbut also with a wellconsidered calculation that she could obtain material assistance in the procuring of bread and cheese which was very necessary to her by a prudent adaptation to her purposes of the good things with which providence had endowed her she did not fall in love she did not wilfully flirt she did not commit herself but she smiled and whispered and made confidences and looked out of her own eyes into mens eyes as though there might be some mysterious bond between her and themif only mysterious circumstances would permit it but the end of all was to induce some one to do something which would cause a publisher to give her good payment for indifferent writing or an editor to be lenient when upon the merits of the case he should have been severe among all her literary friends mr broune was the one in whom she most trusted and mr broune was fond of handsome women it may be as well to give a short record of a scene which had taken place between lady carbury and her friend about a month before the writing of this letter which has been produced she had wanted him to take a series of papers for the morning breakfast table and to have them paid for at rate no 1 whereas she suspected that he was rather doubtful as to their merit and knew that without special favour she could not hope for remuneration above rate no 2 or possibly even no 3 so she had looked into his eyes and had left her soft plump hand for a moment in his a man in such circumstances is so often awkward not knowing with any accuracy when to do one thing and when another mr broune in a moment of enthusiasm had put his arm round lady carburys waist and had kissed her to say that lady carbury was angry as most women would be angry if so treated would be to give an unjust idea of her character it was a little accident which really carried with it no injury unless it should be the injury of leading to a rupture between herself and a valuable ally no feeling of delicacy was shocked what did it matter no unpardonable insult had been offered no harm had been done if only the dear susceptible old donkey could be made at once to understand that that wasnt the way to go on  without a flutter and without a blush she escaped from his arm and then made him an excellent little speech mr broune how foolish how wrong how mistaken is it not so surely you do not wish to put an end to the friendship between us  put an end to our friendship lady carbury oh certainly not that  then why risk it by such an act think of my son and of my daughter both grown up think of the past troubles of my lifeso much suffered and so little deserved no one knows them so well as you do think of my name that has been so often slandered but never disgraced say that you are sorry and it shall be forgotten  when a man has kissed a woman it goes against the grain with him to say the very next moment that he is sorry for what he has done it is as much as to declare that the kiss had not answered his expectation mr broune could not do this and perhaps lady carbury did not quite expect it you know that for world i would not offend you he said this sufficed lady carbury again looked into his eyes and a promise was given that the articles should be printedand with generous remuneration  when the interview was over lady carbury regarded it as having been quite successful of course when struggles have to be made and hard work done there will be little accidents the lady who uses a street cab must encounter mud and dust which her richer neighbour who has a private carriage will escape she would have preferred not to have been kissedbut what did it matter with mr broune the affair was more serious confound them all he said to himself as he left the house no amount of experience enables a man to know them as he went away he almost thought that lady carbury had intended him to kiss her again and he was almost angry with himself in that he had not done so he had seen her three or four times since but had not repeated the offence  we will now go on to the other letters both of which were addressed to the editors of other newspapers the second was written to mr booker of the literary chronicle mr booker was a hardworking professor of literature by no means without talent by no means without influence and by no means without a conscience but from the nature of the struggles in which he had been engaged by compromises which had gradually been driven upon him by the encroachment of brother authors on the one side and by the demands on the other of employers who looked only to their profits he had fallen into a routine of work in which it was very difficult to be scrupulous and almost impossible to maintain the delicacies of a literary conscience he was now a baldheaded old man of sixty with a large family of daughters one of whom was a widow dependent on him with two little children he had five hundred a year for editing the literary chronicle which through his energy had become a valuable property he wrote for magazines and brought out some book of his own almost annually he kept his head above water and was regarded by those who knew about him but did not know him as a successful man he always kept up his spirits and was able in literary circles to show that he could hold his own but he was driven by the stress of circumstances to take such good things as came in his way and could hardly afford to be independent it must be confessed that literary scruple had long departed from his mind letter no 2 was as follows      welbeck street 25th february 187     dear mr booker     i have told mr leadham mr leadham was senior partner in the    enterprising firm of publishers known as messrs leadham and    loiter to send you an early copy of my criminal queens i have    already settled with my friend mr broune that i am to do your new    tale of a tub in the breakfast table indeed i am about it    now and am taking great pains with it if there is anything you    wish to have specially said as to your view of the protestantism    of the time let me know i should like you to say a word as to    the accuracy of my historical details which i know you can safely    do dont put it off as the sale does so much depend on early    notices i am only getting a royalty which does not commence till    the first four hundred are sold     yours sincerely     matilda carbury     alfred booker esq     literary chronicle office strand   there was nothing in this which shocked mr booker he laughed inwardly with a pleasantly reticent chuckle as he thought of lady carbury dealing with his views of protestantismas he thought also of the numerous historical errors into which that clever lady must inevitably fall in writing about matters of which he believed her to know nothing but he was quite alive to the fact that a favourable notice in the breakfast table of his very thoughtful work called the new tale of a tub would serve him even though written by the hand of a female literary charlatan and he would have no compunction as to repaying the service by fulsome praise in the literary chronicle he would not probably say that the book was accurate but he would be able to declare that it was delightful reading that the feminine characteristics of the queens had been touched with a masterly hand and that the work was one which would certainly make its way into all drawingrooms he was an adept at this sort of work and knew well how to review such a book as lady carburys criminal queens without bestowing much trouble on the reading he could almost do it without cutting the book so that its value for purposes of after sale might not be injured and yet mr booker was an honest man and had set his face persistently against many literary malpractices stretchedout type insufficient lines and the french habit of meandering with a few words over an entire page had been rebuked by him with conscientious strength he was supposed to be rather an aristides among reviewers but circumstanced as he was he could not oppose himself altogether to the usages of the time bad of course it is bad he said to a young friend who was working with him on his periodical who doubts that how many very bad things are there that we do but if we were to attempt to reform all our bad ways at once we should never do any good thing i am not strong enough to put the world straight and i doubt if you are such was mr booker  then there was letter no 3 to mr ferdinand alf mr alf managed and as it was supposed chiefly owned the evening pulpit which during the last two years had become quite a property as men connected with the press were in the habit of saying the evening pulpit was supposed to give daily to its readers all that had been said and done up to two oclock in the day by all the leading people in the metropolis and to prophesy with wonderful accuracy what would be the sayings and doings of the twelve following hours this was effected with an air of wonderful omniscience and not unfrequently with an ignorance hardly surpassed by its arrogance but the writing was clever the facts if not true were well invented the arguments if not logical were seductive the presiding spirit of the paper had the gift at any rate of knowing what the people for whom he catered would like to read and how to get his subjects handled so that the reading should be pleasant mr bookers literary chronicle did not presume to entertain any special political opinions the breakfast table was decidedly liberal the evening pulpit was much given to politics but held strictly to the motto which it had assumed    nullius addictus jurare in verba magistri  and consequently had at all times the invaluable privilege of abusing what was being done whether by one side or by the other a newspaper that wishes to make its fortune should never waste its columns and weary its readers by praising anything eulogy is invariably dulla fact that mr alf had discovered and had utilized  mr alf had moreover discovered another fact abuse from those who occasionally praise is considered to be personally offensive and they who give personal offence will sometimes make the world too hot to hold them but censure from those who are always finding fault is regarded so much as a matter of course that it ceases to be objectionable the caricaturist who draws only caricatures is held to be justifiable let him take what liberties he may with a mans face and person it is his trade and his business calls upon him to vilify all that he touches but were an artist to publish a series of portraits in which two out of a dozen were made to be hideous he would certainly make two enemies if not more mr alf never made enemies for he praised no one and as far as the expression of his newspaper went was satisfied with nothing  personally mr alf was a remarkable man no one knew whence he came or what he had been he was supposed to have been born a german jew and certain ladies said that they could distinguish in his tongue the slightest possible foreign accent nevertheless it was conceded to him that he knew england as only an englishman can know it during the last year or two he had come up as the phrase goes and had come up very thoroughly he had been blackballed at three or four clubs but had effected an entrance at two or three others and had learned a manner of speaking of those which had rejected him calculated to leave on the minds of hearers a conviction that the societies in question were antiquated imbecile and moribund he was never weary of implying that not to know mr alf not to be on good terms with mr alf not to understand that let mr alf have been born where he might and how he might he was always to be recognized as a desirable acquaintance was to be altogether out in the dark and that which he so constantly asserted or implied men and women around him began at last to believeand mr alf became an acknowledged something in the different worlds of politics letters and fashion  he was a goodlooking man about forty years old but carrying himself as though he was much younger spare below the middle height with dark brown hair which would have shown a tinge of grey but for the dyers art with wellcut features with a smile constantly on his mouth the pleasantness of which was always belied by the sharp severity of his eyes he dressed with the utmost simplicity but also with the utmost care he was unmarried had a small house of his own close to berkeley square at which he gave remarkable dinner parties kept four or five hunters in northamptonshire and was reputed to earn £6000 a year out of the evening pulpit and to spend about half of that income he also was intimate after his fashion with lady carbury whose diligence in making and fostering useful friendships had been unwearied her letter to mr alf was as follows      dear mr alf     do tell me who wrote the review on fitzgerald barkers last poem    only i know you wont i remember nothing done so well i should    think the poor wretch will hardly hold his head up again before    the autumn but it was fully deserved i have no patience with the    pretensions of wouldbe poets who contrive by toadying and    underground influences to get their volumes placed on every    drawingroom table i know no one to whom the world has been so    goodnatured in this way as to fitzgerald barker but i have heard    of no one who has extended the good nature to the length of    reading his poetry     is it not singular how some men continue to obtain the reputation    of popular authorship without adding a word to the literature of    their country worthy of note it is accomplished by unflagging    assiduity in the system of puffing to puff and to get ones self    puffed have become different branches of a new profession alas    me i wish i might find a class open in which lessons could be    taken by such a poor tyro as myself much as i hate the thing from    my very soul and much as i admire the consistency with which the    pulpit has opposed it i myself am so much in want of support    for my own little efforts and am struggling so hard honestly to    make for myself a remunerative career that i think were the    opportunity offered to me i should pocket my honour lay aside    the high feeling which tells me that praise should be bought    neither by money nor friendship and descend among the low things    in order that i might one day have the pride of feeling that i had    succeeded by my own work in providing for the needs of my    children     but i have not as yet commenced the descent downwards and    therefore i am still bold enough to tell you that i shall look    not with concern but with a deep interest to anything which may    appear in the pulpit respecting my criminal queens i venture    to think that the bookthough i wrote it myselfhas an    importance of its own which will secure for it some notice that    my inaccuracy will be laid bare and presumption scourged i do not    in the least doubt but i think your reviewer will be able to    certify that the sketches are lifelike and the portraits well    considered you will not hear me told at any rate that i had    better sit at home and darn my stockings as you said the other    day of that poor unfortunate mrs effington stubbs     i have not seen you for the last three weeks i have a few friends    every tuesday eveningpray come next week or the week following    and pray believe that no amount of editorial or critical severity    shall make me receive you otherwise than with a smile     most sincerely yours     matilda carbury   lady carbury having finished her third letter threw herself back in her chair and for a moment or two closed her eyes as though about to rest but she soon remembered that the activity of her life did not admit of such rest she therefore seized her pen and began scribbling further notes     chapter ii  the carbury family   something of herself and condition lady carbury has told the reader in the letters given in the former chapter but more must be added she has declared she had been cruelly slandered but she has also shown that she was not a woman whose words about herself could be taken with much confidence if the reader does not understand so much from her letters to the three editors they have been written in vain she has been made to say that her object in work was to provide for the need of her children and that with that noble purpose before her she was struggling to make for herself a career in literature detestably false as had been her letters to the editors absolutely and abominably foul as was the entire system by which she was endeavouring to achieve success far away from honour and honesty as she had been carried by her ready subserviency to the dirty things among which she had lately fallen nevertheless her statements about herself were substantially true she had been illtreated she had been slandered she was true to her childrenespecially devoted to one of themand was ready to work her nails off if by doing so she could advance their interests  she was the widow of one sir patrick carbury who many years since had done great things as a soldier in india and had been thereupon created a baronet he had married a young wife late in life and having found out when too late that he had made a mistake had occasionally spoilt his darling and occasionally illused her in doing each he had done it abundantly among lady carburys faults had never been that of even incipientnot even of sentimentalinfidelity to her husband when as a lovely and penniless girl of eighteen she had consented to marry a man of fortyfour who had the spending of a large income she had made up her mind to abandon all hope of that sort of love which poets describe and which young people generally desire to experience sir patrick at the time of his marriage was redfaced stout bald very choleric generous in money suspicious in temper and intelligent he knew how to govern men he could read and understand a book there was nothing mean about him he had his attractive qualities he was a man who might be lovedbut he was hardly a man for love the young lady carbury had understood her position and had determined to do her duty she had resolved before she went to the altar that she would never allow herself to flirt and she had never flirted for fifteen years things had gone tolerably well with herby which it is intended that the reader should understand that they had so gone that she had been able to tolerate them they had been home in england for three or four years and then sir patrick had returned with some new and higher appointment for fifteen years though he had been passionate imperious and often cruel he had never been jealous a boy and a girl had been born to them to whom both father and mother had been over indulgentbut the mother according to her lights had endeavoured to do her duty by them but from the commencement of her life she had been educated in deceit and her married life had seemed to make the practice of deceit necessary to her her mother had run away from her father and she had been tossed to and fro between this and that protector sometimes being in danger of wanting any one to care for her till she had been made sharp incredulous and untrustworthy by the difficulties of her position but she was clever and had picked up an education and good manners amidst the difficulties of her childhoodand had been beautiful to look at  to marry and have the command of money to do her duty correctly to live in a big house and be respected had been her ambitionand during the first fifteen years of her married life she was successful amidst great difficulties she would smile within five minutes of violent illusage her husband would even strike herand the first effort of her mind would be given to conceal the fact from all the world in latter years he drank too much and she struggled hard first to prevent the evil and then to prevent and to hide the ill effects of the evil but in doing all this she schemed and lied and lived a life of manoeuvres then at last when she felt that she was no longer quite a young woman she allowed herself to attempt to form friendships for herself and among her friends was one of the other sex if fidelity in a wife be compatible with such friendship if the married state does not exact from a woman the necessity of debarring herself from all friendly intercourse with any man except her lord lady carbury was not faithless but sir carbury became jealous spoke words which even she could not endure did things which drove even her beyond the calculations of her prudenceand she left him but even this she did in so guarded a way that as to every step she took she could prove her innocence her life at that period is of little moment to our story except that it is essential that the reader should know in what she had been slandered for a month or two all hard words had been said against her by her husbands friends and even by sir patrick himself but gradually the truth was known and after a years separation they came again together and she remained the mistress of his house till he died she brought him home to england but during the short period left to him of life in his old country he had been a wornout dying invalid but the scandal of her great misfortune had followed her and some people were never tired of reminding others that in the course of her married life lady carbury had run away from her husband and had been taken back again by the kindhearted old gentleman  sir patrick had left behind him a moderate fortune though by no means great wealth to his son who was now sir felix carbury he had left £1000 a year and to his widow as much with a provision that after her death the latter sum should be divided between his son and daughter it therefore came to pass that the young man who had already entered the army when his father died and upon whom devolved no necessity of keeping a house and who in fact not unfrequently lived in his mothers house had an income equal to that with which his mother and sister were obliged to maintain a roof over their head now lady carbury when she was released from her thraldom at the age of forty had no idea at all of passing her future life amidst the ordinary penances of widowhood she had hitherto endeavoured to do her duty knowing that in accepting her position she was bound to take the good and the bad together she had certainly encountered hitherto much that was bad to be scolded watched beaten and sworn at by a choleric old man till she was at last driven out of her house by the violence of his illusage to be taken back as a favour with the assurance that her name would for the remainder of her life be unjustly tarnished to have her flight constantly thrown in her face and then at last to become for a year or two the nurse of a dying debauchee was a high price to pay for such good things as she had hitherto enjoyed now at length had come to her a period of relaxation her reward her freedom her chance of happiness she thought much about herself and resolved on one or two things the time for love had gone by and she would have nothing to do with it nor would she marry again for convenience but she would have friendsreal friends friends who could help herand whom possibly she might help she would too make some career for herself so that life might not be without an interest to her she would live in london and would become somebody at any rate in some circle accident at first rather than choice had thrown her among literary people but that accident had during the last two years been supported and corroborated by the desire which had fallen upon her of earning money she had known from the first that economy would be necessary to hernot chiefly or perhaps not at all from a feeling that she and her daughter could not live comfortably together on a thousand a yearbut on behalf of her son she wanted no luxury but a house so placed that people might conceive of her that she lived in a proper part of the town of her daughters prudence she was as well convinced as of her own she could trust henrietta in everything but her son sir felix was not very trustworthy and yet sir felix was the darling of her heart  at the time of the writing of the three letters at which our story is supposed to begin she was driven very hard for money sir felix was then twentyfive had been in a fashionable regiment for four years had already sold out and to own the truth at once had altogether wasted the property which his father had left him so much the mother knewand knew therefore that with her limited income she must maintain not only herself and daughter but also the baronet she did not know however the amount of the baronets obligationsnor indeed did he or any one else a baronet holding a commission in the guards and known to have had a fortune left him by his father may go very far in getting into debt and sir felix had made full use of all his privileges his life had been in every way bad he had become a burden on his mother so heavyand on his sister alsothat their life had become one of unavoidable embarrassments but not for a moment had either of them ever quarrelled with him henrietta had been taught by the conduct of both father and mother that every vice might be forgiven in a man and in a son though every virtue was expected from a woman and especially from a daughter the lesson had come to her so early in life that she had learned it without the feeling of any grievance she lamented her brothers evil conduct as it affected him but she pardoned it altogether as it affected herself that all her interests in life should be made subservient to him was natural to her and when she found that her little comforts were discontinued and her moderate expenses curtailed because he having eaten up all that was his own was now eating up also all that was his mothers she never complained henrietta had been taught to think that men in that rank of life in which she had been born always did eat up everything  the mothers feeling was less nobleor perhaps it might better be said more open to censure the boy who had been beautiful as a star had ever been the cynosure of her eyes the one thing on which her heart had riveted itself even during the career of his folly she had hardly ventured to say a word to him with the purport of stopping him on his road to ruin in everything she had spoilt him as a boy and in everything she still spoilt him as a man she was almost proud of his vices and had taken delight in hearing of doings which if not vicious of themselves had been ruinous from their extravagance she had so indulged him that even in her own presence he was never ashamed of his own selfishness or apparently conscious of the injustice which he did to others  from all this it had come to pass that that dabbling in literature which had been commenced partly perhaps from a sense of pleasure in the work partly as a passport into society had been converted into hard work by which money if possible might be earned so that lady carbury when she wrote to her friends the editors of her struggles was speaking the truth tidings had reached her of this and the other mans success andcoming near to her stillof this and that other womans earnings in literature and it had seemed to her that within moderate limits she might give a wide field to her hopes why should she not add a thousand a year to her income so that felix might again live like a gentleman and marry that heiress who in lady carburys lookout into the future was destined to make all things straight who was so handsome as her son who could make himself more agreeable who had more of that audacity which is the chief thing necessary to the winning of heiresses  and then he could make his wife lady carbury if only enough money might be earned to tide over the present evil day all might be well  the one most essential obstacle to the chance of success in all this was probably lady carburys conviction that her end was to be obtained not by producing good books but by inducing certain people to say that her books were good she did work hard at what she wrotehard enough at any rate to cover her pages quickly and was by nature a clever woman she could write after a glib commonplace sprightly fashion and had already acquired the knack of spreading all she knew very thin so that it might cover a vast surface she had no ambition to write a good book but was painfully anxious to write a book that the critics should say was good had mr broune in his closet told her that her book was absolutely trash but had undertaken at the same time to have it violently praised in the breakfast table it may be doubted whether the critics own opinion would have even wounded her vanity the woman was false from head to foot but there was much of good in her false though she was  whether sir felix her son had become what he was solely by bad training or whether he had been born bad who shall say it is hardly possible that he should not have been better had he been taken away as an infant and subjected to moral training by moral teachers and yet again it is hardly possible that any training or want of training should have produced a heart so utterly incapable of feeling for others as was his he could not even feel his own misfortunes unless they touched the outward comforts of the moment it seemed that he lacked sufficient imagination to realise future misery though the futurity to be considered was divided from the present but by a single month a single weekbut by a single night he liked to be kindly treated to be praised and petted to be well fed and caressed and they who so treated him were his chosen friends he had in this the instincts of a horse not approaching the higher sympathies of a dog but it cannot be said of him that he had ever loved any one to the extent of denying himself a moments gratification on that loved ones behalf his heart was a stone but he was beautiful to lock at readywitted and intelligent he was very dark with that soft olive complexion which so generally gives to young men an appearance of aristocratic breeding his hair which was never allowed to become long was nearly black and was soft and silky without that taint of grease which is so common with silkenheaded darlings his eyes were long brown in colour and were made beautiful by the perfect arch of the perfect eyebrow but perhaps the glory of the face was due more to the finished moulding and fine symmetry of the nose and mouth than to his other features on his short upper lip he had a moustache as well formed as his eyebrows but he wore no other beard the form of his chin too was perfect but it lacked that sweetness and softness of expression indicative of softness of heart which a dimple conveys he was about five feet nine in height and was as excellent in figure as in face it was admitted by men and clamorously asserted by women that no man had ever been more handsome than felix carbury and it was admitted also that he never showed consciousness of his beauty he had given himself airs on many scoreson the score of his money poor fool while it lasted on the score of his title on the score of his army standing till he lost it and especially on the score of superiority in fashionable intellect but he had been clever enough to dress himself always with simplicity and to avoid the appearance of thought about his outward man as yet the little world of his associates had hardly found out how callous were his affectionsor rather how devoid he was of affection his airs and his appearance joined with some cleverness had carried him through even the viciousness of his life in one matter he had marred his name and by a moments weakness had injured his character among his friends more than he had done by the folly of three years there had been a quarrel between him and a brother officer in which he had been the aggressor and when the moment came in which a mans heart should have produced manly conduct he had first threatened and had then shown the white feather that was now a year since and he had partly outlived the evilbut some men still remembered that felix carbury had been cowed and had cowered  it was now his business to marry an heiress he was well aware that it was so and was quite prepared to face his destiny but he lacked something in the art of making love he was beautiful had the manners of a gentleman could talk well lacked nothing of audacity and had no feeling of repugnance at declaring a passion which he did not feel but he knew so little of the passion that he could hardly make even a young girl believe that he felt it when he talked of love he not only thought that he was talking nonsense but showed that he thought so from this fault he had already failed with one young lady reputed to have £40000 who had refused him because as she naively said she knew he did not really care how can i show that i care more than by wishing to make you my wife he had asked i dont know that you can but all the same you dont care she said and so that young lady escaped the pitfall now there was another young lady to whom the reader shall be introduced in time whom sir felix was instigated to pursue with unremitting diligence her wealth was not defined as had been the £40000 of her predecessor but was known to be very much greater than that it was indeed generally supposed to be fathomless bottomless endless it was said that in regard to money for ordinary expenditure money for houses servants horses jewels and the like one sum was the same as another to the father of this young lady he had great concernsconcerns so great that the payment of ten or twenty thousand pounds upon any trifle was the same thing to himas to men who are comfortable in their circumstances it matters little whether they pay sixpence or ninepence for their mutton chops such a man may be ruined at any time but there was no doubt that to anyone marrying his daughter during the present season of his outrageous prosperity he could give a very large fortune indeed lady carbury who had known the rock on which her son had been once wrecked was very anxious that sir felix should at once make a proper use of the intimacy which he had effected in the house of this topping croesus of the day  and now there must be a few words said about henrietta carbury of course she was of infinitely less importance than her brother who was a baronet the head of that branch of the carburys and her mothers darling and therefore a few words should suffice she also was very lovely being like her brother but somewhat less dark and with features less absolutely regular but she had in her countenance a full measure of that sweetness of expression which seems to imply that consideration of self is subordinated to consideration for others this sweetness was altogether lacking to her brother and her face was a true index of her character again who shall say why the brother and sister had become so opposite to each other whether they would have been thus different had both been taken away as infants from their fathers and mothers training or whether the girls virtues were owing altogether to the lower place which she had held in her parents heart she at any rate had not been spoilt by a title by the command of money and by the temptations of too early acquaintance with the world at the present time she was barely twentyone years old and had not seen much of london society her mother did not frequent balls and during the last two years there had grown upon them a necessity for economy which was inimical to many gloves and costly dresses sir felix went out of course but hetta carbury spent most of her time at home with her mother in welbeck street occasionally the world saw her and when the world did see her the world declared that she was a charming girl the world was so far right  but for henrietta carbury the romance of life had already commenced in real earnest there was another branch of the carburys the head branch which was now represented by one roger carbury of carbury hall roger carbury was a gentleman of whom much will have to be said but here at this moment it need only be told that he was passionately in love with his cousin henrietta he was however nearly forty years old and there was one paul montague whom henrietta had seen     chapter iii  the beargarden   lady carburys house in welbeck street was a modest house enough with no pretensions to be a mansion hardly assuming even to be a residence but having some money in her hands when she first took it she had made it pretty and pleasant and was still proud to feel that in spite of the hardness of her position she had comfortable belongings around her when her literary friends came to see her on her tuesday evenings here she was now living with her son and daughter the back drawingroom was divided from the front by doors that were permanently closed and in this she carried on her great work here she wrote her books and contrived her system for the inveigling of editors and critics here she was rarely disturbed by her daughter and admitted no visitors except editors and critics but her son was controlled by no household laws and would break in upon her privacy without remorse she had hardly finished two galloping notes after completing her letter to mr ferdinand alf when felix entered the room with a cigar in his mouth and threw himself upon the sofa  my dear boy she said pray leave your tobacco below when you come in here  what affectation it is mother he said throwing however the halfsmoked cigar into the fireplace some women swear they like smoke others say they hate it like the devil it depends altogether on whether they wish to flatter or snub a fellow  you dont suppose that i wish to snub you  upon my word i dont know i wonder whether you can let me have twenty pounds  my dear felix  just so motherbut how about the twenty pounds  what is it for felix  wellto tell the truth to carry on the game for the nonce till something is settled a fellow cant live without some money in his pocket i do with as little as most fellows i pay for nothing that i can help i even get my hair cut on credit and as long as it was possible i had a brougham to save cabs  what is to be the end of it felix  i never could see the end of anything mother i never could nurse a horse when the hounds were going well in order to be in at the finish i never could pass a dish that i liked in favour of those that were to follow whats the use the young man did not say carpe diem but that was the philosophy which he intended to preach  have you been at the melmottes today it was now five oclock on a winter afternoon the hour at which ladies are drinking tea and idle men playing whist at the clubsat which young idle men are sometimes allowed to flirt and at which as lady carbury thought her son might have been paying his court to marie melmotte the great heiress  i have just come away  and what do you think of her  to tell the truth mother i have thought very little about her she is not pretty she is not plain she is not clever she is not stupid she is neither saint nor sinner  the more likely to make a good wife  perhaps so i am at any rate quite willing to believe that as wife she would be good enough for me  what does the mother say  the mother is a caution i cannot help speculating whether if i marry the daughter i shall ever find out where the mother came from dolly longestaffe says that somebody says that she was a bohemian jewess but i think shes too fat for that  what does it matter felix  not in the least  is she civil to you  yes civil enough  and the father  well he does not turn me out or anything of that sort of course there are halfadozen after her and i think the old fellow is bewildered among them all hes thinking more of getting dukes to dine with him than of his daughters lovers any fellow might pick her up who happened to hit her fancy  and why not you  why not mother i am doing my best and its no good flogging a willing horse can you let me have the money  oh felix i think you hardly know how poor we are you have still got your hunters down at the place  i have got two horses if you mean that and i havent paid a shilling for their keep since the season began look here mother this is a risky sort of game i grant but i am playing it by your advice if i can marry miss melmotte i suppose all will be right but i dont think the way to get her would be to throw up everything and let all the world know that i havent got a copper to do that kind of thing a man must live a little up to the mark ive brought my hunting down to a minimum but if i gave it up altogether there would be lots of fellows to tell them in grosvenor square why i had done so  there was an apparent truth in this argument which the poor woman was unable to answer before the interview was over the money demanded was forthcoming though at the time it could be but ill afforded and the youth went away apparently with a light heart hardly listening to his mothers entreaties that the affair with marie melmotte might if possible be brought to a speedy conclusion  felix when he left his mother went down to the only club to which he now belonged clubs are pleasant resorts in all respects but one they require ready money or even worse than that in respect to annual paymentsmoney in advance and the young baronet had been absolutely forced to restrict himself he as a matter of course out of those to which he had possessed the right of entrance chose the worst it was called the beargarden and had been lately opened with the express view of combining parsimony with profligacy clubs were ruined so said certain young parsimonious profligates by providing comforts for old fogies who paid little or nothing but their subscriptions and took out by their mere presence three times as much as they gave this club was not to be opened till three oclock in the afternoon before which hour the promoters of the beargarden thought it improbable that they and their fellows would want a club there were to be no morning papers taken no library no morningroom diningrooms billiardrooms and cardrooms would suffice for the beargarden everything was to be provided by a purveyor so that the club should be cheated only by one man everything was to be luxurious but the luxuries were to be achieved at first cost it had been a happy thought and the club was said to prosper herr vossner the purveyor was a jewel and so carried on affairs that there was no trouble about anything he would assist even in smoothing little difficulties as to the settling of card accounts and had behaved with the greatest tenderness to the drawers of cheques whose bankers had harshly declared them to have no effects herr vossner was a jewel and the beargarden was a success perhaps no young man about town enjoyed the beargarden more thoroughly than did sir felix carbury the club was in the close vicinity of other clubs in a small street turning out of st jamess street and piqued itself on its outward quietness and sobriety why pay for stonework for other people to look atwhy lay out money in marble pillars and cornices seeing that you can neither eat such things nor drink them nor gamble with them but the beargarden had the best winesor thought that it hadand the easiest chairs and two billiardtables than which nothing more perfect had ever been made to stand upon legs hither sir felix wended on that january afternoon as soon as he had his mothers cheque for £20 in his pocket  he found his special friend dolly longestaffe standing on the steps with a cigar in his mouth and gazing vacantly at the dull brick house opposite going to dine here dolly said sir felix  i suppose i shall because its such a lot of trouble to go anywhere else im engaged somewhere i know but im not up to getting home and dressing by george i dont know how fellows do that kind of thing i cant  going to hunt tomorrow  well yes but i dont suppose i shall i was going to hunt every day last week but my fellow never would get me up in time i cant tell why it is that things are done in such a beastly way why shouldnt fellows begin to hunt at two or three so that a fellow neednt get up in the middle of the night  because one cant ride by moonlight dolly  it isnt moonlight at three at any rate i cant get myself to euston square by nine i dont think that fellow of mine likes getting up himself he says he comes in and wakes me but i never remember it  how many horses have you got at leighton dolly  how many there were five but i think that fellow down there sold one but then i think he bought another i know he did something  who rides them  he does i suppose that is of course i ride them myself only i so seldom get down somebody told me that grasslough was riding two of them last week i dont think i ever told him he might i think he tipped that fellow of mine and i call that a low kind of thing to do id ask him only i know hed say that i had lent them perhaps i did when i was tight you know  you and grasslough were never pals  i dont like him a bit he gives himself airs because he is a lord and is devilish illnatured i dont know why he should want to ride my horses  to save his own  he isnt hard up why doesnt he have his own horses ill tell you what carbury ive made up my mind to one thing and by jove ill stick to it i never will lend a horse again to anybody if fellows want horses let them buy them  but some fellows havent got any money dolly  then they ought to go tick i dont think ive paid for any of mine ive bought this season there was somebody here yesterday  what here at the club  yes followed me here to say he wanted to be paid for something it was horses i think because of the fellows trousers  what did you say  me oh i didnt say anything  and how did it end  when hed done talking i offered him a cigar and while he was biting off the end went upstairs i suppose he went away when he was tired of waiting  ill tell you what dolly i wish youd let me ride two of yours for a couple of daysthat is of course if you dont want them yourself you aint tight now at any rate  no i aint tight said dolly with melancholy acquiescence  i mean that i wouldnt like to borrow your horses without your remembering all about it nobody knows as well as you do how awfully done up i am i shall pull through at last but its an awful squeeze in the meantime theres nobody id ask such a favour of except you  well you may have themthat is for two days i dont know whether that fellow of mine will believe you he wouldnt believe grasslough and told him so but grasslough took them out of the stables thats what somebody told me  you could write a line to your groom  oh my dear fellow that is such a bore i dont think i could do that my fellow will believe you because you and i have been pals i think ill have a little drop of curacoa before dinner come along and try it itll give us an appetite  it was then nearly seven oclock nine hours afterwards the same two men with two othersof whom young lord grasslough dolly longestaffes peculiar aversion was onewere just rising from a cardtable in one of the upstairs rooms of the club for it was understood that though the beargarden was not to be open before three oclock in the afternoon the accommodation denied during the day was to be given freely during the night no man could get a breakfast at the beargarden but suppers at three oclock in the morning were quite within the rule such a supper or rather succession of suppering there had been tonight various devils and broils and hot toasts having been brought up from time to time first for one and then for another but there had been no cessation of gambling since the cards had first been opened about ten oclock at four in the morning dolly longestaffe was certainly in a condition to lend his horses and to remember nothing about it he was quite affectionate with lord grasslough as he was also with his other companionsaffection being the normal state of his mind when in that condition he was by no means helplessly drunk and was perhaps hardly more silly than when he was sober but he was willing to play at any game whether he understood it or not and for any stakes when sir felix got up and said he would play no more dolly also got up apparently quite contented when lord grasslough with a dark scowl on his face expressed his opinion that it was not just the thing for men to break up like that when so much money had been lost dolly as willingly sat down again but dollys sitting down was not sufficient im going to hunt tomorrow said sir felixmeaning that dayand i shall play no more a man must go to bed at some time  i dont see it at all said lord grasslough its an understood thing that when a man has won as much as you have he should stay  stay how long said sir felix with an angry look thats nonsense there must be an end of everything and theres an end of this for me tonight  oh if you choose said his lordship  i do choose good night dolly well settle this next time we meet ive got it all entered  the night had been one very serious in its results to sir felix he had sat down to the cardtable with the proceeds of his mothers cheque a poor £20 and now he hadhe didnt at all know how much in his pockets he also had drunk but not so as to obscure his mind he knew that longestaffe owed him over £300 and he knew also that he had received more than that in ready money and cheques from lord grasslough and the other player dolly longestaffes money too would certainly be paid though dolly did complain of the importunity of his tradesmen as he walked up st jamess street looking for a cab he presumed himself to be worth over £700 when begging for a small sum from lady carbury he had said that he could not carry on the game without some ready money and had considered himself fortunate in fleecing his mother as he had done now he was in the possession of wealthof wealth that might at any rate be sufficient to aid him materially in the object he had in hand he never for a moment thought of paying his bills even the large sum of which he had become so unexpectedly possessed would not have gone far with him in such a quixotic object as that but he could now look bright and buy presents and be seen with money in his hands it is hard even to make love in these days without something in your purse  he found no cab but in his present frame of mind was indifferent to the trouble of walking home there was something so joyous in the feeling of the possession of all this money that it made the night air pleasant to him then of a sudden he remembered the low wail with which his mother had spoken of her poverty when he demanded assistance from her now he could give her back the £20 but it occurred to him sharply with an amount of carefulness quite new to him that it would be foolish to do so how soon might he want it again and moreover he could not repay the money without explaining to her how he had gotten it it would be preferable to say nothing about his money as he let himself into the house and went up to his room he resolved that he would not say anything about it  on that morning he was at the station at nine and hunted down in buckinghamshire riding two of dolly longestaffes horses for the use of which he paid dolly longestaffes fellow thirty shilling     chapter iv  madame melmottes ball   the next night but one after that of the gambling transaction at the beargarden a great ball was given in grosvenor square it was a ball on a scale so magnificent that it had been talked about ever since parliament met now about a fortnight since some people had expressed an opinion that such a ball as this was intended to be could not be given successfully in february others declared that the money which was to be spentan amount which would make this affair quite new in the annals of ballgivingwould give the thing such a character that it would certainly be successful and much more than money had been expended almost incredible efforts had been made to obtain the cooperation of great people and these efforts had at last been grandly successful the duchess of stevenage had come up from castle albury herself to be present at it and to bring her daughters though it has never been her graces wont to be in london at this inclement season no doubt the persuasion used with the duchess had been very strong her brother lord alfred grendall was known to be in great difficulties whichso people saidhad been considerably modified by opportune pecuniary assistance and then it was certain that one of the young grendalls lord alfreds second son had been appointed to some mercantile position for which he received a salary which his most intimate friends thought that he was hardly qualified to earn it was certainly a fact that he went to abchurch lane in the city four or five days a week and that he did not occupy his time in so unaccustomed a manner for nothing where the duchess of stevenage went all the world would go and it became known at the last moment that is to say only the day before the party that a prince of the blood royal was to be there how this had been achieved nobody quite understood but there were rumours that a certain ladys jewels had been rescued from the pawnbrokers everything was done on the same scale the prime minister had indeed declined to allow his name to appear on the list but one cabinet minister and two or three undersecretaries had agreed to come because it was felt that the giver of the ball might before long be the master of considerable parliamentary interest it was believed that he had an eye to politics and it is always wise to have great wealth on ones own side there had at one time been much solicitude about the ball many anxious thoughts had been given when great attempts fail the failure is disastrous and may be ruinous but this ball had now been put beyond the chance of failure  the giver of the ball was augustus melmotte esq the father of the girl whom sir felix carbury desired to marry and the husband of the lady who was said to have been a bohemian jewess it was thus that the gentleman chose to have himself designated though within the last two years he had arrived in london from paris and had at first been known as m melmotte but he had declared of himself that he had been born in england and that he was an englishman he admitted that his wife was a foreigneran admission that was necessary as she spoke very little english melmotte himself spoke his native language fluently but with an accent which betrayed at least a long expatriation miss melmottewho a very short time since had been known as mademoiselle mariespoke english well but as a foreigner in regard to her it was acknowledged that she had been born out of englandsome said in new york but madame melmotte who must have known had declared that the great event had taken place in paris  it was at any rate an established fact that mr melmotte had made his wealth in france he no doubt had had enormous dealings in other countries as to which stories were told which must surely have been exaggerated it was said that he had made a railway across russia that he provisioned the southern army in the american civil war that he had supplied austria with arms and had at one time bought up all the iron in england he could make or mar any company by buying or selling stock and could make money dear or cheap as he pleased all this was said of him in his praisebut it was also said that he was regarded in paris as the most gigantic swindler that had ever lived that he had made that city too hot to hold him that he had endeavoured to establish himself in vienna but had been warned away by the police and that he had at length found that british freedom would alone allow him to enjoy without persecution the fruits of his industry he was now established privately in grosvenor square and officially in abchurch lane and it was known to all the world that a royal prince a cabinet minister and the very cream of duchesses were going to his wifes ball all this had been done within twelve months  there was but one child in the family one heiress for all this wealth melmotte himself was a large man with bushy whiskers and rough thick hair with heavy eyebrows and a wonderful look of power about his mouth and chin this was so strong as to redeem his face from vulgarity but the countenance and appearance of the man were on the whole unpleasant and i may say untrustworthy he looked as though he were purseproud and a bully she was fat and fairunlike in colour to our traditional jewesses but she had the jewish nose and the jewish contraction of the eyes there was certainly very little in madame melmotte to recommend her unless it was a readiness to spend money on any object that might be suggested to her by her new acquaintances it sometimes seemed that she had a commission from her husband to give away presents to any who would accept them the world had received the man as augustus melmotte esq the world so addressed him on the very numerous letters which reached him and so inscribed him among the directors of three dozen companies to which he belonged but his wife was still madame melmotte the daughter had been allowed to take her rank with an english title she was now miss melmotte on all occasions  marie melmotte had been accurately described by felix carbury to his mother she was not beautiful she was not clever and she was not a saint but then neither was she plain nor stupid nor especially a sinner she was a little thing hardly over twenty years of age very unlike her father or mother having no trace of the jewess in her countenance who seemed to be overwhelmed by the sense of her own position with such people as the melmottes things go fast and it was very well known that miss melmotte had already had one lover who had been nearly accepted the affair however had gone off in this going off no one imputed to the young lady blame or even misfortune it was not supposed that she had either jilted or been jilted as in royal espousals interests of state regulate their expedience with an acknowledged absence with even a proclaimed impossibility of personal predilections so in this case was money allowed to have the same weight such a marriage would or would not be sanctioned in accordance with great pecuniary arrangements the young lord nidderdale the eldest son of the marquis of auld reekie had offered to take the girl and make her marchioness in the process of time for half a million down melmotte had not objected to the sumso it was saidbut had proposed to tie it up nidderdale had desired to have it free in his own grasp and would not move on any other terms melmotte had been anxious to secure the marquisvery anxious to secure the marchioness for at that time terms had not been made with the duchess but at last he had lost his temper and had asked his lordships lawyer whether it was likely that he would entrust such a sum of money to such a man you are willing to trust your only child to him said the lawyer melmotte scowled at the man for a few seconds from under his bushy eyebrows then told him that his answer had nothing in it and marched out of the room so that affair was over i doubt whether lord nidderdale had ever said a word of love to marie melmotteor whether the poor girl had expected it her destiny had no doubt been explained to her  others had tried and had broken down somewhat in the same fashion each had treated the girl as an encumbrance he was to undertakeat a very great price but as affairs prospered with the melmottes as princes and duchesses were obtained by other meanscostly no doubt but not so ruinously costlythe immediate disposition of marie became less necessary and melmotte reduced his offers the girl herself too began to have an opinion it was said that she had absolutely rejected lord grasslough whose father indeed was in a state of bankruptcy who had no income of his own who was ugly vicious illtempered and without any power of recommending himself to a girl she had had experience since lord nidderdale with a half laugh had told her that he might just as well take her for his wife and was now tempted from time to time to contemplate her own happiness and her own condition people around were beginning to say that if sir felix carbury managed his affairs well he might be the happy man  there was a considerable doubt whether marie was the daughter of that jewishlooking woman enquiries had been made but not successfully as to the date of the melmotte marriage there was an idea abroad that melmotte had got his first money with his wife and had gotten it not very long ago then other people said that marie was not his daughter at all altogether the mystery was rather pleasant as the money was certain of the certainty of the money in daily use there could be no doubt there was the house there was the furniture there were the carriages the horses the servants with the livery coats and powdered heads and the servants with the black coats and unpowdered heads there were the gems and the presents and all the nice things that money can buy there were two dinner parties every day one at two oclock called lunch and the other at eight the tradesmen had learned enough to be quite free of doubt and in the city mr melmottes name was worth any moneythough his character was perhaps worth but little  the large house on the south side of grosvenor square was all ablaze by ten oclock the broad verandah had been turned into a conservatory had been covered with boards contrived to look like trelliswork was heated with hot air and filled with exotics at some fabulous price a covered way had been made from the door down across the pathway to the road and the police had i fear been bribed to frighten foot passengers into a belief that they were bound to go round the house had been so arranged that it was impossible to know where you were when once in it the hall was a paradise the staircase was fairyland the lobbies were grottoes rich with ferns walls had been knocked away and arches had been constructed the leads behind had been supported and walled in and covered and carpeted the ball had possession of the ground floor and first floor and the house seemed to be endless its to cost sixty thousand pounds said the marchioness of auld reekie to her old friend the countess of midlothian the marchioness had come in spite of her sons misfortune when she heard that the duchess of stevenage was to be there and worse spent money never was wasted said the countess by all accounts it was as badly come by said the marchioness then the two old noblewomen one after the other made graciously flattering speeches to the muchworn bohemian jewess who was standing in fairyland to receive her guests almost fainting under the greatness of the occasion  the three saloons on the first or drawingroom floor had been prepared for dancing and here marie was stationed the duchess had however undertaken to see that somebody should set the dancing going and she had commissioned her nephew miles grendall the young gentleman who now frequented the city to give directions to the band and to make himself generally useful indeed there had sprung up a considerable intimacy between the grendall familythat is lord alfreds branch of the grendallsand the melmottes which was as it should be as each could give much and each receive much it was known that lord alfred had not a shilling but his brother was a duke and his sister was a duchess and for the last thirty years there had been one continual anxiety for poor dear alfred who had tumbled into an unfortunate marriage without a shilling had spent his own moderate patrimony had three sons and three daughters and had lived now for a very long time entirely on the unwilling contributions of his noble relatives melmotte could support the whole family in affluence without feeling the burdenand why should he not there had once been an idea that miles should attempt to win the heiress but it had soon been found expedient to abandon it miles had no title no position of his own and was hardly big enough for the place it was in all respects better that the waters of the fountain should be allowed to irrigate mildly the whole grendall familyand so miles went into the city  the ball was opened by a quadrille in which lord buntingford the eldest son of the duchess stood up with marie various arrangements had been made and this among them we may say that it had been a part of the bargain lord buntingford had objected mildly being a young man devoted to business fond of his own order rather shy and not given to dancing but he had allowed his mother to prevail of course they are vulgar the duchess had saidso much so as to be no longer distasteful because of the absurdity of the thing i dare say he hasnt been very honest when men make so much money i dont know how they can have been honest of course its done for a purpose its all very well saying that it isnt right but what are we to do about alfreds children miles is to have £500 ayear and then he is always about the house and between you and me they have got up those bills of alfreds and have said they can lie in their safe till it suits your uncle to pay them  they will lie there a long time said lord buntingford  of course they expect something in return do dance with the girl once lord buntingford disapproved mildly and did as his mother asked him  the affair went off very well there were three or four cardtables in one of the lower rooms and at one of them sat lord alfred grendall and mr melmotte with two or three other players cutting in and out at the end of each rubber playing whist was lord alfreds only accomplishment and almost the only occupation of his life he began it daily at his club at three oclock and continued playing till two in the morning with an interval of a couple of hours for his dinner this he did during ten months of the year and during the other two he frequented some wateringplace at which whist prevailed he did not gamble never playing for more than the club stakes and bets he gave to the matter his whole mind and must have excelled those who were generally opposed to him but so obdurate was fortune to lord alfred that he could not make money even of whist melmotte was very anxious to get into lord alfreds clubthe peripatetics it was pleasant to see the grace with which he lost his money and the sweet intimacy with which he called his lordship alfred lord alfred had a remnant of feeling left and would have liked to kick him though melmotte was by far the bigger man and was also the younger lord alfred would not have lacked the pluck to kick him lord alfred in spite of his habitual idleness and vapid uselessness had still left about him a dash of vigour and sometimes thought that he would kick melmotte and have done with it but there were his poor boys and those bills in melmottes safe and then melmotte lost his points so regularly and paid his bets with such absolute good humour come and have a glass of champagne alfred melmotte said as the two cut out together lord alfred liked champagne and followed his host but as he went he almost made up his mind that on some future day he would kick the man  late in the evening marie melmotte was waltzing with felix carbury and henrietta carbury was then standing by talking to one mr paul montague lady carbury was also there she was not well inclined either to balls or to such people as the melmottes nor was henrietta but felix had suggested that bearing in mind his prospects as to the heiress they had better accept the invitation which he would cause to have sent to them they did so and then paul montague also got a card not altogether to lady carburys satisfaction lady carbury was very gracious to madame melmotte for two minutes and then slid into a chair expecting nothing but misery for the evening she however was a woman who could do her duty and endure without complaint  it is the first great ball i ever was at in london said hetta carbury to paul montague  and how do you like it  not at all how should i like it i know nobody here i dont understand how it is that at these parties people do know each other or whether they all go dancing about without knowing  just that i suppose when they are used to it they get introduced backwards and forwards and then they can know each other as fast as they like if you would wish to dance why dont you dance with me  i have danced with youtwice already  is there any law against dancing three times  but i dont especially want to dance said henrietta i think ill go and console poor mamma who has got nobody to speak to her just at this moment however lady carbury was not in that wretched condition as an unexpected friend had come to her relief  sir felix and marie melmotte had been spinning round and round throughout a long waltz thoroughly enjoying the excitement of the music and the movement to give felix carbury what little praise might be his due it is necessary to say that he did not lack physical activity he would dance and ride and shoot eagerly with an animation that made him happy for the moment it was an affair not of thought or calculation but of physical organisation and marie melmotte had been thoroughly happy she loved dancing with all her heart if she could only dance in a manner pleasant to herself  she had been warned especially as to some menthat she should not dance with them she had been almost thrown into lord nidderdales arms and had been prepared to take him at her fathers bidding but she had never had the slightest pleasure in his society and had only not been wretched because she had not as yet recognised that she had an identity of her own in the disposition of which she herself should have a voice she certainly had never cared to dance with lord nidderdale lord grasslough she had absolutely hated though at first she had hardly dared to say so one or two others had been obnoxious to her in different ways but they had passed on or were passing on out of her way there was no one at the present moment whom she had been commanded by her father to accept should an offer be made but she did like dancing with sir felix carbury it was not only that the man was handsome but that he had a power of changing the expression of his countenance a play of face which belied altogether his real disposition he could seem to be hearty and true till the moment came in which he had really to expose his heartor to try to expose it then he failed knowing nothing about it but in the approaches to intimacy with a girl he could be very successful he had already nearly got beyond this with marie melmotte but marie was by no means quick in discovering his deficiencies to her he had seemed like a god if she might be allowed to be wooed by sir felix carbury and to give herself to him she thought that she would be contented  how well you dance said sir felix as soon as he had breath for speaking  do i she spoke with a slightly foreign accent which gave a little prettiness to her speech i was never told so but nobody ever told me anything about myself  i should like to tell you everything about yourself from the beginning to the end  ahbut you dont know  i would find out i think i could make some good guesses ill tell you what you would like best in all the world  what is that  somebody that liked you best in all the world  ahyes if one knew who  how can you know miss melmotte but by believing  that is not the way to know if a girl told me that she liked me better than any other girl i should not know it just because she said so i should have to find it out  and if a gentleman told you so  i shouldnt believe him a bit and i should not care to find out but i should like to have some girl for a friend whom i could love oh ten times better than myself  so should i  have you no particular friend  i mean a girl whom i could loveoh ten times better than myself  now you are laughing at me sir felix said miss melmotte  i wonder whether that will come to anything said paul montague to miss carbury they had come back into the drawingroom and had been watching the approaches to lovemaking which the baronet was opening  you mean felix and miss melmotte i hate to think of such things mr montague  it would be a magnificent chance for him  to marry a girl the daughter of vulgar people just because she will have a great deal of money he cant care for her reallybecause she is rich  but he wants money so dreadfully it seems to me that there is no other condition of things under which felix can face the world but by being the husband of an heiress  what a dreadful thing to say  but isnt it true he has beggared himself  oh mr montague  and he will beggar you and your mother  i dont care about myself  others do though as he said this he did not look at her but spoke through his teeth as if he were angry both with himself and her  i did not think you would have spoken so harshly of felix  i dont speak harshly of him miss carbury i havent said that it was his own fault he seems to be one of those who have been born to spend money and as this girl will have plenty of money to spend i think it would be a good thing if he were to marry her if felix had £20000 a year everybody would think him the finest fellow in the world in saying this however mr paul montague showed himself unfit to gauge the opinion of the world whether sir felix be rich or poor the world evilhearted as it is will never think him a fine fellow  lady carbury had been seated for nearly half an hour in uncomplaining solitude under a bust when she was delighted by the appearance of mr ferdinand alf you here she said  why not melmotte and i are brother adventurers  i should have thought you would find so little here to amuse you  i have found you and in addition to that duchesses and their daughters without number they expect prince george  do they  and legge wilson from the india office is here already i spoke to him in some jewelled bower as i made my way here not five minutes since its quite a success dont you think it very nice lady carbury  i dont know whether you are joking or in earnest  i never joke i say it is very nice these people are spending thousands upon thousands to gratify you and me and others and all they want in return is a little countenance  do you mean to give it then  i am giving it them  ahbut the countenance of the evening pulpit do you mean to give them that  well it is not in our line exactly to give a catalogue of names and to record ladies dresses perhaps it may be better for our host himself that he should be kept out of the newspapers  are you going to be very severe upon poor me mr alf said the lady after a pause  we are never severe upon anybody lady carbury heres the prince what will they do with him now theyve caught him oh theyre going to make him dance with the heiress poor heiress  poor prince said lady carbury  not at all shes a nice little girl enough and hell have nothing to trouble him but how is she poor thing to talk to royal blood  poor thing indeed the prince was brought into the big room where marie was still being talked to by felix carbury and was at once made to understand that she was to stand up and dance with royalty the introduction was managed in a very businesslike manner miles grendall first came in and found the female victim the duchess followed with the male victim madame melmotte who had been on her legs till she was ready to sink waddled behind but was not allowed to take any part in the affair the band were playing a galop but that was stopped at once to the great confusion of the dancers in two minutes miles grendall had made up a set he stood up with his aunt the duchess as visàvis to marie and the prince till about the middle of the quadrille legge wilson was found and made to take his place lord buntingford had gone away but then there were still present two daughters of the duchess who were rapidly caught sir felix carbury being goodlooking and having a name was made to dance with one of them and lord grasslough with the other there were four other couples all made up of titled people as it was intended that this special dance should be chronicled if not in the evening pulpit in some less serious daily journal a paid reporter was present in the house ready to rush off with the list as soon as the dance should be a realized fact the prince himself did not quite understand why he was there but they who marshalled his life for him had so marshalled it for the present moment he himself probably knew nothing about the ladys diamonds which had been rescued or the considerable subscription to st georges hospital which had been extracted from mr melmotte as a makeweight poor marie felt as though the burden of the hour would be greater than she could bear and looked as though she would have fled had flight been possible but the trouble passed quickly and was not really severe the prince said a word or two between each figure and did not seem to expect a reply he made a few words go a long way and was well trained in the work of easing the burden of his own greatness for those who were for the moment inflicted with it when the dance was over he was allowed to escape after the ceremony of a single glass of champagne drunk in the presence of the hostess considerable skill was shown in keeping the presence of his royal guest a secret from the host himself till the prince was gone melmotte would have desired to pour out that glass of wine with his own hands to solace his tongue by royal highnesses and would probably have been troublesome and disagreeable miles grendall had understood all this and had managed the affair very well bless my soulhis royal highness come and gone exclaimed melmotte you and my father were so fast at your whist that it was impossible to get you away said miles melmotte was not a fool and understood it all understood not only that it had been thought better that he should not speak to the prince but also that it might be better that it should be so he could not have everything at once miles grendall was very useful to him and he would not quarrel with miles at any rate as yet  have another rubber alfred he said to miless father as the carriages were taking away the guests  lord alfred had taken sundry glasses of champagne and for a moment forgot the bills in the safe and the good things which his boys were receiving damn that kind of nonsense he said call people by their proper names then he left the house without a further word to the master of it that night before they went to sleep melmotte required from his weary wife an account of the ball and especially of maries conduct marie madame melmotte said had behaved well but had certainly preferred sir carbury to any other of the young men hitherto mr melmotte had heard very little of sir carbury except that he was a baronet though his eyes and ears were always open though he attended to everything and was a man of sharp intelligence he did not yet quite understand the bearing and sequence of english titles he knew that he must get for his daughter either an eldest son or one absolutely in possession himself sir felix he had learned was only a baronet but then he was in possession he had discovered also that sir felixs son would in course of time also become sir felix he was not therefore at the present moment disposed to give any positive orders as to his daughters conduct to the young baronet he did not however conceive that the young baronet had as yet addressed his girl in such words as felix had in truth used when they parted you know who it is he whispered likes you better than any one else in the world  nobody doesdont sir felix  i do he said as he held her hand for a minute he looked into her face and she thought it very sweet he had studied the words as a lesson and repeating them as a lesson he did it fairly well he did it well enough at any rate to send the poor girl to bed with a sweet conviction that at last a man had spoken to her whom she could love     chapter v  after the ball   its weary work said sir felix as he got into the brougham with his mother and sister  what must it have been to me then who had nothing to do said his mother  its the having something to do that makes me call it weary work bythebye now i think of it ill run down to the club before i go home so saying he put his head out of the brougham and stopped the driver  it is two oclock felix said his mother  im afraid it is but you see im hungry you had supper perhaps i had none  are you going down to the club for supper at this time in the morning  i must go to bed hungry if i dont good night then he jumped out of the brougham called a cab and had himself driven to the beargarden he declared to himself that the men there would think it mean of him if he did not give them their revenge he had renewed his play on the preceding night and had again won dolly longestaffe owed him now a considerable sum of money and lord grasslough was also in his debt he was sure that grasslough would go to the club after the ball and he was determined that they should not think that he had submitted to be carried home by his mother and sister so he argued with himself but in truth the devil of gambling was hot within his bosom and though he feared that in losing he might lose real money and that if he won it would be long before he was paid yet he could not keep himself from the cardtable  neither mother or daughter said a word till they reached home and had got upstairs then the elder spoke of the trouble that was nearest to her heart at the moment do you think he gambles  he has got no money mamma  i fear that might not hinder him and he has money with him though for him and such friends as he has it is not much if he gambles everything is lost  i suppose they all do play more or less  i have not known that he played i am wearied too out of all heart by his want of consideration to me it is not that he will not obey me a mother perhaps should not expect obedience from a grownup son but my word is nothing to him he has no respect for me he would as soon do what is wrong before me as before the merest stranger  he has been so long his own master mamma  yeshis own master and yet i must provide for him as though he were but a child hetta you spent the whole evening talking to paul montague  no mamma that is unjust  he was always with you  i knew nobody else i could not tell him not to speak to me i danced with him twice her mother was seated with both her hands up to her forehead and shook her head if you did not want me to speak to paul you should not have taken me there  i dont wish to prevent your speaking to him you know what i want henrietta came up and kissed her and bade her good night i think i am the unhappiest woman in all london she said sobbing hysterically  is it my fault mamma  you could save me from much if you would i work like a horse and i never spend a shilling that i can help i want nothing for myself nothing for myself nobody has suffered as i have but felix never thinks of me for a moment  i think of you mamma  if you did you would accept your cousins offer what right have you to refuse him i believe it is all because of that young man  no mamma it is not because of that young man i like my cousin very muchbut that is all good night mamma lady carbury just allowed herself to be kissed and then was left alone  at eight oclock the next morning daybreak found four young men who had just risen from a cardtable at the beargarden the beargarden was so pleasant a club that there was no rule whatsoever as to its being closedthe only law being that it should not be opened before three in the afternoon a sort of sanction had however been given to the servants to demur to producing supper or drinks after six in the morning so that about eight unrelieved tobacco began to be too heavy even for juvenile constitutions the party consisted of dolly longestaffe lord grasslough miles grendall and felix carbury and the four had amused themselves during the last six hours with various innocent games they had commenced with whist and had culminated during the last halfhour with blind hookey but during the whole night felix had won miles grendall hated him and there had been an expressed opinion between miles and the young lord that it would be both profitable and proper to relieve sir felix of the winnings of the last two nights the two men had played with the same object and being young had shown their intentionso that a certain feeling of hostility had been engendered the reader is not to understand that either of them had cheated or that the baronet had entertained any suspicion of foul play but felix had felt that grendall and grasslough were his enemies and had thrown himself on dolly for sympathy and friendship dolly however was very tipsy  at eight oclock in the morning there came a sort of settling though no money then passed the readymoney transactions had not lasted long through the night grasslough was the chief loser and the figures and scraps of paper which had been passed over to carbury when counted up amounted to nearly £2000 his lordship contested the fact bitterly but contested it in vain there were his own initials and his own figures and even miles grendall who was supposed to be quite wide awake could not reduce the amount then grendall had lost over £400 to carburyan amount indeed that mattered little as miles could at present as easily have raised £40000 however he gave his iou to his opponent with an easy air grasslough also was impecunious but he had a fatheralso impecunious indeed but with them the matter would not be hopeless dolly longestaffe was so tipsy that he could not even assist in making up his own account that was to be left between him and carbury for some future occasion  i suppose youll be here tomorrowthat is tonight said miles  certainlyonly one thing answered felix  what one thing  i think these things should be squared before we play any more  what do you mean by that said grasslough angrily do you mean to hint anything  i never hint anything my grassy said felix i believe when people play cards its intended to be readymoney thats all but im not going to stand on ps and qs with you ill give you your revenge tonight  thats all right said miles  i was speaking to lord grasslough said felix he is an old friend and we know each other you have been rather rough tonight mr grendall  roughwhat the devil do you mean by that  and i think it will be as well that our account should be settled before we begin again  a settlement once a week is the kind of thing im used to said grendall  there was nothing more said but the young men did not part on good terms felix as he got himself taken home calculated that if he could realize his spoil he might begin the campaign again with horses servants and all luxuries as before if all were paid he would have over £3000     chapter vi  roger carbury and paul montague   roger carbury of carbury hall the owner of a small property in suffolk was the head of the carbury family the carburys had been in suffolk a great many yearscertainly from the time of the war of the rosesand had always held up their heads but they had never held them very high it was not known that any had risen ever to the honour of knighthood before sir patrick going higher than that had been made a baronet they had however been true to their acres and their acres true to them through the perils of civil wars reformation commonwealth and revolution and the head carbury of the day had always owned and had always lived at carbury hall at the beginning of the present century the squire of carbury had been a considerable man if not in his county at any rate in his part of the county the income of the estate had sufficed to enable him to live plenteously and hospitably to drink port wine to ride a stout hunter and to keep an old lumbering coach for his wifes use when she went avisiting he had an old butler who had never lived anywhere else and a boy from the village who was in a way apprenticed to the butler there was a cook not too proud to wash up her own dishes and a couple of young womenwhile the house was kept by mrs carbury herself who marked and gave out her own linen made her own preserves and looked to the curing of her own hams in the year 1800 the carbury property was sufficient for the carbury house since that time the carbury property has considerably increased in value and the rents have been raised even the acreage has been extended by the enclosure of commons but the income is no longer comfortably adequate to the wants of an english gentlemans household if a moderate estate in land be left to a man now there arises the question whether he is not damaged unless an income also be left to him wherewith to keep up the estate land is a luxury and of all luxuries is the most costly now the carburys never had anything but land suffolk has not been made rich and great either by coal or iron no great town had sprung up on the confines of the carbury property no eldest son had gone into trade or risen high in a profession so as to add to the carbury wealth no great heiress had been married there had been no ruinno misfortune but in the days of which we write the squire of carbury hall had become a poor man simply through the wealth of others his estate was supposed to bring him in £2000 a year had he been content to let the manor house to live abroad and to have an agent at home to deal with the tenants he would undoubtedly have had enough to live luxuriously but he lived on his own land among his own people as all the carburys before him had done and was poor because he was surrounded by rich neighbours the longestaffes of cavershamof which family dolly longestaffe was the eldest son and hopehad the name of great wealth but the founder of the family had been a lord mayor of london and a chandler as lately as in the reign of queen anne the hepworths who could boast good blood enough on their own side had married into new money the primerosthough the goodnature of the country folk had accorded to the head of them the title of squire primerohad been trading spaniards fifty years ago and had bought the bundlesham property from a great duke the estates of those three gentlemen with the domain of the bishop of elmham lay all around the carbury property and in regard to wealth enabled their owners altogether to overshadow our squire the superior wealth of a bishop was nothing to him he desired that bishops should be rich and was among those who thought that the country had been injured when the territorial possessions of our prelates had been converted into stipends by act of parliament but the grandeur of the longestaffes and the too apparent wealth of the primeros did oppress him though he was a man who would never breathe a word of such oppression into the ear even of his dearest friend it was his opinionwhich he did not care to declare loudly but which was fully understood to be his opinion by those with whom he lived intimatelythat a mans standing in the world should not depend at all upon his wealth the primeros were undoubtedly beneath him in the social scale although the young primeros had three horses apiece and killed legions of pheasants annually at about 10s a head hepworth of eardly was a very good fellow who gave himself no airs and understood his duties as a country gentleman but he could not be more than on a par with carbury of carbury though he was supposed to enjoy £7000 a year the longestaffes were altogether oppressive their footmen even in the country had powdered hair they had a house in towna house of their ownand lived altogether as magnates the lady was lady pomona longestaffe the daughters who certainly were handsome had been destined to marry peers the only son dolly had or had had a fortune of his own they were an oppressive people in a country neighbourhood and to make the matter worse rich as they were they never were able to pay anybody anything that they owed they continued to live with all the appurtenances of wealth the girls always had horses to ride both in town and country the acquaintance of dolly the reader has already made dolly who certainly was a poor creature though goodnatured had energy in one direction he would quarrel perseveringly with his father who only had a life interest in the estate the house at caversham park was during six or seven months of the year full of servants if not of guests and all the tradesmen in the little towns around bungay beccles and harlestone were aware that the longestaffes were the great people of that country though occasionally much distressed for money they would always execute the longestaffe orders with submissive punctuality because there was an idea that the longestaffe property was sound at the bottom and then the owner of a property so managed cannot scrutinise bills very closely  carbury of carbury had never owed a shilling that he could not pay or his father before him his orders to the tradesmen at beccles were not extensive and care was used to see that the goods supplied were neither overcharged nor unnecessary the tradesmen consequently of beccles did not care much for carbury of carburythough perhaps one or two of the elders among them entertained some ancient reverence for the family roger carbury esq was carbury of carburya distinction of itself which from its nature could not belong to the longestaffes and primeros which did not even belong to the hepworths of eardly the very parish in which carbury hall stoodor carbury manor house as it was more properly calledwas carbury parish and there was carbury chase partly in carbury parish and partly in bundleshambut belonging unfortunately in its entirety to the bundlesham estate  roger carbury himself was all alone in the world his nearest relatives of the name were sir felix and henrietta but they were no more than second cousins he had sisters but they had long since been married and had gone away into the world with their husbands one to india and another to the far west of the united states at present he was not much short of forty years of age and was still unmarried he was a stout goodlooking man with a firmly set square face with features finely cut a small mouth good teeth and wellformed chin his hair was red curling round his head which was now partly bald at the top he wore no other beard than small almost unnoticeable whiskers his eyes were small but bright and very cheery when his humour was good he was about five feet nine in height having the appearance of great strength and perfect health a more manly man to the eye was never seen and he was one with whom you would instinctively wish at first sight to be on good termspartly because in looking at him there would come on you an unconscious conviction that he would be very stout in holding his own against his opponents partly also from a conviction equally strong that he would be very pleasant to his friends  when sir patrick had come home from india as an invalid roger carbury had hurried up to see him in london and had proffered him all kindness would sir patrick and his wife and children like to go down to the old place in the country sir patrick did not care a straw for the old place in the country and so told his cousin in almost those very words there had not therefore been much friendship during sir patricks life but when the violent illconditioned old man was dead roger paid a second visit and again offered hospitality to the widow and her daughterand to the young baronet the young baronet had just joined his regiment and did not care to visit his cousin in suffolk but lady carbury and henrietta had spent a month there and everything had been done to make them happy the effort as regarded henrietta had been altogether successful as regarded the widow it must be acknowledged that carbury hall had not quite suited her tastes she had already begun to sigh for the glories of a literary career a career of some kindsufficient to repay her for the sufferings of her early lifeshe certainly desired dear cousin roger as she called him had not seemed to her to have much power of assisting her in these views she was a woman who did not care much for country charms she had endeavoured to get up some mild excitement with the bishop but the bishop had been too plain spoken and sincere for her the primeros had been odious the hepworths stupid the longestaffesshe had endeavoured to make up a little friendship with lady pomona insufferably supercilious she had declared to henrietta that carbury hall was very dull  but then there had come a circumstance which altogether changed her opinions as to carbury hall and its proprietor the proprietor after a few weeks followed them up to london and made a most matteroffact offer to the mother for the daughters hand he was at that time thirtysix and henrietta was not yet twenty he was very coolsome might have thought him phlegmatic in his lovemaking henrietta declared to her mother that she had not in the least expected it but he was very urgent and very persistent lady carbury was eager on his side though the carbury manor house did not exactly suit her it would do admirably for henrietta and as for age to her thinking she being then over forty a man of thirtysix was young enough for any girl but henrietta had an opinion of her own she liked her cousin but did not love him she was amazed and even annoyed by the offer she had praised him and praised the house so loudly to her mother having in her innocence never dreamed of such a proposition as thisso that now she found it difficult to give an adequate reason for her refusal yesshe had undoubtedly said that her cousin was charming but she had not meant charming in that way she did refuse the offer very plainly but still with some apparent lack of persistency when roger suggested that she should take a few months to think of it and her mother supported rogers suggestion she could say nothing stronger than that she was afraid that thinking about it would not do any good their first visit to carbury had been made in september in the following february she went there againmuch against the grain as far as her own wishes were concerned and when there had been cold constrained almost dumb in the presence of her cousin before they left the offer was renewed but henrietta declared that she could not do as they would have her she could give no reason only she did not love her cousin in that way but roger declared that he by no means intended to abandon his suit in truth he verily loved the girl and love with him was a serious thing all this happened a full year before the beginning of our present story  but something else happened also while that second visit was being made at carbury there came to the hall a young man of whom roger carbury had said much to his cousinsone paul montague of whom some short account shall be given in this chapter the squireroger carbury was always called the squire about his own placehad anticipated no evil when he so timed this second visit of his cousins to his house that they must of necessity meet paul montague there but great harm had come of it paul montague had fallen into love with his cousins guest and there had sprung up much unhappiness  lady carbury and henrietta had been nearly a month at carbury and paul montague had been there barely a week when roger carbury thus spoke to the guest who had last arrived ive got to tell you something paul  anything serious  very serious to me i may say so serious that nothing in my own life can approach it in importance he had unconsciously assumed that look which his friend so thoroughly understood indicating his resolve to hold to what he believed to be his own and to fight if fighting be necessary montague knew him well and became half aware that he had done something he knew not what militating against this serious resolve of his friend he looked up but said nothing i have offered my hand in marriage to my cousin henrietta said roger very gravely  miss carbury  yes to henrietta carbury she has not accepted it she has refused me twice but i still have hopes of success perhaps i have no right to hope but i do i tell it you just as it is everything in life to me depends upon it i think i may count upon your sympathy  why did you not tell me before said paul montague in a hoarse voice  then there had come a sudden and rapid interchange of quick speaking between the men each of them speaking the truth exactly each of them declaring himself to be in the right and to be illused by the other each of them equally hot equally generous and equally unreasonable montague at once asserted that he also loved henrietta carbury he blurted out his assurance in the baldest and most incomplete manner but still in such words as to leave no doubt nohe had not said a word to her he had intended to consult roger carbury himselfshould have done so in a day or twoperhaps on that very day had not roger spoken to him you have neither of you a shilling in the world said roger and now you know what my feelings are you must abandon it then montague declared that he had a right to speak to miss carbury he did not suppose that miss carbury cared a straw about him he had not the least reason to think that she did it was altogether impossible but he had a right to his chance that chance was all the world to him as to moneyhe would not admit that he was a pauper and moreover he might earn an income as well as other men had carbury told him that the young lady had shown the slightest intention to receive his carburys addresses he paul would at once have disappeared from the scene but as it was not so he would not say that he would abandon his hope  the scene lasted for above an hour when it was ended paul montague packed up all his clothes and was driven away to the railway station by roger himself without seeing either of the ladies there had been very hot words between the men but the last words which roger spoke to the other on the railway platform were not quarrelsome in their nature god bless you old fellow he said pressing pauls hands pauls eyes were full of tears and he replied only by returning the pressure  paul montagues father and mother had long been dead the father had been a barrister in london having perhaps some small fortune of his own he had at any rate left to this son who was one among others a sufficiency with which to begin the world paul when he had come of age had found himself possessed of about £6000 he was then at oxford and was intended for the bar an uncle of his a younger brother of his father had married a carbury the younger sister of two though older than her brother roger this uncle many years since had taken his wife out to california and had there become an american he had a large tract of land growing wool and wheat and fruit but whether he prospered or whether he did not had not always been plain to the montagues and carburys at home the intercourse between the two families had in the quite early days of paul montagues life created an affection between him and roger who as will be understood by those who have carefully followed the above family history were not in any degree related to each other roger when quite a young man had had the charge of the boys education and had sent him to oxford but the oxford scheme to be followed by the bar and to end on some one of the many judicial benches of the country had not succeeded paul had got into a row at balliol and had been rusticatedhad then got into another row and was sent down indeed he had a talent for rowsthough as roger carbury always declared there was nothing really wrong about any of them paul was then twentyone and he took himself and his money out to california and joined his uncle he had perhaps an ideabased on very insufficient groundsthat rows are popular in california at the end of three years he found that he did not like farming life in californiaand he found also that he did not like his uncle so he returned to england but on returning was altogether unable to get his £6000 out of the californian farm indeed he had been compelled to come away without any of it with funds insufficient even to take him home accepting with much dissatisfaction an assurance from his uncle that an income amounting to ten per cent upon his capital should be remitted to him with the regularity of clockwork the clock alluded to must have been one of sam slicks it had gone very badly at the end of the first quarter there came the proper remittancethen half the amountthen there was a long interval without anything then some dropping payments now and againand then a twelvemonth without anything at the end of that twelvemonth he paid a second visit to california having borrowed money from roger for his journey he had now again returned with some little cash in hand and with the additional security of a deed executed in his favour by one hamilton k fisker who had gone into partnership with his uncle and who had added a vast flourmill to his uncles concerns in accordance with this deed he was to get twelve per cent on his capital and had enjoyed the gratification of seeing his name put up as one of the firm which now stood as fisker montague and montague a business declared by the two elder partners to be most promising had been opened at fiskerville about two hundred and fifty miles from san francisco and the hearts of fisker and the elder montague were very high paul hated fisker horribly did not love his uncle much and would willingly have got back his £6000 had he been able but he was not able and returned as one of fisker montague and montague not altogether unhappy as he had succeeded in obtaining enough of his back income to pay what he owed to roger and to live for a few months he was intent on considering how he should bestow himself consulting daily with roger on the subject when suddenly roger had perceived that the young man was becoming attached to the girl whom he himself loved what then occurred has been told  not a word was said to lady carbury or her daughter of the real cause of pauls sudden disappearance it had been necessary that he should go to london each of the ladies probably guessed something of the truth but neither spoke a word to the other on the subject before they left the manor the squire again pleaded his cause with henrietta but he pleaded it in vain henrietta was colder than everbut she made use of one unfortunate phrase which destroyed all the effect which her coldness might have had she said that she was too young to think of marrying yet she had meant to imply that the difference in their ages was too great but had not known how to say it it was easy to tell her that in a twelvemonth she would be olderbut it was impossible to convince her that any number of twelvemonths would alter the disparity between her and her cousin but even that disparity was not now her strongest reason for feeling sure that she could not marry roger carbury  within a week of the departure of lady carbury from the manor house paul montague returned and returned as a still dear friend he had promised before he went that he would not see henrietta again for three months but he would promise nothing further if she wont take you there is no reason why i shouldnt try that had been his argument roger would not accede to the justice even of this it seemed to him that paul was bound to retire altogether partly because he had got no income partly because of rogers previous claimpartly no doubt in gratitude but of this last reason roger never said a word if paul did not see this himself paul was not such a man as his friend had taken him to be  paul did see it himself and had many scruples but why should his friend be a dog in the manger he would yield at once to roger carburys older claims if roger could make anything of them indeed he could have no chance if the girl were disposed to take roger for her husband roger had all the advantage of carbury manor at his back whereas he had nothing but his share in the doubtful business of fisker montague and montague in a wretched little town 250 miles further off than san francisco but if with all this roger could not prevail why should he not try what roger said about want of money was mere nonsense paul was sure that his friend would have created no such difficulty had not he himself been interested paul declared to himself that he had money though doubtful money and that he certainly would not give up henrietta on that score  he came up to london at various times in search of certain employment which had been half promised him and after the expiration of the three months constantly saw lady carbury and her daughter but from time to time he had given renewed promises to roger carbury that he would not declare his passionnow for two months then for six weeks then for a month in the meantime the two men were fast friendsso fast that montague spent by far the greater part of his time as his friends guestand all this was done with the understanding that roger carbury was to blaze up into hostile wrath should paul ever receive the privilege to call himself henrietta carburys favoured lover but that everything was to be smooth between them should henrietta be persuaded to become the mistress of carbury hall so things went on up to the night at which montague met henrietta at madame melmottes ball the reader should also be informed that there had been already a former love affair in the young life of paul montague there had been and indeed there still was a widow one mrs hurtle whom he had been desperately anxious to marry before his second journey to california but the marriage had been prevented by the interference of roger carbury     chapter vii  mentor   lady carburys desire for a union between roger and her daughter was greatly increased by her solicitude in respect to her son since rogers offer had first been made felix had gone on from bad to worse till his condition had become one of hopeless embarrassment if her daughter could but be settled in the world lady carbury said to herself she could then devote herself to the interests of her son she had no very clear idea of what that devotion would be but she did know that she had paid so much money for him and would have so much more extracted from her that it might well come to pass that she would be unable to keep a home for her daughter in all these troubles she constantly appealed to roger carbury for advicewhich however she never followed he recommended her to give up her house in town to find a home for her daughter elsewhere and also for felix if he would consent to follow her should he not so consent then let the young man bear the brunt of his own misdoings doubtless when he could no longer get bread in london he would find her out roger was always severe when he spoke of the baronetor seemed to lady carbury to be severe  but in truth she did not ask for advice in order that she might follow it she had plans in her head with which she knew that roger would not sympathise she still thought that sir felix might bloom and burst out into grandeur wealth and fashion as the husband of a great heiress and in spite of her sons vices was proud of him in that anticipation when he succeeded in obtaining from her money as in the case of that £20when with brazenfaced indifference to her remonstrances he started off to his club at two in the morning when with impudent drollery he almost boasted of the hopelessness of his debts a sickness of heart would come upon her and she would weep hysterically and lie the whole night without sleeping but could he marry miss melmotte and thus conquer all his troubles by means of his own personal beautythen she would be proud of all that had passed with such a condition of mind roger carbury could have no sympathy to him it seemed that a gentleman was disgraced who owed money to a tradesman which he could not pay and lady carburys heart was high with other hopesin spite of her hysterics and her fears the criminal queens might be a great literary success she almost thought that it would be a success messrs leadham and loiter the publishers were civil to her mr broune had promised mr booker had said that he would see what could be done she had gathered from mr alfs caustic and cautious words that the book would be noticed in the evening pulpit noshe would not take dear rogers advice as to leaving london but she would continue to ask rogers advice men like to have their advice asked and if possible she would arrange the marriage what country retirement could be so suitable for a lady carbury when she wished to retire for awhileas carbury manor the seat of her own daughter and then her mind would fly away into regions of bliss if only by the end of this season henrietta could be engaged to her cousin felix be the husband of the richest bride in europe and she be the acknowledged author of the cleverest book of the year what a paradise of triumph might still be open to her after all her troubles then the sanguine nature of the woman would bear her up almost to exultation and for an hour she would be happy in spite of everything  a few days after the ball roger carbury was up in town and was closeted with her in her back drawingroom the declared cause of his coming was the condition of the baronets affairs and the indispensable necessityso roger thoughtof taking some steps by which at any rate the young mans present expenses might be brought to an end it was horrible to him that a man who had not a shilling in the world or any prospect of a shilling who had nothing and never thought of earning anything should have hunters he was very much in earnest about it and quite prepared to speak his mind to the young man himselfif he could get hold of him where is he now lady carburyat this moment  i think hes out with the baron being out with the baron meant that the young man was hunting with the staghounds some forty miles away from london  how does he manage it whose horses does he ride who pays for them  dont be angry with me roger what can i do to prevent it  i think you should refuse to have anything to do with him while he continues in such courses  my own son  yesexactly but what is to be the end of it is he to be allowed to ruin you and hetta it cant go on long  you wouldnt have me throw him over  i think he is throwing you over and then it is so thoroughly dishonestso ungentlemanlike i dont understand how it goes on from day to day i suppose you dont supply him with ready money  he has had a little  roger frowned angrily i can understand that you should provide him with bed and food but not that you should pander to his vices by giving him money this was very plain speaking and lady carbury winced under it the kind of life that he is leading requires a large income of itself i understand the thing and know that with all i have in the world i could not do it myself  you are so different  i am older of coursevery much older but he is not so young that he should not begin to comprehend has he any money beyond what you give him  then lady carbury revealed certain suspicions which she had begun to entertain during the last day or two i think he has been playing  that is the way to lose moneynot to get it said roger  i suppose somebody winssometimes  they who win are the sharpers they who lose are the dupes i would sooner that he were a fool than a knave  o roger you are so severe  you say he plays how would he pay were he to lose  i know nothing about it i dont even know that he does play but i have reason to think that during the last week he has had money at his command indeed i have seen it he comes home at all manner of hours and sleeps late yesterday i went into his room about ten and did not wake him there were notes and gold lying on his tableever so much  why did you not take them  what rob my own boy  when you tell me that you are absolutely in want of money to pay your own bills and that he has not hesitated to take yours from you why does he not repay you what he has borrowed  ah indeedwhy not he ought to if he has it and there were papers thereious signed by other men  you looked at them  i saw as much as that it is not that i am curious but one does feel about ones own son i think he has bought another horse a groom came here and said something about it to the servants  oh dear oh dear  if you could only induce him to stop the gambling of course it is very bad whether he wins or losesthough i am sure that felix would do nothing unfair nobody ever said that of him if he has won money it would be a great comfort if he would let me have some of itfor to tell the truth i hardly know how to turn i am sure nobody can say that i spend it on myself  then roger again repeated his advice there could be no use in attempting to keep up the present kind of life in welbeck street welbeck street might be very well without a penniless spendthrift such as sir felix but must be ruinous under the present conditions if lady carbury felt as no doubt she did feel bound to afford a home to her ruined son in spite of all his wickedness and folly that home should be found far away from london if he chose to remain in london let him do so on his own resources the young man should make up his mind to do something for himself a career might possibly be opened for him in india if he be a man he would sooner break stones than live on you said roger yes he would see his cousin tomorrow and speak to himthat is if he could possibly find him young men who gamble all night and hunt all day are not easily found but he would come at twelve as felix generally breakfasted at that hour then he gave an assurance to lady carbury which to her was not the least comfortable part of the interview in the event of her son not giving her the money which she at one once required he roger would lend her a hundred pounds till her half years income should be due after that his voice changed altogether as he asked a question on another subject can i see henrietta tomorrow  certainlywhy not she is at home now i think  i will wait till tomorrowwhen i call to see felix i should like her to know that i am coming paul montague was in town the other day he was here i suppose  yeshe called  was that all you saw of him  he was at the melmottes ball felix got a card for himand we were there has he gone down to carbury  nonot to carbury i think he had some business about his partners at liverpool there is another case of a young man without anything to do not that paul is at all like sir felix this he was induced to say by the spirit of honesty which was always strong within him  dont be too hard upon poor felix said lady carbury roger as he took his leave thought that it would be impossible to be too hard upon sir felix carbury  the next morning lady carbury was in her sons bedroom before he was up and with incredible weakness told him that his cousin roger was coming to lecture him what the devils the use of it said felix from beneath the bedclothes  if you speak to me in that way felix i must leave the room  but what is the use of his coming to me i know what he has got to say just as if it were said its all very well preaching sermons to good people but nothing ever was got by preaching to people who aint good  why shouldnt you be good  i shall do very well mother if that fellow will leave me alone i can play my hand better than he can play for me if youll go now ill get up she had intended to ask him for some of the money which she believed he still possessed but her courage failed her if she asked for his money and took it she would in some fashion recognise and tacitly approve his gambling it was not yet eleven and it was early for him to leave his bed but he had resolved that he would get out of the house before that horrible bore should be upon him with his sermon to do this he must be energetic he was actually eating his breakfast at halfpast eleven and had already contrived in his mind how he would turn the wrong way as soon as he got into the street towards marylebone road by which route roger would certainly not come he left the house at ten minutes before twelve cunningly turned away dodging round by the first cornerand just as he had turned it encountered his cousin roger anxious in regard to his errand with time at his command had come before the hour appointed and had strolled about thinking not of felix but of felixs sister the baronet felt that he had been caughtcaught unfairly but by no means abandoned all hope of escape i was going to your mothers house on purpose to see you said roger  were you indeed i am so sorry i have an engagement out here with a fellow which i must keep i could meet you at any other time you know  you can come back for ten minutes said roger taking him by the arm  wellnot conveniently at this moment  you must manage it i am here at your mothers request and cant afford to remain in town day after day looking for you i go down to carbury this afternoon your friend can wait come along his firmness was too much for felix who lacked the courage to shake his cousin off violently and to go his way but as he returned he fortified himself with the remembrance of all the money in his pocket for he still had his winningsremembered too certain sweet words which had passed between him and marie melmotte since the ball and resolved that he would not be sat upon by roger carbury the time was cominghe might almost say that the time had comein which he might defy roger carbury nevertheless he dreaded the words which were now to be spoken to him with a craven fear  your mother tells me said roger that you still keep hunters  i dont know what she calls hunters i have one that i didnt part with when the others went  you have only one horse  wellif you want to be exact i have a hack as well as the horse i ride  and another up here in town  who told you that no i havent at least there is one staying at some stables which has been sent for me to look at  who pays for all these horses  at any rate i shall not ask you to pay for them  noyou would be afraid to do that but you have no scruple in asking your mother though you should force her to come to me or to other friends for assistance you have squandered every shilling of your own and now you are ruining her  that isnt true i have money of my own  where did you get it  this is all very well roger but i dont know that you have any right to ask me these questions i have money if i buy a horse i can pay for it if i keep one or two i can pay for them of course i owe a lot of money but other people owe me money too im all right and you neednt frighten yourself  then why do you beg her last shilling from your mother and when you have money not pay it back to her  she can have the twenty pounds if you mean that  i mean that and a good deal more than that i suppose you have been gambling  i dont know that i am bound to answer your questions and i wont do it if you have nothing else to say ill go about my own business  i have something else to say and i mean to say it felix had walked towards the door but roger was before him and now leaned his back against it  im not going to be kept here against my will said felix  you have to listen to me so you may as well sit still do you wish to be looked upon as a blackguard by all the world  ohgo on  that is what it will be you have spent every shilling of your own and because your mother is affectionate and weak you are now spending all that she has and are bringing her and your sister to beggary  i dont ask her to pay anything for me  not when you borrow her money  there is the £20 take it and give it her said felix counting the notes out of the pocketbook when i asked her for it i did not think she would make such a row about such a trifle roger took up the notes and thrust them into his pocket now have you done said felix  not quite do you purpose that your mother should keep you and clothe you for the rest of your life  i hope to be able to keep her before long and to do it much better than it has ever been done before the truth is roger you know nothing about it if youll leave me to myself youll find that i shall do very well  i dont know any young man who ever did worse or one who had less moral conception of what is right and wrong  very well thats your idea i differ from you people cant all think alike you know now if you please ill go  roger felt that he hadnt half said what he had to say but he hardly knew how to get it said and of what use could it be to talk to a young man who was altogether callous and without feeling the remedy for the evil ought to be found in the mothers conduct rather than the sons she were she not foolishly weak would make up her mind to divide herself utterly from her son at any rate for a while and to leave him to suffer utter penury that would bring him round and then when the agony of want had tamed him he would be content to take bread and meat from her hand and would be humble at present he had money in his pocket and would eat and drink of the best and be free from inconvenience for the moment while this prosperity remained it would be impossible to touch him you will ruin your sister and break your mothers heart said roger firing a last harmless shot after the young reprobate  when lady carbury came into the room which she did as soon as the front door was closed behind her son she seemed to think that a great success had been achieved because the £20 had been recovered i knew he would give it me back if he had it she said  why did he not bring it to you of his own accord  i suppose he did not like to talk about it has he said that he got it byplaying  nohe did not speak a word of truth while he was here you may take it for granted that he did get it by gambling how else should he have it and you may take it for granted also that he will lose all that he has got he talked in the wildest waysaying that he would soon have a home for you and hetta  did hedear boy  had he any meaning  oh yes and it is quite on the cards that it should be so you have heard of miss melmotte  i have heard of the great french swindler who has come over here and who is buying his way into society  everybody visits them now roger  more shame for everybody who knows anything about himexcept that he left paris with the reputation of a specially prosperous rogue but what of him  some people think that felix will marry his only child felix is handsome isnt he what young man is there nearly so handsome they say shell have half a million of money  thats his gameis it  dont you think he is right  no i think hes wrong but we shall hardly agree with each other about that can i see henrietta for a few minutes     chapter viii  lovesick   roger carbury said well that it was very improbable that he and his cousin the widow should agree in their opinions as to the expedience of fortunehunting by marriage it was impossible that they should ever understand each other to lady carbury the prospect of a union between her son and miss melmotte was one of unmixed joy and triumph could it have been possible that marie melmotte should be rich and her father be a man doomed to a deserved sentence in a penal settlement there might perhaps be a doubt about it the wealth even in that case would certainly carry the day against the disgrace and lady carbury would find reasons why poor marie should not be punished for her fathers sins even while enjoying the money which those sins had produced but how different were the existing facts mr melmotte was not at the galleys but was entertaining duchesses in grosvenor square people said that mr melmotte had a reputation throughout europe as a gigantic swindleras one who in the dishonest and successful pursuit of wealth had stopped at nothing people said of him that he had framed and carried out long premeditated and deeplylaid schemes for the ruin of those who had trusted him that he had swallowed up the property of all who had come in contact with him that he was fed with the blood of widows and childrenbut what was all this to lady carbury if the duchesses condoned it all did it become her to be prudish people also said that melmotte would yet get a fallthat a man who had risen after such a fashion never could long keep his head up but he might keep his head up long enough to give marie her fortune and then felix wanted a fortune so badlywas so exactly the young man who ought to marry a fortune to lady carbury there was no second way of looking at the matter  and to roger carbury also there was no second way of looking at it that condonation of antecedents which in the hurry of the world is often vouchsafed to success that growing feeling which induces people to assert to themselves that they are not bound to go outside the general verdict and that they may shake hands with whomsoever the world shakes hands with had never reached him the oldfashioned idea that the touching of pitch will defile still prevailed with him he was a gentlemanand would have felt himself disgraced to enter the house of such a one as augustus melmotte not all the duchesses in the peerage or all the money in the city could alter his notions or induce him to modify his conduct but he knew that it would be useless for him to explain this to lady carbury he trusted however that one of the family might be taught to appreciate the difference between honour and dishonour henrietta carbury had he thought a higher turn of mind than her mother and had as yet been kept free from soil as for felixhe had so grovelled in the gutters as to be dirt all over nothing short of the prolonged sufferings of half a life could cleanse him  he found henrietta alone in the drawingroom have you seen felix she said as soon as they had greeted each other  yes i caught him in the street  we are so unhappy about him  i cannot say but that you have reason i think you know that your mother indulges him foolishly  poor mamma she worships the very ground he treads on  even a mother should not throw her worship away like that the fact is that your brother will ruin you both if this goes on  what can mamma do  leave london and then refuse to pay a shilling on his behalf  what would felix do in the country  if he did nothing how much better would that be than what he does in town you would not like him to become a professional gambler  oh mr carbury you do not mean that he does that  it seems cruel to say such things to youbut in a matter of such importance one is bound to speak the truth i have no influence over your mother but you may have some she asks my advice but has not the slightest idea of listening to it i dont blame her for that but i am anxious for the sake offor the sake of the family  i am sure you are  especially for your sake you will never throw him over  you would not ask me to throw him over  but he may drag you into the mud for his sake you have already been taken into the house of that man melmotte  i do not think that i shall be injured by anything of that kind said henrietta drawing herself up  pardon me if i seem to interfere  oh noit is no interference from you  pardon me then if i am rough to me it seems that an injury is done to you if you are made to go to the house of such a one as this man why does your mother seek his society not because she likes him not because she has any sympathy with him or his familybut simply because there is a rich daughter  everybody goes there mr carbury  yesthat is the excuse which everybody makes is that sufficient reason for you to go to a mans house is there not another place to which we are told that a great many are going simply because the road has become thronged and fashionable have you no feeling that you ought to choose your friends for certain reasons of your own i admit there is one reason here they have a great deal of money and it is thought possible that he may get some of it by falsely swearing to a girl that he loves her after what you have heard are the melmottes people with whom you would wish to be connected  i dont know  i do i know very well they are absolutely disgraceful a social connection with the first crossingsweeper would be less objectionable he spoke with a degree of energy of which he was himself altogether unaware he knit his brows and his eyes flashed and his nostrils were extended of course she thought of his own offer to herself of course her mind at once conceivednot that the melmotte connection could ever really affect him for she felt sure that she would never accept his offerbut that he might think that he would be so affected of course he resented the feeling which she thus attributed to him but in truth he was much too simpleminded for any such complex idea felix he continued has already descended so far that i cannot pretend to be anxious as to what houses he may frequent but i should be sorry to think that you should often be seen at mr melmottes  i think mr carbury that mamma will take care that i am not taken where i ought not to be taken  i wish you to have some opinion of your own as to what is proper for you  i hope i have i am sorry you should think that i have not  i am oldfashioned hetta  and we belong to a newer and worse sort of world i dare say it is so you have been always very kind but i almost doubt whether you can change us now i have sometimes thought that you and mamma were hardly fit for each other  i have thought that you and i wereor possibly might be fit for each other  ohas for me i shall always take mammas side if mamma chooses to go to the melmottes i shall certainly go with her if that is contamination i suppose i must be contaminated i dont see why im to consider myself better than any one else  i have always thought that you were better than any one else  that was before i went to the melmottes i am sure you have altered your opinion now indeed you have told me so i am afraid mr carbury you must go your way and we must go ours  he looked into her face as she spoke and gradually began to perceive the working of her mind he was so true to himself that he did not understand that there should be with her even that violetcoloured tinge of prevarication which women assume as an additional charm could she really have thought that he was attending to his own possible future interests when he warned her as to the making of new acquaintances  for myself he said putting out his hand and making a slight vain effort to get hold of hers i have only one wish in the world and that is to travel the same road with you i do not say that you ought to wish it too but you ought to know that i am sincere when i spoke of the melmottes did you believe that i was thinking of myself  oh nohow should i  i was speaking to you then as to a cousin who might regard me as an elder brother no contact with legions of melmottes could make you other to me than the woman on whom my heart has settled even were you in truth disgraced could disgrace touch one so pure as you it would be the same i love you so well that i have already taken you for better or for worse i cannot change my nature is too stubborn for such changes have you a word to say to comfort me she turned away her head but did not answer him at once do you understand how much i am in need of comfort  you can do very well without comfort from me  no indeed i shall live no doubt but i shall not do very well as it is i am not doing at all well i am becoming sour and moody and ill at ease with my friends i would have you believe me at any rate when i say i love you  i suppose you mean something  i mean a great deal dear i mean all that a man can mean that is it you hardly understand that i am serious to the extent of ecstatic joy on the one side and utter indifference to the world on the other i shall never give it up till i learn that you are to be married to some one else  what can i say mr carbury  that you will love me  but if i dont  say that you will try  no i will not say that love should come without a struggle i dont know how one person is to try to love another in that way i like you very much but being married is such a terrible thing  it would not be terrible to me dear  yeswhen you found that i was too young for your tastes  i shall persevere you know will you assure me of thisthat if you promise your hand to another man you will let me know at once  i suppose i may promise that she said after pausing for a moment  there is no one as yet  there is no one but mr carbury you have no right to question me i dont think it generous i allow you to say things that nobody else could say because you are a cousin and because mamma trusts you so much no one but mamma has a right to ask me whether i care for any one  are you angry with me  no  if i have offended you it is because i love you so dearly  i am not offended but i dont like to be questioned by a gentleman i dont think any girl would like it i am not to tell everybody all that happens  perhaps when you reflect how much of my happiness depends upon it you will forgive me goodbye now she put out her hand to him and allowed it to remain in his for a moment when i walk about the old shrubberies at carbury where we used to be together i am always asking myself what chance there is of your walking there as the mistress  there is no chance  i am of course prepared to hear you say so well goodbye and may god bless you  the man had no poetry about him he did not even care for romance all the outside belongings of love which are so pleasant to many men and which to many women afford the one sweetness in life which they really relish were nothing to him there are both men and women to whom even the delays and disappointments of love are charming even when they exist to the detriment of hope it is sweet to such persons to be melancholy sweet to pine sweet to feel that they are now wretched after a romantic fashion as have been those heroes and heroines of whose sufferings they have read in poetry but there was nothing of this with roger carbury he had as he believed found the woman that he really wanted who was worthy of his love and now having fixed his heart upon her he longed for her with an amazing longing he had spoken the simple truth when he declared that life had become indifferent to him without her no man in england could be less likely to throw himself off the monument or to blow out his brains but he felt numbed in all the joints of his mind by this sorrow he could not make one thing bear upon another so as to console himself after any fashion there was but one thing for himto persevere till he got her or till he had finally lost her and should the latter be his fate as he began to fear that it would be then he would live but live only like a crippled man  he felt almost sure in his heart of hearts that the girl loved that other younger man that she had never owned to such love he was quite sure the man himself and henrietta also had both assured him on this point and he was a man easily satisfied by words and prone to believe but he knew that paul montague was attached to her and that it was pauls intention to cling to his love sorrowfully looking forward through the vista of future years he thought he saw that henrietta would become pauls wife were it so what should he do annihilate himself as far as all personal happiness in the world was concerned and look solely to their happiness their prosperity and their joys be as it were a beneficent old fairy to them though the agony of his own disappointment should never depart from him should he do this and be blessed by themor should he let paul montague know what deep resentment such ingratitude could produce when had a father been kinder to a son or a brother to a brother than he had been to paul his home had been the young mans home and his purse the young mans purse what right could the young man have to come upon him just as he was perfecting his bliss and rob him of all that he had in the world he was conscious all the while that there was a something wrong in his argumentthat paul when he commenced to love the girl knew nothing of his friends lovethat the girl though paul had never come in the way might probably have been as obdurate as she was now to his entreaties he knew all this because his mind was clear but yet the injusticeat any rate the misery was so great that to forgive it and to reward it would be weak womanly and foolish roger carbury did not quite believe in the forgiveness of injuries if you pardon all the evil done to you you encourage others to do you evil if you give your cloak to him who steals your coat how long will it be before your shirt and trousers will go also roger carbury returned that afternoon to suffolk and as he thought of it all throughout the journey he resolved that he would never forgive paul montague if paul montague should become his cousins husband     chapter ix  the great railway to vera cruz   you have been a guest in his house then i guess the things about as good as done these words were spoken with a fine sharp nasal twang by a brilliantlydressed american gentleman in one of the smartest private rooms of the great railway hotel at liverpool and they were addressed to a young englishman who was sitting opposite to him between them there was a table covered with maps schedules and printed programmes the american was smoking a very large cigar which he kept constantly turning in his mouth and half of which was inside his teeth the englishman had a short pipe mr hamilton k fisker of the firm of fisker montague and montague was the american and the englishman was our friend paul the junior member of that firm  but i didnt even speak to him said paul  in commercial affairs that matters nothing it quite justifies you in introducing me we are not going to ask your friend to do us a favour we dont want to borrow money  i thought you did  if hell go in for the thing hed be one of us and there would be no borrowing then hell join us if hes as clever as they say because hell see his way to making a couple of million of dollars out of it if hed take the trouble to run over and show himself in san francisco hed make double that the moneyed men would go in with him at once because they know that he understands the game and has got the pluck a man who has done what he has by financing in europeby george theres no limit to what he might do with us were a bigger people than any of you and have more room we go after bigger things and dont stand shillyshally on the brink as you do but melmotte pretty nigh beats the best among us anyway he should come and try his luck and he couldnt have a bigger thing or a safer thing than this hed see it immediately if i could talk to him for half an hour  mr fisker said paul mysteriously as we are partners i think i ought to let you know that many people speak very badly of mr melmottes honesty  mr fisker smiled gently turned his cigar twice round in his mouth and then closed one eye there is always a want of charity he said when a man is successful  the scheme in question was the grand proposal for a south central pacific and mexican railway which was to run from the salt lake city thus branching off from the san francisco and chicago lineand pass down through the fertile lands of new mexico and arizona into the territory of the mexican republic run by the city of mexico and come out on the gulf at the port of vera cruz mr fisker admitted at once that it was a great undertaking acknowledged that the distance might be perhaps something over 2000 miles acknowledged that no computation had or perhaps could be made as to the probable cost of the railway but seemed to think that questions such as these were beside the mark and childish melmotte if he would go into the matter at all would ask no such questions  but we must go back a little paul montague had received a telegram from his partner hamilton k fisker sent on shore at queenstown from one of the new york liners requesting him to meet fisker at liverpool immediately with this request he had felt himself bound to comply personally he had disliked fiskerand perhaps not the less so because when in california he had never found himself able to resist the mans good humour audacity and cleverness combined he had found himself talked into agreeing with any project which mr fisker might have in hand it was altogether against the grain with him and yet by his own consent that the flourmill had been opened at fiskerville he trembled for his money and never wished to see fisker again but still when fisker came to england he was proud to remember that fisker was his partner and he obeyed the order and went down to liverpool  if the flourmill had frightened him what must the present project have done fisker explained that he had come with two objectsfirst to ask the consent of the english partner to the proposed change in their business and secondly to obtain the cooperation of english capitalists the proposed change in the business meant simply the entire sale of the establishment at fiskerville and the absorption of the whole capital in the work of getting up the railway if you could realise all the money it wouldnt make a mile of the railway said paul mr fisker laughed at him the object of fisker montague and montague was not to make a railway to vera cruz but to float a company paul thought that mr fisker seemed to be indifferent whether the railway should ever be constructed or not it was clearly his idea that fortunes were to be made out of the concern before a spadeful of earth had been moved if brilliantly printed programmes might avail anything with gorgeous maps and beautiful little pictures of trains running into tunnels beneath snowy mountains and coming out of them on the margin of sunlit lakes mr fisker had certainly done much but paul when he saw all these pretty things could not keep his mind from thinking whence had come the money to pay for them mr fisker had declared that he had come over to obtain his partners consent but it seemed to that partner that a great deal had been done without any consent and pauls fears on this hand were not allayed by finding that on all these beautiful papers he himself was described as one of the agents and general managers of the company each document was signed fisker montague and montague references on all matters were to be made to fisker montague and montagueand in one of the documents it was stated that a member of the firm had proceeded to london with the view of attending to british interests in the matter fisker had seemed to think that his young partner would express unbounded satisfaction at the greatness which was thus falling upon him a certain feeling of importance not altogether unpleasant was produced but at the same time there was another conviction forced upon montagues mind not altogether pleasant that his money was being made to disappear without any consent given by him and that it behoved him to be cautious lest such consent should be extracted from him unawares  what has become of the mill he asked  we have put an agent into it  is not that dangerous what check have you on him  he pays us a fixed sum sir but my word when there is such a thing as this on hand a trumpery mill like that is not worth speaking of  you havent sold it  wellno but weve arranged a price for a sale  you havent taken the money for it  wellyes we have weve raised money on it you know you see you werent there and so the two resident partners acted for the firm but mr montague youd better go with us you had indeed  and about my own income  thats a fleabite when weve got a little ahead with this it wont matter sir whether you spend twenty thousand or forty thousand dollars a year weve got the concession from the united states government through the territories and were in correspondence with the president of the mexican republic ive no doubt weve an office open already in mexico and another at vera cruz  wheres the money to come from  money to come from sir where do you suppose the money comes from in all these undertakings if we can float the shares the moneyll come in quick enough we hold three million dollars of the stock ourselves  six hundred thousand pounds said montague  we take them at par of courseand as we sell we shall pay for them but of course we shall only sell at a premium if we can run them up even to 110 there would be three hundred thousand dollars but well do better than that i must try and see melmotte at once you had better write a letter now  i dont know the man  never mind look here ill write it and you can sign it whereupon mr fisker did write the following letter      langham hotel london march 4 18     dear sir     i have the pleasure of informing you that my partner mr fisker    of fisker montague and montague of san franciscois now in    london with the view of allowing british capitalists to assist in    carrying out perhaps the greatest work of the agenamely the    south central pacific and mexican railway which is to give direct    communication between san francisco and the gulf of mexico he is    very anxious to see you upon his arrival as he is aware that your    cooperation would be desirable we feel assured that with your    matured judgment in such matters you would see at once the    magnificence of the enterprise if you will name a day and an    hour mr fisker will call upon you     i have to thank you and madame melmotte for a very pleasant    evening spent at your house last week     mr fisker proposes returning to new york i shall remain here    superintending the british interests which may be involved     i have the honour to be     dear sir     most faithfully yours   but i have never said that i would superintend the interests said montague  you can say so now it binds you to nothing you regular john bull englishmen are so full of scruples that you lose as much of life as should serve to make an additional fortune  after some further conversation paul montague recopied the letter and signed it he did it with doubtalmost with dismay but he told himself that he could do no good by refusing if this wretched american with his hat on one side and rings on his fingers had so far got the upper hand of pauls uncle as to have been allowed to do what he liked with the funds of the partnership paul could not stop it on the following morning they went up to london together and in the course of the afternoon mr fisker presented himself in abchurch lane the letter written at liverpool but dated from the langham hotel had been posted at the euston square railway station at the moment of fiskers arrival fisker sent in his card and was asked to wait in the course of twenty minutes he was ushered into the great mans presence by no less a person than miles grendall  it has been already said that mr melmotte was a big man with large whiskers rough hair and with an expression of mental power on a harsh vulgar face he was certainly a man to repel you by his presence unless attracted to him by some internal consideration he was magnificent in his expenditure powerful in his doings successful in his business and the world around him therefore was not repelled fisker on the other hand was a shining little manperhaps about forty years of age with a welltwisted moustache greasy brown hair which was becoming bald at the top goodlooking if his features were analysed but insignificant in appearance he was gorgeously dressed with a silk waistcoat and chains and he carried a little stick one would at first be inclined to say that fisker was not much of a man but after a little conversation most men would own that there was something in fisker he was troubled by no shyness by no scruples and by no fears his mind was not capacious but such as it was it was his own and he knew how to use it  abchurch lane is not a grand site for the offices of a merchant prince here at a small corner house there was a small brass plate on a swing door bearing the words melmotte  co of whom the co was composed no one knew in one sense mr melmotte might be said to be in company with all the commercial world for there was no business to which he would refuse his cooperation on certain terms but he had never burdened himself with a partner in the usual sense of the term here fisker found three or four clerks seated at desks and was desired to walk upstairs the steps were narrow and crooked and the rooms were small and irregular here he stayed for a while in a small dark apartment in which the daily telegraph was left for the amusement of its occupant till miles grendall announced to him that mr melmotte would see him the millionaire looked at him for a moment or two just condescending to touch with his fingers the hand which fisker had projected  i dont seem to remember he said the gentleman who has done me the honour of writing to me about you  i dare say not mr melmotte when im at home in san francisco i make acquaintance with a great many gents whom i dont remember afterwards my partner i think told me that he went to your house with his friend sir felix carbury  i know a young man called sir felix carbury  thats it i could have got any amount of introductions to you if i had thought this would not have sufficed mr melmotte bowed our account here in london is kept with the city and west end joint stock but i have only just arrived and as my chief object in coming to london is to see you and as i met my partner mr montague in liverpool i took a note from him and came on straight  and what can i do for you mr fisker  then mr fisker began his account of the great south central pacific and mexican railway and exhibited considerable skill by telling it all in comparatively few words and yet he was gorgeous and florid in two minutes he had displayed his programme his maps and his pictures before mr melmottes eyes taking care that mr melmotte should see how often the names of fisker montague and montague reappeared upon them as mr melmotte read the documents fisker from time to time put in a word but the words had no reference at all to the future profits of the railway or to the benefit which such means of communication would confer upon the world at large but applied solely to the appetite for such stock as theirs which might certainly be produced in the speculating world by a proper manipulation of the affairs  you seem to think you couldnt get it taken up in your own country said melmotte  theres not a doubt about getting it all taken up there our folk sir are quick enough at the game but you dont want them to teach you mr melmotte that nothing encourages this kind of thing like competition when they hear at st louis and chicago that the thing is alive in london theyll be alive there and its the same here sir when they know that the stock is running like wildfire in america theyll make it run here too  how far have you got  what weve gone to work upon is a concession for making the line from the united states congress were to have the land for nothing of course and a grant of one thousand acres round every station the stations to be twentyfive miles apart  and the land is to be made over to youwhen  when we have made the line up to the station fisker understood perfectly that mr melmotte did not ask the question in reference to any value that he might attach to the possession of such lands but to the attractiveness of such a prospectus in the eyes of the outside world of speculators  and what do you want me to do mr fisker  i want to have your name there he said and he placed his finger down on a spot on which it was indicated that there was or was to be a chairman of an english board of directors but with a space for the name hitherto blank  who are to be your directors here mr fisker  we should ask you to choose them sir mr paul montague should be one and perhaps his friend sir felix carbury might be another we could get probably one of the directors of the city and west end but we would leave it all to youas also the amount of stock you would like to take yourself if you gave yourself to it heart and soul mr melmotte it would be the finest thing that there has been out for a long time there would be such a mass of stock  you have to back that with a certain amount of paidup capital  we take care sir in the west not to cripple commerce too closely by oldfashioned bandages look at what weve done already sir by having our limbs pretty free look at our line sir right across the continent from san francisco to new york look at  never mind that mr fisker people wanted to go from new york to san francisco and i dont know that they do want to go to vera cruz but i will look at it and you shall hear from me the interview was over and mr fisker was contented with it had mr melmotte not intended at least to think of it he would not have given ten minutes to the subject after all what was wanted from mr melmotte was little more than his name for the use of which mr fisker proposed that he should receive from the speculative public two or three hundred thousand pounds  at the end of a fortnight from the date of mr fiskers arrival in london the company was fully launched in england with a body of london directors of whom mr melmotte was the chairman among the directors were lord alfred grendall sir felix carbury samuel cohenlupe esq member of parliament for staines a gentleman of the jewish persuasion lord nidderdale who was also in parliament and mr paul montague it may be thought that the directory was not strong and that but little help could be given to any commercial enterprise by the assistance of lord alfred or sir felixbut it was felt that mr melmotte was himself so great a tower of strength that the fortune of the companyas a companywas made     chapter x  mr fiskers success   mr fisker was fully satisfied with the progress he had made but he never quite succeeded in reconciling paul montague to the whole transaction mr melmotte was indeed so great a reality such a fact in the commercial world of london that it was no longer possible for such a one as montague to refuse to believe in the scheme melmotte had the telegraph at his command and had been able to make as close inquiries as though san francisco and salt lake city had been suburbs of london he was chairman of the british branch of the company and had had shares allocated to himor as he said to the houseto the extent of two millions of dollars but still there was a feeling of doubt and a consciousness that melmotte though a tower of strength was thought by many to have been built upon the sands  paul had now of course given his full authority to the work much in opposition to the advice of his old friend roger carburyand had come up to live in town that he might personally attend to the affairs of the great railway there was an office just behind the exchange with two or three clerks and a secretary the latter position being held by miles grendall esq paul who had a conscience in the matter and was keenly alive to the fact that he was not only a director but was also one of the firm of fisker montague and montague which was responsible for the whole affair was grievously anxious to be really at work and would attend most inopportunely at the companys offices fisker who still lingered in london did his best to put a stop to this folly and on more than one occasion somewhat snubbed his partner my dear fellow whats the use of your flurrying yourself in a thing of this kind when it has once been set agoing there is nothing else to do you may have to work your fingers off before you can make it move and then fail but all that has been done for you if you go there on the thursdays thats quite as much as you need do you dont suppose that such a man as melmotte would put up with any real interference paul endeavoured to assert himself declaring that as one of the managers he meant to take a part in the managementthat his fortune such as it was had been embarked in the matter and was as important to him as was mr melmottes fortune to mr melmotte but fisker got the better of him and put him down fortune what fortune had either of us a few beggarly thousands of dollars not worth talking of and barely sufficient to enable a man to look at an enterprise and now where are you look here sirtheres more to be got out of the smashingup of such an affair as this if it should smash up than could be made by years of hard work out of such fortunes as yours and mine in the regular way of trade  paul montague certainly did not love mr fisker personally nor did he relish his commercial doctrines but he allowed himself to be carried away by them when and how was i to have helped myself he wrote to roger carbury the money had been raised and spent before this man came here at all its all very well to say that he had no right to do it but he had done it i couldnt even have gone to law with him without going over to california and then i should have got no redress through it all he disliked fisker and yet fisker had one great merit which certainly recommended itself warmly to montagues appreciation though he denied the propriety of pauls interference in the business he quite acknowledged pauls right to a share in the existing dash of prosperity as to the real facts of the money affairs of the firm he would tell paul nothing but he was well provided with money himself and took care that his partner should be in the same position he paid him all the arrears of his stipulated income up to the present moment and put him nominally into possession of a large number of shares in the railwaywith however an understanding that he was not to sell them till they had reached ten per cent above par and that in any sale transacted he was to touch no other money than the amount of profit which would thus accrue what melmotte was to be allowed to do with his shares he never heard as far as montague could understand melmotte was in truth to be powerful over everything all this made the young man unhappy restless and extravagant he was living in london and had money at command but he never could rid himself of the fear that the whole affair might tumble to pieces beneath his feet and that he might be stigmatised as one among a gang of swindlers  we all know how in such circumstances by far the greater proportion of a mans life will be given up to the enjoyments that are offered to him and the lesser proportion to the cares sacrifices and sorrows had this young director been describing to his intimate friend the condition in which he found himself he would have declared himself to be distracted by doubts suspicions and fears till his life was a burden to him and yet they who were living with him at this time found him to be a very pleasant fellow fond of amusement and disposed to make the most of all the good things which came in his way under the auspices of sir felix carbury he had become a member of the beargarden at which best of all possible clubs the mode of entrance was as irregular as its other proceedings when any young man desired to come in who was thought to be unfit for its style of living it was shown to him that it would take three years before his name could be brought up at the usual rate of vacancies but in regard to desirable companions the committee had a power of putting them at the top of the list of candidates and bringing them in at once paul montague had suddenly become credited with considerable commercial wealth and greater commercial influence he sat at the same board with melmotte and melmottes men and was on this account elected at the beargarden without any of that harassing delay to which other less fortunate candidates are subjected  andlet it be said with regret for paul montague was at heart honest and wellconditionedhe took to living a good deal at the beargarden a man must dine somewhere and everybody knows that a man dines cheaper at his club than elsewhere it was thus he reasoned with himself but pauls dinners at the beargarden were not cheap he saw a good deal of his brother directors sir felix carbury and lord nidderdale entertained lord alfred more than once at the club and had twice dined with his great chairman amidst all the magnificence of merchantprincely hospitality in grosvenor square it had indeed been suggested to him by mr fisker that he also ought to enter himself for the great marie melmotte plate lord nidderdale had again declared his intention of running owing to considerable pressure put upon him by certain interested tradesmen and with this intention had become one of the directors of the mexican railway company at the time however of which we are now writing sir felix was the favourite for the race among fashionable circles generally  the middle of april had come and fisker was still in london when millions of dollars are at stakebelonging perhaps to widows and orphans as fisker remarkeda man was forced to set his own convenience on one side but this devotion was not left without reward for mr fisker had a good time in london he also was made free of the beargarden as an honorary member and he also spent a good deal of money but there is this comfort in great affairs that whatever you spend on yourself can be no more than a trifle champagne and gingerbeer are all the same when you stand to win or lose thousandswith this only difference that champagne may have deteriorating results which the more innocent beverage will not produce the feeling that the greatness of these operations relieved them from the necessity of looking to small expenses operated in the champagne direction both on fisker and montague and the result was deleterious the beargarden no doubt was a more lively place than carbury manor but montague found that he could not wake up on these london mornings with thoughts as satisfactory as those which attended his pillow at the old manor house  on saturday the 19th of april fisker was to leave london on his return to new york and on the 18th a farewell dinner was to be given to him at the club mr melmotte was asked to meet him and on such an occasion all the resources of the club were to be brought forth lord alfred grendall was also to be a guest and mr cohenlupe who went about a good deal with melmotte nidderdale carbury montague and miles grendall were members of the club and gave the dinner no expense was spared herr vossner purveyed the viands and winesand paid for them lord nidderdale took the chair with fisker on his right hand and melmotte on his left and for a fastgoing young lord was supposed to have done the thing well there were only two toasts drunk to the healths of mr melmotte and mr fisker and two speeches were of course made by them mr melmotte may have been held to have clearly proved the genuineness of that english birth which he claimed by the awkwardness and incapacity which he showed on the occasion he stood with his hands on the table and with his face turned to his plate blurted out his assurance that the floating of this railway company would be one of the greatest and most successful commercial operations ever conducted on either side of the atlantic it was a great thinga very great thinghe had no hesitation in saying that it was one of the greatest things out he didnt believe a greater thing had ever come out he was happy to give his humble assistance to the furtherance of so great a thingand so on these assertions not varying much one from the other he jerked out like so many separate interjections endeavouring to look his friends in the face at each and then turning his countenance back to his plate as though seeking for inspiration for the next attempt he was not eloquent but the gentlemen who heard him remembered that he was the great augustus melmotte that he might probably make them all rich men and they cheered him to the echo lord alfred had reconciled himself to be called by his christian name since he had been put in the way of raising two or three hundred pounds on the security of shares which were to be allotted to him but of which in the flesh he had as yet seen nothing wonderful are the ways of trade if one can only get the tip of ones little finger into the right pie what noble morsels what rich esculents will stick to it as it is extracted  when melmotte sat down fisker made his speech and it was fluent fast and florid without giving it word for word which would be tedious i could not adequately set before the readers eye the speakers pleasing picture of worldwide commercial love and harmony which was to be produced by a railway from salt lake city to vera cruz nor explain the extent of gratitude from the world at large which might be claimed by and would finally be accorded to the great firms of melmotte  co of london and fisker montague and montague of san francisco mr fiskers arms were waved gracefully about his head was turned now this way and now that but never towards his plate it was very well done but there was more faith in one ponderous word from mr melmottes mouth than in all the americans oratory  there was not one of them then present who had not after some fashion been given to understand that his fortune was to be made not by the construction of the railway but by the floating of the railway shares they had all whispered to each other their convictions on this head even montague did not beguile himself into an idea that he was really a director in a company to be employed in the making and working of a railway people out of doors were to be advertised into buying shares and they who were so to say indoors were to have the privilege of manufacturing the shares thus to be sold that was to be their work and they all knew it but now as there were eight of them collected together they talked of humanity at large and of the coming harmony of nations  after the first cigar melmotte withdrew and lord alfred went with him lord alfred would have liked to remain being a man who enjoyed tobacco and sodaandbrandybut momentous days had come upon him and he thought well to cling to his melmotte mr samuel cohenlupe also went not having taken a very distinguished part in the entertainment then the young men were left alone and it was soon proposed that they should adjourn to the cardroom it had been rather hoped that fisker would go with the elders nidderdale who did not understand much about the races of mankind had his doubts whether the american gentleman might not be a heathen chinee such as he had read of in poetry but mr fisker liked to have his amusement as well as did the others and went up resolutely into the cardroom here they were joined by lord grasslough and were very quickly at work having chosen loo as their game mr fisker made an allusion to poker as a desirable pastime but lord nidderdale remembering his poetry shook his head oh bother he said lets have some game that christians play mr fisker declared himself ready for any gameirrespective of religious prejudices  it must be explained that the gambling at the beargarden had gone on with very little interruption and that on the whole sir felix carbury kept his luck there had of course been vicissitudes but his star had been in the ascendant for some nights together this had been so continual that mr miles grendall had suggested to his friend lord grasslough that there must be foul play lord grasslough who had not many good gifts was at least not suspicious and repudiated the idea well keep an eye on him miles grendall had said you may do as you like but im not going to watch any one grasslough had replied miles had watched and had watched in vain and it may as well be said at once that sir felix with all his faults was not as yet a blackleg both of them now owed sir felix a considerable sum of money as did also dolly longestaffe who was not present on this occasion latterly very little ready money had passed handsvery little in proportion to the sums which had been written down on paper though sir felix was still so well in funds as to feel himself justified in repudiating any caution that his mother might give him  when ious have for some time passed freely in such a company as that now assembled the sudden introduction of a stranger is very disagreeable particularly when that stranger intends to start for san francisco on the following morning if it could be arranged that the stranger should certainly lose no doubt then he would be regarded as a godsend such strangers have ready money in their pockets a portion of which would be felt to descend like a soft shower in a time of drought when these dealings in unsecured paper have been going on for a considerable time real bank notes come to have a loveliness which they never possessed before but should the stranger win then there may arise complications incapable of any comfortable solution in such a state of things some herr vossner must be called in whose terms are apt to be ruinous on this occasion things did not arrange themselves comfortably from the very commencement fisker won and quite a budget of little papers fell into his possession many of which were passed to him from the hands of sir felixbearing however a g intended to stand for grasslough or an n for nidderdale or a wonderful hieroglyphic which was known at the beargarden to mean d lor dolly longestaffe the fabricator of which was not present on the occasion  then there was the mg of miles grendall which was a species of paper peculiarly plentiful and very unattractive on these commercial occasions paul montague hitherto had never given an iou at the beargardennor of late had our friend sir felix on the present occasion montague won though not heavily sir felix lost continually and was almost the only loser but mr fisker won nearly all that was lost he was to start for liverpool by train at 830 am and at 6 am he counted up his bits of paper and found himself the winner of about £600 i think that most of them came from you sir felix he saidhanding the bundle across the table  i dare say they did but they are all good against these other fellows then fisker with most perfect good humour extracted one from the mass which indicated dolly longestaffes indebtedness to the amount of £50 thats longestaffe said felix and ill change that of course then out of his pocketbook he extracted other minute documents bearing that mg which was so little esteemed among them and so made up the sum you seem to have £150 from grasslough £145 from nidderdale and £322 10s from grendall said the baronet then sir felix got up as though he had paid his score fisker with smiling good humour arranged the little bits of paper before him and looked round upon the company  this wont do you know said nidderdale mr fisker must have his money before he leaves youve got it carbury  of course he has said grasslough  as it happens i have not said sir felixbut what if i had  mr fisker starts for new york immediately said lord nidderdale i suppose we can muster £600 among us ring the bell for vossner i think carbury ought to pay the money as he lost it and we didnt expect to have our ious brought up in this way  lord nidderdale said sir felix i have already said that i have not got the money about me why should i have it more than you especially as i knew i had ious more than sufficient to meet anything i could lose when i sat down  mr fisker must have his money at any rate said lord nidderdale ringing the bell again  it doesnt matter one straw my lord said the american let it be sent to me to frisco in a bill my lord and so he got up to take his hat greatly to the delight of miles grendall  but the two young lords would not agree to this if you must go this very minute ill meet you at the train with the money said nidderdale fisker begged that no such trouble should be taken of course he would wait ten minutes if they wished but the affair was one of no consequence wasnt the post running every day then herr vossner came from his bed suddenly arrayed in a dressinggown and there was a conference in a corner between him the two lords and mr grendall in a very few minutes herr vossner wrote a cheque for the amount due by the lords but he was afraid that he had not money at his bankers sufficient for the greater claim it was well understood that herr vossner would not advance money to mr grendall unless others would pledge themselves for the amount  i suppose id better send you a bill over to america said miles grendall who had taken no part in the matter as long as he was in the same boat with the lords  just so my partner montague will tell you the address then bustling off taking an affectionate adieu of paul shaking hands with them all round and looking as though he cared nothing for the money he took his leave one cheer for the south central pacific and mexican railway he said as he went out of the room not one there had liked fisker his manners were not as their manners his waistcoat not as their waistcoats he smoked his cigar after a fashion different from theirs and spat upon the carpet he said my lord too often and grated their prejudices equally whether he treated them with familiarity or deference but he had behaved well about the money and they felt that they were behaving badly sir felix was the immediate offender as he should have understood that he was not entitled to pay a stranger with documents which by tacit contract were held to be good among themselves but there was no use now in going back to that something must be done  vossner must get the money said nidderdale lets have him up again  i dont think its my fault said miles of course no one thought he was to be called upon in this sort of way  why shouldnt you be called upon said carbury you acknowledge that you owe the money  i think carbury ought to have paid it said grasslough  grassy my boy said the baronet your attempts at thinking are never worth much why was i to suppose that a stranger would be playing among us had you a lot of ready money with you to pay if you had lost it i dont always walk about with six hundred pounds in my pocketnor do you  its no good jawing said nidderdale lets get the money then montague offered to undertake the debt himself saying that there were money transactions between him and his partner but this could not be allowed he had only lately come among them had as yet had no dealing in ious and was the last man in the company who ought to be made responsible for the impecuniosity of miles grendall he the impecunious onethe one whose impecuniosity extended to the absolute want of creditsat silent stroking his heavy moustache  there was a second conference between herr vossner and the two lords in another room which ended in the preparation of a document by which miles grendall undertook to pay to herr vossner £450 at the end of three months and this was endorsed by the two lords by sir felix and by paul montague and in return for this the german produced £322 10s in notes and gold this had taken some considerable time then a cup of tea was prepared and swallowed after which nidderdale with montague started off to meet fisker at the railway station itll only be a trifle over £100 each said nidderdale in the cab  wont mr grendall pay it  oh dear no how the devil should he  then he shouldnt play  thatd be hard on him poor fellow if you went to his uncle the duke i suppose you could get it or buntingford might put it right for you perhaps he might win you know some day and then hed make it square hed be fair enough if he had it poor miles  they found fisker wonderfully brilliant with bright rugs and greatcoats with silk linings weve brought you the tin said nidderdale accosting him on the platform  upon my word my lord im sorry you have taken so much trouble about such a trifle  a man should always have his money when he wins  we dont think anything about such little matters at frisco my lord  youre fine fellows at frisco i dare say here we pay up when we can sometimes we cant and then it is not pleasant fresh adieus were made between the two partners and between the american and the lordand then fisker was taken off on his way towards frisco  hes not half a bad fellow but hes not a bit like an englishman said lord nidderdale as he walked out of the station     chapter xi  lady carbury at home   during the last six weeks lady carbury had lived a life of very mixed depression and elevation her great work had come outthe criminal queensand had been very widely reviewed in this matter it had been by no means all pleasure inasmuch as many very hard words had been said of her in spite of the dear friendship between herself and mr alf one of mr alfs most sharpnailed subordinates had been set upon her book and had pulled it to pieces with almost rabid malignity one would have thought that so slight a thing could hardly have been worthy of such protracted attention error after error was laid bare with merciless prolixity no doubt the writer of the article must have had all history at his fingerends as in pointing out the various mistakes made he always spoke of the historical facts which had been misquoted misdated or misrepresented as being familiar in all their bearings to every schoolboy of twelve years old the writer of the criticism never suggested the idea that he himself having been fully provided with books of reference and having learned the art of finding in them what he wanted at a moments notice had as he went on with his work checked off the blunders without any more permanent knowledge of his own than a housekeeper has of coals when she counts so many sacks into the coalcellar he spoke of the parentage of one wicked ancient lady and the dates of the frailties of another with an assurance intended to show that an exact knowledge of all these details abided with him always he must have been a man of vast and varied erudition and his name was jones the world knew him not but his erudition was always there at the command of mr alfand his cruelty the greatness of mr alf consisted in this that he always had a mr jones or two ready to do his work for him it was a great business this of mr alfs for he had his jones also for philology for science for poetry for politics as well as for history and one special jones extraordinarily accurate and very well posted up in his references entirely devoted to the elizabethan drama  there is the review intended to sell a bookwhich comes out immediately after the appearance of the book or sometimes before it the review which gives reputation but does not affect the sale and which comes a little later the review which snuffs a book out quietly the review which is to raise or lower the author a single peg or two pegs as the case may be the review which is suddenly to make an author and the review which is to crush him an exuberant jones has been known before now to declare aloud that he would crush a man and a selfconfident jones has been known to declare that he has accomplished the deed of all reviews the crushing review is the most popular as being the most readable when the rumour goes abroad that some notable man has been actually crushedbeen positively driven over by an entire juggernauts car of criticism till his literary body be a mere amorphous massthen a real success has been achieved and the alf of the day has done a great thing but even the crushing of a poor lady carbury if it be absolute is effective such a review will not make all the world call for the evening pulpit but it will cause those who do take the paper to be satisfied with their bargain whenever the circulation of such a paper begins to slacken the proprietors should as a matter of course admonish their alf to add a little power to the crushing department  lady carbury had been crushed by the evening pulpit we may fancy that it was easy work and that mr alfs historical mr jones was not forced to fatigue himself by the handling of many books of reference the errors did lie a little near the surface and the whole scheme of the work with its pandering to bad tastes by pretended revelations of frequently fabulous crime was reprobated in mr joness very best manner but the poor authoress though utterly crushed and reduced to little more than literary pulp for an hour or two was not destroyed on the following morning she went to her publishers and was closeted for half an hour with the senior partner mr leadham ive got it all in black and white she said full of the wrong which had been done her and can prove him to be wrong it was in 1522 that the man first came to paris and he couldnt have been her lover before that i got it all out of the biographie universelle ill write to mr alf myselfa letter to be published you know  pray dont do anything of the kind lady carbury  i can prove that im right  and they can prove that youre wrong  ive got all the factsand the figures  mr leadham did not care a straw for facts or figureshad no opinion of his own whether the lady or the reviewer were right but he knew very well that the evening pulpit would surely get the better of any mere author in such a contention never fight the newspapers lady carbury who ever yet got any satisfaction by that kind of thing its their business and you are not used to it  and mr alf my particular friend it does seem so hard said lady carbury wiping hot tears from her cheeks  it wont do us the least harm lady carbury  itll stop the sale  not much a book of that sort couldnt hope to go on very long you know the breakfast table gave it an excellent lift and came just at the right time i rather like the notice in the pulpit myself  like it said lady carbury still suffering in every fibre of her selflove from the soreness produced by those juggernauts carwheels  anything is better than indifference lady carbury a great many people remember simply that the book has been noticed but carry away nothing as to the purport of the review its a very good advertisement  but to be told that i have got to learn the a b c of history after working as i have worked  thats a mere form of speech lady carbury  you think the book has done pretty well  pretty welljust about what we hoped you know  therell be something coming to me mr leadham  mr leadham sent for a ledger and turned over a few pages and ran up a few figures and then scratched his head there would be something but lady carbury was not to imagine that it could be very much it did not often happen that a great deal could be made by a first book nevertheless lady carbury when she left the publishers shop did carry a cheque with her she was smartly dressed and looked very well and had smiled on mr leadham mr leadham too was no more than man and had writtena small cheque  mr alf certainly had behaved badly to her but both mr broune of the breakfast table and mr booker of the literary chronicle had been true to her interests lady carbury had as she promised done mr bookers new tale of a tub in the breakfast table that is she had been allowed as a reward for looking into mr brounes eyes and laying her soft hand on mr brounes sleeve and suggesting to mr broune that no one understood her so well as he did to bedaub mr bookers very thoughtful book in a very thoughtless fashionand to be paid for her work what had been said about his work in the breakfast table had been very distasteful to poor mr booker it grieved his inner contemplative intelligence that such rubbish should be thrown upon him but in his outside experience of life he knew that even the rubbish was valuable and that he must pay for it in the manner to which he had unfortunately become accustomed so mr booker himself wrote the article on the criminal queens in the literary chronicle knowing that what he wrote would also be rubbish remarkable vivacity power of delineating character excellent choice of subject considerable intimacy with the historical details of various periods the literary world would be sure to hear of lady carbury again the composition of the review together with the reading of the book consumed altogether perhaps an hour of mr bookers time he made no attempt to cut the pages but here and there read those that were open he had done this kind of thing so often that he knew well what he was about he could have reviewed such a book when he was three parts asleep when the work was done he threw down his pen and uttered a deep sigh he felt it to be hard upon him that he should be compelled by the exigencies of his position to descend so low in literature but it did not occur to him to reflect that in fact he was not compelled and that he was quite at liberty to break stones or to starve honestly if no other honest mode of carrying on his career was open to him if i didnt somebody else would he said to himself  but the review in the morning breakfast table was the making of lady carburys book as far as it ever was made mr broune saw the lady after the receipt of the letter given in the first chapter of this tale and was induced to make valuable promises which had been fully performed two whole columns had been devoted to the work and the world had been assured that no more delightful mixture of amusement and instruction had ever been concocted than lady carburys criminal queens it was the very book that had been wanted for years it was a work of infinite research and brilliant imagination combined there had been no hesitation in the laying on of the paint at that last meeting lady carbury had been very soft very handsome and very winning mr broune had given the order with good will and it had been obeyed in the same feeling  therefore though the crushing had been very real there had also been some elation and as a net result lady carbury was disposed to think that her literary career might yet be a success mr leadhams cheque had been for a small amount but it might probably lead the way to something better people at any rate were talking about her and her tuesday evenings at home were generally full but her literary life and her literary successes her flirtations with mr broune her business with mr booker and her crushing by mr alfs mr jones were after all but adjuncts to that real inner life of hers of which the absorbing interest was her son and with regard to him too she was partly depressed and partly elated allowing her hopes however to dominate her fears there was very much to frighten her even the moderate reform in the young mans expenses which had been effected under dire necessity had been of late abandoned though he never told her anything she became aware that during the last month of the hunting season he had hunted nearly every day she knew too that he had a horse up in town she never saw him but once in the day when she visited him in his bed about noon and was aware that he was always at his club throughout the night she knew that he was gambling and she hated gambling as being of all pastimes the most dangerous but she knew that he had ready money for his immediate purposes and that two or three tradesmen who were gifted with a peculiar power of annoying their debtors had ceased to trouble her in welbeck street for the present therefore she consoled herself by reflecting that his gambling was successful but her elation sprang from a higher source than this from all that she could hear she thought it likely that felix would carry off the great prize and then should he do thatwhat a blessed son would he have been to her how constantly in her triumph would she be able to forget all his vices his debts his gambling his late hours and his cruel treatment of herself as she thought of it the bliss seemed to be too great for the possibility of realisation she was taught to understand that £10000 a year to begin with would be the least of it and that the ultimate wealth might probably be such as to make sir felix carbury the richest commoner in england in her very heart of hearts she worshipped wealth but desired it for him rather than for herself then her mind ran away to baronies and earldoms and she was lost in the coming glories of the boy whose faults had already nearly engulfed her in his own ruin  and she had another ground for elation which comforted her much though elation from such a cause was altogether absurd she had discovered that her son had become a director of the south central pacific and mexican railway company she must have knownshe certainly did knowthat felix such as he was could not lend assistance by his work to any company or commercial enterprise in the world she was aware that there was some reason for such a choice hidden from the world and which comprised and conveyed a falsehood a ruined baronet of fiveandtwenty every hour of whose life since he had been left to go alone had been loaded with vice and follywhose egregious misconduct warranted his friends in regarding him as one incapable of knowing what principle isof what service could he be that he should be made a director but lady carbury though she knew that he could be of no service was not at all shocked she was now able to speak up a little for her boy and did not forget to send the news by post to roger carbury and her son sat at the same board with mr melmotte what an indication was this of coming triumphs  fisker had started as the reader will perhaps remember on the morning of saturday 19th april leaving sir felix at the club at about seven in the morning all that day his mother was unable to see him she found him asleep in his room at noon and again at two and when she sought him again he had flown but on the sunday she caught him i hope she said youll stay at home on tuesday evening hitherto she had never succeeded in inducing him to grace her evening parties by his presence  all your people are coming you know mother it is such an awful bore  madame melmotte and her daughter will be here  one looks such a fool carrying on that kind of thing in ones own house everybody sees that it has been contrived and it is such a pokey stuffy little place  then lady carbury spoke out her mind felix i think you must be a fool i have given over ever expecting that you would do anything to please me i sacrifice everything for you and i do not even hope for a return but when i am doing everything to advance your own interests when i am working night and day to rescue you from ruin i think you might at any rate help a littlenot for me of course but for yourself  i dont know what you mean by working day and night i dont want you to work day and night  there is hardly a young man in london that is not thinking of this girl and you have chances that none of them have i am told they are going out of town at whitsuntide and that shes to meet lord nidderdale down in the country  she cant endure nidderdale she says so herself  she will do as she is toldunless she can be made to be downright in love with some one like yourself why not ask her at once on tuesday  if im to do it at all i must do it after my own fashion im not going to be driven  of course if you will not take the trouble to be here to see her when she comes to your own house you cannot expect her to think that you really love her  love her what a bother there is about loving wellill look in what time do the animals come to feed  there will be no feeding felix you are so heartless and so cruel that i sometimes think i will make up my mind to let you go your own way and never to speak to you again my friends will be here about teni should say from ten till twelve i think you should be here to receive her not later than ten  if i can get my dinner out of my throat by that time i will come  when the tuesday came the overdriven young man did contrive to get his dinner eaten and his glass of brandy sipped and his cigar smoked and perhaps his game of billiards played so as to present himself in his mothers drawingroom not long after halfpast ten madame melmotte and her daughter were already thereand many others of whom the majority were devoted to literature among them mr alf was in the room and was at this very moment discussing lady carburys book with mr booker he had been quite graciously received as though he had not authorised the crushing lady carbury had given him her hand with that energy of affection with which she was wont to welcome her literary friends and had simply thrown one glance of appeal into his eyes as she looked into his faceas though asking him how he had found it in his heart to be so cruel to one so tender so unprotected so innocent as herself i cannot stand this kind of thing said mr alf to mr booker theres a regular system of touting got abroad and i mean to trample it down  if youre strong enough said mr booker  well i think i am im strong enough at any rate to show that im not afraid to lead the way ive the greatest possible regard for our friend herebut her book is a bad book a thoroughly rotten book an unblushing compilation from halfadozen works of established reputation in pilfering from which she has almost always managed to misapprehend her facts and to muddle her dates then she writes to me and asks me to do the best i can for her i have done the best i could  mr alf knew very well what mr booker had done and mr booker was aware of the extent of mr alfs knowledge what you say is all very right said mr booker only you want a different kind of world to live in  just soand therefore we must make it different i wonder how our friend broune felt when he saw that his critic had declared that the criminal queens was the greatest historical work of modern days  i didnt see the notice there isnt much in the book certainly as far as i have looked at it i should have said that violent censure or violent praise would be equally thrown away upon it one doesnt want to break a butterfly on the wheelespecially a friendly butterfly  as to the friendship it should be kept separate thats my idea said mr alf moving away  ill never forget what youve done for menever said lady carbury holding mr brounes hand for a moment as she whispered to him  nothing more than my duty said he smiling  i hope youll learn to know that a woman can really be grateful she replied then she let go his hand and moved away to some other guest there was a dash of true sincerity in what she had said of enduring gratitude it may be doubtful whether she was capable but at this moment she did feel that mr broune had done much for her and that she would willingly make him some return of friendship of any feeling of another sort of any turn at the moment towards flirtation of any idea of encouragement to a gentleman who had once acted as though he were her lover she was absolutely innocent she had forgotten that little absurd episode in their joint lives she was at any rate too much in earnest at the present moment to think about it but it was otherwise with mr broune he could not quite make up his mind whether the lady was or was not in love with himor whether if she were it was incumbent on him to indulge herand if so in what manner then as he looked after her he told himself that she was certainly very beautiful that her figure was distinguished that her income was certain and her rank considerable nevertheless mr broune knew of himself that he was not a marrying man he had made up his mind that marriage would not suit his business and he smiled to himself as he reflected how impossible it was that such a one as lady carbury should turn him from his resolution  i am so glad that you have come tonight mr alf lady carbury said to the highminded editor of the evening pulpit  am i not always glad to come lady carbury  you are very good but i feared  feared what lady carbury  that you might perhaps have felt that i should be unwilling to welcome you afterwell after the compliments of last thursday  i never allow the two things to join themselves together you see lady carbury i dont write all these things myself  no indeed what a bitter creature you would be if you did  to tell the truth i never write any of them of course we endeavour to get people whose judgments we can trust and if as in this case it should unfortunately happen that the judgment of our critic should be hostile to the literary pretensions of a personal friend of my own i can only lament the accident and trust that my friend may have spirit enough to divide me as an individual from that mr alf who has the misfortune to edit a newspaper  it is because you have so trusted me that i am obliged to you said lady carbury with her sweetest smile she did not believe a word that mr alf had said to her she thought and thought rightly that mr alfs mr jones had taken direct orders from his editor as to his treatment of the criminal queens but she remembered that she intended to write another book and that she might perhaps conquer even mr alf by spirit and courage under her present infliction  it was lady carburys duty on the occasion to say pretty things to everybody and she did her duty but in the midst of it all she was ever thinking of her son and marie melmotte and she did at last venture to separate the girl from her mother marie herself was not unwilling to be talked to by sir felix he had never bullied her had never seemed to scorn her and then he was so beautiful she poor girl bewildered among various suitors utterly confused by the life to which she was introduced troubled by fitful attacks of admonition from her father who would again fitfully leave her unnoticed for a week at a time with no trust in her pseudomotherfor poor marie had in truth been born before her father had been a married man and had never known what was her own mothers fatewith no enjoyment in her present life had come solely to this conclusion that it would be well for her to be taken away somewhere by somebody many a varied phase of life had already come in her way she could just remember the dirty street in the german portion of new york in which she had been born and had lived for the first four years of her life and could remember too the poor hardlytreated woman who had been her mother she could remember being at sea and her sicknessbut could not quite remember whether that woman had been with her then she had run about the streets of hamburg and had sometimes been very hungry sometimes in ragsand she had a dim memory of some trouble into which her father had fallen and that he was away from her for a time she had up to the present splendid moment her own convictions about that absence but she had never mentioned them to a human being then her father had married her present mother in frankfort that she could remember distinctly as also the rooms in which she was then taken to live and the fact that she was told that from henceforth she was to be a jewess but there had soon come another change they went from frankfort to paris and there they were all christians from that time they had lived in various apartments in the french capital but had always lived well sometimes there had been a carriage sometimes there had been none and then there came a time in which she was grown woman enough to understand that her father was being much talked about her father to her had always been alternately capricious and indifferent rather than cross or cruel but just at this period he was cruel both to her and to his wife and madame melmotte would weep at times and declare that they were all ruined then at a moment they burst out into sudden splendour at paris there was an hotel with carriages and horses almost unnumberedand then there came to their rooms a crowd of dark swarthy greasy men who were entertained sumptuously but there were few women at this time marie was hardly nineteen and young enough in manner and appearance to be taken for seventeen suddenly again she was told that she was to be taken to london and the migration had been effected with magnificence she was first taken to brighton where the half of an hotel had been hired and had then been brought to grosvenor square and at once thrown into the matrimonial market no part of her life had been more disagreeable to her more frightful than the first months in which she had been trafficked for by the nidderdales and grassloughs she had been too frightened too much of a coward to object to anything proposed to her but still had been conscious of a desire to have some hand in her own future destiny luckily for her the first attempts at trafficking with the nidderdales and grassloughs had come to nothing and at length she was picking up a little courage and was beginning to feel that it might be possible to prevent a disposition of herself which did not suit her own tastes she was also beginning to think that there might be a disposition of herself which would suit her own tastes  felix carbury was standing leaning against a wall and she was seated on a chair close to him i love you better than anyone in the world he said speaking plainly enough for her to hear perhaps indifferent as to the hearing of others  oh sir felix pray do not talk like that  you knew that before now i want you to say whether you will be my wife  how can i answer that myself papa settles everything  may i go to papa  you may if you like she replied in a very low whisper it was thus that the greatest heiress of the day the greatest heiress of any day if people spoke truly gave herself away to a man without a penny     chapter xii  sir felix in his mothers house   when all her friends were gone lady carbury looked about for her son not expecting to find him for she knew how punctual was his nightly attendance at the beargarden but still with some faint hope that he might have remained on this special occasion to tell her of his fortune she had watched the whispering had noticed the cool effrontery with which felix had spokenfor without hearing the words she had almost known the very moment in which he was askingand had seen the girls timid face and eyes turned to the ground and the nervous twitching of her hands as she replied as a woman understanding such things who had herself been wooed who had at least dreamed of love she had greatly disapproved her sons manner but yet if it might be successful if the girl would put up with lovemaking so slight as that and if the great melmotte would accept in return for his money a title so modest as that of her son how glorious should her son be to her in spite of his indifference  i heard him leave the house before the melmottes went said henrietta when the mother spoke of going up to her sons bedroom  he might have stayed tonight do you think he asked her  how can i say mamma  i should have thought you would have been anxious about your brother i feel sure he didand that she accepted him  if so i hope he will be good to her i hope he loves her  why shouldnt he love her as well as any one else a girl need not be odious because she has money there is nothing disagreeable about her  nonothing disagreeable i do not know that she is especially attractive  who is i dont see anybody specially attractive it seems to me you are quite indifferent about felix  do not say that mamma  yes you are you dont understand all that he might be with this girls fortune and what he must be unless he gets money by marriage he is eating us both up  i wouldnt let him do that mamma  its all very well to say that but i have some heart i love him i could not see him starve think what he might be with £20000 ayear  if he is to marry for that only i cannot think that they will be happy  you had better go to bed henrietta you never say a word to comfort me in all my troubles  then henrietta went to bed and lady carbury absolutely sat up the whole night waiting for her son in order that she might hear his tidings she went up to her room disembarrassed herself of her finery and wrapped herself in a white dressinggown as she sat opposite to her glass relieving her head from its garniture of false hair she acknowledged to herself that age was coming on her she could hide the unwelcome approach by arthide it more completely than can most women of her age but there it was stealing on her with short grey hairs over her ears and around her temples with little wrinkles round her eyes easily concealed by objectionable cosmetics and a look of weariness round the mouth which could only be removed by that selfassertion of herself which practice had made always possible to her in company though it now so frequently deserted her when she was alone  but she was not a woman to be unhappy because she was growing old her happiness like that of most of us was ever in the futurenever reached but always coming she however had not looked for happiness to love and loveliness and need not therefore be disappointed on that score she had never really determined what it was that might make her happyhaving some hazy aspiration after social distinction and literary fame in which was ever commingled solicitude respecting money but at the present moment her great fears and her great hopes were centred on her son she would not care how grey might be her hair or how savage might be mr alf if her felix were to marry this heiress on the other hand nothing that pearlpowder or the morning breakfast table could do would avail anything unless he could be extricated from the ruin that now surrounded him so she went down into the diningroom that she might be sure to hear the key in the door even should she sleep and waited for him with a volume of french memoirs in her hand  unfortunate woman she might have gone to bed and have been duly called about her usual time for it was past eight and the full staring daylight shone into her room when felixs cab brought him to the door the night had been very wretched to her she had slept and the fire had sunk nearly to nothing and had refused to become again comfortable she could not keep her mind to her book and while she was awake the time seemed to be everlasting and then it was so terrible to her that he should be gambling at such hours as these why should he desire to gamble if this girls fortune was ready to fall into his hands fool to risk his health his character his beauty the little money which at this moment of time might be so indispensable to his great project for the chance of winning something which in comparison with marie melmottes money must be despicable but at last he came she waited patiently till he had thrown aside his hat and coat and then she appeared at the diningroom door she had studied her part for the occasion she would not say a harsh word and now she endeavoured to meet him with a smile mother he said you up at this hour his face was flushed and she thought that there was some unsteadiness in his gait she had never seen him tipsy and it would be doubly terrible to her if such should be his condition  i could not go to bed till i had seen you  why not why should you want to see me ill go to bed now therell be plenty of time byandby  is anything the matter felix  matterwhat should be the matter theres been a gentle row among the fellows at the clubthats all i had to tell grasslough a bit of my mind and he didnt like it i didnt mean that he should  there is not going to be any fighting felix  what duelling oh nonothing so exciting as that whether somebody may not have to kick somebody is more than i can say at present you must let me go to bed now for i am about used up  what did marie melmotte say to you  nothing particular and he stood with his hand on the door as he answered her  and what did you say to her  nothing particular good heavens mother do you think that a man is in a condition to talk about such stuff as that at eight oclock in the morning when he has been up all night  if you knew all that i suffer on your behalf you would speak a word to me she said imploring him holding him by the arm and looking into his purple face and bloodshot eyes she was sure that he had been drinking she could smell it in his breath  i must go to the old fellow of course  she told you to go to her father  as far as i remember that was about it of course he means to settle it as he likes i should say that its ten to one against me pulling himself away with some little roughness from his mothers hold he made his way up to his own bedroom occasionally stumbling against the stairs  then the heiress herself had accepted her son if so surely the thing might be done lady carbury recalled to mind her old conviction that a daughter may always succeed in beating a hardhearted parent in a contention about marriage if she be well in earnest but then the girl must be really in earnest and her earnestness will depend on that of her lover in this case however there was as yet no reason for supposing that the great man would object as far as outward signs went the great man had shown some partiality for her son no doubt it was mr melmotte who had made sir felix a director of the great american company felix had also been kindly received in grosvenor square and then sir felix was sir felixa real baronet mr melmotte had no doubt endeavoured to catch this and that lord but failing a lord why should he not content himself with a baronet lady carbury thought that her son wanted nothing but money to make him an acceptable suitor to such a fatherinlaw as mr melmottenot money in the funds not a real fortune not so many thousands ayear that could be settledthe mans own enormous wealth rendered this unnecessary but such a one as mr melmotte would not like outward palpable signs of immediate poverty there should be means enough for present sleekness and present luxury he must have a horse to ride and rings and coats to wear and bright little canes to carry and above all the means of making presents he must not be seen to be poor fortunately most fortunately chance had befriended him lately and had given him some ready money but if he went on gambling chance would certainly take it all away again for aught that the poor mother knew chance might have done so already and then again it was indispensable that he should abandon the habit of playat any rate for the present while his prospects depended on the good opinions of mr melmotte of course such a one as mr melmotte could not like gambling at a club however much he might approve of it in the city why with such a preceptor to help him should not felix learn to do his gambling on the exchange or among the brokers or in the purlieus of the bank lady carbury would at any rate instigate him to be diligent in his position as director of the great mexican railwaywhich position ought to be the beginning to him of a fortune to be made on his own account but what hope could there be for him if he should take to drink would not all hopes be over with mr melmotte should he ever learn that his daughters lover reached home and tumbled upstairs to bed between eight and nine oclock in the morning  she watched for his appearance on the following day and began at once on the subject  do you know felix i think i shall go down to your cousin roger for whitsuntide  to carbury manor said he as he eat some devilled kidneys which the cook had been specially ordered to get for his breakfast i thought you found it so dull that you didnt mean to go there any more  i never said so felix and now i have a great object  what will hetta do  go toowhy shouldnt she  oh i didnt know i thought that perhaps she mightnt like it  i dont see why she shouldnt like it besides everything cant give way to her  has roger asked you  no but im sure hed be pleased to have us if i proposed that we should all go  not me mother  yes you especially  not if i know it mother what on earth should i do at carbury manor  madame melmotte told me last night that they were all going down to caversham to stay three or four days with the longestaffes she spoke of lady pomona as quite her particular friend  ohh that explains it all  explains what felix said lady carbury who had heard of dolly longestaffe and was not without some fear that this projected visit to caversham might have some matrimonial purpose in reference to that delightful young heir  they say at the club that melmotte has taken up old longestaffes affairs and means to put them straight theres an old property in sussex as well as caversham and they say that melmotte is to have that himself theres some bother because dolly who would do anything for anybody else wont join his father in selling so the melmottes are going to caversham  madame melmotte told me so  and the longestaffes are the proudest people in england  of course we ought to be at carbury manor while they are there what can be more natural everybody goes out of town at whitsuntide and why shouldnt we run down to the family place  all very natural if you can manage it mother  and youll come  if marie melmotte goes ill be there at any rate for one day and night said felix  his mother thought that for him the promise had been graciously made     chapter xiii  the longestaffes   mr adolphus longestaffe the squire of caversham in suffolk and of pickering park in sussex was closeted on a certain morning for the best part of an hour with mr melmotte in abchurch lane had there discussed all his private affairs and was about to leave the room with a very dissatisfied air there are menand old men too who ought to know the worldwho think that if they can only find the proper medea to boil the cauldron for them they can have their ruined fortunes so cooked that they shall come out of the pot fresh and new and unembarrassed these great conjurors are generally sought for in the city and in truth the cauldrons are kept boiling though the result of the process is seldom absolute rejuvenescence no greater medea than mr melmotte had ever been potent in money matters and mr longestaffe had been taught to believe that if he could get the necromancer even to look at his affairs everything would be made right for him but the necromancer had explained to the squire that property could not be created by the waving of any wand or the boiling of any cauldron he mr melmotte could put mr longestaffe in the way of realising property without delay of changing it from one shape into another or could find out the real market value of the property in question but he could create nothing you have only a life interest mr longestaffe  no only a life interest that is customary with family estates in this country mr melmotte  just so and therefore you can dispose of nothing else your son of course could join you and then you could sell either one estate or the other  there is no question of selling caversham sir lady pomona and i reside there  your son will not join you in selling the other place  i have not directly asked him but he never does do anything that i wish i suppose you would not take pickering park on a lease for my life  i think not mr longestaffe my wife would not like the uncertainty  then mr longestaffe took his leave with a feeling of outraged aristocratic pride his own lawyer would almost have done as much for him and he need not have invited his own lawyer as a guest to cavershamand certainly not his own lawyers wife and daughter he had indeed succeeded in borrowing a few thousand pounds from the great man at a rate of interest which the great mans head clerk was to arrange and this had been effected simply on the security of the lease of a house in town there had been an ease in this an absence of that delay which generally took place between the expression of his desire for money and the acquisition of itand this had gratified him but he was already beginning to think that he might pay too dearly for that gratification at the present moment too mr melmotte was odious to him for another reason he had condescended to ask mr melmotte to make him a director of the south central pacific and mexican railway and headolphus longestaffe of cavershamhad had his request refused mr longestaffe had condescended very low you have made lord alfred grendall one he had said in a complaining tone then mr melmotte explained that lord alfred possessed peculiar aptitudes for the position im sure i could do anything that he does said mr longestaffe upon this mr melmotte knitting his brows and speaking with some roughness replied that the number of directors required was completed since he had had two duchesses at his house mr melmotte was beginning to feel that he was entitled to bully any mere commoner especially a commoner who could ask him for a seat at his board  mr longestaffe was a tall heavy man about fifty with hair and whiskers carefully dyed whose clothes were made with great care though they always seemed to fit him too tightly and who thought very much of his personal appearance it was not that he considered himself handsome but that he was specially proud of his aristocratic bearing he entertained an idea that all who understood the matter would perceive at a single glance that he was a gentleman of the first water and a man of fashion he was intensely proud of his position in life thinking himself to be immensely superior to all those who earned their bread there were no doubt gentlemen of different degrees but the english gentleman of gentlemen was he who had land and family titledeeds and an old family place and family portraits and family embarrassments and a family absence of any usual employment he was beginning even to look down upon peers since so many men of much less consequence than himself had been made lords and having stood and been beaten three or four times for his county he was of opinion that a seat in the house was rather a mark of bad breeding he was a silly man who had no fixed idea that it behoved him to be of use to any one but yet he had compassed a certain nobility of feeling there was very little that his position called upon him to do but there was much that it forbad him to do it was not allowed to him to be close in money matters he could leave his tradesmens bills unpaid till the men were clamorous but he could not question the items in their accounts he could be tyrannical to his servants but he could not make inquiry as to the consumption of his wines in the servants hall he had no pity for his tenants in regard to game but he hesitated much as to raising their rent he had his theory of life and endeavoured to live up to it but the attempt had hardly brought satisfaction to himself or to his family  at the present moment it was the great desire of his heart to sell the smaller of his two properties and disembarrass the other the debt had not been altogether of his own making and the arrangement would he believed serve his whole family as well as himself it would also serve his son who was blessed with a third property of his own which he had already managed to burden with debt the father could not bear to be refused and he feared that his son would decline but adolphus wants money as much as any one lady pomona had said he had shaken his head and pished and pshawed women never could understand anything about money now he walked down sadly from mr melmottes office and was taken in his brougham to his lawyers chambers in lincolns inn even for the accommodation of those few thousand pounds he was forced to condescend to tell his lawyers that the titledeeds of his house in town must be given up mr longestaffe felt that the world in general was very hard on him  what on earth are we to do with them said sophia the eldest miss longestaffe to her mother  i do think its a shame of papa said georgiana the second daughter i certainly shant trouble myself to entertain them  of course you will leave them all on my hands said lady pomona wearily  but whats the use of having them urged sophia i can understand going to a crush at their house in town when everybody else goes one doesnt speak to them and need not know them afterwards as to the girl im sure i shouldnt remember her if i were to see her  it would be a fine thing if adolphus would marry her said lady pomona  dolly will never marry anybody said georgiana the idea of his taking the trouble of asking a girl to have him besides he wont come down to caversham cartropes wouldnt bring him if that is to be the game mamma it is quite hopeless  why should dolly marry such a creature as that asked sophia  because everybody wants money said lady pomona im sure i dont know what your papa is to do or how it is that there never is any money for anything i dont spend it  i dont think that we do anything out of the way said sophia i havent the slightest idea what papas income is but if were to live at all i dont know how we are to make a change  its always been like this ever since i can remember said georgiana and i dont mean to worry about it any more i suppose its just the same with other people only one doesnt know it  but my dearswhen we are obliged to have such people as these melmottes  as for that if we didnt have them somebody else would i shant trouble myself about them i suppose it will only be for two days  my dear theyre coming for a week  then papa must take them about the country thats all i never did hear of anything so absurd what good can they do papa by being down there  he is wonderfully rich said lady pomona  but i dont suppose hell give papa his money continued georgiana of course i dont pretend to understand but i think there is more fuss about these things than they deserve if papa hasnt got money to live at home why doesnt he go abroad for a year the sidney beauchamps did that and the girls had quite a nice time of it in florence it was there that clara beauchamp met young lord liffey i shouldnt at all mind that kind of thing but i think it quite horrible to have these sort of people brought down upon us at caversham no one knows who they are or where they came from or what theyll turn to so spoke georgiana who among the longestaffes was supposed to have the strongest head and certainly the sharpest tongue  this conversation took place in the drawingroom of the longestaffes family townhouse in bruton street it was not by any means a charming house having but few of those luxuries and elegancies which have been added of late years to newlybuilt london residences it was gloomy and inconvenient with large drawingrooms bad bedrooms and very little accommodation for servants but it was the old family townhouse having been inhabited by three or four generations of longestaffes and did not savour of that radical newness which prevails and which was peculiarly distasteful to mr longestaffe queens gate and the quarters around were according to mr longestaffe devoted to opulent tradesmen even belgrave square though its aristocratic properties must be admitted still smelt of the mortar many of those living there and thereabouts had never possessed in their families real family townhouses the old streets lying between piccadilly and oxford street one or two wellknown localities to the south and north of these boundaries were the proper sites for these habitations when lady pomona instigated by some friend of high rank but questionable taste had once suggested a change to eaton square mr longestaffe had at once snubbed his wife if bruton street wasnt good enough for her and the girls then they might remain at caversham the threat of remaining at caversham had been often made for mr longestaffe proud as he was of his townhouse was from year to year very anxious to save the expense of the annual migration the girls dresses and the girls horses his wifes carriage and his own brougham his dull london dinnerparties and the one ball which it was always necessary that lady pomona should give made him look forward to the end of july with more dread than to any other period it was then that he began to know what that years season would cost him but he had never yet been able to keep his family in the country during the entire year the girls who as yet knew nothing of the continent beyond paris had signified their willingness to be taken about germany and italy for twelve months but had shown by every means in their power that they would mutiny against any intention on their fathers part to keep them at caversham during the london season  georgiana had just finished her strongminded protest against the melmottes when her brother strolled into the room dolly did not often show himself in bruton street he had rooms of his own and could seldom even be induced to dine with his family his mother wrote to him notes without endnotes every day pressing invitations of all sorts upon him would he come and dine would he take them to the theatre would he go to this ball would he go to that eveningparty these dolly barely read and never answered he would open them thrust them into some pocket and then forget them consequently his mother worshipped him and even his sisters who were at any rate superior to him in intellect treated him with a certain deference he could do as he liked and they felt themselves to be slaves bound down by the dulness of the longestaffe regime his freedom was grand to their eyes and very enviable although they were aware that he had already so used it as to impoverish himself in the midst of his wealth  my dear adolphus said the mother this is so nice of you  i think it is rather nice said dolly submitting himself to be kissed  oh dolly whoever would have thought of seeing you said sophia  give him some tea said his mother lady pomona was always having tea from four oclock till she was taken away to dress for dinner  id sooner have soda and brandy said dolly  my darling boy  i didnt ask for it and i dont expect to get it indeed i dont want it i only said id sooner have it than tea wheres the governor they all looked at him with wondering eyes there must be something going on more than they had dreamed of when dolly asked to see his father  papa went out in the brougham immediately after lunch said sophia gravely  ill wait a little for him said dolly taking out his watch  do stay and dine with us said lady pomona  i could not do that because ive got to go and dine with some fellow  some fellow i believe you dont know where youre going said georgiana  my fellow knows at least hes a fool if he dont  adolphus began lady pomona very seriously ive got a plan and i want you to help me  i hope there isnt very much to do in it mother  were all going to caversham just for whitsuntide and we particularly want you to come  by george no i couldnt do that  you havent heard half madame melmotte and her daughter are coming  the d they are ejaculated dolly  dolly said sophia do remember where you are  yes i willand ill remember too where i wont be i wont go to caversham to meet old mother melmotte  my dear boy continued the mother do you know that miss melmotte will have twenty thousand a year the day she marries and that in all probability her husband will some day be the richest man in europe  half the fellows in london are after her said dolly  why shouldnt you be one of them she isnt going to stay in the same house with half the fellows in london suggested georgiana if youve a mind to try it youll have a chance which nobody else can have just at present  but i havent any mind to try it good gracious meoh dear it isnt at all in my way mother  i knew he wouldnt said georgiana  it would put everything so straight said lady pomona  theyll have to remain crooked if nothing else will put them straight theres the governor i heard his voice now for a row then mr longestaffe entered the room  my dear said lady pomona heres adolphus come to see us the father nodded his head at his son but said nothing we want him to stay and dine but hes engaged  though he doesnt know where said sophia  my fellow knowshe keeps a book ive got a letter sir ever so long from those fellows in lincolns inn they want me to come and see you about selling something so ive come its an awful bore because i dont understand anything about it perhaps there isnt anything to be sold if so i can go away again you know  youd better come with me into the study said the father we neednt disturb your mother and sisters about business then the squire led the way out of the room and dolly followed making a woeful grimace at his sisters the three ladies sat over their tea for about halfanhour waitingnot the result of the conference for with that they did not suppose that they would be made acquaintedbut whatever signs of good or evil might be collected from the manner and appearance of the squire when he should return to them dolly they did not expect to see againprobably for a month he and the squire never did come together without quarrelling and careless as was the young man in every other respect he had hitherto been obdurate as to his own rights in any dealings which he had with his father at the end of the halfhour mr longestaffe returned to the drawingroom and at once pronounced the doom of the family my dear he said we shall not return from caversham to london this year he struggled hard to maintain a grand dignified tranquillity as he spoke but his voice quivered with emotion  papa screamed sophia  my dear you dont mean it said lady pomona  of course papa doesnt mean it said georgiana rising to her feet  i mean it accurately and certainly said mr longestaffe we go to caversham in about ten days and we shall not return from caversham to london this year  our ball is fixed said lady pomona  then it must be unfixed so saying the master of the house left the drawingroom and descended to his study  the three ladies when left to deplore their fate expressed their opinions as to the sentence which had been pronounced very strongly but the daughters were louder in their anger than was their mother  he cant really mean it said sophia  he does said lady pomona with tears in her eyes  he must unmean it againthats all said georgiana dolly has said something to him very rough and he resents it upon us why did he bring us up at all if he means to take us down before the season has begun  i wonder what adolphus has said to him your papa is always hard upon adolphus  dolly can take care of himself said georgiana and always does do so dolly does not care for us  not a bit said sophia  ill tell you what you must do mamma you mustnt stir from this at all you must give up going to caversham altogether unless he promises to bring us back i wont stirunless he has me carried out of the house  my dear i couldnt say that to him  then i will to go and be buried down in that place for a whole year with no one near us but the rusty old bishop and mr carbury who is rustier still i wont stand it there are some sort of things that one ought not to stand if you go down i shall stay up with the primeros mrs primero would have me i know it wouldnt be nice of course i dont like the primeros i hate the primeros oh yesits quite true i know that as well as you sophia they are vulgar but not half so vulgar mamma as your friend madame melmotte  thats illnatured georgiana she is not a friend of mine  but youre going to have her down at caversham i cant think what made you dream of going to caversham just now knowing as you do how hard papa is to manage  everybody has taken to going out of town at whitsuntide my dear  no mamma everybody has not people understand too well the trouble of getting up and down for that the primeros arent going down i never heard of such a thing in all my life what does he expect is to become of us if he wants to save money why doesnt he shut caversham up altogether and go abroad caversham costs a great deal more than is spent in london and its the dullest house i think in all england  the family party in bruton street that evening was not very gay nothing was being done and they sat gloomily in each others company whatever mutinous resolutions might be formed and carried out by the ladies of the family they were not brought forward on that occasion the two girls were quite silent and would not speak to their father and when he addressed them they answered simply by monosyllables lady pomona was ill and sat in a corner of a sofa wiping her eyes to her had been imparted upstairs the purport of the conversation between dolly and his father dolly had refused to consent to the sale of pickering unless half the produce of the sale were to be given to him at once when it had been explained to him that the sale would be desirable in order that the caversham property might be freed from debt which caversham property would eventually be his he replied that he also had an estate of his own which was a little mortgaged and would be the better for money the result seemed to be that pickering could not be soldand as a consequence of that mr longestaffe had determined that there should be no more london expenses that year  the girls when they got up to go to bed bent over him and kissed his head as was their custom there was very little show of affection in the kiss you had better remember that what you have to do in town must be done this week he said they heard the words but marched in stately silence out of the room without deigning to notice them     chapter xiv  carbury manor   i dont think it quite nice mamma thats all of course if you have made up your mind to go i must go with you  what on earth can be more natural than that you should go to your own cousins house  you know what i mean mamma  its done now my dear and i dont think there is anything at all in what you say this little conversation arose from lady carburys announcement to her daughter of her intention of soliciting the hospitality of carbury manor for the whitsun week it was very grievous to henrietta that she should be taken to the house of a man who was in love with her even though he was her cousin but she had no escape she could not remain in town by herself nor could she even allude to her grievance to any one but her mother lady carbury in order that she might be quite safe from opposition had posted the following letter to her cousin before she spoke to her daughter      welbeck street 24th april 18     my dear roger     we know how kind you are and how sincere and that if what i am    going to propose doesnt suit youll say so at once i have been    working very hard too hard indeed and i feel that nothing will do    me so much real good as getting into the country for a day or two    would you take us for a part of whitsun week we would come down    on the 20th may and stay over the sunday if you would keep us    felix says he would run down though he would not trouble you for    so long a time as we talk of staying     im sure you must have been glad to hear of his being put upon    that great american railway board as a director it opens a new    sphere of life to him and will enable him to prove that he can    make himself useful i think it was a great confidence to place in    one so young     of course you will say so at once if my little proposal interferes    with any of your plans but you have been so very very kind to us    that i have no scruple in making it     henrietta joins with me in kind love     your affectionate cousin     matilda carbury   there was much in this letter that disturbed and even annoyed roger carbury in the first place he felt that henrietta should not be brought to his house much as he loved her dear as her presence to him always was he hardly wished to have her at carbury unless she would come with a resolution to be its future mistress in one respect he did lady carbury an injustice he knew that she was anxious to forward his suit and he thought that henrietta was being brought to his house with that object he had not heard that the great heiress was coming into his neighbourhood and therefore knew nothing of lady carburys scheme in that direction he was too disgusted by the illfounded pride which the mother expressed at her sons position as a director roger carbury did not believe in the railway he did not believe in fisker nor in melmotte and certainly not in the board generally paul montague had acted in opposition to his advice in yielding to the seductions of fisker the whole thing was to his mind false fraudulent and ruinous of what nature could be a company which should have itself directed by such men as lord alfred grendall and sir felix carbury and then as to their great chairman did not everybody know in spite of all the duchesses that mr melmotte was a gigantic swindler although there was more than one immediate cause for bitterness between them roger loved paul montague well and could not bear with patience the appearance of his friends name on such a list and now he was asked for warm congratulations because sir felix carbury was one of the board he did not know which to despise most sir felix for belonging to such a board or the board for having such a director new sphere of life he said to himself the only proper sphere for them all would be newgate  and there was another trouble he had asked paul montague to come to carbury for this special week and paul had accepted the invitation with the constancy which was perhaps his strongest characteristic he clung to his old affection for the man he could not bear the idea of a permanent quarrel though he knew that there must be a quarrel if the man interfered with his dearest hopes he had asked him down to carbury intending that the name of henrietta carbury should not be mentioned between themand now it was proposed to him that henrietta carbury should be at the manor house at the very time of pauls visit he made up his mind at once that he must tell paul not to come  he wrote his two letters at once that to lady carbury was very short he would be delighted to see her and henrietta at the time namedand would be very glad should it suit felix to come also he did not say a word about the board or the young mans probable usefulness in his new sphere of life to montague his letter was longer it is always best to be open and true he said since you were kind enough to say that you would come to me lady carbury has proposed to visit me just at the same time and to bring her daughter after what has passed between us i need hardly say that i could not make you both welcome here together it is not pleasant to me to have to ask you to postpone your visit but i think you will not accuse me of a want of hospitality towards you paul wrote back to say that he was sure that there was no want of hospitality and that he would remain in town  suffolk is not especially a picturesque county nor can it be said that the scenery round carbury was either grand or beautiful but there were little prettinesses attached to the house itself and the grounds around it which gave it a charm of its own the carbury river so called though at no place is it so wide but that an active schoolboy might jump across itruns or rather creeps into the waveney and in its course is robbed by a moat which surrounds carbury manor house the moat has been rather a trouble to the proprietors and especially so to roger as in these days of sanitary considerations it has been felt necessary either to keep it clean with at any rate moving water in it or else to fill it up and abolish it altogether that plan of abolishing it had to be thought of and was seriously discussed about ten years since but then it was decided that such a proceeding would altogether alter the character of the house would destroy the gardens and would create a waste of mud all round the place which it would take years to beautify or even to make endurable and then an important question had been asked by an intelligent farmer who had long been a tenant on the property fill un oopeh eh sooner said than doone squoire where be the stoof to come from the squire therefore had given up that idea and instead of abolishing his moat had made it prettier than ever the high road from bungay to beccles ran close to the houseso close that the gable ends of the building were separated from it only by the breadth of the moat a short private road not above a hundred yards in length led to the bridge which faced the front door the bridge was old and high with sundry architectural pretensions and guarded by iron gates in the centre which however were very rarely closed between the bridge and the front door there was a sweep of ground just sufficient for the turning of a carriage and on either side of this the house was brought close to the water so that the entrance was in a recess or irregular quadrangle of which the bridge and moat formed one side at the back of the house there were large gardens screened from the road by a wall ten feet high in which there were yew trees and cypresses said to be of wonderful antiquity the gardens were partly inside the moat but chiefly beyond them and were joined by two bridges a foot bridge and one with a carriage wayand there was another bridge at the end of the house furthest from the road leading from the back door to the stables and farmyard  the house itself had been built in the time of charles ii when that which we call tudor architecture was giving way to a cheaper less picturesque though perhaps more useful form but carbury manor house through the whole county had the reputation of being a tudor building the windows were long and for the most part low made with strong mullions and still contained small oldfashioned panes for the squire had not as yet gone to the expense of plate glass there was one high bow window which belonged to the library and which looked out on to the gravel sweep at the left of the front door as you entered it all the other chief rooms faced upon the garden the house itself was built of a stone that had become buff or almost yellow with years and was very pretty it was still covered with tiles as were all the attached buildings it was only two stories high except at the end where the kitchens were placed and the offices which thus rose above the other part of the edifice the rooms throughout were low and for the most part long and narrow with large wide fireplaces and deep wainscotings taking it altogether one would be inclined to say that it was picturesque rather than comfortable such as it was its owner was very proud of itwith a pride of which he never spoke to any one which he endeavoured studiously to conceal but which had made itself known to all who knew him well the houses of the gentry around him were superior to his in material comfort and general accommodation but to none of them belonged that thoroughly established look of old county position which belonged to carbury bundlesham where the primeros lived was the finest house in that part of the county but it looked as if it had been built within the last twenty years it was surrounded by new shrubs and new lawns by new walls and new outhouses and savoured of tradeso at least thought roger carbury though he never said the words caversham was a very large mansion built in the early part of george iiis reign when men did care that things about them should be comfortable but did not care that they should be picturesque there was nothing at all to recommend caversham but its size eardly park the seat of the hepworths had as a park some pretensions carbury possessed nothing that could be called a park the enclosures beyond the gardens being merely so many home paddocks but the house of eardly was ugly and bad the bishops palace was an excellent gentlemans residence but then that too was comparatively modern and had no peculiar features of its own now carbury manor house was peculiar and in the eyes of its owner was preeminently beautiful  it often troubled him to think what would come of the place when he was gone he was at present forty years old and was perhaps as healthy a man as you could find in the whole county those around who had known him as he grew into manhood among them especially the farmers of the neighbourhood still regarded him as a young man they spoke of him at the county fairs as the young squire when in his happiest moods he could be almost a boy and he still had something of oldfashioned boyish reverence for his elders but of late there had grown up a great care within his breasta care which does not often perhaps in these days bear so heavily on mens hearts as it used to do he had asked his cousin to marry himhaving assured himself with certainty that he did love her better than any other womanand she had declined she had refused him more than once and he believed her implicitly when she told him that she could not love him he had a way of believing people especially when such belief was opposed to his own interests and had none of that selfconfidence which makes a man think that if opportunity be allowed him he can win a woman even in spite of herself but if it were fated that he should not succeed with henrietta thenso he felt assuredno marriage would now be possible to him in that case he must look out for an heir and could regard himself simply as a stopgap among the carburys in that case he could never enjoy the luxury of doing the best he could with the property in order that a son of his own might enjoy it  now sir felix was the next heir roger was hampered by no entail and could leave every acre of the property as he pleased in one respect the natural succession to it by sir felix would generally be considered fortunate it had happened that a title had been won in a lower branch of the family and were this succession to take place the family title and the family property would go together no doubt to sir felix himself such an arrangement would seem to be the most proper thing in the worldas it would also to lady carbury were it not that she looked to carbury manor as the future home of another child but to all this the present owner of the property had very strong objections it was not only that he thought ill of the baronet himself so ill as to feel thoroughly convinced that no good could come from that quarterbut he thought ill also of the baronetcy itself sir patrick to his thinking had been altogether unjustifiable in accepting an enduring title knowing that he would leave behind him no property adequate for its support a baronet so thought roger carbury should be a rich man rich enough to grace the rank which he assumed to wear a title according to rogers doctrine on such subjects could make no man a gentleman but if improperly worn might degrade a man who would otherwise be a gentleman he thought that a gentleman born and bred acknowledged as such without doubt could not be made more than a gentleman by all the titles which the queen could give with these oldfashioned notions roger hated the title which had fallen upon a branch of his family he certainly would not leave his property to support the title which sir felix unfortunately possessed but sir felix was the natural heir and this man felt himself constrained almost as by some divine law to see that his land went by natural descent though he was in no degree fettered as to its disposition he did not presume himself to have more than a life interest in the estate it was his duty to see that it went from carbury to carbury as long as there was a carbury to hold it and especially his duty to see that it should go from his hands at his death unimpaired in extent or value there was no reason why he should himself die for the next twenty or thirty yearsbut were he to die sir felix would undoubtedly dissipate the acres and then there would be an end of carbury but in such case he roger carbury would at any rate have done his duty he knew that no human arrangements can be fixed let the care in making them be ever so great to his thinking it would be better that the estate should be dissipated by a carbury than held together by a stranger he would stick to the old name while there was one to bear it and to the old family while a member of it was left so thinking he had already made his will leaving the entire property to the man whom of all others he most despised should he himself die without child  in the afternoon of the day on which lady carbury was expected he wandered about the place thinking of all this how infinitely better it would be that he should have an heir of his own how wonderfully beautiful would the world be to him if at last his cousin would consent to be his wife how wearily insipid must it be if no such consent could be obtained from her and then he thought much of her welfare too in very truth he did not like lady carbury he saw through her character judging her with almost absolute accuracy the woman was affectionate seeking good things for others rather than for herself but she was essentially worldly believing that good could come out of evil that falsehood might in certain conditions be better than truth that shams and pretences might do the work of true service that a strong house might be built upon the sand it was lamentable to him that the girl he loved should be subjected to this teaching and live in an atmosphere so burdened with falsehood would not the touch of pitch at last defile her in his heart of hearts he believed that she loved paul montague and of paul himself he was beginning to fear evil what but a sham could be a man who consented to pretend to sit as one of a board of directors to manage an enormous enterprise with such colleagues as lord alfred grendall and sir felix carbury under the absolute control of such a one as mr augustus melmotte was not this building a house upon the sand with a vengeance what a life it would be for henrietta carbury were she to marry a man striving to become rich without labour and without capital and who might one day be wealthy and the next a beggara city adventurer who of all men was to him the vilest and most dishonest he strove to think well of paul montague but such was the life which he feared the young man was preparing for himself  then he went into the house and wandered up through the rooms which the two ladies were to occupy as their host a host without a wife or mother or sister it was his duty to see that things were comfortable but it may be doubted whether he would have been so careful had the mother been coming alone in the smaller room of the two the hangings were all white and the room was sweet with may flowers and he brought a white rose from the hothouse and placed it in a glass on the dressing table surely she would know who put it there then he stood at the open window looking down upon the lawn gazing vacantly for half an hour till he heard the wheels of the carriage before the front door during that halfhour he resolved that he would try again as though there had as yet been no repulse     chapter xv you should remember that i am his mother   this is so kind of you said lady carbury grasping her cousins hand as she got out of the carriage  the kindness is on your part said roger  i felt so much before i dared to ask you to take us but i did so long to get into the country and i do so love carbury andand  where should a carbury go to escape from london smoke but to the old house i am afraid henrietta will find it dull  oh no said hetta smiling you ought to remember that i am never dull in the country  the bishop and mrs yeld are coming here to dine tomorrowand the hepworths  i shall be so glad to meet the bishop once more said lady carbury  i think everybody must be glad to meet him he is such a dear good fellow and his wife is just as good and there is another gentleman coming whom you have never seen  a new neighbour  yesa new neighbourfather john barham who has come to beccles as priest he has got a little cottage about a mile from here in this parish and does duty both at beccles and bungay i used to know something of his family  he is a gentleman then  certainly he is a gentleman he took his degree at oxford and then became what we call a pervert and what i suppose they call a convert he has not got a shilling in the world beyond what they pay him as a priest which i take it amounts to about as much as the wages of a day labourer he told me the other day that he was absolutely forced to buy secondhand clothes  how shocking said lady carbury holding up her hands  he didnt seem to be at all shocked at telling it we have got to be quite friends  will the bishop like to meet him  why should not the bishop like to meet him ive told the bishop all about him and the bishop particularly wishes to know him he wont hurt the bishop but you and hetta will find it very dull  i shant find it dull mr carbury said henrietta  it was to escape from the eternal parties that we came down here said lady carbury  she had nevertheless been anxious to hear what guests were expected at the manor house sir felix had promised to come down on saturday with the intention of returning on monday and lady carbury had hoped that some visiting might be arranged between caversham and the manor house so that her son might have the full advantage of his closeness to marie melmotte  i have asked the longestaffes for monday said roger  they are down here then  i think they arrived yesterday there is always a flustering breeze in the air and a perturbation generally through the county when they come or go and i think i perceived the effects about four in the afternoon they wont come i dare say  why not  they never do they have probably a house full of guests and they know that my accommodation is limited ive no doubt theyll ask us on tuesday or wednesday and if you like we will go  i know they are to have guests said lady carbury  what guests  the melmottes are coming to them lady carbury as she made the announcement felt that her voice and countenance and selfpossession were failing her and that she could not mention the thing as she would any matter that was indifferent to her  the melmottes coming to caversham said roger looking at henrietta who blushed with shame as she remembered that she had been brought into her lovers house solely in order that her brother might have an opportunity of seeing marie melmotte in the country  oh yesmadame melmotte told me i take it they are very intimate  mr longestaffe ask the melmottes to visit him at caversham  why not  i should almost as soon have believed that i myself might have been induced to ask them here  i fancy roger that mr longestaffe does want a little pecuniary assistance  and he condescends to get it in this way i suppose it will make no difference soon whom one knows and whom one doesnt things arent as they were of course and never will be again perhaps its all for the betteri wont say it isnt but i should have thought that such a man as mr longestaffe might have kept such another man as mr melmotte out of his wifes drawingroom henrietta became redder than ever even lady carbury flushed up as she remembered that roger carbury knew that she had taken her daughter to madame melmottes ball he thought of this himself as soon as the words were spoken and then tried to make some half apology i dont approve of them in london you know but i think they are very much worse in the country  then there was a movement the ladies were shown into their rooms and roger again went out into the garden he began to feel that he understood it all lady carbury had come down to his house in order that she might be near the melmottes there was something in this which he felt it difficult not to resent it was for no love of him that she was there he had felt that henrietta ought not to have been brought to his house but he could have forgiven that because her presence there was a charm to him he could have forgiven that even while he was thinking that her mother had brought her there with the object of disposing of her if it were so the mothers object would be the same as his own and such a manoeuvre he could pardon though he could not approve his selflove had to some extent been gratified but now he saw that he and his house had been simply used in order that a vile project of marrying two vile people to each other might be furthered  as he was thinking of all this lady carbury came out to him in the garden she had changed her travelling dress and made herself pretty as she well knew how to do and now she dressed her face in her sweetest smiles her mind also was full of the melmottes and she wished to explain to her stern unbending cousin all the good that might come to her and hers by an alliance with the heiress i can understand roger she said taking his arm that you should not like those people  what people  the melmottes  i dont dislike them how should i dislike people that i never saw i dislike those who seek their society simply because they have the reputation of being rich  meaning me  no not meaning you i dont dislike you as you know very well though i do dislike the fact that you should run after these people i was thinking of the longestaffes then  do you suppose my friend that i run after them for my own gratification do you think that i go to their house because i find pleasure in their magnificence or that i follow them down here for any good that they will do me  i would not follow them at all  i will go back if you bid me but i must first explain what i mean you know my sons conditionbetter i fear than he does himself roger nodded assent to this but said nothing what is he to do the only chance for a young man in his position is that he should marry a girl with money he is goodlooking you cant deny that  nature has done enough for him  we must take him as he is he was put into the army very young and was very young when he came into possession of his own small fortune he might have done better but how many young men placed in such temptations do well as it is he has nothing left  i fear not  and therefore is it not imperative that he should marry a girl with money  i call that stealing a girls money lady carbury  oh roger how hard you are  a man must be hard or softwhich is best  with women i think that a little softness has the most effect i want to make you understand this about the melmottes it stands to reason that the girl will not marry felix unless she loves him  but does he love her  why should he not is a girl to be debarred from being loved because she has money of course she looks to be married and why should she not have felix if she likes him best cannot you sympathise with my anxiety so to place him that he shall not be a disgrace to the name and to the family  we had better not talk about the family lady carbury  but i think so much about it  you will never get me to say that i think the family will be benefited by a marriage with the daughter of mr melmotte i look upon him as dirt in the gutter to me in my oldfashioned way all his money if he has it can make no difference when there is a question of marriage people at any rate should know something of each other who knows anything of this man who can be sure that she is his daughter  he would give her her fortune when she married  yes it all comes to that men say openly that he is an adventurer and a swindler no one pretends to think that he is a gentleman there is a consciousness among all who speak of him that he amasses his money not by honest trade but by unknown tricks as does a cardsharper he is one whom we would not admit into our kitchens much less to our tables on the score of his own merits but because he has learned the art of making money we not only put up with him but settle upon his carcase as so many birds of prey  do you mean that felix should not marry the girl even if they love each other  he shook his head in disgust feeling sure that any idea of love on the part of the young man was a sham and a pretence not only as regarded him but also his mother he could not quite declare this and yet he desired that she should understand that he thought so i have nothing more to say about it he continued had it gone on in london i should have said nothing it is no affair of mine when i am told that the girl is in the neighbourhood at such a house as caversham and that felix is coming here in order that he may be near to his prey and when i am asked to be a party to the thing i can only say what i think your son would be welcome to my house because he is your son and my cousin little as i approve his mode of life but i could have wished that he had chosen some other place for the work that he has on hand  if you wish it roger we will return to london i shall find it hard to explain to hettabut we will go  no i certainly do not wish that  but you have said such hard things how are we to stay you speak of felix as though he were all bad she looked at him hoping to get from him some contradiction of this some retractation some kindly word but it was what he did think and he had nothing to say she could bear much she was not delicate as to censure implied or even expressed she had endured rough usage before and was prepared to endure more had he found fault with herself or with henrietta she would have put up with it for the sake of benefits to comewould have forgiven it the more easily because perhaps it might not have been deserved but for her son she was prepared to fight if she did not defend him who would i am grieved roger that we should have troubled you with our visit but i think that we had better go you are very harsh and it crushes me  i have not meant to be harsh  you say that felix is seeking for hisprey and that he is to be brought here to be nearhis prey what can be more harsh than that at any rate you should remember that i am his mother  she expressed her sense of injury very well roger began to be ashamed of himself and to think that he had spoken unkind words and yet he did not know how to recall them if i have hurt you i regret it much  of course you have hurt me i think i will go in now how very hard the world is i came here thinking to find peace and sunshine and there has come a storm at once  you asked me about the melmottes and i was obliged to speak you cannot think that i meant to offend you they walked on in silence till they had reached the door leading from the garden into the house and here he stopped her if i have been over hot with you let me beg your pardon she smiled and bowed but her smile was not one of forgiveness and then she essayed to pass on into the house pray do not speak of going lady carbury  i think i will go to my room now my head aches so that i can hardly stand  it was late in the afternoonabout sixand according to his daily custom he should have gone round to the offices to see his men as they came from their work but he stood still for a few moments on the spot where lady carbury had left him and went slowly across the lawn to the bridge and there seated himself on the parapet could it really be that she meant to leave his house in anger and to take her daughter with her was it thus that he was to part with the one human being in the world that he loved he was a man who thought much of the duties of hospitality feeling that a man in his own house was bound to exercise a courtesy towards his guests sweeter softer more gracious than the world required elsewhere and of all guests those of his own name were the best entitled to such courtesy at carbury he held the place in trust for the use of others but if there were one among all others to whom the house should be a house of refuge from care not an abode of trouble on whose behalf were it possible he would make the very air softer and the flowers sweeter than their wont to whom he would declare were such words possible to his tongue that of him and of his house and of all things there she was the mistress whether she would condescend to love him or nothat one was his cousin hetta and now he had been told by his guest that he had been so rough to her that she and her daughter must return to london  and he could not acquit himself he knew that he had been rough he had said very hard words it was true that he could not have expressed his meaning without hard words nor have repressed his meaning without selfreproach but in his present mood he could not comfort himself by justifying himself she had told him that he ought to have remembered that felix was her son and as she spoke she had acted well the part of an outraged mother his heart was so soft that though he knew the woman to be false and the son to be worthless he utterly condemned himself look where he would there was no comfort when he had sat half an hour upon the bridge he turned towards the house to dress for dinnerand to prepare himself for an apology if any apology might be accepted at the door standing in the doorway as though waiting for him he met his cousin hetta she had on her bosom the rose he had placed in her room and as he approached her he thought that there was more in her eyes of graciousness towards him than he had ever seen there before  mr carbury she said mamma is so unhappy  i fear that i have offended her  it is not that but that you should be soso angry about felix  i am vexed with myself that i have vexed hermore vexed than i can tell you  she knows how good you are  no im not i was very bad just now she was so offended with me that she talked of going back to london he paused for her to speak but hetta had no words ready for the moment i should be wretched indeed if you and she were to leave my house in anger  i do not think she will do that  and you  i am not angry i should never dare to be angry with you i only wish that felix would be better they say that young men have to be bad and that they do get to be better as they grow older he is something in the city now a director they call him and mamma thinks that the work will be of service to him roger could express no hope in this direction or even look as though he approved of the directorship i dont see why he should not try at any rate  dear hetta i only wish he were like you  girls are so different you know  it was not till late in the evening long after dinner that he made his apology in form to lady carbury but he did make it and at last it was accepted i think i was rough to you talking about felix he saidand i beg your pardon  you were energetic that was all  a gentleman should never be rough to a lady and a man should never be rough to his own guests i hope you will forgive me she answered him by putting out her hand and smiling on him and so the quarrel was over  lady carbury understood the full extent of her triumph and was enabled by her disposition to use it thoroughly felix might now come down to carbury and go over from thence to caversham and prosecute his wooing and the master of carbury could make no further objection and felix if he would come would not now be snubbed roger would understand that he was constrained to courtesy by the former severity of his language such points as these lady carbury never missed he understood it too and though he was soft and gracious in his bearing endeavouring to make his house as pleasant as he could to his two guests he felt that he had been cheated out of his undoubted right to disapprove of all connection with the melmottes in the course of the evening there came a noteor rather a bundle of notesfrom caversham that addressed to roger was in the form of a letter lady pomona was sorry to say that the longestaffe party were prevented from having the pleasure of dining at carbury hall by the fact that they had a house full of guests lady pomona hoped that mr carbury and his relatives who lady pomona heard were with him at the hall would do the longestaffes the pleasure of dining at caversham either on the monday or tuesday following as might best suit the carbury plans that was the purport of lady pomonas letter to roger carbury then there were cards of invitation for lady carbury and her daughter and also for sir felix  roger as he read his own note handed the others over to lady carbury and then asked her what she would wish to have done the tone of his voice as he spoke grated on her ear as there was something in it of his former harshness but she knew how to use her triumph i should like to go she said  i certainly shall not go he replied but there will be no difficulty whatever in sending you over you must answer at once because their servant is waiting  monday will be best she said that is if nobody is coming here  there will be nobody here  i suppose i had better say that i and hettaand felix will accept their invitation  i can make no suggestion said roger thinking how delightful it would be if henrietta could remain with him how objectionable it was that henrietta should be taken to caversham to meet the melmottes poor hetta herself could say nothing she certainly did not wish to meet the melmottes nor did she wish to dine alone with her cousin roger  that will be best said lady carbury after a moments thought it is very good of you to let us go and to send us  of course you will do here just as you please he replied but there was still that tone in his voice which lady carbury feared a quarter of an hour later the caversham servant was on his way home with two lettersthe one from roger expressing his regret that he could not accept lady pomonas invitation and the other from lady carbury declaring that she and her son and daughter would have great pleasure in dining at caversham on the monday     chapter xvi  the bishop and the priest   the afternoon on which lady carbury arrived at her cousins house had been very stormy roger carbury had been severe and lady carbury had suffered under his severityor had at least so well pretended to suffer as to leave on rogers mind a strong impression that he had been cruel to her she had then talked of going back at once to london and when consenting to remain had remained with a very bad feminine headache she had altogether carried her point but had done so in a storm the next morning was very calm that question of meeting the melmottes had been settled and there was no need for speaking of them again roger went out by himself about the farm immediately after breakfast having told the ladies that they could have the waggonette when they pleased im afraid youll find it tiresome driving about our lanes he said lady carbury assured him that she was never dull when left alone with books just as he was starting he went into the garden and plucked a rose which he brought to henrietta he only smiled as he gave it her and then went his way he had resolved that he would say nothing to her of his suit till monday if he could prevail with her then he would ask her to remain with him when her mother and brother would be going out to dine at caversham she looked up into his face as she took the rose and thanked him in a whisper she fully appreciated the truth and honour and honesty of his character and could have loved him so dearly as her cousin if he would have contented himself with such cousinly love she was beginning within her heart to take his side against her mother and brother and to feel that he was the safest guide that she could have but how could she be guided by a lover whom she did not love  i am afraid my dear we shall have a bad time of it here said lady carbury  why so mamma  it will be so dull your cousin is the best friend in all the world and would make as good a husband as could be picked out of all the gentlemen of england but in his present mood with me he is not a comfortable host what nonsense he did talk about the melmottes  i dont suppose mamma that mr and mrs melmotte can be nice people  why shouldnt they be as nice as anybody else pray henrietta dont let us have any of that nonsense from you when it comes from the superhuman virtue of poor dear roger it has to be borne but i beg that you will not copy him  mamma i think that is unkind  and i shall think it very unkind if you take upon yourself to abuse people who are able and willing to set poor felix on his legs a word from you might undo all that we are doing  what word  what word any word if you have any influence with your brother you should use it in inducing him to hurry this on i am sure the girl is willing enough she did refer him to her father  then why does he not go to mr melmotte  i suppose he is delicate about it on the score of money if roger could only let it be understood that felix is the heir to this place and that some day he will be sir felix carbury of carbury i dont think there would be any difficulty even with old melmotte  how could he do that mamma  if your cousin were to die as he is now it would be so your brother would be his heir  you should not think of such a thing mamma  why do you dare to tell me what i am to think am i not to think of my own son is he not to be dearer to me than any one and what i say is so if roger were to die tomorrow he would be sir felix carbury of carbury  but mamma he will live and have a family why should he not  you say he is so old that you will not look at him  i never said so when we were joking i said he was old you know i did not mean that he was too old to get married men a great deal older get married every day  if you dont accept him he will never marry he is a man of that kind so stiff and stubborn and oldfashioned that nothing will change him he will go on boodying over it till he will become an old misanthrope if you would take him i would be quite contented you are my child as well as felix but if you mean to be obstinate i do wish that the melmottes should be made to understand that the property and title and name of the place will all go together it will be so and why should not felix have the advantage  who is to say it  ahthats where it is roger is so violent and prejudiced that one cannot get him to speak rationally  oh mammayou wouldnt suggest it to himthat this place is to go to felix when heis dead  it would not kill him a day sooner  you would not dare to do it mamma  i would dare to do anything for my children but you need not look like that henrietta i am not going to say anything to him of the kind he is not quick enough to understand of what infinite service he might be to us without in any way hurting himself henrietta would fain have answered that their cousin was quick enough for anything but was by far too honest to take part in such a scheme as that proposed she refrained however and was silent there was no sympathy on the matter between her and her mother she was beginning to understand the tortuous mazes of manoeuvres in which her mothers mind had learned to work and to dislike and almost to despise them but she felt it to be her duty to abstain from rebukes  in the afternoon lady carbury alone had herself driven into beccles that she might telegraph to her son you are to dine at caversham on monday come on saturday if you can she is there lady carbury had many doubts as to the wording of this message the female in the office might too probably understand who was the she who was spoken of as being at caversham and might understand also the project and speak of it publicly but then it was essential that felix should know how great and certain was the opportunity afforded to him he had promised to come on saturday and return on mondayand unless warned would too probably stick to his plan and throw over the longestaffes and their dinnerparty again if he were told to come simply for the monday he would throw over the chance of wooing her on the sunday it was lady carburys desire to get him down for as long a period as was possible and nothing surely would so tend to bring him and to keep him as a knowledge that the heiress was already in the neighbourhood then she returned and shut herself up in her bedroom and worked for an hour or two at a paper which she was writing for the breakfast table nobody should ever accuse her justly of idleness and afterwards as she walked by herself round and round the garden she revolved in her mind the scheme of a new book whatever might happen she would persevere if the carburys were unfortunate their misfortunes should come from no fault of hers henrietta passed the whole day alone she did not see her cousin from breakfast till he appeared in the drawingroom before dinner but she was thinking of him during every minute of the dayhow good he was how honest how thoroughly entitled to demand at any rate kindness at her hand her mother had spoken of him as of one who might be regarded as all but dead and buried simply because of his love for her could it be true that his constancy was such that he would never marry unless she would take his hand she came to think of him with more tenderness than she had ever felt before but yet she would not tell herself she loved him it might perhaps be her duty to give herself to him without loving himbecause he was so good but she was sure that she did not love him  in the evening the bishop came and his wife mrs yeld and the hepworths of eardly and father john barham the beccles priest the party consisted of eight which is perhaps the best number for a mixed gathering of men and women at a dinnertableespecially if there be no mistress whose prerogative and duty it is to sit opposite to the master in this case mr hepworth faced the giver of the feast the bishop and the priest were opposite to each other and the ladies graced the four corners roger though he spoke of such things to no one turned them over much in his mind believing it to be the duty of a host to administer in all things to the comfort of his guests in the drawingroom he had been especially courteous to the young priest introducing him first to the bishop and his wife and then to his cousins henrietta watched him through the whole evening and told herself that he was a very mirror of courtesy in his own house she had seen it all before no doubt but she had never watched him as she now watched him since her mother had told her that he would die wifeless and childless because she would not be his wife and the mother of his children  the bishop was a man sixty years of age very healthy and handsome with hair just becoming grey clear eyes a kindly mouth and something of a double chin he was all but six feet high with a broad chest large hands and legs which seemed to have been made for clerical breeches and clerical stockings he was a man of fortune outside his bishopric and as he never went up to london and had no children on whom to spend his money he was able to live as a nobleman in the country he did live as a nobleman and was very popular among the poor around him he was idolized and by such clergy of his diocese as were not enthusiastic in their theology either on the one side or on the other he was regarded as a model bishop by the very high and the very lowby those rather who regarded ritualism as being either heavenly or devilishhe was looked upon as a timeserver because he would not put to sea in either of those boats he was an unselfish man who loved his neighbour as himself and forgave all trespasses and thanked god for his daily bread from his heart and prayed heartily to be delivered from temptation but i doubt whether he was competent to teach a creedor even to hold one if it be necessary that a man should understand and define his creed before he can hold it whether he was free from or whether he was scared by any inward misgivings who shall say if there were such he never whispered a word of them even to the wife of his bosom from the tone of his voice and the look of his eye you would say that he was unscathed by that agony which doubt on such a matter would surely bring to a man so placed and yet it was observed of him that he never spoke of his faith or entered into arguments with men as to the reasons on which he had based it he was diligent in preachingmoral sermons that were short pithy and useful he was never weary in furthering the welfare of his clergymen his house was open to them and to their wives the edifice of every church in his diocese was a care to him he laboured at schools and was zealous in improving the social comforts of the poor but he was never known to declare to man or woman that the human soul must live or die for ever according to its faith perhaps there was no bishop in england more loved or more useful in his diocese than the bishop of elmham  a man more antagonistic to the bishop than father john barham the lately appointed roman catholic priest at beccles it would be impossible to conceiveand yet they were both eminently good men father john was not above five feet nine in height but so thin so meagre so wasted in appearance that unless when he stooped he was taken to be tall he had thick dark brown hair which was cut short in accordance with the usage of his church but which he so constantly ruffled by the action of his hands that though short it seemed to be wild and uncombed in his younger days when long locks straggled over his forehead he had acquired a habit while talking energetically of rubbing them back with his finger which he had not since dropped in discussions he would constantly push back his hair and then sit with his hand fixed on the top of his head he had a high broad forehead enormous blue eyes a thin long nose cheeks very thin and hollow a handsome large mouth and a strong square chin he was utterly without worldly means except those which came to him from the ministry of his church and which did not suffice to find him food and raiment but no man ever lived more indifferent to such matters than father john barham he had been the younger son of an english country gentleman of small fortune had been sent to oxford that he might hold a family living and on the eve of his ordination had declared himself a roman catholic his family had resented this bitterly but had not quarrelled with him till he had drawn a sister with him when banished from the house he had still striven to achieve the conversion of other sisters by his letters and was now absolutely an alien from his fathers heart and care but of this he never complained it was a part of the plan of his life that he should suffer for his faith had he been able to change his creed without incurring persecution worldly degradation and poverty his own conversion would not have been to him comfortable and satisfactory as it was he considered that his father as a protestantand in his mind protestant and heathen were all the samehad been right to quarrel with him but he loved his father and was endless in prayer wearying his saints with supplications that his father might see the truth and be as he was  to him it was everything that a man should believe and obeythat he should abandon his own reason to the care of another or of others and allow himself to be guided in all things by authority faith being sufficient and of itself all in all moral conduct could be nothing to a man except as a testimony of faith for to him whose belief was true enough to produce obedience moral conduct would certainly be added the dogmas of his church were to father barham a real religion and he would teach them in season and out of season always ready to commit himself to the task of proving their truth afraid of no enemy not even fearing the hostility which his perseverance would create he had but one duty before himto do his part towards bringing over the world to his faith it might be that with the toil of his whole life he should convert but one that he should but half convert one that he should do no more than disturb the thoughts of one so that future conversion might be possible but even that would be work done he would sow the seed if it might be so but if it were not given to him to do that he would at any rate plough the ground  he had come to beccles lately and roger carbury had found out that he was a gentleman by birth and education roger had found out also that he was very poor and had consequently taken him by the hand the young priest had not hesitated to accept his neighbours hospitality having on one occasion laughingly protested that he should be delighted to dine at carbury as he was much in want of a dinner he had accepted presents from the garden and the poultry yard declaring that he was too poor to refuse anything the apparent frankness of the man about himself had charmed roger and the charm had not been seriously disturbed when father barham on one winter evening in the parlour at carbury had tried his hand at converting his host i have the most thorough respect for your religion roger had said but it would not suit me the priest had gone on with his logic if he could not sow the seed he might plough the ground this had been repeated two or three times and roger had begun to feel it to be disagreeable but the man was in earnest and such earnestness commanded respect and roger was quite sure that though he might be bored he could not be injured by such teaching then it occurred to him one day that he had known the bishop of elmham intimately for a dozen years and had never heard from the bishops mouthexcept when in the pulpita single word of religious teaching whereas this man who was a stranger to him divided from him by the very fact of his creed was always talking to him about his faith roger carbury was not a man given to much deep thinking but he felt that the bishops manner was the pleasanter of the two  lady carbury at dinner was all smiles and pleasantness no one looking at her or listening to her could think that her heart was sore with many troubles she sat between the bishop and her cousin and was skilful enough to talk to each without neglecting the other she had known the bishop before and had on one occasion spoken to him of her soul the first tone of the good mans reply had convinced her of her error and she never repeated it to mr alf she commonly talked of her mind to mr broune of her heart to mr booker of her bodyand its wants she was quite ready to talk of her soul on a proper occasion but she was much too wise to thrust the subject even on a bishop now she was full of the charms of carbury and its neighbourhood yes indeed said the bishop i think suffolk is a very nice county and as we are only a mile or two from norfolk ill say as much for norfolk too its an ill bird that fouls its own nest  i like a county in which there is something left of county feeling said lady carbury staffordshire and warwickshire cheshire and lancashire have become great towns and have lost all local distinctions  we still keep our name and reputation said the bishop silly suffolk  but that was never deserved  as much perhaps as other general epithets i think we are a sleepy people weve got no coal you see and no iron we have no beautiful scenery like the lake countryno rivers great for fishing like scotlandno hunting grounds like the shires  partridges pleaded lady carbury with pretty energy  yes we have partridges fine churches and the herring fishery we shall do very well if too much is not expected of us we cant increase and multiply as they do in the great cities  i like this part of england so much the best for that very reason what is the use of a crowded population  the earth has to be peopled lady carbury  oh yes said her ladyship with some little reverence added to her voice feeling that the bishop was probably adverting to a divine arrangement the world must be peopled but for myself i like the country better than the town  so do i said roger and i like suffolk the people are hearty and radicalism is not quite so rampant as it is elsewhere the poor people touch their hats and the rich people think of the poor there is something left among us of old english habits  that is so nice said lady carbury  something left of old english ignorance said the bishop all the same i dare say were improving like the rest of the world what beautiful flowers you have here mr carbury at any rate we can grow flowers in suffolk  mrs yeld the bishops wife was sitting next to the priest and was in truth somewhat afraid of her neighbour she was perhaps a little stauncher than her husband in protestantism and though she was willing to admit that mr barham might not have ceased to be a gentleman when he became a roman catholic priest she was not quite sure that it was expedient for her or her husband to have much to do with him mr carbury had not taken them unawares notice had been given that the priest was to be there and the bishop had declared that he would be very happy to meet the priest but mrs yeld had had her misgivings she never ventured to insist on her opinion after the bishop had expressed his but she had an idea that right was right and wrong wrongand that roman catholics were wrong and therefore ought to be put down and she thought also that if there were no priests there would be no roman catholics mr barham was no doubt a man of good family which did make a difference  mr barham always made his approaches very gradually the taciturn humility with which he commenced his operations was in exact proportion to the enthusiastic volubility of his advanced intimacy mrs yeld thought that it became her to address to him a few civil words and he replied to her with a shamefaced modesty that almost overcame her dislike to his profession she spoke of the poor of beccles being very careful to allude only to their material position there was too much beer drunk no doubt and the young women would have finery where did they get the money to buy those wonderful bonnets which appeared every sunday mr barham was very meek and agreed to everything that was said no doubt he had a plan ready formed for inducing mrs yeld to have mass said regularly within her husbands palace but he did not even begin to bring it about on this occasion it was not till he made some apparently chance allusion to the superior churchattending qualities of our people that mrs yeld drew herself up and changed the conversation by observing that there had been a great deal of rain lately  when the ladies were gone the bishop at once put himself in the way of conversation with the priest and asked questions as to the morality of beccles it was evidently mr barhams opinion that his people were more moral than other people though very much poorer but the irish always drink said mr hepworth  not so much as the english i think said the priest and you are not to suppose that we are all irish of my flock the greater proportion are english  it is astonishing how little we know of our neighbours said the bishop of course i am aware that there are a certain number of persons of your persuasion round about us indeed i could give the exact number in this diocese but in my own immediate neighbourhood i could not put my hand upon any families which i know to be roman catholic  it is not my lord because there are none  of course not it is because as i say i do not know my neighbours  i think here in suffolk they must be chiefly the poor said mr hepworth  they were chiefly the poor who at first put their faith in our saviour said the priest  i think the analogy is hardly correctly drawn said the bishop with a curious smile we were speaking of those who are still attached to an old creed our saviour was the teacher of a new religion that the poor in the simplicity of their hearts should be the first to acknowledge the truth of a new religion is in accordance with our idea of human nature but that an old faith should remain with the poor after it has been abandoned by the rich is not so easily intelligible  the roman population still believed said carbury when the patricians had learned to regard their gods as simply useful bugbears  the patricians had not ostensibly abandoned their religion the people clung to it thinking that their masters and rulers clung to it also  the poor have ever been the salt of the earth my lord said the priest  that begs the whole question said the bishop turning to his host and beginning to talk about a breed of pigs which had lately been imported into the palace sties father barham turned to mr hepworth and went on with his argument or rather began another it was a mistake to suppose that the catholics in the county were all poor there were the a s and the b s and the c s and the d s he knew all their names and was proud of their fidelity to him these faithful ones were really the salt of the earth who would some day be enabled by their fidelity to restore england to her pristine condition the bishop had truly said that of many of his neighbours he did not know to what church they belonged but father barham though he had not as yet been twelve months in the county knew the name of nearly every roman catholic within its borders  your priest is a very zealous man said the bishop afterwards to roger carbury and i do not doubt but that he is an excellent gentleman but he is perhaps a little indiscreet  i like him because he is doing the best he can according to his lights without any reference to his own worldly welfare  that is all very grand and i am perfectly willing to respect him but i do not know that i should care to talk very freely in his company  i am sure he would repeat nothing  perhaps not but he would always be thinking that he was going to get the best of me  i dont think it answers said mrs yeld to her husband as they went home of course i dont want to be prejudiced but protestants are protestants and roman catholics are roman catholics  you may say the same of liberals and conservatives but you wouldnt have them decline to meet each other  it isnt quite the same my dear after all religion is religion  it ought to be said the bishop  of course i dont mean to put myself up against you my dear but i dont know that i want to meet mr barham again  i dont know that i do either said the bishop but if he comes in my way i hope i shall treat him civilly     chapter xvii  marie melmotte hears a love tale   on the following morning there came a telegram from felix he was to be expected at beccles on that afternoon by a certain train and roger at lady carburys request undertook to send a carriage to the station for him this was done but felix did not arrive there was still another train by which he might come so as to be just in time for dinner if dinner were postponed for half an hour lady carbury with a tender look almost without speaking a word appealed to her cousin on behalf of her son he knit his brows as he always did involuntarily when displeased but he assented then the carriage had to be sent again now carriages and carriagehorses were not numerous at carbury the squire kept a waggonette and a pair of horses which when not wanted for house use were employed about the farm he himself would walk home from the train leaving the luggage to be brought by some cheap conveyance he had already sent the carriage once on this dayand now sent it again lady carbury having said a word which showed that she hoped that this would be done but he did it with deep displeasure to the mother her son was sir felix the baronet entitled to special consideration because of his position and rankbecause also of his intention to marry the great heiress of the day to roger carbury felix was a vicious young man peculiarly antipathetic to himself to whom no respect whatever was due nevertheless the dinner was put off and the waggonette was sent but the waggonette again came back empty that evening was spent by roger lady carbury and henrietta in very much gloom  about four in the morning the house was roused by the coming of the baronet failing to leave town by either of the afternoon trains he had contrived to catch the evening mail and had found himself deposited at some distant town from which he had posted to carbury roger came down in his dressinggown to admit him and lady carbury also left her room sir felix evidently thought that he had been a very fine fellow in going through so much trouble roger held a very different opinion and spoke little or nothing oh felix said the mother you have so terrified us  i can tell you i was terrified myself when i found that i had to come fifteen miles across the country with a pair of old jades who could hardly get up a trot  but why didnt you come by the train you named  i couldnt get out of the city said the baronet with a ready lie  i suppose you were at the board to this felix made no direct answer roger knew that there had been no board mr melmotte was in the country and there could be no board nor could sir felix have had business in the city it was sheer impudencesheer indifference and into the bargain a downright lie the young man who was of himself so unwelcome who had come there on a project which he roger utterly disapprovedwho had now knocked him and his household up at four oclock in the morninghad uttered no word of apology miserable cub roger muttered between his teeth then he spoke aloud you had better not keep your mother standing here i will show you your room  all right old fellow said sir felix im awfully sorry to disturb you all in this way i think ill just take a drop of brandy and soda before i go to bed though this was another blow to roger  i doubt whether we have sodawater in the house and if we have i dont know where to get it i can give you some brandy if you will come with me he pronounced the word brandy in a tone which implied that it was a wicked dissipated beverage it was a wretched work to roger he was forced to go upstairs and fetch a key in order that he might wait upon this cubthis cur he did it however and the cub drank his brandyandwater not in the least disturbed by his hosts illhumour as he went to bed he suggested the probability of his not showing himself till lunch on the following day and expressed a wish that he might have breakfast sent to him in bed he is born to be hung said roger to himself as he went to his roomand hell deserve it  on the following morning being sunday they all went to churchexcept felix lady carbury always went to church when she was in the country never when she was at home in london it was one of those moral habits like early dinners and long walks which suited country life and she fancied that were she not to do so the bishop would be sure to know it and would be displeased she liked the bishop she liked bishops generally and was aware that it was a womans duty to sacrifice herself for society as to the purpose for which people go to church it had probably never in her life occurred to lady carbury to think of it on their return they found sir felix smoking a cigar on the gravel path close in front of the open drawingroom window  felix said his cousin take your cigar a little farther you are filling the house with tobacco  oh heavenswhat a prejudice said the baronet  let it be so but still do as i ask you sir felix chucked the cigar out of his mouth on to the gravel walk whereupon roger walked up to the spot and kicked the offending weed away this was the first greeting of the day between the two men  after lunch lady carbury strolled about with her son instigating him to go over at once to caversham how the deuce am i to get there  your cousin will lend you a horse  hes as cross as a bear with a sore head hes a deal older than i am and a cousin and all that but im not going to put up with insolence if it were anywhere else i should just go into the yard and ask if i could have a horse and saddle as a matter of course  roger has not a great establishment  i suppose he has a horse and saddle and a man to get it ready i dont want anything grand  he is vexed because he sent twice to the station for you yesterday  i hate the kind of fellow who is always thinking of little grievances such a man expects you to go like clockwork and because you are not wound up just as he is he insults you i shall ask him for a horse as i would any one else and if he does not like it he may lump it about half an hour after this he found his cousin can i have a horse to ride over to caversham this afternoon he said  our horses never go out on sunday said roger then he added after a pause you can have it ill give the order sir felix would be gone on tuesday and it should be his own fault if that odious cousin ever found his way into carbury house again so he declared to himself as felix rode out of the yard but he soon remembered how probable it was that felix himself would be the owner of carbury and should it ever come to passas still was possiblethat henrietta should be the mistress of carbury he could hardly forbid her to receive her brother he stood for a while on the bridge watching his cousin as he cantered away upon the road listening to the horses feet the young man was offensive in every possible way who does not know that ladies only are allowed to canter their friends horses upon roads a gentleman trots his horse and his friends horse roger carbury had but one saddle horsea favourite old hunter that he loved as a friend and now this dear old friend whose legs probably were not quite so good as they once were was being galloped along the hard road by that odious cub soda and brandy roger exclaimed to himself almost aloud thinking of the discomfiture of that early morning hell die some day of delirium tremens in a hospital  before the longestaffes left london to receive their new friends the melmottes at caversham a treaty had been made between mr longestaffe the father and georgiana the strongminded daughter the daughter on her side undertook that the guests should be treated with feminine courtesy this might be called the mostfavourednation clause the melmottes were to be treated exactly as though old melmotte had been a gentleman and madame melmotte a lady in return for this the longestaffe family were to be allowed to return to town but here again the father had carried another clause the prolonged sojourn in town was to be only for six weeks on the 10th of july the longestaffes were to be removed into the country for the remainder of the year when the question of a foreign tour was proposed the father became absolutely violent in his refusal in gods name where do you expect the money is to come from when georgiana urged that other people had money to go abroad her father told her that a time was coming in which she might think it lucky if she had a house over her head this however she took as having been said with poetical licence the same threat having been made more than once before the treaty was very clear and the parties to it were prepared to carry it out with fair honesty the melmottes were being treated with decent courtesy and the house in town was not dismantled  the idea hardly ever in truth entertained but which had been barely suggested from one to another among the ladies of the family that dolly should marry marie melmotte had been abandoned dolly with all his vapid folly had a will of his own which among his own family was invincible he was never persuaded to any course either by his father or mother dolly certainly would not marry marie melmotte therefore when the longestaffes heard that sir felix was coming to the country they had no special objection to entertaining him at caversham he had been lately talked of in london as the favourite in regard to marie melmotte georgiana longestaffe had a grudge of her own against lord nidderdale and was on that account somewhat well inclined towards sir felixs prospects soon after the melmottes arrival she contrived to say a word to marie respecting sir felix there is a friend of yours going to dine here on monday miss melmotte marie who was at the moment still abashed by the grandeur and size and general fashionable haughtiness of her new acquaintances made hardly any answer i think you know sir felix carbury continued georgiana  oh yes we know sir felix carbury  he is coming down to his cousins i suppose it is for your bright eyes as carbury manor would hardly be just what he would like  i dont think he is coming because of me said marie blushing she had once told him that he might go to her father which according to her idea had been tantamount to accepting his offer as far as her power of acceptance went since that she had seen him indeed but he had not said a word to press his suit nor as far as she knew had he said a word to mr melmotte but she had been very rigorous in declining the attentions of other suitors she had made up her mind that she was in love with felix carbury and she had resolved on constancy but she had begun to tremble fearing his faithlessness  we had heard said georgiana that he was a particular friend of yours and she laughed aloud with a vulgarity which madame melmotte certainly could not have surpassed  sir felix on the sunday afternoon found all the ladies out on the lawn and he also found mr melmotte there at the last moment lord alfred grendall had been askednot because he was at all in favour with any of the longestaffes but in order that he might be useful in disposing of the great director lord alfred was used to him and could talk to him and might probably know what he liked to eat and drink therefore lord alfred had been asked to caversham and lord alfred had come having all his expenses paid by the great director when sir felix arrived lord alfred was earning his entertainment by talking to mr melmotte in a summerhouse he had cool drink before him and a box of cigars but was probably thinking at the time how hard the world had been to him lady pomona was languid but not uncivil in her reception she was doing her best to perform her part of the treaty in reference to madame melmotte sophia was walking apart with a certain mr whitstable a young squire in the neighbourhood who had been asked to caversham because as sophia was now reputed to be twentyeightthey who decided the question might have said thirtyone without falsehood it was considered that mr whitstable was good enough or at least as good as could be expected sophia was handsome but with a big cold unalluring handsomeness and had not quite succeeded in london georgiana had been more admired and boasted among her friends of the offers which she had rejected her friends on the other hand were apt to tell of her many failures nevertheless she held her head up and had not as yet come down among the rural whitstables at the present moment her hands were empty and she was devoting herself to such a performance of the treaty as should make it impossible for her father to leave his part of it unfulfilled  for a few minutes sir felix sat on a garden chair making conversation to lady pomona and madame melmotte beautiful garden he said for myself i dont much care for gardens but if one is to live in the country this is the sort of thing that one would like  delicious said madame melmotte repressing a yawn and drawing her shawl higher round her throat it was the end of may and the weather was very warm for the time of the year but in her heart of hearts madame melmotte did not like sitting out in the garden  it isnt a pretty place but the house is comfortable and we make the best of it said lady pomona  plenty of glass i see said sir felix if one is to live in the country i like that kind of thing carbury is a very poor place  there was offence in thisas though the carbury property and the carbury position could be compared to the longestaffe property and the longestaffe position though dreadfully hampered for money the longestaffes were great people for a small place said lady pomona i think carbury is one of the nicest in the county of course it is not extensive  no by jove said sir felix you may say that lady pomona its like a prison to me with that moat round it then he jumped up and joined marie melmotte and georgiana georgiana glad to be released for a time from performance of the treaty was not long before she left them together she had understood that the two horses now in the running were lord nidderdale and sir felix and though she would not probably have done much to aid sir felix she was quite willing to destroy lord nidderdale  sir felix had his work to do and was willing to do itas far as such willingness could go with him the prize was so great and the comfort of wealth was so sure that even he was tempted to exert himself it was this feeling which had brought him into suffolk and induced him to travel all night across dirty roads in an old cab for the girl herself he cared not the least it was not in his power really to care for anybody he did not dislike her much he was not given to disliking people strongly except at the moments in which they offended him he regarded her simply as the means by which a portion of mr melmottes wealth might be conveyed to his uses in regard to feminine beauty he had his own ideas and his own inclinations he was by no means indifferent to such attraction but marie melmotte from that point of view was nothing to him such prettiness as belonged to her came from the brightness of her youth and from a modest shy demeanour joined to an incipient aspiration for the enjoyment of something in the world which should be her own there was too arising within her bosom a struggle to be something in the world an idea that she too could say something and have thoughts of her own if only she had some friend near her whom she need not fear though still shy she was always resolving that she would abandon her shyness and already had thoughts of her own as to the perfectly open confidence which should exist between two lovers when aloneand she was much aloneshe would build castles in the air which were bright with art and love rather than with gems and gold the books she read poor though they generally were left something bright on her imagination she fancied to herself brilliant conversations in which she bore a bright part though in real life she had hitherto hardly talked to any one since she was a child sir felix carbury she knew had made her an offer she knew also or thought that she knew that she loved the man and now she was with him alone now surely had come the time in which some one of her castles in the air might be found to be built of real materials  you know why i have come down here he said  to see your cousin  no indeed im not particularly fond of my cousin who is a methodical stiffnecked old bacheloras cross as the mischief  how disagreeable  yes he is disagreeable i didnt come down to see him i can tell you but when i heard that you were going to be here with the longestaffes i determined to come at once i wonder whether you are glad to see me  i dont know said marie who could not at once find that brilliancy of words with which her imagination supplied her readily enough in her solitude  do you remember what you said to me that evening at my mothers  did i say anything i dont remember anything particular  do you not then i fear you cant think very much of me he paused as though he supposed that she would drop into his mouth like a cherry i thought you told me that you would love me  did i  did you not  i dont know what i said perhaps if i said that i didnt mean it  am i to believe that  perhaps you didnt mean it yourself  by george i did i was quite in earnest there never was a fellow more in earnest than i was ive come down here on purpose to say it again  to say what  whether youll accept me  i dont know whether you love me well enough she longed to be told by him that he loved her he had no objection to tell her so but without thinking much about it felt it to be a bore all that kind of thing was trash and twaddle he desired her to accept him and he would have wished were it possible that she should have gone to her father for his consent there was something in the big eyes and heavy jaws of mr melmotte which he almost feared do you really love me well enough she whispered  of course i do im bad at making pretty speeches and all that but you know i love you  do you  by george yes i always liked you from the first moment i saw you i did indeed  it was a poor declaration of love but it sufficed then i will love you she said i will with all my heart  theres a darling  shall i be your darling indeed i will i may call you felix now maynt i  rather  oh felix i hope you will love me i will so dote upon you you know a great many men have asked me to love them  i suppose so  but i have never never cared for one of them in the leastnot in the least  you do care for me  oh yes she looked up into his beautiful face as she spoke and he saw that her eyes were swimming with tears he thought at the moment that she was very common to look at as regarded appearance only he would have preferred even sophia longestaffe there was indeed a certain brightness of truth which another man might have read in maries mingled smiles and tears but it was thrown away altogether upon him they were walking in some shrubbery quite apart from the house where they were unseen so as in duty bound he put his arm round her waist and kissed her oh felix she said giving her face up to him no one ever did it before he did not in the least believe her nor was the matter one of the slightest importance to him say that you will be good to me felix i will be so good to you  of course i will be good to you  men are not always good to their wives papa is often very cross to mamma  i suppose he can be cross  yes he can he does not often scold me i dont know what hell say when we tell him about this  but i suppose he intends that you shall be married  he wanted me to marry lord nidderdale and lord grasslough but i hated them both i think he wants me to marry lord nidderdale again now he hasnt said so but mamma tells me but i never willnever  i hope not marie  you neednt be a bit afraid i would not do it if they were to kill me i hate himand i do so love you then she leaned with all her weight upon his arm and looked up again into his beautiful face you will speak to papa wont you  will that be the best way  i suppose so how else  i dont know whether madame melmotte ought not  oh dear no nothing would induce her she is more afraid of him than anybodymore afraid of him than i am i thought the gentleman always did that  of course ill do it said sir felix im not afraid of him why should i he and i are very good friends you know  im glad of that  he made me a director of one of his companies the other day  did he perhaps hell like you for a soninlaw  theres no knowingis there  i hope he will i shall like you for papas soninlaw i hope it isnt wrong to say that oh felix say that you love me then she put her face up towards his again  of course i love you he said not thinking it worth his while to kiss her its no good speaking to him here i suppose i had better go and see him in the city  he is in a good humour now said marie  but i couldnt get him alone it wouldnt be the thing to do down here  wouldnt it  not in the countryin another persons house shall you tell madame melmotte  yes i shall tell mamma but she wont say anything to him mamma does not care much about me but ill tell you all that another time of course i shall tell you everything now i never yet had anybody to tell anything to but i shall never be tired of telling you then he left her as soon as he could and escaped to the other ladies mr melmotte was still sitting in the summerhouse and lord alfred was still with him smoking and drinking brandy and seltzer as sir felix passed in front of the great man he told himself that it was much better that the interview should be postponed till they were all in london mr melmotte did not look as though he were in a good humour sir felix said a few words to lady pomona and madame melmotte yes he hoped to have the pleasure of seeing them with his mother and sister on the following day he was aware that his cousin was not coming he believed that his cousin roger never did go anywhere like any one else no he had not seen mr longestaffe he hoped to have the pleasure of seeing him tomorrow then he escaped and got on his horse and rode away  thats going to be the lucky man said georgiana to her mother that evening  in what way lucky  he is going to get the heiress and all the money what a fool dolly has been  i dont think it would have suited dolly said lady pomona after all why should not dolly marry a lady     chapter xviii  ruby ruggles hears a love tale   ruby ruggles the granddaughter of old daniel ruggles of sheeps acre in the parish of sheepstone close to bungay received the following letter from the hands of the rural post lettercarrier on that sunday morninga friend will be somewhere near sheepstone birches between four and five oclock on sunday afternoon there was not another word in the letter but miss ruby ruggles knew well from whom it came  daniel ruggles was a farmer who had the reputation of considerable wealth but who was not very well looked on in the neighbourhood as being somewhat of a curmudgeon and a miser his wife was deadhe had quarrelled with his only son whose wife was also dead and had banished him from his homehis daughters were married and away and the only member of his family who lived with him was his granddaughter ruby and this granddaughter was a great trouble to the old man she was twentythree years old and had been engaged to a prosperous young man at bungay in the meal and pollard line to whom old ruggles had promised to give £500 on their marriage but ruby had taken it into her foolish young head that she did not like meal and pollard and now she had received the above very dangerous letter though the writer had not dared to sign his name she knew well that it came from sir felix carburythe most beautiful gentleman she had ever set her eyes upon poor ruby ruggles living down at sheeps acre on the waveney she had heard both too much and too little of the great world beyond her ken there were she thought many glorious things to be seen which she would never see were she in these her early years to become the wife of john crumb the dealer in meal and pollard at bungay therefore she was full of a wild joy half joy half fear when she got her letter and therefore punctually at four oclock on that sunday she was ensconced among the sheepstone birches so that she might see without much danger of being seen poor ruby ruggles who was left to be so much mistress of herself at the time of her life in which she most required the kindness of a controlling hand  mr ruggles held his land or the greater part of it on what is called a bishops lease sheeps acre farm being a part of the property which did belong to the bishopric of elmham and which was still set apart for its sustentationbut he also held a small extent of outlying meadow which belonged to the carbury estate so that he was one of the tenants of roger carbury those sheepstone birches at which felix made his appointment belonged to roger on a former occasion when the feeling between the two cousins was kinder than that which now existed felix had ridden over with the landlord to call on the old man and had then first seen rubyand had heard from roger something of rubys history up to that date it had then been just made known that she was to marry john crumb since that time not a word had been spoken between the men respecting the girl mr carbury had heard with sorrow that the marriage was either postponed or abandonedbut his growing dislike to the baronet had made it very improbable that there should be any conversation between them on the subject sir felix however had probably heard more of ruby ruggles than her grandfathers landlord  there is perhaps no condition of mind more difficult for the ordinarily wellinstructed inhabitant of a city to realise than that of such a girl as ruby ruggles the rural day labourer and his wife live on a level surface which is comparatively open to the eye their aspirations whether for good or evilwhether for food and drink to be honestly earned for themselves and children or for drink first to be come by either honestly or dishonestlyare if looked at at all fairly visible and with the men of the ruggles class one can generally find out what they would be at and in what direction their minds are at work but the ruggles womanespecially the ruggles young womanis better educated has higher aspirations and a brighter imagination and is infinitely more cunning than the man if she be goodlooking and relieved from the pressure of want her thoughts soar into a world which is as unknown to her as heaven is to us and in regard to which her longings are apt to be infinitely stronger than are ours for heaven her education has been much better than that of the man she can read whereas he can only spell words from a book she can write a letter after her fashion whereas he can barely spell words out on a paper her tongue is more glib and her intellect sharper but her ignorance as to the reality of things is much more gross than his by such contact as he has with men in markets in the streets of the towns he frequents and even in the fields he learns something unconsciously of the relative condition of his countrymenand as to that which he does not learn his imagination is obtuse but the woman builds castles in the air and wonders and longs to the young farmer the squires daughter is a superior being very much out of his way to the farmers daughter the young squire is an apollo whom to look at is a pleasureby whom to be looked at is a delight the danger for the most part is soon over the girl marries after her kind and then husband and children put the matter at rest for ever  a mind more absolutely uninstructed than that of ruby ruggles as to the world beyond suffolk and norfolk it would be impossible to find but her thoughts were as wide as they were vague and as active as they were erroneous why should she with all her prettiness and all her clevernesswith all her fortune to bootmarry that dustiest of all men john crumb before she had seen something of the beauties of the things of which she had read in the books which came in her way john crumb was not badlooking he was a sturdy honest fellow tooslow of speech but sure of his points when he had got them within his grip fond of his beer but not often drunk and the very soul of industry at his work but though she had known him all her life she had never known him otherwise than dusty the meal had so gotten within his hair and skin and raiment that it never came out altogether even on sundays his normal complexion was a healthy pallor through which indeed some records of hidden ruddiness would make themselves visible but which was so judiciously assimilated to his hat and coat and waistcoat that he was more like a stout ghost than a healthy young man nevertheless it was said of him that he could thrash any man in bungay and carry two hundredweight of flour upon his back and ruby also knew this of himthat he worshipped the very ground on which she trod  but alas she thought there might be something better than such worship and therefore when felix carbury came in her way with his beautiful oval face and his rich brown colour and his bright hair and lovely moustache she was lost in a feeling which she mistook for love and when he sneaked over to her a second and a third time she thought more of his listless praise than ever she had thought of john crumbs honest promises but though she was an utter fool she was not a fool without a principle she was miserably ignorant but she did understand that there was a degradation which it behoved her to avoid she thought as the moths seem to think that she might fly into the flame and not burn her wings after her fashion she was pretty with long glossy ringlets which those about the farm on week days would see confined in curlpapers and large round dark eyes and a clear dark complexion in which the blood showed itself plainly beneath the soft brown skin she was strong and healthy and tall and had a will of her own which gave infinite trouble to old daniel ruggles her grandfather  felix carbury took himself two miles out of his way in order that he might return by sheepstone birches which was a little copse distant not above half a mile from sheeps acre farmhouse a narrow angle of the little wood came up to the road by which there was a gate leading into a grass meadow which sir felix had remembered when he made his appointment the road was no more than a country lane unfrequented at all times and almost sure to be deserted on sundays he approached the gate in a walk and then stood awhile looking into the wood he had not stood long before he saw the girls bonnet beneath a tree standing just outside the wood in the meadow but on the bank of the ditch thinking for a moment what he would do about his horse he rode him into the field and then dismounting fastened him to a rail which ran down the side of the copse then he sauntered on till he stood looking down upon ruby ruggles as she sat beneath the tree i like your impudence she said in calling yourself a friend  aint i a friend ruby  a pretty sort of friend you when you was going away you was to be back at carbury in a fortnight and that isoh ever so long ago now  but i wrote to you ruby  whats letters and the postman to know all as in em for anything anybody knows and grandfather to be almost sure to see em i dont call letters no good at all and i beg you wont write em any more  did he see them  no thanks to you if he didnt i dont know why you are come here sir felixnor yet i dont know why i should come and meet you its all just folly like  because i love youthats why i come eh ruby and you have come because you love me eh ruby is not that about it then he threw himself on the ground beside her and got his arm round her waist  it would boot little to tell here all that they said to each other the happiness of ruby ruggles for that halfhour was no doubt complete she had her london lover beside her and though in every word he spoke there was a tone of contempt still he talked of love and made her promises and told her that she was pretty he probably did not enjoy it much he cared very little about her and carried on the liaison simply because it was the proper sort of thing for a young man to do he had begun to think that the odour of patchouli was unpleasant and that the flies were troublesome and the ground hard before the halfhour was over she felt that she could be content to sit there for ever and to listen to him this was a realisation of those delights of life of which she had read in the thricethumbed old novels which she had gotten from the little circulating library at bungay  but what was to come next she had not dared to ask him to marry her had not dared to say those very words and he had not dared to ask her to be his mistress there was an animal courage about her and an amount of strength also and a fire in her eye of which he had learned to be aware before the halfhour was over i think that he wished himself awaybut when he did go he made a promise to see her again on the tuesday morning her grandfather would be at harlestone market and she would meet him at about noon at the bottom of the kitchen garden belonging to the farm as he made the promise he resolved that he would not keep it he would write to her again and bid her come to him in london and would send her money for the journey  i suppose i am to be his wedded wife said ruby to herself as she crept away down from the road away also from her own homeso that on her return her presence should not be associated with that of the young man should any one chance to see the young man on the road ill never be nothing unless im that she said to herself then she allowed her mind to lose itself in expatiating on the difference between john crumb and sir felix carbury     chapter xix  hetta carbury hears a love tale   i half a mind to go back tomorrow morning felix said to his mother that sunday evening after dinner at that moment roger was walking round the garden by himself and henrietta was in her own room  tomorrow morning felix you are engaged to dine with the longestaffes  you could make any excuse you like about that  it would be the most uncourteous thing in the world the longestaffes you know are the leading people in this part of the country no one knows what may happen if you should ever be living at carbury how sad it would be that you should have quarrelled with them  you forget mother that dolly longestaffe is about the most intimate friend i have in the world  that does not justify you in being uncivil to the father and mother and you should remember what you came here for  what did i come for  that you might see marie melmotte more at your ease than you can in their london house  thats all settled said sir felix in the most indifferent tone that he could assume  settled  as far as the girl is concerned i cant very well go to the old fellow for his consent down here  do you mean to say felix that marie melmotte has accepted you  i told you that before  my dear felix oh my boy in her joy the mother took her unwilling son in her arms and caressed him here was the first step taken not only to success but to such magnificent splendour as should make her son to be envied by all young men and herself to be envied by all mothers in england no you didnt tell me before but i am so happy is she really fond of you i dont wonder that any girl should be fond of you  i cant say anything about that but i think she means to stick to it  if she is firm of course her father will give way at last fathers always do give way when the girl is firm why should he oppose it  i dont know that he will  you are a man of rank with a title of your own i suppose what he wants is a gentleman for his girl i dont see why he should not be perfectly satisfied with all his enormous wealth a thousand a year or so cant make any difference and then he made you one of the directors at his board oh felixit is almost too good to be true  i aint quite sure that i care very much about being married you know  oh felix pray dont say that why shouldnt you like being married she is a very nice girl and we shall all be so fond of her dont let any feeling of that kind come over you pray dont you will be able to do just what you please when once the question of her money is settled of course you can hunt as often as you like and you can have a house in any part of london you please you must understand by this time how very disagreeable it is to have to get on without an established income  i quite understand that  if this were once done you would never have any more trouble of that kind there would be plenty of money for everything as long as you live it would be complete success i dont know how to say enough to you or to tell you how dearly i love you or to make you understand how well i think you have done it all then she caressed him again and was almost beside herself in an agony of mingled anxiety and joy if after all her beautiful boy who had lately been her disgrace and her great trouble because of his poverty should shine forth to the world as a baronet with £20000 a year how glorious would it be she must have knownshe did knowhow poor how selfish a creature he was but her gratification at the prospect of his splendour obliterated the sorrow with which the vileness of his character sometimes oppressed her were he to win this girl with all her fathers money neither she nor his sister would be the better for it except in this that the burden of maintaining him would be taken from her shoulders but his magnificence would be established he was her son and the prospect of his fortune and splendour was sufficient to elate her into a very heaven of beautiful dreams but felix she continued you really must stay and go to the longestaffes tomorrow it will only be one day and now were you to run away  run away what nonsense you talk  if you were to start back to london at once i mean it would be an affront to her and the very thing to set melmotte against you you should lay yourself out to please himindeed you should  oh bother said sir felix but nevertheless he allowed himself to be persuaded to remain the matter was important even to him and he consented to endure the almost unendurable nuisance of spending another day at the manor house lady carbury almost lost in delight did not know where to turn for sympathy if her cousin were not so stiff so pigheaded so wonderfully ignorant of the affairs of the world he would have at any rate consented to rejoice with her though he might not like felixwho as his mother admitted to herself had been rude to her cousinhe would have rejoiced for the sake of the family but as it was she did not dare to tell him he would have received her tidings with silent scorn and even henrietta would not be enthusiastic she felt that though she would have delighted to expatiate on this great triumph she must be silent at present it should now be her great effort to ingratiate herself with mr melmotte at the dinner party at caversham  during the whole of that evening roger carbury hardly spoke to his cousin hetta there was not much conversation between them till quite late when father barham came in for supper he had been over at bungay among his people there and had walked back taking carbury on the way what did you think of our bishop roger asked him rather imprudently  not much of him as a bishop i dont doubt that he makes a very nice lord and that he does more good among his neighbours than an average lord but you dont put power or responsibility into the hands of any one sufficient to make him a bishop  ninetenths of the clergy in the diocese would be guided by him in any matter of clerical conduct which might come before him  because they know that he has no strong opinion of his own and would not therefore desire to dominate theirs take any of your bishops that has an opinionif there be one leftand see how far your clergy consent to his teaching roger turned round and took up his book he was already becoming tired of his pet priest he himself always abstained from saying a word derogatory to his new friends religion in the mans hearing but his new friend did not by any means return the compliment perhaps also roger felt that were he to take up the cudgels for an argument he might be worsted in the combat as in such combats success is won by practised skill rather than by truth henrietta was also reading and felix was smoking elsewherewondering whether the hours would ever wear themselves away in that castle of dulness in which no cards were to be seen and where except at mealtimes there was nothing to drink but lady carbury was quite willing to allow the priest to teach her that all appliances for the dissemination of religion outside his own church must be naught  i suppose our bishops are sincere in their beliefs she said with her sweetest smile  im sure i hope so i have no possible reason to doubt it as to the two or three whom i have seennor indeed as to all the rest whom i have not seen  they are so much respected everywhere as good and pious men  i do not doubt it nothing tends so much to respect as a good income but they may be excellent men without being excellent bishops i find no fault with them but much with the system by which they are controlled is it probable that a man should be fitted to select guides for other mens souls because he has succeeded by infinite labour in his vocation in becoming the leader of a majority in the house of commons  indeed no said lady carbury who did not in the least understand the nature of the question put to her  and when youve got your bishop is it likely that a man should be able to do his duty in that capacity who has no power of his own to decide whether a clergyman under him is or is not fit for his duty  hardly indeed  the english people or some of themthat some being the richest and at present the most powerfullike to play at having a church though there is not sufficient faith in them to submit to the control of a church  do you think men should be controlled by clergymen mr barham  in matters of faith i do and so i suppose do you at least you make that profession you declare it to be your duty to submit yourself to your spiritual pastors and masters  that i thought was for children said lady carbury the clergyman in the catechism says my good child  it is what you were taught as a child before you had made profession of your faith to a bishop in order that you might know your duty when you had ceased to be a child i quite agree however that the matter as viewed by your church is childish altogether and intended only for children as a rule adults with you want no religion  i am afraid that is true of a great many  it is marvellous to me that when a man thinks of it he should not be driven by very fear to the comforts of a safer faithunless indeed he enjoy the security of absolute infidelity  that is worse than anything said lady carbury with a sigh and a shudder  i dont know that it is worse than a belief which is no belief said the priest with energythan a creed which sits so easily on a man that he does not even know what it contains and never asks himself as he repeats it whether it be to him credible or incredible  that is very bad said lady carbury  were getting too deep i think said roger putting down the book which he had in vain been trying to read  i think it is so pleasant to have a little serious conversation on sunday evening said lady carbury the priest drew himself back into his chair and smiled he was quite clever enough to understand that lady carbury had been talking nonsense and clever enough also to be aware of the cause of rogers uneasiness but lady carbury might be all the easier converted because she understood nothing and was fond of ambitious talking and roger carbury might possibly be forced into conviction by the very feeling which at present made him unwilling to hear arguments  i dont like hearing my church illspoken of said roger  you wouldnt like me if i thought ill of it and spoke well of it said the priest  and therefore the less said the sooner mended said roger rising from his chair upon this father barham look his departure and walked away to beccles it might be that he had sowed some seed it might be that he had at any rate ploughed some ground even the attempt to plough the ground was a good work which would not be forgotten  the following morning was the time on which roger had fixed for repeating his suit to henrietta he had determined that it should be so and though the words had been almost on his tongue during that sunday afternoon he had repressed them because he would do as he had determined he was conscious almost painfully conscious of a certain increase of tenderness in his cousins manner towards him all that pride of independence which had amounted almost to roughness when she was in london seemed to have left her when he greeted her morning and night she looked softly into his face she cherished the flowers which he gave her he could perceive that if he expressed the slightest wish in any matter about the house she would attend to it there had been a word said about punctuality and she had become punctual as the hand of the clock there was not a glance of her eye nor a turn of her hand that he did not watch and calculate its effect as regarded himself but because she was tender to him and observant he did not by any means allow himself to believe that her heart was growing into love for him he thought that he understood the working of her mind she could see how great was his disgust at her brothers doings how fretted he was by her mothers conduct her grace and sweetness and sense took part with him against those who were nearer to herself and thereforein pityshe was kind to him it was thus he read it and he read it almost with exact accuracy  hetta he said after breakfast come out into the garden awhile  are not you going to the men  not yet at any rate i do not always go to the men as you call it she put on her hat and tripped out with him knowing well that she had been summoned to hear the old story she had been sure as soon as she found the white rose in her room that the old story would be repeated again before she left carburyand up to this time she had hardly made up her mind what answer she would give to it that she could not take his offer she thought she did know she knew well that she loved the other man that other man had never asked her for her love but she thought that she knew that he desired it but in spite of all this there had in truth grown up in her bosom a feeling of tenderness towards her cousin so strong that it almost tempted her to declare to herself that he ought to have what he wanted simply because he wanted it he was so good so noble so generous so devoted that it almost seemed to her that she could not be justified in refusing him and she had gone entirely over to his side in regard to the melmottes her mother had talked to her of the charm of mr melmottes money till her very heart had been sickened there was nothing noble there but as contrasted with that rogers conduct and bearing were those of a fine gentleman who knew neither fear nor shame should such a one be doomed to pine for ever because a girl could not love hima man born to be loved if nobility and tenderness and truth were lovely  hetta he said put your arm here she gave him her arm i was a little annoyed last night by that priest i want to be civil to him and now he is always turning against me  he doesnt do any harm i suppose  he does do harm if he teaches you and me to think lightly of those things which we have been brought up to revere so thought henrietta it isnt about love this time its only about the church he ought not to say things before my guests as to our way of believing which i wouldnt under any circumstances say as to his i didnt quite like your hearing it  i dont think hell do me any harm im not at all that way given i suppose they all do it its their business  poor fellow i brought him here just because i thought it was a pity that a man born and bred like a gentleman should never see the inside of a comfortable house  i liked himonly i didnt like his saying stupid things about the bishop  and i like him then there was a pause i suppose your brother does not talk to you much about his own affairs  his own affairs roger do you mean money he never says a word to me about money  i meant about the melmottes  no not to me felix hardly ever speaks to me about anything  i wonder whether she has accepted him  i think she very nearly did accept him in london  i cant quite sympathise with your mother in all her feelings about this marriage because i do not think that i recognise as she does the necessity of money  felix is so disposed to be extravagant  well yes but i was going to say that though i cannot bring myself to say anything to encourage her about this heiress i quite recognise her unselfish devotion to his interests  mamma thinks more of him than of anything said hetta not in the least intending to accuse her mother of indifference to herself  i know it and though i happen to think myself that her other child would better repay her devotionthis he said looking up to hetta and smilingi quite feel how good a mother she is to felix you know when she first came the other day we almost had a quarrel  i felt that there was something unpleasant  and then felix coming after his time put me out i am getting old and cross or i should not mind such things  i think you are so good and so kind as she said this she leaned upon his arm almost as though she meant to tell him that she loved him  i have been angry with myself he said and so i am making you my father confessor open confession is good for the soul sometimes and i think that you would understand me better than your mother  i do understand you but dont think there is any fault to confess  you will not exact any penance she only looked at him and smiled i am going to put a penance on myself all the same i cant congratulate your brother on his wooing over at caversham as i know nothing about it but i will express some civil wish to him about things in general  will that be a penance  if you could look into my mind youd find that it would im full of fretful anger against him for halfadozen little frivolous things didnt he throw his cigar on the path didnt he lie in bed on sunday instead of going to church  but then he was travelling all the saturday night  whose fault was that but dont you see it is the triviality of the offence which makes the penance necessary had he knocked me over the head with a pickaxe or burned the house down i should have had a right to be angry but i was angry because he wanted a horse on sunday and therefore i must do penance  there was nothing of love in all this hetta however did not wish him to talk of love he was certainly now treating her as a friendas a most intimate friend if he would only do that without making love to her how happy could she be but his determination still held good and now said he altering his tone altogether i must speak about myself immediately the weight of her hand upon his arm was lessened thereupon he put his left hand round and pressed her arm to his no he said do not make any change towards me while i speak to you whatever comes of it we shall at any rate be cousins and friends  always friends she said  yesalways friends and now listen to me for i have much to say i will not tell you again that i love you you know it or else you must think me the vainest and falsest of men it is not only that i love you but i am so accustomed to concern myself with one thing only so constrained by the habits and nature of my life to confine myself to single interests that i cannot as it were escape from my love i am thinking of it always often despising myself because i think of it so much for after all let a woman be ever so goodand you to me are all that is gooda man should not allow his love to dominate his intellect  oh no  i do i calculate my chances within my own bosom almost as a man might calculate his chances of heaven i should like you to know me just as i am the weak and the strong together i would not win you by a lie if i could i think of you more than i ought to do i am sure quite sure that you are the only possible mistress of this house during my tenure of it if i am ever to live as other men do and to care about the things which other men care for it must be as your husband  praypray do not say that  yes i think that i have a right to say itand a right to expect that you should believe me i will not ask you to be my wife if you do not love me not that i should fear aught for myself but that you should not be pressed to make a sacrifice of yourself because i am your friend and cousin but i think it is quite possible you might come to love meunless your heart be absolutely given away elsewhere  what am i to say  we each of us know of what the other is thinking if paul montague has robbed me of my love  mr montague has never said a word  if he had i think he would have wronged me he met you in my house and i think must have known what my feelings were towards you  but he never has  we have been like brothers togetherone brother being very much older than the other indeed or like father and son i think he should place his hopes elsewhere  what am i to say if he have such hope he has not told me i think it almost cruel that a girl should be asked in that way  hetta i should not wish to be cruel to you of course i know the way of the world in such matters i have no right to ask you about paul montagueno right to expect an answer but it is all the world to me you can understand that i should think you might learn to love even me if you loved no one else the tone of his voice was manly and at the same time full of entreaty his eyes as he looked at her were bright with love and anxiety she not only believed him as to the tale which he now told her but she believed in him altogether she knew that he was a staff on which a woman might safely lean trusting to it for comfort and protection in life in that moment she all but yielded to him had he seized her in his arms and kissed her then i think she would have yielded she did all but love him she so regarded him that had it been some other woman that he craved she would have used every art she knew to have backed his suit and would have been ready to swear that any woman was a fool who refused him she almost hated herself because she was unkind to one who so thoroughly deserved kindness as it was she made him no answer but continued to walk beside him trembling i thought i would tell it you all because i wish you to know exactly the state of my mind i would show you if i could all my heart and all my thoughts about yourself as in a glass case do not coy your love for me if you can feel it when you know dear that a mans heart is set upon a woman as mine is set on you so that it is for you to make his life bright or dark for you to open or to shut the gates of his earthly paradise i think you will be above keeping him in darkness for the sake of a girlish scruple  oh roger  if ever there should come a time in which you can say it truly remember my truth to you and say it boldly i at least shall never change of course if you love another man and give yourself to him it will be all over tell me that boldly also i have said it all now god bless you my own hearts darling i hopei hope i may be strong enough through it all to think more of your happiness than of my own then he parted from her abruptly taking his way over one of the bridges and leaving her to find her way into the house alone     chapter xx  lady pomonas dinner party   roger carburys halfformed plan of keeping henrietta at home while lady carbury and sir felix went to dine at caversham fell to the ground it was to be carried out only in the event of hettas yielding to his prayer but he had in fact not made a prayer and hetta had certainly yielded nothing when the evening came lady carbury started with her son and daughter and roger was left alone in the ordinary course of his life he was used to solitude during the greater part of the year he would eat and drink and live without companionship so that there was to him nothing peculiarly sad in this desertion but on the present occasion he could not prevent himself from dwelling on the loneliness of his lot in life these cousins of his who were his guests cared nothing for him lady carbury had come to his house simply that it might be useful to her sir felix did not pretend to treat him with even ordinary courtesy and hetta herself though she was soft to him and gracious was soft and gracious through pity rather than love on this day he had in truth asked her for nothing but he had almost brought himself to think that she might give all that he wanted without asking and yet when he told her of the greatness of his love and of its endurance she was simply silent when the carriage taking them to dinner went away down the road he sat on the parapet of the bridge in front of the house listening to the sound of the horses feet and telling himself that there was nothing left for him in life  if ever one man had been good to another he had been good to paul montague and now paul montague was robbing him of everything he valued in the world his thoughts were not logical nor was his mind exact the more he considered it the stronger was his inward condemnation of his friend he had never mentioned to any one the services he had rendered to montague in speaking of him to hetta he had alluded only to the affection which had existed between them but he felt that because of those services his friend montague had owed it to him not to fall in love with the girl he loved and he thought that if unfortunately this had happened unawares montague should have retired as soon as he learned the truth he could not bring himself to forgive his friend even though hetta had assured him that his friend had never spoken to her of love he was sore all over and it was paul montague who made him sore had there been no such man at carbury when hetta came there hetta might now have been mistress of the house he sat there till the servant came to tell him that his dinner was on the table then he crept in and ateso that the man might not see his sorrow and after dinner he sat with a book in his hand seeming to read but he read not a word for his mind was fixed altogether on his cousin hetta what a poor creature a man is he said to himself who is not sufficiently his own master to get over a feeling like this  at caversham there was a very grand partyas grand almost as a dinner party can be in the country there were the earl and countess of loddon and lady jane pewet from loddon park and the bishop and his wife and the hepworths these with the carburys and the parsons family and the people staying in the house made twentyfour at the dinner table as there were fourteen ladies and only ten men the banquet can hardly be said to have been very well arranged but those things cannot be done in the country with the exactness which the appliances of london make easy and then the longestaffes though they were decidedly people of fashion were not famous for their excellence in arranging such matters if aught however was lacking in exactness it was made up in grandeur there were three powdered footmen and in that part of the country lady pomona alone was served after this fashion and there was a very heavy butler whose appearance of itself was sufficient to give éclat to a family the grand saloon in which nobody ever lived was thrown open and sofas and chairs on which nobody ever sat were uncovered it was not above once in the year that this kind of thing vas done at caversham but when it was done nothing was spared which could contribute to the magnificence of the fête lady pomona and her two tall daughters standing up to receive the little countess of loddon and lady jane pewet who was the image of her mother on a somewhat smaller scale while madame melmotte and marie stood behind as though ashamed of themselves was a sight to see then the carburys came and then mrs yeld with the bishop the grand room was soon fairly full but nobody had a word to say the bishop was generally a man of much conversation and lady loddon if she were well pleased with her listeners could talk by the hour without ceasing but on this occasion nobody could utter a word lord loddon pottered about making a feeble attempt in which he was seconded by no one lord alfred stood stockstill stroking his grey moustache with his hand that much greater man augustus melmotte put his thumbs into the armholes of his waistcoat and was impassible the bishop saw at a glance the hopelessness of the occasion and made no attempt the master of the house shook hands with each guest as he entered and then devoted his mind to expectation of the next corner lady pomona and her two daughters were grand and handsome but weary and dumb in accordance with the treaty madame melmotte had been entertained civilly for four entire days it could not be expected that the ladies of caversham should come forth unwearied after such a struggle  when dinner was announced felix was allowed to take in marie melmotte there can be no doubt but that the caversham ladies did execute their part of the treaty they were led to suppose that this arrangement would be desirable to the melmottes and they made it the great augustus himself went in with lady carbury much to her satisfaction she also had been dumb in the drawingroom but now if ever it would be her duty to exert herself i hope you like suffolk she said  pretty well i thank you oh yesvery nice place for a little fresh air  yesthats just it mr melmotte when the summer comes one does long so to see the flowers  we have better flowers in our balconies than any i see down here said mr melmotte  no doubtbecause you can command the floral tribute of the world at large what is there that money will not do it can turn a london street into a bower of roses and give you grottoes in grosvenor square  its a very nice place is london  if you have got plenty of money mr melmotte  and if you have not its the best place i know to get it do you live in london maam he had quite forgotten lady carbury even if he had seen her at his house and with the dulness of hearing common to men had not picked up her name when told to take her out to dinner oh yes i live in london i have had the honour of being entertained by you there this she said with her sweetest smile  oh indeed so many do come that i dont always just remember  how should youwith all the world flocking round you i am lady carbury the mother of sir felix carbury whom i think you will remember  yes i know sir felix hes sitting there next to my daughter  happy fellow  i dont know much about that young men dont get their happiness in that way now theyve got other things to think of  he thinks so much of his business  oh i didnt know said mr melmotte  he sits at the same board with you i think mr melmotte  ohthats his business said mr melmotte with a grim smile  lady carbury was very clever as to many things and was not illinformed on matters in general that were going on around her but she did not know much about the city and was profoundly ignorant as to the duties of those directors of whom from time to time she saw the names in a catalogue i trust that he is diligent there she said and that he is aware of the great privilege which he enjoys in having the advantage of your counsel and guidance  he dont trouble me much maam and i dont trouble him much after this lady carbury said no more as to her sons position in the city she endeavoured to open various other subjects of conversation but she found mr melmotte to be heavy on her hands after a while she had to abandon him in despair and give herself up to raptures in favour of protestantism at the bidding of the caversham parson who sat on the other side of her and who had been worked to enthusiasm by some mention of father barhams name  opposite to her or nearly so sat sir felix and his love i have told mamma marie had whispered as she walked in to dinner with him she was now full of the idea so common to girls who are engagedand as natural as it is commonthat she might tell everything to her lover  did she say anything he asked then marie had to take her place and arrange her dress before she could reply to him as to her i suppose it does not matter what she says does it  she said a great deal she thinks that papa will think you are not rich enough hush talk about something else or people will hear so much she had been able to say during the bustle  felix was not at all anxious to talk about his love and changed the subject very willingly have you been riding he asked  no i dont think there are horses herenot for visitors that is how did you get home did you have any adventures  none at all said felix remembering ruby ruggles i just rode home quietly i go to town tomorrow  and we go on wednesday mind you come and see us before long this she said bringing her voice down to a whisper  of course i shall i suppose id better go to your father in the city does he go every day  oh yes every day hes back always about seven sometimes hes goodnatured enough when he comes back but sometimes hes very cross hes best just after dinner but its so hard to get to him then lord alfred is almost always there and then other people come and they play cards i think the city will be best  youll stick to it he asked  oh yesindeed i will now that ive once said it nothing will ever turn me i think papa knows that felix looked at her as she said this and thought that he saw more in her countenance than he had ever read there before perhaps she would consent to run away with him and if so being the only child she would certainlyalmost certainly be forgiven but if he were to run away with her and marry her and then find that she were not forgiven and that melmotte allowed her to starve without a shilling of fortune where would he be then looking at the matter in all its bearings considering among other things the trouble and the expense of such a measure he thought that he could not afford to run away with her  after dinner he hardly spoke to her indeed the room itselfthe same big room in which they had been assembled before the feastseemed to be illadapted for conversation again nobody talked to anybody and the minutes went very heavily till at last the carriages were there to take them all home they arranged that you should sit next to her said lady carbury to her son as they were in the carriage  oh i suppose that came naturallyone young man and one young woman you know  those things are always arranged and they would not have done it unless they had thought that it would please mr melmotte oh felix if you can bring it about  i shall if i can mother you neednt make a fuss about it  no i wont you cannot wonder that i should be anxious you behaved beautifully to her at dinner i was so happy to see you together good night felix and god bless you she said again as they were parting for the night i shall be the happiest and the proudest mother in england if this comes about     chapter xxi  everybody goes to them   when the melmottes went from caversham the house was very desolate the task of entertaining these people was indeed over and had the return to london been fixed for a certain near day there would have been comfort at any rate among the ladies of the family but this was so far from being the case that the thursday and friday passed without anything being settled and dreadful fears began to fill the minds of lady pomona and sophia longestaffe georgiana was also impatient but she asserted boldly that treachery such as that which her mother and sister contemplated was impossible their father she thought would not dare to propose it on each of these daysthree or four times dailyhints were given and questions were asked but without avail mr longestaffe would not consent to have a day fixed till he had received some particular letter and would not even listen to the suggestion of a day i suppose we can go at any rate on tuesday georgiana said on the friday evening i dont know why you should suppose anything of the kind the father replied poor lady pomona was urged by her daughters to compel him to name a day but lady pomona was less audacious in urging the request than her younger child and at the same time less anxious for its completion on the sunday morning before they went to church there was a great discussion upstairs the bishop of elmham was going to preach at caversham church and the three ladies were dressed in their best london bonnets they were in their mothers room having just completed the arrangements of their churchgoing toilet it was supposed that the expected letter had arrived mr longestaffe had certainly received a despatch from his lawyer but had not as yet vouchsafed any reference to its contents he had been more than ordinarily silent at breakfast andso sophia assertedmore disagreeable than ever the question had now arisen especially in reference to their bonnets you might as well wear them said lady pomona for i am sure you will not be in london again this year  you dont mean it mamma said sophia  i do my dear he looked like it when he put those papers back into his pocket i know what his face means so well  it is not possible said sophia he promised and he got us to have those horrid people because he promised  well my dear if your father says that we cant go back i suppose we must take his word for it it is he must decide of course what he meant i suppose was that he would take us back if he could  mamma shouted georgiana was there to be treachery not only on the part of their natural adversary who adversary though he was had bound himself to terms by a treaty but treachery also in their own camp  my dear what can we do said lady pomona  do georgiana was now going to speak out plainly make him understand that we are not going to be sat upon like that ill do something if thats going to be the way of it if he treats me like that ill run off with the first man that will take me let him be who it may  dont talk like that georgiana unless you wish to kill me  ill break his heart for him he does not care about us not the least whether we are happy or miserable but he cares very much about the family name ill tell him that im not going to be a slave ill marry a london tradesman before ill stay down here the younger miss longestaffe was lost in passion at the prospect before her  oh georgey dont say such horrid things as that pleaded her sister  its all very well for you sophy youve got george whitstable  i havent got george whitstable  yes you have and your fish is fried dolly does just what he pleases and spends money as fast as he likes of course it makes no difference to you mamma where you are  you are very unjust said lady pomona wailing and you say horrid things  i aint unjust at all it doesnt matter to you and sophy is the same as settled but im to be sacrificed how am i to see anybody down here in this horrid hole papa promised and he must keep his word  then there came to them a loud voice calling to them from the hall are any of you coming to church or are you going to keep the carriage waiting all day of course they were all going to church they always did go to church when they were at caversham and would more especially do so today because of the bishop and because of the bonnets they trooped down into the hall and into the carriage lady pomona leading the way georgiana stalked along passing her father at the front door without condescending to look at him not a word was spoken on the way to church or on the way home during the service mr longestaffe stood up in the corner of his pew and repeated the responses in a loud voice in performing this duty he had been an example to the parish all his life the three ladies knelt on their hassocks in the most becoming fashion and sat during the sermon without the slightest sign either of weariness or of attention they did not collect the meaning of any one combination of sentences it was nothing to them whether the bishop had or had not a meaning endurance of that kind was their strength had the bishop preached for fortyfive minutes instead of half an hour they would not have complained it was the same kind of endurance which enabled georgiana to go on from year to year waiting for a husband of the proper sort she could put up with any amount of tedium if only the fair chance of obtaining ultimate relief were not denied to her but to be kept at caversham all the summer would be as bad as hearing a bishop preach for ever after the service they came back to lunch and that meal also was eaten in silence when it was over the head of the family put himself into the diningroom armchair evidently meaning to be left alone there in that case he would have meditated upon his troubles till he went to sleep and would have thus got through the afternoon with comfort but this was denied to him the two daughters remained steadfast while the things were being removed and lady pomona though she made one attempt to leave the room returned when she found that her daughters would not follow her georgiana had told her sister that she meant to have it out with her father and sophia had of course remained in the room in obedience to her sisters behest when the last tray had been taken out georgiana began papa dont you think you could settle now when we are to go back to town of course we want to know about engagements and all that there is lady monograms party on wednesday we promised to be there ever so long ago  you had better write to lady monogram and say you cant keep your engagement  but why not papa we could go up on wednesday morning  you cant do anything of the kind  but my dear we should all like to have a day fixed said lady pomona then there was a pause even georgiana in her present state of mind would have accepted some distant even some undefined time as a compromise  then you cant have a day fixed said mr longestaffe  how long do you suppose that we shall be kept here said sophia in a low constrained voice  i do not know what you mean by being kept here this is your home and this is where you may make up your minds to live  but we are to go back demanded sophia georgiana stood by in silence listening resolving and biding her time  youll not return to london this season said mr longestaffe turning himself abruptly to a newspaper which he held in his hands  do you mean that that is settled said lady pomona i mean to say that that is settled said mr longestaffe was there ever treachery like this the indignation in georgianas mind approached almost to virtue as she thought of her fathers falseness she would not have left town at all but for that promise she would not have contaminated herself with the melmottes but for that promise and now she was told that the promise was to be absolutely broken when it was no longer possible that she could get back to londoneven to the house of the hated primeroswithout absolutely running away from her fathers residence then papa she said with affected calmness you have simply and with premeditation broken your word to us  how dare you speak to me in that way you wicked child  i am not a child papa as you know very well i am my own mistress by law  then go and be your own mistress you dare to tell me your father that i have premeditated a falsehood if you tell me that again you shall eat your meals in your own room or not eat them in this house  did you not promise that we should go back if we would come down and entertain these people  i will not argue with a child insolent and disobedient as you are if i have anything to say about it i will say it to your mother it should be enough for you that i your father tell you that you have to live here now go away and if you choose to be sullen go and be sullen where i shant see you georgiana looked round on her mother and sister and then marched majestically out of the room she still meditated revenge but she was partly cowed and did not dare in her fathers presence to go on with her reproaches she stalked off into the room in which they generally lived and there she stood panting with anger breathing indignation through her nostrils  and you mean to put up with it mamma she said  what can we do my dear  i will do something im not going to be cheated and swindled and have my life thrown away into the bargain i have always behaved well to him i have never run up bills without saying anything about them this was a cut at her elder sister who had once got into some little trouble of that kind i have never got myself talked about with anybody if there is anything to be done i always do it i have written his letters for him till i have been sick and when you were ill i never asked him to stay out with us after two or halfpast two at the latest and now he tells me that i am to eat my meals up in my bedroom because i remind him that he distinctly promised to take us back to london did he not promise mamma  i understood so my dear  you know he promised mamma if i do anything now he must bear the blame of it i am not going to keep myself straight for the sake of the family and then be treated in that way  you do that for your own sake i suppose said her sister  it is more than youve been able to do for anybodys sake said georgiana alluding to a very old affair to an ancient flirtation in the course of which the elder daughter had made a foolish and a futile attempt to run away with an officer of dragoons whose private fortune was very moderate ten years had passed since that and the affair was never alluded to except in moments of great bitterness  ive kept myself as straight as you have said sophia its easy enough to be straight when a person never cares for anybody and nobody cares for a person  my dears if you quarrel what am i to do said their mother  it is i that have to suffer continued georgiana does he expect me to find anybody here that i could take poor george whitstable is not much but there is nobody else at all  you may have him if you like said sophia with a chuck of her head  thank you my dear but i shouldnt like it at all i havent come to that quite yet  you were talking of running away with somebody  i shant run away with george whitstable you may be sure of that ill tell you what i shall doi will write papa a letter i suppose hell condescend to read it if he wont take me up to town himself he must send me up to the primeros what makes me most angry in the whole thing is that we should have condescended to be civil to the melmottes down in the country in london one does those things but to have them here was terrible  during that entire afternoon nothing more was said not a word passed between them on any subject beyond those required by the necessities of life georgiana had been as hard to her sister as to her father and sophia in her quiet way resented the affront she was now almost reconciled to the sojourn in the country because it inflicted a fitting punishment on georgiana and the presence of mr whitstable at a distance of not more than ten miles did of course make a difference to herself lady pomona complained of a headache which was always an excuse with her for not speakingand mr longestaffe went to sleep georgiana during the whole afternoon remained apart and on the next morning the head of the family found the following letter on his dressingtable      my dear papa     i dont think you ought to be surprised because we feel that our    going up to town is so very important to us if we are not to be    in london at this time of the year we can never see anybody and    of course you know what that must mean for me if this goes on    about sophia it does not signify for her and though mamma likes    london it is not of real importance but it is very very hard    upon me it isnt for pleasure that i want to go up there isnt    so very much pleasure in it but if im to be buried down here at    caversham i might just as well be dead at once if you choose to    give up both houses for a year or for two years and take us all    abroad i should not grumble in the least there are very nice    people to be met abroad and perhaps things go easier that way    than in town and there would be nothing for horses and we could    dress very cheap and wear our old things im sure i dont want to    run up bills but if you would only think what caversham must be    to me without any one worth thinking about within twenty miles    you would hardly ask me to stay here     you certainly did say that if we would come down here with those    melmottes we should be taken back to town and you cannot be    surprised that we should be disappointed when we are told that we    are to be kept here after that it makes me feel that life is so    hard that i cant bear it i see other girls having such chances    when i have none that sometimes i think i dont know what will    happen to me this was the nearest approach which she dared to    make in writing to that threat which she had uttered to her mother    of running away with somebody i suppose that now it is useless    for me to ask you to take us all back this summerthough it was    promised but i hope youll give me money to go up to the    primeros it would only be me and my maid julia primero asked me    to stay with them when you first talked of not going up and i    should not in the least object to reminding her only it should be    done at once their house in queens gate is very large and i    know theyve a room they all ride and i should want a horse but    there would be nothing else as they have plenty of carriages and    the groom who rides with julia would do for both of us pray    answer this at once papa     your affectionate daughter     georgiana longestaffe   mr longestaffe did condescend to read the letter he though he had rebuked his mutinous daughter with stern severity was also to some extent afraid of her at a sudden burst he could stand upon his authority and assume his position with parental dignity but not the less did he dread the wearing toil of continued domestic strife he thought that upon the whole his daughter liked a row in the house if not there surely would not be so many rows he himself thoroughly hated them he had not any very lively interest in life he did not read much he did not talk much he was not specially fond of eating and drinking he did not gamble and he did not care for the farm to stand about the door and hall and public rooms of the clubs to which he belonged and hear other men talk politics or scandal was what he liked better than anything else in the world but he was quite willing to give this up for the good of his family he would be contented to drag through long listless days at caversham and endeavour to nurse his property if only his daughter would allow it by assuming a certain pomp in his living which had been altogether unserviceable to himself and family by besmearing his footmens heads and bewigging his coachmen by aping though never achieving the grand ways of grander men than himself he had run himself into debt his own ambition had been a peerage and he had thought that this was the way to get it a separate property had come to his son from his wifes mothersome £2000 or £3000 a year magnified by the world into double its amountand the knowledge of this had for a time reconciled him to increasing the burdens on the family estates he had been sure that adolphus when of age would have consented to sell the sussex property in order that the suffolk property might be relieved but dolly was now in debt himself and though in other respects the most careless of men was always on his guard in any dealings with his father he would not consent to the sale of the sussex property unless half of the proceeds were to be at once handed to himself the father could not bring himself to consent to this but while refusing it found the troubles of the world very hard upon him melmotte had done something for himbut in doing this melmotte was very hard and tyrannical melmotte when at caversham had looked into his affairs and had told him very plainly that with such an establishment in the country he was not entitled to keep a house in town mr longestaffe had then said something about his daughterssomething especially about georgianaand mr melmotte had made a suggestion  mr longestaffe when he read his daughters appeal did feel for her in spite of his anger but if there was one man he hated more than another it was his neighbour mr primero and if one woman it was mrs primero primero whom mr longestaffe regarded as quite an upstart and anything but a gentleman owed no man anything he paid his tradesmen punctually and never met the squire of caversham without seeming to make a parade of his virtue in that direction he had spent many thousands for his party in county elections and borough elections and was now himself member for a metropolitan district he was a radical of course or according to mr longestaffes view of his political conduct acted and voted on the radical side because there was nothing to be got by voting and acting on the other and now there had come into suffolk a rumour that mr primero was to have a peerage to others the rumour was incredible but mr longestaffe believed it and to mr longestaffe that belief was an agony a baron bundlesham just at his door and such a baron bundlesham would be more than mr longestaffe could endure it was quite impossible that his daughter should be entertained in london by the primeros  but another suggestion had been made georgianas letter had been laid on her fathers table on the monday morning on the following morning when there could have been no intercourse with london by letter lady pomona called her younger daughter to her and handed her a note to read your papa has this moment given it me of course you must judge for yourself this was the note      my dear mr longestaffe     as you seem determined not to return to london this season    perhaps one of your young ladies would like to come to us mrs    melmotte would be delighted to have miss georgiana for june and    july if so she need only give mrs melmotte a days notice     yours truly     augustus melmotte   georgiana as soon as her eye had glanced down the one side of note paper on which this invitation was written looked up for the date it was without a date and had she felt sure been left in her fathers hands to be used as he might think fit she breathed very hard both her father and mother had heard her speak of these melmottes and knew what she thought of them there was an insolence in the very suggestion but at the first moment she said nothing of that why shouldnt i go to the primeros she asked  your father will not hear of it he dislikes them especially  and i dislike the melmottes i dislike the primeros of course but they are not so bad as the melmottes that would be dreadful  you must judge for yourself georgiana  it is thator staying here  i think so my dear  if papa chooses i dont know why i am to mind it will be awfully disagreeableabsolutely disgusting  she seemed to be very quiet  pooh mamma quiet she was quiet here because she was afraid of us she isnt yet used to be with people like us shell get over that if im in the house with her and then she is oh so frightfully vulgar she must have been the very sweeping of the gutters did you not see it mamma she could not even open her mouth she was so ashamed of herself i shouldnt wonder if they turned out to be something quite horrid they make me shudder was there ever anything so dreadful to look at as he is  everybody goes to them said lady pomona the duchess of stevenage has been there over and over again and so has lady auld reekie everybody goes to their house  but everybody doesnt go and live with them oh mammato have to sit down to breakfast every day for ten weeks with that man and that woman  perhaps theyll let you have your breakfast upstairs  but to have to go out with themwalking into the room after her only think of it  but you are so anxious to be in london my dear  of course i am anxious what other chance have i mamma and oh dear i am so tired of it pleasure indeed papa talks of pleasure if papa had to work half as hard as i do i wonder what hed think of it i suppose i must do it i know it will make me so ill that i shall almost die under it horrid horrid people and papa to propose it who has always been so proud of everythingwho used to think so much of being with the right set  things are changed georgiana said the anxious mother  indeed they are when papa wants me to go and stay with people like that why mamma the apothecary in bungay is a fine gentleman compared with mr melmotte and his wife is a fine lady compared with madame melmotte but ill go if papa chooses me to be seen with such people it is not my fault there will be no disgracing ones self after that i dont believe in the least that any decent man would propose to a girl in such a house and you and papa must not be surprised if i take some horrid creature from the stock exchange papa has altered his ideas and so i suppose i had better alter mine  georgiana did not speak to her father that night but lady pomona informed mr longestaffe that mr melmottes invitation was to be accepted she herself would write a line to madame melmotte and georgiana would go up on the friday following i hope shell like it said mr longestaffe the poor man had no intention of irony it was not in his nature to be severe after that fashion but to poor lady pomona the words sounded very cruel how could any one like to live in a house with mr and madame melmotte  on the friday morning there was a little conversation between the two sisters just before georgianas departure to the railway station which was almost touching she had endeavoured to hold up her head as usual but had failed the thing that she was going to do cowed her even in the presence of her sister sophy i do so envy you staying here  but it was you who were so determined to be in london  yes i was determined and am determined ive got to get myself settled somehow and that cant be done down here but you are not going to disgrace yourself  theres no disgrace in it georgey  yes there is i believe the man to be a swindler and a thief and i believe her to be anything low that you can think of as to their pretensions to be gentlefolk it is monstrous the footmen and housemaids would be much better  then dont go georgey  i must go its the only chance that is left if i were to remain down here everybody would say that i was on the shelf you are going to marry whitstable and youll do very well it isnt a big place but theres no debt on it and whitstable himself isnt a bad sort of fellow  is he now  of course he hasnt much to say for himself for hes always at home but he is a gentleman  that he certainly is  as for me i shall give over caring about gentlemen now the first man that comes to me with four or five thousand a year ill take him though hed come out of newgate or bedlam and i shall always say it has been papas doing  and so georgiana longestaffe went up to london and stayed with the melmottes     chapter xxii  lord nidderdales morality   it was very generally said in the city about this time that the great south central pacific and mexican railway was the very best thing out it was known that mr melmotte had gone into it with heart and hand there were many who declaredwith gross injustice to the great fiskerthat the railway was melmottes own child that he had invented it advertised it agitated it and floated it but it was not the less popular on that account a railway from salt lake city to mexico no doubt had much of the flavour of a castle in spain our farwestern american brethren are supposed to be imaginative mexico has not a reputation among us for commercial security or that stability which produces its four five or six per cent with the regularity of clockwork but there was the panama railway a small affair which had paid twentyfive per cent and there was the great line across the continent to san francisco in which enormous fortunes had been made it came to be believed that men with their eyes open might do as well with the great south central as had ever been done before with other speculations and this belief was no doubt founded on mr melmottes partiality for the enterprise mr fisker had struck ile when he induced his partner montague to give him a note to the great man  paul montague himself who cannot be said to have been a man having his eyes open in the city sense of the word could not learn how the thing was progressing at the regular meetings of the board which never sat for above half an hour two or three papers were read by miles grendall melmotte himself would speak a few slow words intended to be cheery and always indicative of triumph and then everybody would agree to everything somebody would sign something and the board for that day would be over to paul montague this was very unsatisfactory more than once or twice he endeavoured to stay the proceedings not as disapproving but simply as desirous of being made to understand but the silent scorn of his chairman put him out of countenance and the opposition of his colleagues was a barrier which he was not strong enough to overcome lord alfred grendall would declare that he did not think all that was at all necessary lord nidderdale with whom montague had now become intimate at the beargarden would nudge him in the ribs and bid him hold his tongue mr cohenlupe would make a little speech in fluent but broken english assuring the committee that everything was being done after the approved city fashion sir felix after the first two meetings was never there and thus paul montague with a sorely burdened conscience was carried along as one of the directors of the great south central pacific and mexican railway company  i do not know whether the burden was made lighter to him or heavier by the fact that the immediate pecuniary result was certainly very comfortable the company had not yet been in existence quite six weeksor at any rate melmotte had not been connected with it above that timeand it had already been suggested to him twice that he should sell fifty shares at £112 10s he did not even yet know how many shares he possessed but on both occasions he consented to the proposal and on the following day received a cheque for £625that sum representing the profit over and above the original nominal price of £100 a share the suggestion was made to him by miles grendall and when he asked some questions as to the manner in which the shares had been allocated he was told that all that would be arranged in accordance with the capital invested and must depend on the final disposition of the californian property but from what we see old fellow said miles i dont think you have anything to fear you seem to be about the best in of them all melmotte wouldnt advise you to sell out gradually if he didnt look upon the thing as a certain income as far as you are concerned  paul montague understood nothing of all this and felt that he was standing on ground which might be blown from under his feet at any moment the uncertainty and what he feared might be the dishonesty of the whole thing made him often very miserable in those wretched moments his conscience was asserting itself but again there were times in which he also was almost triumphant and in which he felt the delight of his wealth though he was snubbed at the board when he wanted explanations he received very great attention outside the boardroom from those connected with the enterprise melmotte had asked him to dine two or three times mr cohenlupe had begged him to go down to his little place at rickmansworthan entreaty with which montague had not as yet complied lord alfred was always gracious to him and nidderdale and carbury were evidently anxious to make him one of their set at the club many other houses became open to him from the same source though melmotte was supposed to be the inventor of the railway it was known that fisker montague and montague were largely concerned in it and it was known also that paul montague was one of the montagues named in that firm people both in the city and the west end seemed to think that he knew all about it and treated him as though some of the manna falling from that heaven were at his disposition there were results from this which were not unpleasing to the young man he only partially resisted the temptation and though determined at times to probe the affair to the bottom was so determined only at times the money was very pleasant to him the period would now soon arrive before which he understood himself to be pledged not to make a distinct offer to henrietta carbury and when that period should have been passed it would be delightful to him to know that he was possessed of property sufficient to enable him to give a wife a comfortable home in all his aspirations and in all his fears he was true to hetta carbury and made her the centre of his hopes nevertheless had hetta known everything it may be feared that she would have at any rate endeavoured to dismiss him from her heart  there was considerable uneasiness in the bosoms of others of the directors and a disposition to complain against the grand director arising from a grievance altogether different from that which afflicted montague neither had sir felix carbury nor lord nidderdale been invited to sell shares and consequently neither of them had received any remuneration for the use of their names they knew well that montague had sold shares he was quite open on the subject and had told felix whom he hoped some day to regard as his brotherinlaw exactly what shares he had sold and for how muchand the two men had endeavoured to make the matter intelligible between themselves the original price of the shares being £100 each and £12 10s a share having been paid to montague as the premium it was to be supposed that the original capital was reinvested in other shares but each owned to the other that the matter was very complicated to him and montague could only write to hamilton k fisker at san francisco asking for explanation as yet he had received no answer but it was not the wealth flowing into montagues hands which embittered nidderdale and carbury they understood that he had really brought money into the concern and was therefore entitled to take money out of it nor did it occur to them to grudge melmotte his more noble pickings for they knew how great a man was melmotte of cohenlupes doings they heard nothing but he was a regular city man and had probably supplied funds cohenlupe was too deep for their inquiry but they knew that lord alfred had sold shares and had received the profit and they knew also how utterly impossible it was that lord alfred should have produced capital if lord alfred grendall was entitled to plunder why were not they and if their day for plunder had not yet come why lord alfreds and if there was so much cause to fear lord alfred that it was necessary to throw him a bone why should not they also make themselves feared lord alfred passed all his time with melmottehad as these young men said become melmottes head valetand therefore had to be paid but that reason did not satisfy the young men  you havent sold any shareshave you this question sir felix asked lord nidderdale at the club nidderdale was constant in his attendance at the board and felix was not a little afraid that he might be jockied also by him  not a share  nor got any profits  not a shilling of any kind as far as money is concerned my only transaction has been my part of the expense of fiskers dinner  what do you get then by going into the city asked sir felix  im blessed if i know what i get i suppose something will turn up some day  in the meantime you know there are our names and grendall is making a fortune out of it  poor old duffer said his lordship if hes doing so well i think miles ought to be made to pay up something of what he owes i think we ought to tell him that we shall expect him to have the money ready when that bill of vossners comes round  yes by george lets tell him that will you do it  not that it will be the least good it would be quite unnatural to him to pay anything  fellows used to pay their gambling debts said sir felix who was still in funds and who still held a considerable assortment of ious  they dont nowunless they like it how did a fellow manage before if he hadnt got it  he went smash said sir felix and disappeared and was never heard of any more it was just the same as if hed been found cheating i believe a fellow might cheat now and nobodyd say anything  i shouldnt said lord nidderdale whats the use of being beastly illnatured im not very good at saying my prayers but i do think theres something in that bit about forgiving people of course cheating isnt very nice and it isnt very nice for a fellow to play when he knows he cant pay but i dont know that its worse than getting drunk like dolly longestaffe or quarrelling with everybody as grasslough doesor trying to marry some poor devil of a girl merely because shes got money i believe in living in glass houses but i dont believe in throwing stones do you ever read the bible carbury  read the bible wellyesnothat is i suppose i used to do  i often think i shouldnt have been the first to pick up a stone and pitch it at that woman live and letlive thats my motto  but you agree that we ought to do something about these shares said sir felix thinking that this doctrine of forgiveness might be carried too far  oh certainly ill let old grendall live with all my heart but then he ought to let me live too only whos to bell the cat  what cat  its no good our going to old grendall said lord nidderdale who had some understanding in the matter nor yet to young grendall the one would only grunt and say nothing and the other would tell every lie that came into his head the cat in this matter i take to be our great master augustus melmotte  this little meeting occurred on the day after felix carburys return from suffolk and at a time at which as we know it was the great duty of his life to get the consent of old melmotte to his marriage with marie melmotte in doing that he would have to put one bell on the cat and he thought that for the present that was sufficient in his heart of hearts he was afraid of melmotte but then as he knew very well nidderdale was intent on the same object nidderdale he thought was a very queer fellow that talking about the bible and the forgiving of trespasses was very queer and that allusion to the marrying of heiresses very queer indeed he knew that nidderdale wanted to marry the heiress and nidderdale must also know that he wanted to marry her and yet nidderdale was indelicate enough to talk about it and now the man asked who should bell the cat you go there oftener than i do and perhaps you could do it best said sir felix  go where  to the board  but youre always at his house hed be civil to me perhaps because im a lord but then for the same reason hed think i was the bigger fool of the two  i dont see that at all said sir felix  i aint afraid of him if you mean that continued lord nidderdale hes a wretched old reprobate and i dont doubt but hed skin you and me if he could make money off our carcases but as he cant skin me ill have a shy at him on the whole i think he rather likes me because ive always been on the square with him if it depended on him you know i should have the girl tomorrow  would you sir felix did not at all mean to doubt his friends assertion but felt it hard to answer so very strange a statement  but then she dont want me and i aint quite sure that i want her where the devil would a fellow find himself if the money wasnt all there lord nidderdale then sauntered away leaving the baronet in a deep study of thought as to such a condition of things as that which his lordship had suggested where the mischief would he sir felix carbury be if he were to marry the girl and then to find that the money was not all there  on the following friday which was the board day nidderdale went to the great mans offices in abchurch lane and so contrived that he walked with the great man to the board meeting melmotte was always very gracious in his manner to lord nidderdale but had never up to this moment had any speech with his proposed soninlaw about business i wanted just to ask you something said the lord hanging on the chairmans arm  anything you please my lord  dont you think that carbury and i ought to have some shares to sell  no i dontif you ask me  ohi didnt know but why shouldnt we as well as the others  have you and sir felix put any money into it  well if you come to that i dont suppose we have how much has lord alfred put into it  i have taken shares for lord alfred said melmotte putting very heavy emphasis on the personal pronoun if it suits me to advance money to lord alfred grendall i suppose i may do so without asking your lordships consent or that of sir felix carbury  oh certainly i dont want to make inquiry as to what you do with your money  im sure you dont and therefore we wont say anything more about it you wait awhile lord nidderdale and youll find it will come all right if youve got a few thousand pounds loose and will put them into the concern why of course you can sell and if the shares are up can sell at a profit its presumed just at present that at some early day youll qualify for your directorship by doing so and till that is done the shares are allocated to you but cannot be transferred to you  thats it is it said lord nidderdale pretending to understand all about it  if things go on as we hope they will between you and marie you can have pretty nearly any number of shares that you pleasethat is if your father consents to a proper settlement  i hope itll all go smooth im sure said nidderdale thank you im ever so much obliged to you and ill explain it all to carbury     chapter xxiii  yes im a baronet   how eager lady carbury was that her son should at once go in form to maries father and make his proposition may be easily understood my dear felix she said standing over his bedside a little before noon pray dont put it off you dont know how many slips there may be between the cup and the lip  its everything to get him in a good humour pleaded sir felix  but the young lady will feel that she is illused  theres no fear of that shes all right what am i to say to him about money thats the question  i shouldnt think of dictating anything felix  nidderdale when he was on before stipulated for a certain sum down or his father did for him so much cash was to be paid over before the ceremony and it only went off because nidderdale wanted the money to do what he liked with  you wouldnt mind having it settled  noid consent to that on condition that the money was paid down and the income insured to mesay £7000 or £8000 a year i wouldnt do it for less mother it wouldnt be worth while  but you have nothing left of your own  ive got a throat that i can cut and brains that i can blow out said the son using an argument which he conceived might be efficacious with his mother though had she known him she might have been sure that no man lived less likely to cut his own throat or blow out his own brains  oh felix how brutal it is to speak to me in that way  it may be brutal but you know mother business is business you want me to marry this girl because of her money  you want to marry her yourself  im quite a philosopher about it i want her money and when one wants money one should make up ones mind how much or how little one means to takeand whether one is sure to get it  i dont think there can be any doubt  if i were to marry her and if the money wasnt there it would be very like cutting my throat then mother if a man plays and loses he can play again and perhaps win but when a fellow goes in for an heiress and gets the wife without the money he feels a little hampered you know  of course hed pay the money first  its very well to say that of course he ought but it would be rather awkward to refuse to go into church after everything had been arranged because the money hadnt been paid over hes so clever that hed contrive that a man shouldnt know whether the money had been paid or not you cant carry £10000 a year about in your pocket you know if youll go mother perhaps i might think of getting up  lady carbury saw the danger and turned over the affair on every side in her own mind but she could also see the house in grosvenor square the expenditure without limit the congregating duchesses the general acceptation of the people and the mercantile celebrity of the man and she could weigh against that the absolute pennilessness of her baronetson as he was his condition was hopeless such a one must surely run some risk the embarrassments of such a man as lord nidderdale were only temporary there were the family estates and the marquisate and a golden future for him but there was nothing coming to felix in the future  all the goods he would ever have of his own he had nowposition a title and a handsome face surely he could afford to risk something even the ruins and wreck of such wealth as that displayed in grosvenor square would be better than the baronets present condition and then though it was possible that old melmotte should be ruined some day there could be no doubt as to his present means and would it not be probable that he would make hay while the sun shone by securing his daughters position she visited her son again on the next morning which was sunday and again tried to persuade him to the marriage i think you should be content to run a little risk she said  sir felix had been unlucky at cards on saturday night and had taken perhaps a little too much wine he was at any rate sulky and in a humour to resent interference i wish youd leave me alone he said to manage my own business  is it not my business too  no you havent got to marry her and to put up with these people i shall make up my mind what to do myself and i dont want anybody to meddle with me  you ungrateful boy  i understand all about that of course im ungrateful when i dont do everything just as you wish it you dont do any good you only set me against it all  how do you expect to live then are you always to be a burden on me and your sister i wonder that youve no shame your cousin roger is right i will quit london altogether and leave you to your own wretchedness  thats what roger says is it i always thought roger was a fellow of that sort  he is the best friend i have what would roger have thought had he heard this assertion from lady carbury  hes an illtempered closefisted interfering cad and if he meddles with my affairs again i shall tell him what i think of him upon my word mother these little disputes up in my bedroom aint very pleasant of course its your house but if you do allow me a room i think you might let me have it to myself it was impossible for lady carbury in her present mood and in his present mood to explain to him that in no other way and at no other time could she ever find him if she waited till he came down to breakfast he escaped from her in five minutes and then he returned no more till some unholy hour in the morning she was as good a pelican as ever allowed the blood to be torn from her own breast to satisfy the greed of her young but she felt that she should have something back for her bloodsome return for her sacrifices this chick would take all as long as there was a drop left and then resent the fondling of the motherbird as interference again and again there came upon her moments in which she thought that roger carbury was right and yet she knew that when the time came she would not be able to be severe she almost hated herself for the weakness of her own lovebut she acknowledged it if he should fall utterly she must fall with him in spite of his cruelty his callous hardness his insolence to herself his wickedness and ruinous indifference to the future she must cling to him to the last all that she had done and all that she had borne all that she was doing and bearingwas it not for his sake  sir felix had been in grosvenor square since his return from carbury and had seen madame melmotte and marie but he had seen them together and not a word had been said about the engagement he could not make much use of the elder woman she was as gracious as was usual with her but then she was never very gracious she had told him that miss longestaffe was coming to her which was a great bore as the young lady was fatigante upon this marie had declared that she intended to like the young lady very much pooh said madame melmotte you never like no person at all at this marie had looked over to her lover and smiled ah yes that is all very wellwhile it lasts but you care for no friend from which felix had judged that madame melmotte at any rate knew of his offer and did not absolutely disapprove of it on the saturday he had received a note at his club from marie come on sunday at halfpast two you will find papa after lunch this was in his possession when his mother visited him in his bedroom and he had determined to obey the behest but he would not tell her of his intention because he had drunk too much wine and was sulky  at about three on sunday he knocked at the door in grosvenor square and asked for the ladies up to the moment of his knockingeven after he had knocked and when the big porter was opening the doorhe intended to ask for mr melmotte but at the last his courage failed him and he was shown up into the drawingroom there he found madame melmotte marie georgiana longestaffe andlord nidderdale marie looked anxiously into his face thinking that he had already been with her father he slid into a chair close to madame melmotte and endeavoured to seem at his ease lord nidderdale continued his flirtation with miss longestaffea flirtation which she carried on in a half whisper wholly indifferent to her hostess or the young lady of the house we know what brings you here she said  i came on purpose to see you  im sure lord nidderdale you didnt expect to find me here  lord bless you i knew all about it and came on purpose its a great institution isnt it  its an institution you mean to belong topermanently  no indeed i did have thoughts about it as fellows do when they talk of going into the army or to the bar but i couldnt pass that fellow there is the happy man i shall go on coming here because youre here i dont think youll like it a bit you know  i dont suppose i shall lord nidderdale  after a while marie contrived to be alone with her lover near one of the windows for a few seconds papa is downstairs in the bookroom she said lord alfred was told when he came that he was out it was evident to sir felix that everything was prepared for him you go down she continued and ask the man to show you into the bookroom  shall i come up again  no but leave a note for me here under cover to madame didon now sir felix was sufficiently at home in the house to know that madame didon was madame melmottes own woman commonly called didon by the ladies of the family or send it by postunder cover to her that will be better go at once now it certainly did seem to sir felix that the very nature of the girl was altered but he went just shaking hands with madame melmotte and bowing to miss longestaffe  in a few moments he found himself with mr melmotte in the chamber which had been dignified with the name of the bookroom the great financier was accustomed to spend his sunday afternoons here generally with the company of lord alfred grendall it may be supposed that he was meditating on millions and arranging the prices of money and funds for the new york paris and london exchanges but on this occasion he was waked from slumber which he seemed to have been enjoying with a cigar in his mouth how do you do sir felix he said i suppose you want the ladies  ive just been in the drawingroom but i thought id look in on you as i came down it immediately occurred to melmotte that the baronet had come about his share of the plunder out of the railway and he at once resolved to be stern in his manner and perhaps rude also he believed that he should thrive best by resenting any interference with him in his capacity as financier he thought that he had risen high enough to venture on such conduct and experience had told him that men who were themselves only halfplucked might easily be cowed by a savage assumption of superiority and he too had generally the advantage of understanding the game while those with whom he was concerned did not at any rate more than half understand it he could thus trade either on the timidity or on the ignorance of his colleagues when neither of these sufficed to give him undisputed mastery then he cultivated the cupidity of his friends he liked young associates because they were more timid and less greedy than their elders lord nidderdales suggestions had soon been put at rest and mr melmotte anticipated no greater difficulty with sir felix lord alfred he had been obliged to buy  im very glad to see you and all that said melmotte assuming a certain exaltation of the eyebrows which they who had many dealings with him often found to be very disagreeable but this is hardly a day for business sir felix noryet a place for business  sir felix wished himself at the beargarden he certainly had come about businessbusiness of a particular sort but marie had told him that of all days sunday would be the best and had also told him that her father was more likely to be in a good humour on sunday than on any other day sir felix felt that he had not been received with good humour i didnt mean to intrude mr melmotte he said  i dare say not i only thought id tell you you might have been going to speak about that railway  oh dear no  your mother was saying to me down in the county that she hoped you attended to the business i told her that there was nothing to attend to  my mother doesnt understand anything at all about it said sir felix  women never do wellwhat can i do for you now that you are here  mr melmotte im comeim come toin short mr melmotte i want to propose myself as a suitor for your daughters hand  the d you do  well yes and we hope youll give us your consent  she knows youre coming then  yesshe knows  and my wifedoes she know  ive never spoken to her about it perhaps miss melmotte has  and how long have you and she understood each other  ive been attached to her ever since i saw her said sir felix i have indeed ive spoken to her sometimes you know how that kind of thing goes on  im blessed if i do i know how it ought to go on i know that when large sums of money are supposed to be concerned the young man should speak to the father before he speaks to the girl hes a fool if he dont if he wants to get the fathers money so she has given you a promise  i dont know about a promise  do you consider that shes engaged to you  not if shes disposed to get out of it said sir felix hoping that he might thus ingratiate himself with the father of course i should be awfully disappointed  she has consented to your coming to me  well yesin a sort of a way of course she knows that it all depends on you  not at all shes of age if she chooses to marry you she can marry you if thats all you want her consent is enough youre a baronet i believe  oh yes im a baronet  and therefore youve come to your own property you havent to wait for your father to die and i dare say you are indifferent about money  this was a view of things which sir felix felt that he was bound to dispel even at the risk of offending the father not exactly that he said i suppose you will give your daughter a fortune of course  then i wonder you didnt come to me before you went to her if my daughter marries to please me i shall give her money no doubt how much is neither here nor there if she marries to please herself without considering me i shant give her a farthing  i had hoped that you might consent mr melmotte  ive said nothing about that it is possible youre a man of fashion and have a title of your ownand no doubt a property if youll show me that youve an income fit to maintain her ill think about it at any rate what is your property sir felix  what could three or four thousand a year or even five or six matter to a man like melmotte it was thus that sir felix looked at it when a man can hardly count his millions he ought not to ask questions about trifling sums of money but the question had been asked and the asking of such a question was no doubt within the prerogative of a proposed fatherinlaw at any rate it must be answered for a moment it occurred to sir felix that he might conveniently tell the truth it would be nasty for the moment but there would be nothing to come after were he to do so he could not be dragged down lower and lower into the mire by crossexaminings there might be an end of all his hopes but there would at the same time be an end of all his misery but he lacked the necessary courage it isnt a large property you know he said  not like the marquis of westminsters i suppose said the horrid big rich scoundrel  nonot quite like that said sir felix with a sickly laugh  but you have got enough to support a baronets title  that depends on how you want to support it said sir felix putting off the evil day  wheres your family seat  carbury manor down in suffolk near the longestaffes is the old family place  that doesnt belong to you said melmotte very sharply  no not yet but im the heir  perhaps if there is one thing in england more difficult than another to be understood by men born and bred out of england it is the system under which titles and property descend together or in various lines the jurisdiction of our courts of law is complex and so is the business of parliament but the rules regulating them though anomalous are easy to the memory compared with the mixed anomalies of the peerage and primogeniture they who are brought up among it learn it as children do a language but strangers who begin the study in advanced life seldom make themselves perfect in it it was everything to melmotte that he should understand the ways of the country which he had adopted and when he did not understand he was clever at hiding his ignorance now he was puzzled he knew that sir felix was a baronet and therefore presumed him to be the head of the family he knew that carbury manor belonged to roger carbury and he judged by the name it must be an old family property and now the baronet declared that he was heir to the man who was simply an esquire oh the heir are you but how did he get it before you youre the head of the family  yes i am the head of the family of course said sir felix lying directly but the place wont be mine till he dies it would take a long time to explain it all  hes a young man isnt he  nonot what youd call a young man he isnt very old  if he were to marry and have children how would it be then  sir felix was beginning to think that he might have told the truth with discretion i dont quite know how it would be i have always understood that i am the heir its not very likely that he will marry  and in the meantime what is your own property  my father left me money in the funds and in railway stockand then i am my mothers heir  you have done me the honour of telling me that you wish to marry my daughter  certainly  would you then object to inform me the amount and nature of the income on which you intend to support your establishment as a married man i fancy that the position you assume justifies the question on my part the bloated swindler the vile city ruffian was certainly taking a most ungenerous advantage of the young aspirant for wealth it was then that sir felix felt his own position was he not a baronet and a gentleman and a very handsome fellow and a man of the world who had been in a crack regiment if this surfeited sponge of speculation this crammed commercial cormorant wanted more than that for his daughter why could he not say so without asking disgusting questions such as thesequestions which it was quite impossible that a gentleman should answer was it not sufficiently plain that any gentleman proposing to marry the daughter of such a man as melmotte must do so under the stress of pecuniary embarrassment would it not be an understood bargain that as he provided the rank and position she would provide the money and yet the vulgar wretch took advantage of his assumed authority to ask these dreadful questions sir felix stood silent trying to look the man in the face but failingwishing that he was well out of the house and at the beargarden you dont seem to be very clear about your own circumstances sir felix perhaps you will get your lawyer to write to me  perhaps that will be best said the lover  either that or to give it up my daughter no doubt will have money but money expects money at this moment lord alfred entered the room youre very late today alfred why didnt you come as you said you would  i was here more than an hour ago and they said you were out  i havent been out of this room all dayexcept to lunch good morning sir felix ring the bell alfred and well have a little soda and brandy sir felix had gone through some greeting with his fellow director lord alfred and at last succeeded in getting melmotte to shake hands with him before he went do you know anything about that young fellow melmotte asked as soon as the door was closed  hes a baronet without a shillingwas in the army and had to leave it said lord alfred as he buried his face in a big tumbler  without a shilling i supposed so but hes heir to a place down in suffolkeh  not a bit of it its the same name and thats about all mr carbury has a small property there and he might give it to me tomorrow i wish he would though there isnt much of it that young fellow has nothing to do with it whatever  hasnt he now mr melmotte as he speculated upon it almost admired the young mans impudence     chapter xxiv  miles grendalls triumph   sir felix as he walked down to his club felt that he had been checkmatedand was at the same time full of wrath at the insolence of the man who had so easily beaten him out of the field as far as he could see the game was over no doubt he might marry marie melmotte the father had told him so much himself and he perfectly believed the truth of that oath which marie had sworn he did not doubt but that shed stick to him close enough she was in love with him which was natural and was a foolwhich was perhaps also natural but romance was not the game which he was playing people told him that when girls succeeded in marrying without their parents consent fathers were always constrained to forgive them at last that might be the case with ordinary fathers but melmotte was decidedly not an ordinary father he wasso sir felix declared to himselfperhaps the greatest brute ever created sir felix could not but remember that elevation of the eyebrows and the brazen forehead and the hard mouth he had found himself quite unable to stand up against melmotte and now he cursed and swore at the man as he was carried down to the beargarden in a cab  but what should he do should he abandon marie melmotte altogether never go to grosvenor square again and drop the whole family including the great mexican railway then an idea occurred to him nidderdale had explained to him the result of his application for shares you see we havent bought any and therefore cant sell any there seems to be something in that i shall explain it all to my governor and get him to go a thou or two if he sees his way to get the money back hed do that and let me have the difference on that sunday afternoon sir felix thought over all this why shouldnt he go a thou and get the difference he made a mental calculation £12 10s per £100 £125 for a thousand and all paid in ready money as far as sir felix could understand directly the one operation had been perfected the thousand pounds would be available for another as he looked into it with all his intelligence he thought that he began to perceive that that was the way in which the melmottes of the world made their money there was but one objection he had not got the entire thousand pounds but luck had been on the whole very good to him he had more than the half of it in real money lying at a bank in the city at which he had opened an account and he had very much more than the remainder in ious from dolly longestaffe and miles grendall in fact if every man had his ownand his bosom glowed with indignation as he reflected on the injustice with which he was kept out of his ownhe could go into the city and take up his shares tomorrow and still have ready money at his command if he could do this would not such conduct on his part be the best refutation of that charge of not having any fortune which melmotte had brought against him he would endeavour to work the money out of dolly longestaffeand he entertained an idea that though it would be impossible to get cash from miles grendall he might use his claim against miles in the city miles was secretary to the board and might perhaps contrive that the money required for the shares should not be all ready money sir felix was not very clear about it but thought that he might possibly in this way use the indebtedness of miles grendall how i do hate a fellow who does not pay up he said to himself as he sat alone in his club waiting for some friend to come in and he formed in his head draconic laws which he would fain have executed upon men who lost money at play and did not pay how the deuce fellows can look one in the face is what i cant understand he said to himself  he thought over this great stroke of exhibiting himself to melmotte as a capitalist till he gave up his idea of abandoning his suit so he wrote a note to marie melmotte in accordance with her instructions      dear m     your father cut up very rough about money perhaps you had better    see him yourself or would your mother     yours always     f   this as directed he put under cover to madame didongrosvenor square and posted at the club he had put nothing at any rate in the letter which would commit him  there was generally on sundays a house dinner so called at eight oclock five or six men would sit down and would always gamble afterwards on this occasion dolly longestaffe sauntered in at about seven in quest of sherry and bitters and felix found the opportunity a good one to speak of his money you couldnt cash your ious for me tomorrowcould you  tomorrow oh lord  ill tell you why you know id tell you anything because i think we are really friends im after that daughter of melmottes  im told youre to have her  i dont know about that i mean to try at any rate ive gone in you know for that board in the city  i dont know anything about boards my boy  yes you do dolly you remember that american fellow montagues friend that was here one night and won all our money  the chap that had the waistcoat and went away in the morning to california fancy starting to california after a hard night i always wondered whether he got there alive  welli cant explain to you all about it because you hate those kinds of things  and because i am such a fool  i dont think youre a fool at all but it would take a week but its absolutely essential for me to take up a lot of shares in the city tomorrowor perhaps wednesday might do im bound to pay for them and old melmotte will think that im utterly hard up if i dont indeed he said as much and the only objection about me and this girl of his is as to money cant you understand now how important it may be  its always important to have a lot of money i know that  i shouldnt have gone in for this kind of thing if i hadnt thought i was sure you know how much you owe me dont you  not in the least  its about eleven hundred pounds  i shouldnt wonder  and miles grendall owes me two thousand grasslough and nidderdale when they lose always pay with miless ious  so should i if i had them  itll come to that soon that there wont be any other stuff going and they really aint worth anything i dont see whats the use of playing when this rubbish is shoved about the table as for grendall himself he has no feeling about it  not the least i should say  youll try and get me the money wont you dolly  melmotte has been at me twice he wants me to agree to sell something hes an old thief and of course he means to rob me you may tell him that if hell let me have the money in the way ive proposed you are to have a thousand pounds out of it i dont know any other way  you could write me thatin a business sort of way  i couldnt do that carbury whats the use i never write any letters i cant do it you tell him that and if the sale comes off ill make it straight  miles grendall also dined there and after dinner in the smokingroom sir felix tried to do a little business with the secretary he began his operations with unusual courtesy believing that the man must have some influence with the great distributor of shares  im going to take up my shares in that company said sir felix  ahindeed and miles enveloped himself from head to foot in smoke  i didnt quite understand about it but nidderdale saw melmotte and he has explained it i think i shall go in for a couple of thousand on wednesday  ohah  it will be the proper thing to dowont it  very goodthing to do miles grendall smoked harder and harder as the suggestions were made to him  is it always ready money  always ready money said miles shaking his head as though in reprobation of so abominable an institution  i suppose they allow some time to their own directors if a deposit say 50 per cent is made for the shares  theyll give you half the number which would come to the same thing  sir felix turned this over in his mind but let him look at it as he would could not see the truth of his companions remark you know i should want to sell againfor the rise  oh youll want to sell again  and therefore i must have the full number  you could sell half the number you know said miles  im determined to begin with ten sharesthats £1000 welli have got the money but i dont want to draw out so much couldnt you manage for me that i should get them on paying 50 per cent down  melmotte does all that himself  you could explain you know that you are a little short in your own payments to me this sir felix said thinking it to be a delicate mode of introducing his claim upon the secretary  thats private said miles frowning  of course its private but if you would pay me the money i could buy the shares with it though they are public  i dont think we could mix the two things together carbury  you cant help me  not in that way  then when the deuce will you pay me what you owe me sir felix was driven to this plain expression of his demand by the impassibility of his debtor here was a man who did not pay his debts of honour who did not even propose any arrangement for paying them and who yet had the impudence to talk of not mixing up private matters with affairs of business it made the young baronet very sick miles grendall smoked on in silence there was a difficulty in answering the question and he therefore made no answer do you know how much you owe me continued the baronet determined to persist now that he had commenced the attack there was a little crowd of other men in the room and the conversation about the shares had been commenced in an undertone these two last questions sir felix had asked in a whisper but his countenance showed plainly that he was speaking in anger  of course i know said miles  well  im not going to talk about it here  not going to talk about it here  no this is a public room  i am going to talk about it said sir felix raising his voice  will any fellow come upstairs and play a game of billiards said miles grendall rising from his chair then he walked slowly out of the room leaving sir felix to take what revenge he pleased for a moment sir felix thought that he would expose the transaction to the whole room but he was afraid thinking that miles grendall was a more popular man than himself  it was sunday night but not the less were the gamblers assembled in the cardroom at about eleven dolly longestaffe was there and with him the two lords and sir felix and miles grendall of course and i regret to say a much better man than any of them paul montague sir felix had doubted much as to the propriety of joining the party what was the use of playing with a man who seemed by general consent to be liberated from any obligation to pay but then if he did not play with him where should he find another gambling table they began with whist but soon laid that aside and devoted themselves to loo the least respected man in that confraternity was grendall and yet it was in compliance with the persistency of his suggestion that they gave up the nobler game lets stick to whist i like cutting out said grasslough its much more jolly having nothing to do now and then one can always bet said dolly shortly afterwards i hate loo said sir felix in answer to a third application i like whist best said nidderdale but ill play anything anybody likespitch and toss if you please but miles grendall had his way and loo was the game  at about two oclock grendall was the only winner the play had not been very high but nevertheless he had won largely whenever a large pool had collected itself he swept it into his garners the men opposed to him hardly grudged him this stroke of luck he had hitherto been unlucky and they were able to pay him with his own paper which was so valueless that they parted with it without a pang even dolly longestaffe seemed to have a supply of it the only man there not so furnished was montague and while the sums won were quite small he was allowed to pay with cash but to sir felix it was frightful to see ready money going over to miles grendall as under no circumstances could it be got back from him montague he said just change these for the time ill take them back if you still have them when weve done and he handed a lot of miless paper across the table the result of course would be that felix would receive so much real money and that miles would get back more of his own worthless paper to montague it would make no difference and he did as he was askedor rather was preparing to do so when miles interfered on what principle of justice could sir felix come between him and another man i dont understand this kind of thing he said when i win from you carbury ill take my ious as long as you have any  by george thats kind  but i wont have them handed about the table to be changed  pay them yourself then said sir felix laying a handful down on the table  dont lets have a row said lord nidderdale  carbury is always making a row said grasslough  of course he is said miles grendall  i dont make more row than anybody else but i do say that as we have such a lot of these things and as we all know that we dont get cash for them as we want it grendall shouldnt take money and walk off with it  who is walking off said miles  and why should you be entitled to montagues money more than any of us asked grasslough  the matter was debated and was thus decided it was not to be allowed that miless paper should be negotiated at the table in the manner that sir felix had attempted to adopt but mr grendall pledged his honour that when they broke up the party he would apply any money that he might have won to the redemption of his ious paying a regular percentage to the holders of them the decision made sir felix very cross he knew that their condition at six or seven in the morning would not be favourable to such commercial accuracywhich indeed would require an accountant to effect it and he felt sure that miles if still a winner would in truth walk off with the ready money  for a considerable time he did not speak and became very moderate in his play tossing his cards about almost always losing but losing a minimum and watching the board he was sitting next to grendall and he thought that he observed that his neighbour moved his chair farther and farther away from him and nearer to dolly longestaffe who was next to him on the other side this went on for an hour during which grendall still wonand won heavily from paul montague i never saw a fellow have such a run of luck in my life said grasslough youve had two trumps dealt to you every hand almost since we began  ever so many hands i havent played at all said miles  youve always won when ive played said dolly ive been looed every time  you oughtnt to begrudge me one run of luck when ive lost so much said miles who since he began had destroyed paper counters of his own making supposed to represent considerably above £1000 and had alsowhich was of infinitely greater concern to himreceived an amount of ready money which was quite a godsend to him  whats the good of talking about it said nidderdale i hate all this row about winning and losing lets go on or go to bed the idea of going to bed was absurd so they went on sir felix however hardly spoke at all played very little and watched miles grendall without seeming to watch him at last he felt certain that he saw a card go into the mans sleeve and remembered at the moment that the winner had owed his success to a continued run of aces he was tempted to rush at once upon the player and catch the card on his person but he feared grendall was a big man and where would he be if there should be no card there and then in the scramble there would certainly be at any rate a doubt and he knew that the men around him would be most unwilling to believe such an accusation grasslough was grendalls friend and nidderdale and dolly longestaffe would infinitely rather be cheated than suspect any one of their own set of cheating them he feared both the violence of the man he should accuse and also the unpassive good humour of the others he let that opportunity pass by again watched and again saw the card abstracted thrice he saw it till it was wonderful to him that others also should not see it as often as the deal came round the man did it felix watched more closely and was certain that in each round the man had an ace at least once it seemed to him that nothing could be easier at last he pleaded a headache got up and went away leaving the others playing he had lost nearly a thousand pounds but it had been all in paper theres something the matter with that fellow said grasslough  theres always something the matter with him i think said miles he is so awfully greedy about his money miles had become somewhat triumphant in his success  the less said about that grendall the better said nidderdale we have put up with a good deal you know and he has put up with as much as anybody miles was cowed at once and went on dealing without manoeuvring a card on that hand     chapter xxv  in grosvenor square   marie melmotte was hardly satisfied with the note which she received from didon early on the monday morning with a volubility of french eloquence didon declared that she would be turned out of the house if either monsieur or madame were to know what she was doing marie told her that madame would certainly never dismiss her well perhaps not madame said didon who knew too much about madame to be dismissed but monsieur marie declared that by no possibility could monsieur know anything about it in that house nobody ever told anything to monsieur he was regarded as the general enemy against whom the whole household was always making ambushes always firing guns from behind rocks and trees it is not a pleasant condition for a master of a house but in this house the master at any rate knew how he was placed it never occurred to him to trust any one of course his daughter might run away but who would run away with her without money and there could be no money except from him he knew himself and his own strength he was not the man to forgive a girl and then bestow his wealth on the lothario who had injured him his daughter was valuable to him because she might make him the fatherinlaw of a marquis or an earl but the higher that he rose without such assistance the less need had he of his daughters aid lord alfred was certainly very useful to him lord alfred had whispered into his ear that by certain conduct and by certain uses of his money he himself might be made a baronet but if they should say that im not an englishman suggested melmotte lord alfred had explained that it was not necessary that he should have been born in england or even that he should have an english name no questions would be asked let him first get into parliament and then spend a little money on the proper sideby which lord alfred meant the conservative sideand be munificent in his entertainments and the baronetcy would be almost a matter of course indeed there was no knowing what honours might not be achieved in the present days by money scattered with a liberal hand in these conversations melmotte would speak of his money and power of making money as though they were unlimitedand lord alfred believed him  marie was dissatisfied with her letternot because it described her father as cutting up rough to her who had known her father all her life that was a matter of course but there was no word of love in the note an impassioned correspondence carried on through didon would be delightful to her she was quite capable of loving and she did love the young man she had no doubt consented to accept the addresses of others whom she did not lovebut this she had done at the moment almost of her first introduction to the marvellous world in which she was now living as days went on she ceased to be a child and her courage grew within her she became conscious of an identity of her own which feeling was produced in great part by the contempt which accompanied her increasing familiarity with grand people and grand names and grand things she was no longer afraid of saying no to the nidderdales on account of any awe of them personally it might be that she should acknowledge herself to be obliged to obey her father though she was drifting away even from the sense of that obligation had her mind been as it was now when lord nidderdale first came to her she might indeed have loved him who as a man was infinitely better than sir felix and who had he thought it to be necessary would have put some grace into his lovemaking but at that time she had been childish he finding her to be a child had hardly spoken to her and she child though she was had resented such usage but a few months in london had changed all this and now she was a child no longer she was in love with sir felix and had told her love whatever difficulties there might be she intended to be true if necessary she would run away sir felix was her idol and she abandoned herself to its worship but she desired that her idol should be of flesh and blood and not of wood she was at first halfinclined to be angry but as she sat with his letter in her hand she remembered that he did not know didon as well as she did and that he might be afraid to trust his raptures to such custody she could write to him at his club and having no such fear she could write warmly      grosvenor square early monday morning     dearest dearest felix     i have just got your notesuch a scrap of course papa would    talk about money because he never thinks of anything else i dont    know anything about money and i dont care in the least how much    you have got papa has got plenty and i think he would give us    some if we were once married i have told mamma but mamma is    always afraid of everything papa is very cross to her sometimes    more so than to me i will try to tell him though i cant always    get at him i very often hardly see him all day long but i dont    mean to be afraid of him and will tell him that on my word and    honour i will never marry any one except you i dont think he    will beat me but if he does ill bear itfor your sake he does    beat mamma sometimes i know     you can write to me quite safely through didon i think if you    would call some day and give her something it would help as she    is very fond of money do write and tell me that you love me i    love you better than anything in the world and i will nevernever    give you up i suppose you can come and callunless papa tells the    man in the hall not to let you in ill find that out from didon    but i cant do it before sending this letter papa dined out    yesterday somewhere with that lord alfred so i havent seen him    since you were here i never see him before he goes into the city    in the morning now i am going downstairs to breakfast with mamma    and that miss longestaffe she is a stuckup thing didnt you    think so at caversham     goodbye you are my own own own darling felix     and i am your own own affectionate ladylove     marie   sir felix when he read this letter at his club in the afternoon of the monday turned up his nose and shook his head he thought if there were much of that kind of thing to be done he could not go on with it even though the marriage were certain and the money secure what an infernal little ass he said to himself as he crumpled the letter up  marie having intrusted her letter to didon together with a little present of gloves and shoes went down to breakfast her mother was the first there and miss longestaffe soon followed that lady when she found that she was not expected to breakfast with the master of the house abandoned the idea of having her meal sent to her in her own room madame melmotte she must endure with madame melmotte she had to go out in the carriage every day indeed she could only go to those parties to which madame melmotte accompanied her if the london season was to be of any use at all she must accustom herself to the companionship of madame melmotte the man kept himself very much apart from her she met him only at dinner and that not often madame melmotte was very bad but she was silent and seemed to understand that her guest was only her guest as a matter of business  but miss longestaffe already perceived that her old acquaintances were changed in their manner to her she had written to her dear friend lady monogram whom she had known intimately as miss triplex and whose marriage with sir damask monogram had been splendid preferment telling how she had been kept down in suffolk at the time of her friends last party and how she had been driven to consent to return to london as the guest of madame melmotte she hoped her friend would not throw her off on that account she had been very affectionate with a poor attempt at fun and rather humble georgiana longestaffe had never been humble before but the monograms were people so much thought of and in such an excellent set she would do anything rather then lose the monograms but it was of no use she had been humble in vain for lady monogram had not even answered her note she never really cared for anybody but herself georgiana said in her wretched solitude then too she had found that lord nidderdales manner to her had been quite changed she was not a fool and could read these signs with sufficient accuracy there had been little flirtations between her and nidderdalemeaning nothing as every one knew that nidderdale must marry money but in none of them had he spoken to her as he spoke when he met her in madame melmottes drawingroom she could see it in the faces of people as they greeted her in the park especially in the faces of the men she had always carried herself with a certain high demeanour and had been able to maintain it all that was now gone from her and she knew it though the thing was as yet but a few days old she understood that others understood that she had degraded herself whats all this about lord grasslough had said to her seeing her come into a room behind madame melmotte she had simpered had tried to laugh and had then turned away her face  impudent scoundrel she said to herself knowing that a fortnight ago he would not have dared to address her in such a tone  a day or two afterwards an occurrence took place worthy of commemoration dolly longestaffe called on his sister his mind must have been much stirred when he allowed himself to be moved to such uncommon action he came too at a very early hour not much after noon when it was his custom to be eating his breakfast in bed he declared at once to the servant that he did not wish to see madame melmotte or any of the family he had called to see his sister he was therefore shown into a separate room where georgiana joined him  whats all this about  she tried to laugh as she tossed her head what brings you here i wonder this is quite an unexpected compliment  my being here doesnt matter i can go anywhere without doing much harm why are you staying with these people  ask papa  i dont suppose he sent you here  thats just what he did do  you neednt have come i suppose unless you liked it is it because they are none of them coming up  exactly that dolly what a wonderful young man you are for guessing  dont you feel ashamed of yourself  nonot a bit  then i feel ashamed for you  everybody comes here  noeverybody does not come and stay here as you are doing everybody doesnt make themselves a part of the family i have heard of nobody doing it except you i thought you used to think so much of yourself  i think as much of myself as ever i did said georgiana hardly able to restrain her tears  i can tell you nobody else will think much of you if you remain here i could hardly believe it when nidderdale told me  what did he say dolly  he didnt say much to me but i could see what he thought and of course everybody thinks the same how you can like the people yourself is what i cant understand  i dont like themi hate them  then why do you come and live with them  oh dolly it is impossible to make you understand a man is so different you can go just where you please and do what you like and if youre short of money people will give you credit and you can live by yourself and all that sort of thing how should you like to be shut up down at caversham all the season  i shouldnt mind itonly for the governor  you have got a property of your own your fortune is made for you what is to become of me  you mean about marrying  i mean altogether said the poor girl unable to be quite as explicit with her brother as she had been with her father and mother and sister of course i have to think of myself  i dont see how the melmottes are to help you the long and the short of it is you oughtnt to be here its not often i interfere but when i heard it i thought id come and tell you i shall write to the governor and tell him too he should have known better  dont write to papa dolly  yes i shall i am not going to see everything going to the devil without saying a word goodbye  as soon as he had left he hurried down to some club that was opennot the beargarden as it was long before the beargarden hoursand actually did write a letter to his father   my dear father  i have seen georgiana at mr melmottes house she ought not to be there i suppose you dont know it but everybody says hes a swindler for the sake of the family i hope you will get her home again it seems to me that bruton street is the proper place for the girls at this time of the year  your affectionate son  adolphus longestaffe   this letter fell upon old mr longestaffe at caversham like a thunderbolt it was marvellous to him that his son should have been instigated to write a letter the melmottes must be very bad indeed worse than he had thoughtor their iniquities would not have brought about such energy as this but the passage which angered him most was that which told him that he ought to have taken his family back to town this had come from his son who had refused to do anything to help him in his difficulties     chapter xxvi  mrs hurtle   paul montague at this time lived in comfortable lodgings in sackville street and ostensibly the world was going well with him but he had many troubles his troubles in reference to fisker montague and montagueand also their consolationare already known to the reader he was troubled too about his love though when he allowed his mind to expatiate on the success of the great railway he would venture to hope that on that side his life might perhaps be blessed henrietta had at any rate as yet showed no disposition to accept her cousins offer he was troubled too about the gambling which he disliked knowing that in that direction there might be speedy ruin and yet returning to it from day to day in spite of his own conscience but there was yet another trouble which culminated just at this time one morning not long after that sunday night which had been so wretchedly spent at the beargarden he got into a cab in piccadilly and had himself taken to a certain address in islington here he knocked at a decent modest door at such a house as men live in with two or three hundred a yearand asked for mrs hurtle yesmrs hurtle lodged there and he was shown into the drawingroom there he stood by the round table for a quarter of an hour turning over the lodginghouse books which lay there and then mrs hurtle entered the room mrs hurtle was a widow whom he had once promised to marry paul she said with a quick sharp voice but with a voice which could be very pleasant when she pleasedtaking him by the hand as she spoke paul say that that letter of yours must go for nothing say that it shall be so and i will forgive everything  i cannot say that he replied laying his hand on hers  you cannot say it what do you mean will you dare to tell me that your promises to me are to go for nothing  things are changed said paul hoarsely he had come thither at her bidding because he had felt that to remain away would be cowardly but the meeting was inexpressibly painful to him he did think that he had sufficient excuse for breaking his troth to this woman but the justification of his conduct was founded on reasons which he hardly knew how to plead to her he had heard that of her past life which had he heard it before would have saved him from his present difficulty but he had loved herdid love her in a certain fashion and her offences such as they were did not debar her from his sympathies  how are they changed i am two years older if you mean that as she said this she looked round at the glass as though to see whether she was become so haggard with age as to be unfit to become this mans wife she was very lovely with a kind of beauty which we seldom see now in these days men regard the form and outward lines of a womans face and figure more than either the colour or the expression and women fit themselves to mens eyes with padding and false hair without limit a figure may be constructed of almost any dimensions the sculptors who construct them male and female hairdressers and milliners are very skilful and figures are constructed of noble dimensions sometimes with voluptuous expansion sometimes with classic reticence sometimes with dishevelled negligence which becomes very dishevelled indeed when long out of the sculptors hands colours indeed are added but not the colours which we used to love the taste for flesh and blood has for the day given place to an appetite for horsehair and pearl powder but mrs hurtle was not a beauty after the present fashion she was very darka dark brunettewith large round blue eyes that could indeed be soft but could also be very severe her silken hair almost black hung in a thousand curls all round her head and neck her cheeks and lips and neck were full and the blood would come and go giving a varying expression to her face with almost every word she spoke her nose also was full and had something of the pug but nevertheless it was a nose which any man who loved her would swear to be perfect her mouth was large and she rarely showed her teeth her chin was full marked by a large dimple and as it ran down to her neck was beginning to form a second her bust was full and beautifully shaped but she invariably dressed as though she were oblivious or at any rate neglectful of her own charms her dress as montague had seen her was always blacknot a sad weeping widows garment but silk or woollen or cotton as the case might be always new always nice always wellfitting and most especially always simple she was certainly a most beautiful woman and she knew it she looked as though she knew itbut only after that fashion in which a woman ought to know it of her age she had never spoken to montague she was in truth over thirtyperhaps almost as near thirtyfive as thirty but she was one of those whom years hardly seem to touch  you are beautiful as ever you were he said  psha do not tell me of that i care nothing for my beauty unless it can bind me to your love sit down there and tell me what it means then she let go his hand and seated herself opposite to the chair which she gave him  i told you in my letter  you told me nothing in your letterexcept that it was to beoff why is it to beoff do you not love me then she threw herself upon her knees and leaned upon his and looked up in his face paul she said i have come across the atlantic on purpose to see youafter so many monthsand will you not give me one kiss even though you should leave me for ever give me one kiss of course he kissed her not once but with a long warm embrace how could it have been otherwise with all his heart he wished that she would have remained away but while she knelt there at his feet what could he do but embrace her now tell me everything she said seating herself on a footstool at his feet  she certainly did not look like a woman whom a man might illtreat or scorn with impunity paul felt even while she was lavishing her caresses upon him that she might too probably turn and rend him before he left her he had known something of her temper before though he had also known the truth and warmth of her love he had travelled with her from san francisco to england and she had been very good to him in illness in distress of mind and in povertyfor he had been almost penniless in new york when they landed at liverpool they were engaged as man and wife he had told her all his affairs had given her the whole history of his life this was before his second journey to america when hamilton k fisker was unknown to him but she had told him little or nothing of her own lifebut that she was a widow and that she was travelling to paris on business when he left her at the london railway station from which she started for dover he was full of all a lovers ardour he had offered to go with her but that she had declined but when he remembered that he must certainly tell his friend roger of his engagement and remembered also how little he knew of the lady to whom he was engaged he became embarrassed what were her means he did not know he did know that she was some years older than himself and that she had spoken hardly a word to him of her own family she had indeed said that her husband had been one of the greatest miscreants ever created and had spoken of her release from him as the one blessing she had known before she had met paul montague but it was only when he thought of all this after she had left himonly when he reflected how bald was the story which he must tell roger carburythat he became dismayed such had been the womans cleverness such her charm so great her power of adaptation that he had passed weeks in her daily company with still progressing intimacy and affection without feeling that anything had been missing  he had told his friend and his friend had declared to him that it was impossible that he should marry a woman whom he had met in a railway train without knowing something about her roger did all he could to persuade the lover to forget his loveand partially succeeded it is so pleasant and so natural that a young man should enjoy the company of a clever beautiful woman on a long journeyso natural that during the journey he should allow himself to think that she may during her whole life be all in all to him as she is at that momentand so natural again that he should see his mistake when he has parted from her but montague though he was half false to his widow was half true to her he had pledged his word and that he said ought to bind him then he returned to california and learned through the instrumentality of hamilton k fisker that in san francisco mrs hurtle was regarded as a mystery some people did not quite believe that there ever had been a mr hurtle others said that there certainly had been a mr hurtle and that to the best of their belief he still existed the fact however best known of her was that she had shot a man through the head somewhere in oregon she had not been tried for it as the world of oregon had considered that the circumstances justified the deed everybody knew that she was very clever and very beautifulbut everybody also thought that she was very dangerous she always had money when she was here hamilton fisker said but no one knew where it came from then he wanted to know why paul inquired i dont think you know that i should like to go in for a life partnership if you mean that said hamilton k fisker  montague had seen her in new york as he passed through on his second journey to san francisco and had then renewed his promises in spite of his cousins caution he told her that he was going to see what he could make of his broken fortunesfor at this time as the reader will remember there was no great railway in existenceand she had promised to follow him since that they had never met till this day she had not made the promised journey to san francisco at any rate before he had left it letters from her had reached him in england and these he had answered by explaining to her or endeavouring to explain that their engagement must be at an end and now she had followed him to london tell me everything she said leaning upon him and looking up into his face  but youwhen did you arrive here  here at this house i arrived the night before last on tuesday i reached liverpool there i found that you were probably in london and so i came on i have come only to see you i can understand that you should have been estranged from me that journey home is now so long ago our meeting in new york was so short and wretched i would not tell you because you then were poor yourself but at that moment i was penniless i have got my own now out from the very teeth of robbers as she said this she looked as though she could be very persistent in claiming her ownor what she might think to be her own i could not get across to san francisco as i said i would and when i was there you had quarrelled with your uncle and returned and now i am here i at any rate have been faithful as she said this his arm was again thrown over her so as to press her head to his knee and now she said tell me about yourself  his position was embarrassing and very odious to himself had he done his duty properly he would gently have pushed her from him have sprung to his legs and have declared that however faulty might have been his previous conduct he now found himself bound to make her understand that he did not intend to become her husband but he was either too much of a man or too little of a man for conduct such as that he did make the avowal to himself even at that moment as she sat there let the matter go as it would she should never be his wife he would marry no one unless it was hetta carbury but he did not at all know how to get this said with proper emphasis and yet with properly apologetic courtesy i am engaged here about this railway he said you have heard i suppose of our projected scheme  heard of it san francisco is full of it hamilton fisker is the great man of the day there and when i left your uncle was buying a villa for seventyfour thousand dollars and yet they say that the best of it all has been transferred to you londoners many there are very hard upon fisker for coming here and doing as he did  its doing very well i believe said paul with some feeling of shame as he thought how very little he knew about it  you are the manager here in england  noi am a member of the firm that manages it at san francisco but the real manager here is our chairman mr melmotte  ah i have heard of him he is a great mana frenchman is he not there was a talk of inviting him to california you know him of course  yesi know him i see him once a week  i would sooner see that man than your queen or any of your dukes or lords they tell me that he holds the world of commerce in his right hand what powerwhat grandeur  grand enough said paul if it all came honestly  such a man rises above honesty said mrs hurtle as a great general rises above humanity when he sacrifices an army to conquer a nation such greatness is incompatible with small scruples a pigmy man is stopped by a little ditch but a giant stalks over the rivers  i prefer to be stopped by the ditches said montague  ah paul you were not born for commerce and i will grant you this that commerce is not noble unless it rises to great heights to live in plenty by sticking to your counter from nine in the morning to nine at night is not a fine life but this man with a scratch of his pen can send out or call in millions of dollars do they say here that he is not honest  as he is my partner in this affair perhaps i had better say nothing against him  of course such a man will be abused people have said that napoleon was a coward and washington a traitor you must take me where i shall see melmotte he is a man whose hand i would kiss but i would not condescend to speak even a word of reverence to any of your emperors  i fear you will find that your idol has feet of clay  ahyou mean that he is bold in breaking those precepts of yours about coveting worldly wealth all men and women break that commandment but they do so in a stealthy fashion half drawing back the grasping hand praying to be delivered from temptation while they filch only a little pretending to despise the only thing that is dear to them in the world here is a man who boldly says that he recognises no such law that wealth is power and that power is good and that the more a man has of wealth the greater and the stronger and the nobler be can be i love a man who can turn the hobgoblins inside out and burn the wooden bogies that he meets  montague had formed his own opinions about melmotte though connected with the man he believed their grand director to be as vile a scoundrel as ever lived mrs hurtles enthusiasm was very pretty and there was something of feminine eloquence in her words but it was shocking to see them lavished on such a subject personally i do not like him said paul  i had thought to find that you and he were hand and glove  oh no  but you are prospering in this business  yesi suppose we are prospering it is one of those hazardous things in which a man can never tell whether he be really prosperous till he is out of it i fell into it altogether against my will i had no alternative  it seems to me to have been a golden chance  as far as immediate results go it has been golden  that at any rate is well paul and nownow that we have got back into our old way of talking tell me what all this means i have talked to no one after this fashion since we parted why should our engagement be over you used to love me did you not  he would willingly have left her question unanswered but she waited for an answer you know i did he said  i thought so this i know that you were sure and are sure of my love to you is it not so come speak openly like a man do you doubt me  he did not doubt her and was forced to say so no indeed  oh with what bated halfmouthed words you speakfit for a girl from a nursery out with it if you have anything to say against me you owe me so much at any rate i have never illtreated you i have never lied to you i have taken nothing from youif i have not taken your heart i have given you all that i can give then she leaped to her feet and stood a little apart from him if you hate me say so  winifred he said calling her by her name  winifred yes now for the first time though i have called you paul from the moment you entered the room well speak out is there another woman that you love  at this moment paul montague proved that at any rate he was no coward knowing the nature of the woman how ardent how impetuous she could be and how full of wrath he had come at her call intending to tell her the truth which he now spoke there is another he said  she stood silent looking into his face thinking how she would commence her attack upon him she fixed her eyes upon him standing quite upright squeezing her own right hand with the fingers of the left oh she said in a whisper that is the reason why i am told that i am to beoff  that was not the reason  whatcan there be more reason than thatbetter reason than that unless indeed it be that as you have learned to love another so also you have learned tohate me  listen to me winifred  no sir no winifred now how did you dare to kiss me knowing that it was on your tongue to tell me i was to be cast aside and so you lovesome other woman i am too old to please you too roughtoo little like the dolls of your own country what were yourother reasons let me hear yourother reasons that i may tell you that they are lies  the reasons were very difficult to tell though when put forward by roger carbury they had been easily pleaded paul knew but little about winifred hurtle and nothing at all about the late mr hurtle his reasons curtly put forward might have been so stated we know too little of each other he said  what more do you want to know you can know all for the asking did i ever refuse to answer you as to my knowledge of you and your affairs if i think it sufficient need you complain what is it that you want to know ask anything and i will tell you is it about my money you knew when you gave me your word that i had next to none now i have ample means of my own you knew that i was a widow what more if you wish to hear of the wretch that was my husband i will deluge you with stories i should have thought that a man who loved would not have cared to hear much of onewho perhaps was loved once  he knew that his position was perfectly indefensible it would have been better for him not to have alluded to any reasons but to have remained firm to his assertion that he loved another woman he must have acknowledged himself to be false perjured inconstant and very base a fault that may be venial to those who do not suffer is damnable deserving of an eternity of tortures in the eyes of the sufferer he must have submitted to be told that he was a fiend and might have had to endure whatever of punishment a lady in her wrath could inflict upon him but he would have been called upon for no further mental effort his position would have been plain but now he was all at sea i wish to hear nothing he said  then why tell me that we know so little of each other that surely is a poor excuse to make to a womanafter you have been false to her why did you not say that when we were in new york together think of it paul is not that mean  i do not think that i am mean  noa man will lie to a woman and justify it always who isthis lady  he knew that he could not at any rate be warranted in mentioning hetta carburys name he had never even asked her for her love and certainly had received no assurance that he was loved i cannot name her  and i who have come hither from california to see you am to return satisfied because you tell me that you havechanged your affections that is to be all and you think that fair that suits your own mind and leaves no sore spot in your heart you can do that and shake hands with me and go awaywithout a pang without a scruple  i did not say so  and you are the man who cannot bear to hear me praise augustus melmotte because you think him dishonest are you a liar  i hope not  did you say you would be my husband answer me sir  i did say so  do you now refuse to keep your promise you shall answer me  i cannot marry you  then sir are you not a liar it would have taken him long to explain to her even had he been able that a man may break a promise and yet not tell a lie he had made up his mind to break his engagement before he had seen hetta carbury and therefore he could not accuse himself of falseness on her account he had been brought to his resolution by the rumours he had heard of her past life and as to his uncertainty about her husband if mr hurtle were alive certainly then he would not be a liar because he did not marry mrs hurtle he did not think himself to be a liar but he was not at once ready with his defence oh paul she said changing at once into softnessi am pleading to you for my life oh that i could make you feel that i am pleading for my life have you given a promise to this lady also  no said he i have given no promise  but she loves you  she has never said so  you have told her of your love  never  there is nothing then between you and you would put her against mesome woman who has nothing to suffer no cause of complaint who for aught you know cares nothing for you is that so  i suppose it is said paul  then you may still be mine oh paul come back to me will any woman love you as i dolive for you as i do think what i have done in coming here where i have no friendnot a single friendunless you are a friend listen to me i have told the woman here that i am engaged to marry you  you have told the woman of the house  certainly i have was i not justified were you not engaged to me am i to have you to visit me here and to risk her insults perhaps to be told to take myself off and to find accommodation elsewhere because i am too mealymouthed to tell the truth as to the cause of my being here i am here because you have promised to make me your wife and as far as i am concerned i am not ashamed to have the fact advertised in every newspaper in the town i told her that i was the promised wife of one paul montague who was joined with mr melmotte in managing the new great american railway and that mr paul montague would be with me this morning she was too farseeing to doubt me but had she doubted i could have shown her your letters now go and tell her that what i have said is falseif you dare the woman was not there and it did not seem to be his immediate duty to leave the room in order that he might denounce a lady whom he certainly had illused the position was one which required thought after a while he took up his hat to go do you mean to tell her that my statement is untrue  no he said not today  and you will come back to me  yesi will come back  i have no friend here but you paul remember that remember all your promises remember all our loveand be good to me then she let him go without another word     chapter xxvii  mrs hurtle goes to the play   on the day after the visit just recorded paul montague received the following letter from mrs hurtle      my dear paul     i think that perhaps we hardly made ourselves understood to each    other yesterday and i am sure that you do not understand how    absolutely my whole life is now at stake i need only refer you to    our journey from san francisco to london to make you conscious    that i really love you to a woman such love is all important she    cannot throw it from her as a man may do amidst the affairs of the    world nor if it has to be thrown from her can she bear the loss    as a man bears it her thoughts have dwelt on it with more    constancy than hisand then too her devotion has separated her    from other things my devotion to you has separated me from    everything     but i scorn to come to you as a suppliant if you choose to say    after hearing me that you will put me away from you because you    have seen some one fairer than i am whatever course i may take in    my indignation i shall not throw myself at your feet to tell you    of my wrongs i wish however that you should hear me you say    that there is some one you love better than you love me but that    you have not committed yourself to her alas i know too much of    the world to be surprised that a mans constancy should not stand    out two years in the absence of his mistress a man cannot wrap    himself up and keep himself warm with an absent love as a woman    does but i think that some remembrance of the past must come back    upon you now that you have seen me again i think that you must    have owned to yourself that you did love me and that you could    love me again you sin against me to my utter destruction if you    leave me i have given up every friend i have to follow you as    regards the othernameless lady there can be no fault for as    you tell me she knows nothing of your passion     you hinted that there were other reasonsthat we know too little    of each other you meant no doubt that you knew too little of me    is it not the case that you were content when you knew only what    was to be learned in those days of our sweet intimacy but that    you have been made discontented by stories told you by your    partners at san francisco if this be so trouble yourself at any    rate to find out the truth before you allow yourself to treat a    woman as you propose to treat me i think you are too good a man    to cast aside a woman you have lovedlike a soiled glove    because illnatured words have been spoken of her by men or    perhaps by women who know nothing of her life my late husband    caradoc hurtle was attorneygeneral in the state of kansas when i    married him i being then in possession of a considerable fortune    left to me by my mother there his life was infamously bad he    spent what money he could get of mine and then left me and the    state and took himself to texaswhere he drank himself to    death i did not follow him and in his absence i was divorced    from him in accordance with the laws of kansas state i then went    to san francisco about property of my mothers which my husband    had fraudulently sold to a countryman of ours now resident in    parishaving forged my name there i met you and in that short    story i tell you all that there is to be told it may be that you    do not believe me now but if so are you not bound to go where    you can verify your own doubts or my word     i try to write dispassionately but i am in truth overborne by    passion i also have heard in california rumours about myself and    after much delay i received your letter i resolved to follow you    to england as soon as circumstances would permit me i have been    forced to fight a battle about my property and i have won it i    had two reasons for carrying this through by my personal efforts    before i saw you i had begun it and had determined that i would    not be beaten by fraud and i was also determined that i would not    plead to you as a pauper we have talked too freely together in    past days of our mutual money matters for me to feel any delicacy    in alluding to them when a man and woman have agreed to be    husband and wife there should be no delicacy of that kind when we    came here together we were both embarrassed we both had some    property but neither of us could enjoy it since that i have made    my way through my difficulties from what i have heard at san    francisco i suppose that you have done the same i at any rate    shall be perfectly contented if from this time our affairs can be    made one     and now about myselfimmediately i have come here all alone    since i last saw you in new york i have not had altogether a good    time i have had a great struggle and have been thrown on my own    resources and have been all alone very cruel things have been    said of me you heard cruel things said but i presume them to    have been said to you with reference to my late husband since    that they have been said to others with reference to you i have    not now come as my countrymen do generally backed with a trunk    full of introductions and with scores of friends ready to receive    me it was necessary to me that i should see you and hear my    fateand here i am i appeal to you to release me in some degree    from the misery of my solitude you knowno one so wellthat    my nature is social and that i am not given to be melancholy let    us be cheerful together as we once were if it be only for a day    let me see you as i used to see you and let me be seen as i used    to be seen     come to me and take me out with you and let us dine together and    take me to one of your theatres if you wish it i will promise you    not to allude to that revelation you made to me just now though    of course it is nearer to my heart than any other matter perhaps    some womans vanity makes me think that if you would only see me    again and talk to me as you used to talk you would think of me    as you used to think     you need not fear but you will find me at home i have no whither    to goand shall hardly stir from the house till you come to me    send me a line however that i may have my hat on if you are    minded to do as i ask you     yours with all my heart     winifred hurtle   this letter took her much time to write though she was very careful so to write as to make it seem that it had flown easily from her pen she copied it from the first draught but she copied it rapidly with one or two premeditated erasures so that it should look to have been done hurriedly there had been much art in it she had at any rate suppressed any show of anger in calling him to her she had so written as to make him feel that if he would come he need not fear the claws of an offended lionessand yet she was angry as a lioness who had lost her cub she had almost ignored that other lady whose name she had not yet heard she had spoken of her lovers entanglement with that other lady as a light thing which might easily be put aside she had said much of her own wrongs but had not said much of the wickedness of the wrongdoer invited as she had invited him surely he could not but come to her and then in her reference to money not descending to the details of dollars and cents she had studied how to make him feel that he might marry her without imprudence as she read it over to herself she thought that there was a tone through it of natural feminine uncautious eagerness she put her letter up in an envelope stuck a stamp on it and addressed itand then threw herself back in her chair to think of her position  he should marry heror there should be something done which should make the name of winifred hurtle known to the world she had no plan of revenge yet formed she would not talk of revengeshe told herself that she would not even think of revenge till she was quite sure that revenge would be necessary but she did think of it and could not keep her thoughts from it for a moment could it be possible that she with all her intellectual gifts as well as those of her outward person should be thrown over by a man whom well as she loved himand she did love him with all her heartshe regarded as greatly inferior to herself he had promised to marry her and he should marry her or the world should hear the story of his perjury  paul montague felt that he was surrounded by difficulties as soon as he read the letter that his heart was all the other way he was quite sure but yet it did seem to him that there was no escape from his troubles open to him there was not a single word in this womans letter that he could contradict he had loved her and had promised to make her his wifeand had determined to break his word to her because he found that she was enveloped in dangerous mystery he had so resolved before he had ever seen hetta carbury having been made to believe by roger carbury that a marriage with an unknown american womanof whom he only did know that she was handsome and clever would be a step to ruin the woman as roger said was an adventuressmight never have had a husbandmight at this moment have two or threemight be overwhelmed with debtmight be anything bad dangerous and abominable all that he had heard at san francisco had substantiated rogers views any scrape is better than that scrape roger had said to him paul had believed his mentor and had believed with a double faith as soon as he had seen hetta carbury  but what should he do now it was impossible after what had passed between them that he should leave mrs hurtle at her lodgings at islington without any notice it was clear enough to him that she would not consent to be so left then her present proposalthough it seemed to be absurd and almost comical in the tragical condition of their present circumstanceshad in it some immediate comfort to take her out and give her a dinner and then go with her to some theatre would be easy and perhaps pleasant it would be easier and certainly much pleasanter because she had pledged herself to abstain from talking of her grievances then he remembered some happy evenings delicious hours which he had so passed with her when they were first together at new york there could be no better companion for such a festival she could talkand she could listen as well as talk and she could sit silent conveying to her neighbour the sense of her feminine charms by her simple proximity he had been very happy when so placed had it been possible he would have escaped the danger now but the reminiscence of past delights in some sort reconciled him to the performance of this perilous duty  but when the evening should be over how would he part with her when the pleasant hour should have passed away and he had brought her back to her door what should he say to her then he must make some arrangement as to a future meeting he knew that he was in a great peril and he did not know how he might best escape it he could not now go to roger carbury for advice for was not roger carbury his rival it would be for his friends interest that he should marry the widow roger carbury as he knew well was too honest a man to allow himself to be guided in any advice he might give by such a feeling but still on this matter he could no longer tell everything to roger carbury he could not say all that he would have to say without speaking of hettaand of his love for hetta he could not speak to his rival  he had no other friend in whom he could confide there was no other human being he could trust unless it was hetta herself he thought for a moment that he would write a stern and true letter to the woman telling her that as it was impossible that there should ever be marriage between them he felt himself bound to abstain from her society but then he remembered her solitude her picture of herself in london without even an acquaintance except himself and he convinced himself that it would be impossible that he should leave her without seeing her so he wrote to her thus      dear winifred     i will come for you tomorrow at halfpast five we will dine    together at the thespianand then i will have a box at the    haymarket the thespian is a good sort of place and lots of    ladies dine there you can dine in your bonnet     yours affectionately     p m   some halfformed idea ran through his brain that p m was a safer signature than paul montague then came a long train of thoughts as to the perils of the whole proceeding she had told him that she had announced herself to the keeper of the lodginghouse as engaged to him and he had in a manner authorized the statement by declining to contradict it at once and now after that announcement he was assenting to her proposal that they should go out and amuse themselves together hitherto she had always seemed to him to be open candid and free from intrigue he had known her to be impulsive capricious at times violent but never deceitful perhaps he was unable to read correctly the inner character of a woman whose experience of the world had been much wider than his own his mind misgave him that it might be so but still he thought that he knew that she was not treacherous and yet did not her present acts justify him in thinking that she was carrying on a plot against him the note however was sent and he prepared for the evening of the play leaving the dangers of the occasion to adjust themselves he ordered the dinner and he took the box and at the hour fixed he was again at her lodgings  the woman of the house with a smile showed him into mrs hurtles sittingroom and he at once perceived that the smile was intended to welcome him as an accepted lover it was a smile half of congratulation to the lover half of congratulation to herself as a woman that another man had been caught by the leg and made fast who does not know the smile what man who has been caught and made sure has not felt a certain dissatisfaction at being so treated understanding that the smile is intended to convey to him a sense of his own captivity it has however generally mattered but little to us if we have felt that something of ridicule was intended because we have been regarded as cocks with their spurs cut away then we also have a pride when we have declared to ourselves that upon the whole we have gained more than we have lost but with paul montague at the present moment there was no satisfaction no prideonly a feeling of danger which every hour became deeper and stronger with less chance of escape he was almost tempted at this moment to detain the woman and tell her the truthand bear the immediate consequences but there would be treason in doing so and he would not could not do it  he was left hardly a moment to think of this almost before the woman had shut the door mrs hurtle came to him out of her bedroom with her hat on her head nothing could be more simple than her dress and nothing prettier it was now june and the weather was warm and the lady wore a light gauzy black dressthere is a fabric which the milliners i think call grenadinecoming close up round her throat it was very pretty and she was prettier even than her dress and she had on a hat black also small and simple but very pretty there are times at which a man going to a theatre with a lady wishes her to be bright in her apparelalmost gorgeous in which he will hardly be contented unless her cloak be scarlet and her dress white and her gloves of some bright hueunless she wear roses or jewels in her hair it is thus our girls go to the theatre now when they go intending that all the world shall know who they are but there are times again in which a man would prefer that his companion should be very quiet in her dressbut still pretty in which he would choose that she should dress herself for him only all this mrs hurtle had understood accurately and paul montague who understood nothing of it was gratified you told me to have a hat and here i amhat and all she gave him her hand and laughed and looked pleasantly at him as though there was no cause of unhappiness between them the lodginghouse woman saw them enter the cab and muttered some little word as they went off paul did not hear the word but was sure that it bore some indistinct reference to his expected marriage  neither during the drive nor at the dinner nor during the performance at the theatre did she say a word in allusion to her engagement it was with them as in former days it had been at new york she whispered pleasant words to him touching his arm now and again with her finger as she spoke seeming ever better inclined to listen than to speak now and again she referred after some slightest fashion to little circumstances that had occurred between them to some joke some hour of tedium some moment of delight but it was done as one man might do it to anotherif any man could have done it so pleasantly there was a scent which he had once approved and now she bore it on her handkerchief there was a ring which he had once given her and she wore it on the finger with which she touched his sleeve with his own hands he had once adjusted her curls and each curl was as he had placed it she had a way of shaking her head that was very prettya way that might one would think have been dangerous at her age as likely to betray those first grey hairs which will come to disturb the last days of youth he had once told her in sport to be more careful she now shook her head again and as he smiled she told him that she could still dare to be careless there are a thousand little silly softnesses which are pretty and endearing between acknowledged lovers with which no woman would like to dispense to which even men who are in love submit sometimes with delight but which in other circumstances would be vulgarand to the woman distasteful there are closenesses and sweet approaches smiles and nods and pleasant winkings whispers innuendoes and hints little mutual admirations and assurances that there are things known to those two happy ones of which the world beyond is altogether ignorant much of this comes of nature but something of it sometimes comes by art of such art as there may be in it mrs hurtle was a perfect master no allusion was made to their engagementnot an unpleasant word was spoken but the art was practised with all its pleasant adjuncts paul was flattered to the top of his bent and though the sword was hanging over his head though he knew that the sword must fallmust partly fall that very nightstill he enjoyed it  there are men who of their natures do not like women even though they may have wives and legions of daughters and be surrounded by things feminine in all the affairs of their lives others again have their strongest affinities and sympathies with women and are rarely altogether happy when removed from their influence paul montague was of the latter sort at this time he was thoroughly in love with hetta carbury and was not in love with mrs hurtle he would have given much of his golden prospects in the american railway to have had mrs hurtle reconveyed suddenly to san francisco and yet he had a delight in her presence the acting isnt very good he said when the piece was nearly over  what does it signify what we enjoy or what we suffer depends upon the humour the acting is not firstrate but i have listened and laughed and cried because i have been happy  he was bound to tell her that he also had enjoyed the evening and was bound to say it in no voice of hypocritical constraint it has been very jolly he said  and one has so little that is really jolly as you call it i wonder whether any girl ever did sit and cry like that because her lover talked to another woman what i find fault with is that the writers and actors are so ignorant of men and women as we see them every day its all right that she should cry but she wouldnt cry there the position described was so nearly her own that he could say nothing to this she had so spoken on purposefighting her own battle after her own fashion knowing well that her words would confuse him a woman hides such tears she may be found crying because she is unable to hide thembut she does not willingly let the other woman see them does she  i suppose not  medea did not weep when she was introduced to creusa  women are not all medeas he replied  theres a dash of the savage princess about most of them i am quite ready if you like i never want to see the curtain fall and i have had no nosegay brought in a wheelbarrow to throw on to the stage are you going to see me home  certainly  you need not im not a bit afraid of a london cab by myself but of course he accompanied her to islington he owed her at any rate as much as that she continued to talk during the whole journey what a wonderful place london wasso immense but so dirty new york of course was not so big but was she thought pleasanter but paris was the gem of gems among towns she did not like frenchmen and she liked englishmen even better than americans but she fancied that she could never like english women i do so hate all kinds of buckram i like good conduct and law and religion too if it be not forced down ones throat but i hate what your women call propriety i suppose what we have been doing tonight is very improper but i am quite sure that it has not been in the least wicked  i dont think it has said paul montague very tamely it is a long way from the haymarket to islington but at last the cab reached the lodginghouse door yes this is it she said even about the houses there is an air of stiffnecked propriety which frightens me she was getting out as she spoke and he had already knocked at the door come in for one moment she said as he paid the cabman the woman the while was standing with the door in her hand it was near midnightbut when people are engaged hours do not matter the woman of the house who was respectability herselfa nice kind widow with five children named pipkinunderstood that and smiled again as he followed the lady into the sittingroom she had already taken off her hat and was flinging it on to the sofa as he entered shut the door for one moment she said and he shut it then she threw herself into his arms not kissing him but looking up into his face oh paul she exclaimed my darling oh paul my love i will not bear to be separated from you no nonever i swear it and you may believe me there is nothing i cannot do for love of youbut to lose you then she pushed him from her and looked away from him clasping her hands together but paul i mean to keep my pledge to you tonight it was to be an island in our troubles a little holiday in our hard schooltime and i will not destroy it at its close you will see me again soonwill you not he nodded assent then took her in his arms and kissed her and left her without a word     chapter xxviii  dolly longestaffe goes into the city   it has been told how the gambling at the beargarden went on one sunday night on the following monday sir felix did not go to the club he had watched miles grendall at play and was sure that on more than one or two occasions the man had cheated sir felix did not quite know what in such circumstances it would be best for him to do reprobate as he was himself this work of villainy was new to him and seemed to be very terrible what steps ought he to take he was quite sure of his facts and yet he feared that nidderdale and grasslough and longestaffe would not believe him he would have told montague but montague had he thought hardly enough authority at the club to be of any use to him on the tuesday again he did not go to the club he felt severely the loss of the excitement to which he had been accustomed but the thing was too important to him to be slurred over he did not dare to sit down and play with the man who had cheated him without saying anything about it on the wednesday afternoon life was becoming unbearable to him and he sauntered into the building at about five in the afternoon there as a matter of course he found dolly longestaffe drinking sherry and bitters where the blessed angels have you been said dolly dolly was at that moment alert with the sense of a duty performed he had just called on his sister and written a sharp letter to his father and felt himself to be almost a man of business  ive had fish of my own to fry said felix who had passed the last two days in unendurable idleness then he referred again to the money which dolly owed him not making any complaint not indeed asking for immediate payment but explaining with an air of importance that if a commercial arrangement could be made it might at this moment be very serviceable to him im particularly anxious to take up those shares said felix  of course you ought to have your money  i dont say that at all old fellow i know very well that youre all right youre not like that fellow miles grendall  well no poor miles has got nothing to bless himself with i suppose i could get it and so i ought to pay  thats no excuse for grendall said sir felix shaking his head  a chap cant pay if he hasnt got it carbury a chap ought to pay of course ive had a letter from our lawyer within the last half hour here it is and dolly pulled a letter out of his pocket which he had opened and read indeed the last hour but which had been duly delivered at his lodgings early in the morning my governor wants to sell pickering and melmotte wants to buy the place my governor cant sell without me and ive asked for half the plunder i know whats what my interest in the property is greater than his it isnt much of a place and they are talking of £50000 over and above the debt upon it £25000 would pay off what i owe on my own property and make me very square from what this fellow says i suppose theyre going to give in to my terms  by george thatll be a grand thing for you dolly  oh yes of course i want it but i dont like the place going im not much of a fellow i know im awfully lazy and cant get myself to go in for things as i ought to do but ive a sort of feeling that i dont like the family property going to pieces a fellow oughtnt to let his family property go to pieces  you never lived at pickering  noand i dont know that it is any good it gives us 3 per cent on the money its worth while the governor is paying 6 per cent and im paying 25 for the money weve borrowed i know more about it than youd think it ought to be sold and now i suppose it will be sold old melmotte knows all about it and if you like ill go with you to the city tomorrow and make it straight about what i owe you hell advance me £1000 and then you can get the shares are you going to dine here  sir felix said that he would dine at the club but declared with considerable mystery in his manner that he could not stay and play whist afterwards he acceded willingly to dollys plans of visiting abchurch lane on the following day but had some difficulty in inducing his friend to consent to fix on an hour early enough for city purposes dolly suggested that they should meet at the club at 4 pm sir felix had named noon and promised to call at dollys lodgings they split the difference at last and agreed to start at two they then dined together miles grendall dining alone at the next table to them dolly and grendall spoke to each other frequently but in that conversation the young baronet would not join nor did grendall ever address himself to sir felix is there anything up between you and miles said dolly when they had adjourned to the smokingroom  i cant bear him  there never was any love between you two i know but you used to speak and youve played with him all through  played with him i should think i have though he did get such a haul last sunday he owes me more than you do now  is that the reason you havent played the last two nights  sir felix paused a moment nothat is not the reason ill tell you all about it in the cab tomorrow then he left the club declaring that he would go up to grosvenor square and see marie melmotte he did go up to the square and when he came to the house he would not go in what was the good he could do nothing further till he got old melmottes consent and in no way could he so probably do that as by showing that he had got money wherewith to buy shares in the railway what he did with himself during the remainder of the evening the reader need not know but on his return home at some comparatively early hour he found this note from marie      wednesday afternoon     dearest felix     why dont we see you mamma would say nothing if you came papa is    never in the drawingroom miss longestaffe is here of course and    people always come in in the evening we are just going to dine out    at the duchess of stevenages papa and mamma and i mamma told me    that lord nidderdale is to be there but you need not be a bit    afraid i dont like lord nidderdale and i will never take any one    but the man i love you know who that is miss longestaffe is so    angry because she cant go with us what do you think of her    telling me that she did not understand being left alone we are to    go afterwards to a musical party at lady gamuts miss longestaffe    is going with us but she says she hates music she is such a setup    thing i wonder why papa has her here we dont go anywhere    tomorrow evening so pray come     and why havent you written me something and sent it to didon she    wont betray us and if she did what matters i mean to be true    if papa were to beat me into a mummy i would stick to you he told    me once to take lord nidderdale and then he told me to refuse him    and now he wants me to take him again but i wont ill take no    one but my own darling     yours for ever and ever     marie   now that the young lady had begun to have an interest of her own in life she was determined to make the most of it all this was delightful to her but to sir felix it was simply a bother sir felix was quite willing to marry the girl tomorrowon condition of course that the money was properly arranged but he was not willing to go through much work in the way of lovemaking with marie melmotte in such business he preferred ruby ruggles as a companion  on the following day felix was with his friend at the appointed time and was only kept an hour waiting while dolly ate his breakfast and struggled into his coat and boots on their way to the city felix told his dreadful story about miles grendall by george said dolly and you think you saw him do it  its not thinking at all im sure i saw him do it three times i believe he always had an ace somewhere about him dolly sat quite silent thinking of it what had i better do asked sir felix  by georgei dont know  what should you do  nothing at all i shouldnt believe my own eyes or if i did should take care not to look at him  you wouldnt go on playing with him  yes i should itd be such a bore breaking up  but dollyif you think of it  thats all very fine my dear fellow but i shouldnt think of it  and you wont give me your advice  wellno i think id rather not i wish you hadnt told me why did you pick me out to tell me why didnt you tell nidderdale  he might have said why didnt you tell longestaffe  no he wouldnt nobody would suppose that anybody would pick me out for this kind of thing if id known that you were going to tell me such a story as this i wouldnt have come with you  thats nonsense dolly  very well i cant bear these kind of things i feel all in a twitter already  you mean to go on playing just the same  of course i do if he won anything very heavy i should begin to think about it i suppose oh this is abchurch lane is it now for the man of money  the man of money received them much more graciously than felix had expected of course nothing was said about marie and no further allusion was made to the painful subject of the baronets property both dolly and sir felix were astonished by the quick way in which the great financier understood their views and the readiness with which he undertook to comply with them no disagreeable questions were asked as to the nature of the debt between the young men dolly was called upon to sign a couple of documents and sir felix to sign oneand then they were assured that the thing was done mr adolphus longestaffe had paid sir felix carbury a thousand pounds and sir felix carburys commission had been accepted by mr melmotte for the purchase of railway stock to that amount sir felix attempted to say a word he endeavoured to explain that his object in this commercial transaction was to make money immediately by reselling the sharesand to go on continually making money by buying at a low price and selling at a high price he no doubt did believe that being a director if he could once raise the means of beginning this game he could go on with it for an unlimited periodbuy and sell buy and sellso that he would have an almost regular income this as far as he could understand was what paul montague was allowed to dosimply because he had become a director with a little money mr melmotte was cordiality itself but he could not be got to go into particulars it was all right you will wish to sell again of courseof course ill watch the market for you when the young men left the room all they knew or thought that they knew was that dolly longestaffe had authorized melmotte to pay a thousand pounds on his behalf to sir felix and that sir felix had instructed the same great man to buy shares with the amount but why didnt he give you the scrip said dolly on his way westwards  i suppose its all right with him said sir felix  oh yesits all right thousands of pounds to him are only like halfcrowns to us fellows i should say its all right all the same hes the biggest rogue out you know sir felix already began to be unhappy about his thousand pounds     chapter xxix  miss melmottes courage   lady carbury continued to ask frequent questions as to the prosecution of her sons suit and sir felix began to think that he was persecuted i have spoken to her father he said crossly  and what did mr melmotte say  saywhat should he say he wanted to know what income i had got after all hes an old screw  did he forbid you to come there any more  now mother its no use your crossexamining me if youll let me alone ill do the best i can  she has accepted you herself  of course she has i told you that at carbury  then felix if i were you id run off with her i would indeed its done every day and nobody thinks any harm of it when you marry the girl you could do it now because i know youve got money from all i can hear shes just the sort of girl that would go with you the son sat silent listening to these maternal councils he did believe that marie would go off with him were he to propose the scheme to her her own father had almost alluded to such a proceedinghad certainly hinted that it was feasiblebut at the same time had very clearly stated that in such case the ardent lover would have to content himself with the lady alone in any such event as that there would be no fortune but then might not that only be a threat rich fathers generally do forgive their daughters and a rich father with only one child would surely forgive her when she returned to him as she would do in this instance graced with a title sir felix thought of all this as he sat there silent his mother read his thoughts as she continued of course felix there must be some risk  fancy what it would be to be thrown over at last he exclaimed i couldnt bear it i think i should kill her  oh no felix you wouldnt do that but when i say there would be some risk i mean that there would be very little there would be nothing in it that ought to make him really angry he has nobody else to give his money to and it would be much nicer to have his daughter lady carbury with him than to be left all alone in the world  i couldnt live with him you know i couldnt do it  you neednt live with him felix of course she would visit her parents when the money was once settled you need see as little of them as you pleased pray do not allow trifles to interfere with you if this should not succeed what are you to do we shall all starve unless something be done if i were you felix i would take her away at once they say she is of age  i shouldnt know where to take her said sir felix almost stunned into thoughtfulness by the magnitude of the proposition made to him all that about scotland is done with now  of course you would marry her at once  i suppose sounless it were better to stay as we were till the money was settled  oh no no everybody would be against you if you take her off in a spirited sort of way and then marry her everybody will be with you thats what you want the father and mother will be sure to come round if  the mother is nothing  he will come round if people speak up in your favour i could get mr alf and mr broune to help id try it felix indeed i would ten thousand a year is not to be had every year  sir felix gave no assent to his mothers views he felt no desire to relieve her anxiety by an assurance of activity in the matter but the prospect was so grand that it had excited even him he had money sufficient for carrying out the scheme and if he delayed the matter now it might well be that he would never again find himself so circumstanced he thought that he would ask somebody whither he ought to take her and what he ought to do with herand that he would then make the proposition to herself miles grendall would be the man to tell him because with all his faults miles did understand things but he could not ask miles he and nidderdale were good friends but nidderdale wanted the girl for himself grasslough would be sure to tell nidderdale dolly would be altogether useless he thought that perhaps herr vossner would be the man to help him there would be no difficulty out of which herr vossner would not extricate a fellow if the fellow paid him  on thursday evening he went to grosvenor square as desired by marie but unfortunately found melmotte in the drawingroom lord nidderdale was there also and his lordships old father the marquis of auld reekie whom felix when he entered the room did not know he was a fiercelooking gouty old man with watery eyes and very stiff grey hairalmost white he was standing up supporting himself on two sticks when sir felix entered the room there were also present madame melmotte miss longestaffe and marie as felix had entered the hail one huge footman had said that the ladies were not at home then there had been for a moment a whispering behind a doorin which he afterwards conceived that madame didon had taken a partand upon that a second tall footman had contradicted the first and had ushered him up to the drawingroom he felt considerably embarrassed but shook hands with the ladies bowed to melmotte who seemed to take no notice of him and nodded to lord nidderdale he had not had time to place himself when the marquis arranged things suppose we go downstairs said the marquis  certainly my lord said melmotte ill show your lordship the way the marquis did not speak to his son but poked at him with his stick as though poking him out of the door so instigated nidderdale followed the financier and the gouty old marquis toddled after them  madame melmotte was beside herself with trepidation you should not have been made to come up at all she said il faut que vous vous retiriez  i am very sorry said sir felix looking quite aghast i think that i had at any rate better retire said miss longestaffe raising herself to her full height and stalking out of the room  quelle est méchante said madame melmotte oh she is so bad sir felix you had better go too yes indeed  no said marie running to him and taking hold of his arm why should he go i want papa to know  il vous tuera said madame melmotte my god yes  then he shall said marie clinging to her lover i will never marry lord nidderdale if he were to cut me into bits i wouldnt do it felix you love me do you not  certainly said sir felix slipping his arm round her waist  mamma said marie i will never have any other man but himnever never never oh felix tell her that you love me  you know that dont you maam sir felix was a little troubled in his mind as to what he should say or what he should do  oh love it is a beastliness said madame melmotte sir felix you had better go yes indeed will you be so obliging  dont go said marie no mamma he shant go what has he to be afraid of i will walk down among them into papas room and say that i will never marry that man and that this is my lover felix will you come  sir felix did not quite like the proposition there had been a savage ferocity in that marquiss eye and there was habitually a heavy sternness about melmotte which together made him resist the invitation i dont think i have a right to do that he said because it is mr melmottes own house  i wouldnt mind said marie i told papa today that i wouldnt marry lord nidderdale  was he angry with you  he laughed at me he manages people till he thinks that everybody must do exactly what he tells them he may kill me but i will not do it i have quite made up my mind felix if you will be true to me nothing shall separate us i will not be ashamed to tell everybody that i love you  madame melmotte had now thrown herself into a chair and was sighing sir felix stood on the rug with his arm round maries waist listening to her protestations but saying little in answer to themwhen suddenly a heavy step was heard ascending the stairs cest lui screamed madame melmotte bustling up from her seat and hurrying out of the room by a side door the two lovers were alone for one moment during which marie lifted up her face and sir felix kissed her lips now be brave she said escaping from his arm and ill be brave mr melmotte looked round the room as he entered where are the others he asked  mamma has gone away and miss longestaffe went before mamma  sir felix it is well that i should tell you that my daughter is engaged to marry lord nidderdale  sir felix i am not engagedtomarry lord nidderdale said marie its no good papa i wont do it if you chop me to pieces i wont do it  she will marry lord nidderdale continued mr melmotte addressing himself to sir felix as that is arranged you will perhaps think it better to leave us i shall be happy to renew my acquaintance with you as soon as the fact is recognizedor happy to see you in the city at any time  papa he is my lover said marie  pooh  it is not pooh he is i will never have any other i hate lord nidderdale and as for that dreadful old man i could not bear to look at him sir felix is as good a gentleman as he is if you loved me papa you would not want to make me unhappy all my life  her father walked up to her rapidly with his hand raised and she clung only the closer to her lovers arm at this moment sir felix did not know what he might best do but he thoroughly wished himself out in the square jade said melmotte get to your room  of course i will go to bed if you tell me papa  i do tell you how dare you take hold of him in that way before me have you no idea of disgrace  i am not disgraced it is not more disgraceful to love him than that other man oh papa dont you hurt me i am going he took her by the arm and dragged her to the door and then thrust her out  i am very sorry mr melmotte said sir felix to have had a hand in causing this disturbance  go away and dont come back any morethats all you cant both marry her all you have got to understand is this im not the man to give my daughter a single shilling if she marries against my consent by the god that hears me sir felix she shall not have one shilling but look youif youll give this up i shall be proud to cooperate with you in anything you may wish to have done in the city  after this sir felix left the room went down the stairs had the door opened for him and was ushered into the square but as he went through the hall a woman managed to shove a note into his hand which he read as soon as he found himself under a gas lamp it was dated that morning and had therefore no reference to the fray which had just taken place it ran as follows      i hope you will come tonight there is something i cannot tell you    then but you ought to know it when we were in france papa thought    it wise to settle a lot of money on me i dont know how much but    i suppose it was enough to live on if other things went wrong he    never talked to me about it but i know it was done and it hasnt    been undone and cant be without my leave he is very angry about    you this morning for i told him i would never give you up he says    he wont give me anything if i marry without his leave but i am    sure he cannot take it away i tell you because i think i ought to    tell you everything     m   sir felix as he read this could not but think that he had become engaged to a very enterprising young lady it was evident that she did not care to what extent she braved her father on behalf of her lover and now she coolly proposed to rob him but sir felix saw no reason why he should not take advantage of the money made over to the girls name if he could lay his bands on it he did not know much of such transactions but he knew more than marie melmotte and could understand that a man in melmottes position should want to secure a portion of his fortune against accidents by settling it on his daughter whether having so settled it he could again resume it without the daughters assent sir felix did not know marie who had no doubt been regarded as an absolutely passive instrument when the thing was done was now quite alive to the benefit which she might possibly derive from it her proposition put into plain english amounted to this take me and marry me without my fathers consent and then you and i together can rob my father of the money which for his own purposes he has settled upon me he had looked upon the lady of his choice as a poor weak thing without any special character of her own who was made worthy of consideration only by the fact that she was a rich mans daughter but now she began to loom before his eyes as something bigger than that she had had a will of her own when the mother had none she had not been afraid of her brutal father when he sir felix had trembled before him she had offered to be beaten and killed and chopped to pieces on behalf of her lover there could be no doubt about her running away if she were asked  it seemed to him that within the last month he had gained a great deal of experience and that things which heretofore had been troublesome to him or difficult or perhaps impossible were now coming easily within his reach he had won two or three thousand pounds at cards whereas invariable loss had been the result of the small play in which he had before indulged he had been set to marry this heiress having at first no great liking for the attempt because of its difficulties and the small amount of hope which it offered him the girl was already willing and anxious to jump into his arms then he had detected a man cheating at cardsan extent of iniquity that was awful to him before he had seen itand was already beginning to think that there was not very much in that if there was not much in it if such a man as miles grendall could cheat at cards and be brought to no punishment why should not he try it it was a rapid way of winning no doubt he remembered that on one or two occasions he had asked his adversary to cut the cards a second time at whist because he had observed that there was no honour at the bottom no feeling of honesty had interfered with him the little trick had hardly been premeditated but when successful without detection had not troubled his conscience now it seemed to him that much more than that might be done without detection but nothing had opened his eyes to the ways of the world so widely as the sweet loverlike proposition made by miss melmotte for robbing her father it certainly recommended the girl to him she had been able at an early age amidst the circumstances of a very secluded life to throw off from her altogether those scruples of honesty those bugbears of the world which are apt to prevent great enterprises in the minds of men  what should he do next this sum of money of which marie wrote so easily was probably large it would not have been worth the while of such a man as mr melmotte to make a trifling provision of this nature it could hardly be less than £50000might probably be very much more but this was certain to himthat if he and marie were to claim this money as man and wife there could then be no hope of further liberality it was not probable that such a man as mr melmotte would forgive even an only child such an offence as that even if it were obtained £50000 would not be very much and melmotte might probably have means even if the robbery were duly perpetrated of making the possession of the money very uncomfortable these were deep waters into which sir felix was preparing to plunge and he did not feel himself to be altogether comfortable although he liked the deep waters     chapter xxx  mr melmottes promise   on the following saturday there appeared in mr alfs paper the evening pulpit a very remarkable article on the south central pacific and mexican railway it was an article that attracted a great deal of attention and was therefore remarkable but it was in nothing more remarkable than in thisthat it left on the mind of its reader no impression of any decided opinion about the railway the editor would at any future time be able to refer to his article with equal pride whether the railway should become a great cosmopolitan fact or whether it should collapse amidst the foul struggles of a horde of swindlers in utrumque paratus the article was mysterious suggestive amusing wellinformedthat in the evening pulpit was a matter of courseand above all things ironical next to its omniscience its irony was the strongest weapon belonging to the evening pulpit there was a little praise given no doubt in irony to the duchesses who served mr melmotte there was a little praise given of course in irony to mr melmottes board of english directors there was a good deal of praise but still alloyed by a dash of irony bestowed on the idea of civilizing mexico by joining it to california praise was bestowed upon england for taking up the matter but accompanied by some ironical touches at her incapacity to believe thoroughly in any enterprise not originated by herself then there was something said of the universality of mr melmottes commercial genius but whether said in a spirit prophetic of ultimate failure and disgrace or of heavenborn success and unequalled commercial splendour no one could tell  it was generally said at the clubs that mr alf had written this article himself old splinter who was one of a body of men possessing an excellent cellar of wine and calling themselves paides pallados and who had written for the heavy quarterlies any time this last forty years professed that he saw through the article the evening pulpit had been he explained desirous of going as far as it could in denouncing mr melmotte without incurring the danger of an action for libel mr splinter thought that the thing was clever but mean these new publications generally were mean mr splinter was constant in that opinion but putting the meanness aside he thought that the article was well done according to his view it was intended to expose mr melmotte and the railway but the paides pallados generally did not agree with him under such an interpretation what had been the meaning of that paragraph in which the writer had declared that the work of joining one ocean to another was worthy of the nearest approach to divinity that had been granted to men old splinter chuckled and gabbled as he heard this and declared that there was not wit enough left now even among the paides pallados to understand a shaft of irony there could be no doubt however at the time that the world did not go with old splinter and that the article served to enhance the value of shares in the great railway enterprise  lady carbury was sure that the article was intended to write up the railway and took great joy in it she entertained in her brain a somewhat confused notion that if she could only bestir herself in the right direction and could induce her son to open his eyes to his own advantage very great things might be achieved so that wealth might become his handmaid and luxury the habit and the right of his life he was the beloved and the accepted suitor of marie melmotte he was a director of this great company sitting at the same board with the great commercial hero he was the handsomest young man in london and he was a baronet very wild ideas occurred to her should she take mr alf into her entire confidence if melmotte and alf could be brought together what might they not do alf could write up melmotte and melmotte could shower shares upon alf and if melmotte would come and be smiled upon by herself be flattered as she thought that she could flatter him be told that he was a god and have that passage about the divinity of joining ocean to ocean construed to him as she could construe it would not the great man become plastic under her hands and if while this was adoing felix would run away with marie could not forgiveness be made easy and her creative mind ranged still farther mr broune might help and even mr booker to such a one as melmotte a man doing great things through the force of the confidence placed in him by the world at large the freelyspoken support of the press would be everything who would not buy shares in a railway as to which mr broune and mr alf would combine in saying that it was managed by divinity her thoughts were rather hazy but from day to day she worked hard to make them clear to herself  on the sunday afternoon mr booker called on her and talked to her about the article she did not say much to mr booker as to her own connection with mr melmotte telling herself that prudence was essential in the present emergency but she listened with all her ears it was mr bookers idea that the man was going to make a spoon or spoil a horn you think him honestdont you asked lady carbury mr booker smiled and hesitated of course i mean honest as men can be in such very large transactions  perhaps that is the best way of putting it said mr booker  if a thing can be made great and beneficent a boon to humanity simply by creating a belief in it does not a man become a benefactor to his race by creating that belief  at the expense of veracity suggested mr booker  at the expense of anything rejoined lady carbury with energy one cannot measure such men by the ordinary rule  you would do evil to produce good asked mr booker  i do not call it doing evil you have to destroy a thousand living creatures every time you drink a glass of water but you do not think of that when you are athirst you cannot send a ship to sea without endangering lives you do send ships to sea though men perish yearly you tell me this man may perhaps ruin hundreds but then again he may create a new world in which millions will be rich and happy  you are an excellent casuist lady carbury  i am an enthusiastic lover of beneficent audacity said lady carbury picking her words slowly and showing herself to be quite satisfied with herself as she picked them did i hold your place mr booker in the literature of my country  i hold no place lady carbury  yesand a very distinguished place were i circumstanced as you are i should have no hesitation in lending the whole weight of my periodical let it be what it might to the assistance of so great a man and so great an object as this  i should be dismissed tomorrow said mr booker getting up and laughing as he took his departure lady carbury felt that as regarded mr booker she had only thrown out a chance word that could not do any harm she had not expected to effect much through mr bookers instrumentality on the tuesday eveningher regular tuesday as she called itall her three editors came to her drawingroom but there came also a greater man than either of them she had taken the bull by the horns and without saying anything to anybody had written to mr melmotte himself asking him to honour her poor house with his presence she had written a very pretty note to him reminding him of their meeting at caversham telling him that on a former occasion madame melmotte and his daughter had been so kind as to come to her and giving him to understand that of all the potentates now on earth he was the one to whom she could bow the knee with the purest satisfaction he wrote backor miles grendall did for hima very plain note accepting the honour of lady carburys invitation  the great man came and lady carbury took him under her immediate wing with a grace that was all her own she said a word about their dear friends at caversham expressed her sorrow that her sons engagements did not admit of his being there and then with the utmost audacity rushed off to the article in the pulpit her friend mr alf the editor had thoroughly appreciated the greatness of mr melmottes character and the magnificence of mr melmottes undertakings mr melmotte bowed and muttered something that was inaudible now i must introduce you to mr alf said the lady the introduction was effected and mr alf explained that it was hardly necessary as he had already been entertained as one of mr melmottes guests  there were a great many there i never saw and probably never shall see said mr melmotte  i was one of the unfortunates said mr alf  im sorry you were unfortunate if you had come into the whist room you would have found me  ahif i had but known said mr alf the editor as was proper carried about with him samples of the irony which his paper used so effectively but it was altogether thrown away upon melmotte  lady carbury finding that no immediate good results could be expected from this last introduction tried another mr melmotte she said whispering to him i do so want to make you known to mr broune mr broune i know you have never met before a morning paper is a much heavier burden to an editor than one published in the afternoon mr broune as of course you know manages the breakfast table there is hardly a more influential man in london than mr broune and they declare you know she said lowering the tone of her whisper as she communicated the fact that his commercial articles are gospel absolutely gospel then the two men were named to each other and lady carbury retreatedbut not out of hearing  getting very hot said mr melmotte  very hot indeed said mr broune  it was over 70 in the city today i call that very hot for june  very hot indeed said mr broune again then the conversation was over mr broune sidled away and mr melmotte was left standing in the middle of the room lady carbury told herself at the moment that rome was not built in a day she would have been better satisfied certainly if she could have laid a few more bricks on this day perseverance however was the thing wanted  but mr melmotte himself had a word to say and before he left the house he said it it was very good of you to ask me lady carbury very good lady carbury intimated her opinion that the goodness was all on the other side and i came continued mr melmotte because i had something particular to say otherwise i dont go out much to evening parties your son has proposed to my daughter lady carbury looked up into his face with all her eyesclasped both her hands together and then having unclasped them put one upon his sleeve  my daughter maam is engaged to another man  you would not enslave her affections mr melmotte  i wont give her a shilling if she marries any one else thats all you reminded me down at caversham that your son is a director at our board  i didi did  i have a great respect for your son maam i dont want to hurt him in any way if hell signify to my daughter that he withdraws from this offer of his because im against it ill see that he does uncommon well in the city ill be the making of him good night maam then mr melmotte took his departure without another word  here at any rate was an undertaking on the part of the great man that he would be the making of felix if felix would only obey him accompanied or rather preceded by a most positive assurance that if felix were to succeed in marrying his daughter he would not give his soninlaw a shilling there was very much to be considered in this she did not doubt that felix might be made by mr melmottes city influences but then any perpetuity of such making must depend on qualifications in her son which she feared that he did not possess the wife without the money would be terrible that would be absolute ruin there could be no escape then no hope there was an appreciation of real tragedy in her heart while she contemplated the position of sir felix married to such a girl as she supposed marie melmotte to be without any means of support for either of them but what she could supply it would kill her and for those young people there would be nothing before them but beggary and the workhouse as she thought of this she trembled with true maternal instincts her beautiful boyso glorious with his outward gifts so fit as she thought him for all the graces of the grand world though the ambition was vilely ignoble the mothers love was noble and disinterested  but the girl was an only child the future honours of the house of melmotte could be made to settle on no other head no doubt the father would prefer a lord for a soninlaw and having that preference would of course do as he was now doing that he should threaten to disinherit his daughter if she married contrary to his wishes was to be expected but would it not be equally a matter of course that he should make the best of the marriage if it were once effected his daughter would return to him with a title though with one of a lower degree than his ambition desired to herself personally lady carbury felt that the great financier had been very rude he had taken advantage of her invitation that he might come to her house and threaten her but she would forgive that she could pass that over altogether if only anything were to be gained by passing it over  she looked round the room longing for a friend whom she might consult with a true feeling of genuine womanly dependence her most natural friend was roger carbury but even had he been there she could not have consulted him on any matter touching the melmottes his advice would have been very clear he would have told her to have nothing at all to do with such adventurers but then dear roger was oldfashioned and knew nothing of people as they are now he lived in a world which though slow had been good in its way but which whether bad or good had now passed away then her eye settled on mr broune she was afraid of mr alf she had almost begun to think that mr alf was too difficult of management to be of use to her but mr broune was softer mr booker was serviceable for an article but would not be sympathetic as a friend  mr broune had been very courteous to her latelyso much so that on one occasion she had almost feared that the susceptible old goose was going to be a goose again that would be a bore but still she might make use of the friendly condition of mind which such susceptibility would produce when her guests began to leave her she spoke a word aside to him she wanted his advice would he stay for a few minutes after the rest of the company he did stay and when all the others were gone she asked her daughter to leave them hetta she said i have something of business to communicate to mr broune and so they were left alone  im afraid you didnt make much of mr melmotte she said smiling he had seated himself on the end of a sofa close to the armchair which she occupied in reply he only shook his head and laughed i saw how it was and i was sorry for it for he certainly is a wonderful man  i suppose he is but he is one of those men whose powers do not lie i should say chiefly in conversation though indeed there is no reason why he should not say the same of mefor if he said little i said less  it didnt just come off lady carbury suggested with her sweetest smile but now i want to tell you something i think i am justified in regarding you as a real friend  certainly he said putting out his hand for hers  she gave it to him for a moment and then took it back againfinding that he did not relinquish it of his own accord stupid old goose she said to herself and now to my story you know my boy felix the editor nodded his head he is engaged to marry that mans daughter  engaged to marry miss melmotte then lady carbury nodded her head why she is said to be the greatest heiress that the world has ever produced i thought she was to marry lord nidderdale  she has engaged herself to felix she is desperately in love with him as is he with her she tried to tell her story truly knowing that no advice can be worth anything that is not based on a true storybut lying had become her nature melmotte naturally wants her to marry the lord he came here to tell me that if his daughter married felix she would not have a penny  do you mean that he volunteered that as a threat  just soand he told me that he had come here simply with the object of saying so it was more candid than civil but we must take it as we get it  he would be sure to make some such threat  exactly that is just what i feel and in these days young people are often kept from marrying simply by a fathers fantasy but i must tell you something else he told me that if felix would desist he would enable him to make a fortune in the city  thats bosh said broune with decision  do you think it must be socertainly  yes i do such an undertaking if intended by melmotte would give me a worse opinion of him than i have ever held  he did make it  then he did very wrong he must have spoken with the purpose of deceiving  you know my son is one of the directors of that great american railway it was not just as though the promise were made to a young man who was altogether unconnected with him  sir felixs name was put there in a hurry merely because he has a title and because melmotte thought he as a young man would not be likely to interfere with him it may be that he will be able to sell a few shares at a profit but if i understand the matter rightly he has no capital to go into such a business  nohe has no capital  dear lady carbury i would place no dependence at all on such a promise as that  you think he should marry the girl then in spite of the father  mr broune hesitated before he replied to this question but it was to this question that lady carbury especially wished for a reply she wanted some one to support her under the circumstances of an elopement she rose from her chair and he rose at the same time  perhaps i should have begun by saying that felix is all but prepared to take her off she is quite ready to go she is devoted to him do you think he would be wrong  that is a question very hard to answer  people do it every day lionel goldsheiner ran away the other day with lady julia start and everybody visits them  oh yes people do run away and it all comes right it was the gentleman had the money then and it is said you know that old lady catchboy lady julias mother had arranged the elopement herself as offering the safest way of securing the rich prize the young lord didnt like it so the mother had it done in that fashion  there would be nothing disgraceful  i didnt say there wouldbut nevertheless it is one of those things a man hardly ventures to advise if you ask me whether i think that melmotte would forgive her and make her an allowance afterwardsi think he would  i am so glad to hear you say that  and i feel quite certain that no dependence whatever should be placed on that promise of assistance  i quite agree with you i am so much obliged to you said lady carbury who was now determined that felix should run off with the girl you have been so very kind then again she gave him her hand as though to bid him farewell for the night  and now he said i also have something to say to you     chapter xxxi  mr broune has made up his mind   and now i have something to say to you mr broune as he thus spoke to lady carbury rose up to his feet and then sat down again there was an air of perturbation about him which was very manifest to the lady and the cause and coming result of which she thought that she understood the susceptible old goose is going to do something highly ridiculous and very disagreeable it was thus that she spoke to herself of the scene that she saw was prepared for her but she did not foresee accurately the shape in which the susceptibility of the old goose would declare itself lady carbury said mr broune standing up a second time we are neither of us so young as we used to be  no indeedand therefore it is that we can afford to ourselves the luxury of being friends nothing but age enables men and women to know each other intimately  this speech was a great impediment to mr brounes progress it was evidently intended to imply that he at least had reached a time of life at which any allusion to love would be absurd and yet as a fact he was nearer fifty than sixty was young of his age could walk his four or five miles pleasantly could ride his cob in the park with as free an air as any man of forty and could afterwards work through four or five hours of the night with an easy steadiness which nothing but sound health could produce mr broune thinking of himself and his own circumstances could see no reason why he should not be in love i hope we know each other intimately at any rate he said somewhat lamely  oh yesand it is for that reason that i have come to you for advice had i been a young woman i should not have dared to ask you  i dont see that i dont quite understand that but it has nothing to do with my present purpose when i said that we were neither of us so young as we once were i uttered what was a stupid platitudea foolish truism  i do not think so said lady carbury smiling  or would have been only that i intended something further mr broune had got himself into a difficulty and hardly knew how to get out of it i was going on to say that i hoped we were not too old tolove  foolish old darling what did he mean by making such an ass of himself this was worse even than the kiss as being more troublesome and less easily pushed on one side and forgotten it may serve to explain the condition of lady carburys mind at the time if it be stated that she did not even at this moment suppose that the editor of the morning breakfast table intended to make her an offer of marriage she knew or thought she knew that middleaged men are fond of prating about love and getting up sensational scenes the falseness of the thing and the injury which may come of it did not shock her at all had she known that the editor professed to be in love with some lady in the next street she would have been quite ready to enlist the lady in the next street among her friends that she might thus strengthen her own influence with mr broune for herself such makebelieve of an improper passion would be inconvenient and therefore to be avoided but that any man placed as mr broune was in the worldblessed with power with a large income with influence throughout all the world around him courted fêted feared and almost worshippedthat he should desire to share her fortunes her misfortunes her struggles her poverty and her obscurity was not within the scope of her imagination there was a homage in it of which she did not believe any man to be capableand which to her would be the more wonderful as being paid to herself she thought so badly of men and women generally and of mr broune and herself as a man and a woman individually that she was unable to conceive the possibility of such a sacrifice mr broune she said i did not think that you would take advantage of the confidence i have placed in you to annoy me in this way  to annoy you lady carbury the phrase at any rate is singular after much thought i have determined to ask you to be my wife that i should beannoyed and more than annoyed by your refusal is a matter of course that i ought to expect such annoyance is perhaps too true but you can extricate yourself from the dilemma only too easily  the word wife came upon her like a thunderclap it at once changed all her feelings towards him she did not dream of loving him she felt sure that she never could love him had it been on the cards with her to love any man as a lover it would have been some handsome spendthrift who would have hung from her neck like a nether millstone this man was a friend to be usedto be used because he knew the world and now he gave her this clear testimony that he knew as little of the world as any other man mr broune of the daily breakfast table asking her to be his wife but mixed with her other feelings there was a tenderness which brought back some memory of her distant youth and almost made her weep that a mansuch a manshould offer to take half her burdens and to confer upon her half his blessings what an idiot but what a god she had looked upon the man as all intellect alloyed perhaps by some passionless remnants of the vices of his youth and now she found that he not only had a human heart in his bosom but a heart that she could touch how wonderfully sweet how infinitely small  it was necessary that she should answer himand to her it was only natural that she should think what answer would best assist her own views without reference to his it did not occur to her that she could love him but it did occur to her that he might lift her out of her difficulties what a benefit it would be to her to have a father and such a father for felix how easy would be a literary career to the wife of the editor of the morning breakfast table and then it passed through her mind that somebody had told her that the man was paid £3000 a year for his work would not the world or any part of it that was desirable come to her drawingroom if she were the wife of mr broune it all passed through her brain at once during that minute of silence which she allowed herself after the declaration was made to her but other ideas and other feelings were present to her also perhaps the truest aspiration of her heart had been the love of freedom which the tyranny of her late husband had engendered once she had fled from that tyranny and had been almost crushed by the censure to which she had been subjected then her husbands protection and his tyranny had been restored to her  after that the freedom had come it had been accompanied by many hopes never as yet fulfilled and embittered by many sorrows which had been always present to her but still the hopes were alive and the remembrance of the tyranny was very clear to her at last the minute was over and she was bound to speak mr broune she said you have quite taken away my breath i never expected anything of this kind  and now mr brounes mouth was opened and his voice was free lady carbury he said i have lived a long time without marrying and i have sometimes thought that it would be better for me to go on the same way to the end i have worked so hard all my life that when i was young i had no time to think of love and as i have gone on my mind has been so fully employed that i have hardly realized the want which nevertheless i have felt and so it has been with me till i fancied not that i was too old for love but that others would think me so then i met you as i said at first perhaps with scant gallantry you also are not as young as you once were but you keep the beauty of your youth and the energy and something of the freshness of a young heart and i have come to love you i speak with absolute frankness risking your anger i have doubted much before i resolved upon this it is so hard to know the nature of another person but i think i understand yoursand if you can confide your happiness with me i am prepared to entrust mine to your keeping poor mr broune though endowed with gifts peculiarly adapted for the editing of a daily newspaper he could have had but little capacity for reading a womans character when he talked of the freshness of lady carburys young mind and he must have surely been much blinded by love before convincing himself that he could trust his happiness to such keeping  you do me infinite honour you pay me a great compliment ejaculated lady carbury  well  how am i to answer you at a moment i expected nothing of this as god is to be my judge it has come upon me like a dream i look upon your position as almost the highest in englandon your prosperity as the uttermost that can be achieved  that prosperity such as it is i desire most anxiously to share with you  you tell me sobut i can hardly yet believe it and then how am i to know my own feelings so suddenly marriage as i have found it mr broune has not been happy i have suffered much i have been wounded in every joint hurt in every nervetortured till i could hardly endure my punishment at last i got my liberty and to that i have looked for happiness  has it made you happy  it has made me less wretched and there is so much to be considered i have a son and a daughter mr broune  your daughter i can love as my own i think i prove my devotion to you when i say that i am willing for your sake to encounter the troubles which may attend your sons future career  mr broune i love him betteralways shall love him betterthan anything in the world this was calculated to damp the lovers ardour but he probably reflected that should he now be successful time might probably change the feeling which had just been expressed mr broune she said i am now so agitated that you had better leave me and it is very late the servant is sitting up and will wonder that you should remain it is near two oclock  when may i hope for an answer  you shall not be kept waiting i will write to you almost at once i will write to youtomorrow say the day after tomorrow on thursday i feel that i ought to have been prepared with an answer but i am so surprised that i have none ready he took her hand in his and kissing it left her without another word  as he was about to open the front door to let himself out a key from the other side raised the latch and sir felix returning from his club entered his mothers house the young man looked up into mr brounes face with mingled impudence and surprise halloo old fellow he said youve been keeping it up late here havent you he was nearly drunk and mr broune perceiving his condition passed him without a word lady carbury was still standing in the drawingroom struck with amazement at the scene which had just passed full of doubt as to her future conduct when she heard her son tumbling up the stairs it was impossible for her not to go out to him felix she said why do you make so much noise as you come in  noish im not making any noish i think im very early your peoples only just gone i shaw shat editor fellow at the door that wont call himself brown hesh great assh that fellow all right mother oh yesh im all right and so he tumbled up to bed and his mother followed him to see that the candle was at any rate placed squarely on the table beyond the reach of the bed curtains  mr broune as he walked to his newspaper office experienced all those pangs of doubt which a man feels when he has just done that which for days and weeks past he has almost resolved that he had better leave undone that last apparition which he had encountered at his lady loves door certainly had not tended to reassure him what curse can be much greater than that inflicted by a drunken reprobate son the evil when in the course of things it comes upon a man has to be borne but why should a man in middle life unnecessarily afflict himself with so terrible a misfortune the woman too was devoted to the cub then thousands of other thoughts crowded upon him how would this new life suit him he must have a new house and new ways must live under a new dominion and fit himself to new pleasures and what was he to gain by it lady carbury was a handsome woman and he liked her beauty he regarded her too as a clever woman and because she had flattered him he had liked her conversation he had been long enough about town to have known betterand as he now walked along the streets he almost felt that he ought to have known better every now and again he warmed himself a little with the remembrance of her beauty and told himself that his new home would be pleasanter though it might perhaps be less free than the old one he tried to make the best of it but as he did so was always repressed by the memory of the appearance of that drunken young baronet  whether for good or for evil the step had been taken and the thing was done it did not occur to him that the lady would refuse him all his experience of the world was against such refusal towns which consider always render themselves ladies who doubt always solve their doubts in the one direction of course she would accept himand of course he would stand to his guns as he went to his work he endeavoured to bathe himself in selfcomplacency but at the bottom of it there was a substratum of melancholy which leavened his prospects  lady carbury went from the door of her sons room to her own chamber and there sat thinking through the greater part of the night during these hours she perhaps became a better woman as being more oblivious of herself than she had been for many a year it could not be for the good of this man that he should marry herand she did in the midst of her many troubles try to think of the mans condition although in the moments of her triumphand such moments were manyshe would buoy herself up with assurances that her felix would become a rich man brilliant with wealth and rank an honour to her a personage whose society would be desired by many still in her heart of hearts she knew how great was the peril and in her imagination she could foresee the nature of the catastrophe which might come he would go utterly to the dogs and would take her with him and whithersoever he might go to what lowest canine regions he might descend she knew herself well enough to be sure that whether married or single she would go with him though her reason might be ever so strong in bidding her to desert him her heart she knew would be stronger than her reason he was the one thing in the world that overpowered her in all other matters she could scheme and contrive and pretend could get the better of her feelings and fight the world with a double face laughing at illusions and telling herself that passions and preferences were simply weapons to be used but her love for her son mastered herand she knew it as it was so could it be fit that she should marry another man  and then her liberty even though felix should bring her to utter ruin nevertheless she would be and might remain a free woman should the worse come to the worst she thought that she could endure a bohemian life in which should all her means have been taken from her she could live on what she earned though felix was a tyrant after a kind he was not a tyrant who could bid her do this or that a repetition of marriage vows did not of itself recommend itself to her as to loving the man liking his caresses and being specially happy because he was near herno romance of that kind ever presented itself to her imagination how would it affect felix and her togetherand mr broune as connected with her and felix if felix should go to the dogs then would mr broune not want her should felix go to the stars instead of the dogs and become one of the gilded ornaments of the metropolis then would not he and she want mr broune it was thus that she regarded the matter  she thought very little of her daughter as she considered all this there was a home for hetta with every comfort if hetta would only condescend to accept it why did not hetta marry her cousin roger carbury and let there be an end of that trouble of course hetta must live wherever her mother lived till she should marry but hettas life was so much at her own disposal that her mother did not feel herself bound to be guided in the great matter by hettas predispositions  but she must tell hetta should she ultimately make up her mind to marry the man and in that case the sooner this was done the better on that night she did not make up her mind ever and again as she declared to herself that she would not marry him the picture of a comfortable assured home over her head and the conviction that the editor of the morning breakfast table would be powerful for all things brought new doubts to her mind but she could not convince herself and when at last she went to her bed her mind was still vacillating the next morning she met hetta at breakfast and with assumed nonchalance asked a question about the man who was perhaps about to be her husband do you like mr broune hetta  yespretty well i dont care very much about him what makes you ask mamma  because among my acquaintances in london there is no one so truly kind to me as he is  he always seems to me to like to have his own way  why shouldnt he like it  he has to me that air of selfishness which is so very common with people in londonas though what he said were all said out of surface politeness  i wonder what you expect hetta when you talk of london people why should not london people be as kind as other people i think mr broune is as obliging a man as any one i know but if i like anybody you always make little of him the only person you seem to think well of is mr montague  mamma that is unfair and unkind i never mention mr montagues name if i can help itand i should not have spoken of mr broune had you not asked me     chapter xxxii  lady monogram   georgiana longestaffe had now been staying with the melmottes for a fortnight and her prospects in regard to the london season had not much improved her brother had troubled her no further and her family at caversham had not as far as she was aware taken any notice of dollys interference twice a week she received a cold dull letter from her mothersuch letters as she had been accustomed to receive when away from home and these she had answered always endeavouring to fill her sheet with some customary description of fashionable doings with some bit of scandal such as she would have repeated for her mothers amusementand her own delectation in the telling of it had there been nothing painful in the nature of her sojourn in london of the melmottes she hardly spoke she did not say that she was taken to the houses in which it was her ambition to be seen she would have lied directly in saying so but she did not announce her own disappointment she had chosen to come up to the melmottes in preference to remaining at caversham and she would not declare her own failure i hope they are kind to you lady pomona always said but georgiana did not tell her mother whether the melmottes were kind or unkind  in truth her season was a very unpleasant season her mode of living was altogether different to anything she had already known the house in bruton street had never been very bright but the appendages of life there had been of a sort which was not known in the gorgeous mansion in grosvenor square it had been full of books and little toys and those thousand trifling household gods which are accumulated in years and which in their accumulation suit themselves to the taste of their owners in grosvenor square there were no laresno toys no books nothing but gold and grandeur pomatum powder and pride the longestaffe life had not been an easy natural or intellectual life but the melmotte life was hardly endurable even by a longestaffe she had however come prepared to suffer much and was endowed with considerable power of endurance in pursuit of her own objects having willed to come even to the melmottes in preference to remaining at caversham she fortified herself to suffer much could she have ridden in the park at midday in desirable company and found herself in proper houses at midnight she would have borne the rest bad as it might have been but it was not so she had her horse but could with difficulty get any proper companion she had been in the habit of riding with one of the primero girlsand old primero would accompany them or perhaps a brother primero or occasionally her own father and then when once out she would be surrounded by a cloud of young menand though there was but little in it a walking round and round the same bit of ground with the same companions and with the smallest attempt at conversation still it had been the proper thing and had satisfied her now it was with difficulty that she could get any cavalier such as the laws of society demand even penelope primero snubbed herwhom she georgiana longestaffe had hitherto endured and snubbed she was just allowed to join them when old primero rode and was obliged even to ask for that assistance  but the nights were still worse she could only go where madame melmotte went and madame melmotte was more prone to receive people at home than to go out and the people she did receive were antipathetic to miss longestaffe she did not even know who they were whence they came or what was their nature they seemed to be as little akin to her as would have been the shopkeepers in the small town near caversham she would sit through long evenings almost speechless trying to fathom the depth of the vulgarity of her associates occasionally she was taken out and was then probably taken to very grand houses the two duchesses and the marchioness of auld reekie received madame melmotte and the garden parties of royalty were open to her and some of the most elaborate fêtes of the seasonwhich indeed were very elaborate on behalf of this and that travelling potentatewere attained on these occasions miss longestaffe was fully aware of the struggle that was always made for invitations often unsuccessfully but sometimes with triumph even the bargains conducted by the hands of lord alfred and his mighty sister were not altogether hidden from her the emperor of china was to be in london and it was thought proper that some private person some untitled individual should give the emperor a dinner so that the emperor might see how an english merchant lives mr melmotte was chosen on condition that he would spend £10000 on the banquetand as a part of his payment for this expenditure was to be admitted with his family to a grand entertainment given to the emperor at windsor park of these good things georgiana longestaffe would receive her share but she went to them as a melmotte and not as a longestaffeand when amidst these gaieties though she could see her old friends she was not with them she was ever behind madame melmotte till she hated the make of that ladys garments and the shape of that ladys back  she had told both her father and mother very plainly that it behoved her to be in london at this time of the year that she mightlook for a husband she had not hesitated in declaring her purpose and that purpose together with the means of carrying it out had not appeared to them to be unreasonable she wanted to be settled in life she had meant when she first started on her career to have a lordbut lords are scarce she was herself not very highly born not very highly gifted not very lovely not very pleasant and she had no fortune she had long made up her mind that she could do without a lord but that she must get a commoner of the proper sort he must be a man with a place in the country and sufficient means to bring him annually to london he must be a gentlemanand probably in parliament and above all things he must be in the right set she would rather go on for ever struggling than take some country whitstable as her sister was about to do but now the men of the right sort never came near her the one object for which she had subjected herself to all this ignominy seemed to have vanished altogether in the distance when by chance she danced or exchanged a few words with the nidderdales and grassloughs whom she used to know they spoke to her with a want of respect which she felt and tasted but could hardly analyse even miles grendall who had hitherto been below her notice attempted to patronize her in a manner that bewildered her all this nearly broke her heart  and then from time to time little rumours reached her ears which made her aware that in the teeth of all mr melmottes social successes a general opinion that he was a gigantic swindler was rather gaining ground than otherwise your host is a wonderful fellow by george said lord nidderdale no one seems to know which way hell turn up at last theres nothing like being a robber if you can only rob enough said lord grassloughnot exactly naming melmotte but very clearly alluding to him there was a vacancy for a member of parliament at westminster and melmotte was about to come forward as a candidate if he can manage that i think hell pull through she heard one man say if moneyll do it it will be done said another she could understand it all mr melmotte was admitted into society because of some enormous power which was supposed to lie in his hands but even by those who thus admitted him he was regarded as a thief and a scoundrel this was the man whose house had been selected by her father in order that she might make her search for a husband from beneath his wing  in her agony she wrote to her old friend julia triplex now the wife of sir damask monogram she had been really intimate with julia triplex and had been sympathetic when a brilliant marriage had been achieved julia had been without fortune but very pretty sir damask was a man of great wealth whose father had been a contractor but sir damask himself was a sportsman keeping many horses on which other men often rode a yacht in which other men sunned themselves a deer forest a moor a large machinery for making pheasants he shot pigeons at hurlingham drove fourinhand in the park had a box at every racecourse and was the most goodnatured fellow known he had really conquered the world had got over the difficulty of being the grandson of a butcher and was now as good as though the monograms had gone to the crusades julia triplex was equal to her position and made the very most of it she dispensed champagne and smiles and made everybody including herself believe that she was in love with her husband lady monogram had climbed to the top of the tree and in that position had been of course invaluable to her old friend we must give her her due and say that she had been fairly true to friendship while georgianabehaved herself she thought that georgiana in going to the melmottes had not behaved herself and therefore she had determined to drop georgiana heartless false purseproud creature georgiana said to herself as she wrote the following letter in humiliating agony      dear lady monogram     i think you hardly understand my position of course you have cut    me havent you and of course i must feel it very much you did    not use to be illnatured and i hardly think you can have become    so now when you have everything pleasant around you i do not    think that i have done anything that should make an old friend    treat me in this way and therefore i write to ask you to let me    see you of course it is because i am staying here you know me    well enough to be sure that it cant be my own choice papa    arranged it all if there is anything against these people i    suppose papa does not know it of course they are not nice of    course they are not like anything that i have been used to but    when papa told me that the house in bruton street was to be shut    up and that i was to come here of course i did as i was bid i    dont think an old friend like you whom i have always liked more    than anybody else ought to cut me for it its not about the    parties but about yourself that i mind i dont ask you to come    here but if you will see me i can have the carriage and will go    to you     yours as ever     georgiana longestaffe   it was a troublesome letter to get written lady monogram was her junior in age and had once been lower than herself in social position in the early days of their friendship she had sometimes domineered over julia triplex and had been entreated by julia in reference to balls here and routes there the great monogram marriage had been accomplished very suddenly and had taken placeexalting julia very highjust as georgiana was beginning to allow her aspirations to descend it was in that very season that she moved her castle in the air from the upper to the lower house and now she was absolutely begging for notice and praying that she might not be cut she sent her letter by post and on the following day received a reply which was left by a footman      dear georgiana     of course i shall be delighted to see you i dont know what you    mean by cutting i never cut anybody we happen to have got into    different sets but that is not my fault sir damask wont let me    call on the melmottes i cant help that you wouldnt have me go    where he tells me not i dont know anything about them myself    except that i did go to their ball but everybody knows thats    different i shall be at home all tomorrow till threethat is    today i mean for im writing after coming home from lady    killarneys ball but if you wish to see me alone you had better    come before lunch     yours affectionately     j monogram   georgiana condescended to borrow the carriage and reached her friends house a little after noon the two ladies kissed each other when they metof course and then miss longestaffe at once began julia i did think that you would at any rate have asked me to your second ball  of course you would have been asked if you had been up in bruton street you know that as well as i do it would have been a matter of course  what difference does a house make  but the people in a house make a great deal of difference my dear i dont want to quarrel with you my dear but i cant know the melmottes  who asks you  you are with them  do you mean to say that you cant ask anybody to your house without asking everybody that lives with that person its done every day  somebody must have brought you  i would have come with the primeros julia  i couldnt do it i asked damask and he wouldnt have it when that great affair was going on in february we didnt know much about the people i was told that everybody was going and therefore i got sir damask to let me go he says now that he wont let me know them and after having been at their house i cant ask you out of it without asking them too  i dont see it at all julia  im very sorry my dear but i cant go against my husband  everybody goes to their house said georgiana pleading her cause to the best of her ability the duchess of stevenage has dined in grosvenor square since i have been there  we all know what that means replied lady monogram  and people are giving their eyes to be asked to the dinner party which he is to give to the emperor in julyand even to the reception afterwards  to hear you talk georgiana one would think that you didnt understand anything said lady monogram people are going to see the emperor not to see the melmottes i dare say we might have gone only i suppose we shant nowbecause of this row  i dont know what you mean by a row julia  wellit is a row and i hate rows going there when the emperor of china is there or anything of that kind is no more than going to the play somebody chooses to get all london into his house and all london chooses to go but it isnt understood that that means acquaintance i should meet madame melmotte in the park afterwards and not think of bowing to her  i should call that rude  very well then we differ but really it does seem to me that you ought to understand these things as well as anybody i dont find any fault with you for going to the melmottesthough i was very sorry to hear it but when you have done it i dont think you should complain of people because they wont have the melmottes crammed down their throats  nobody has wanted it said georgiana sobbing at this moment the door was opened and sir damask came in im talking to your wife about the melmottes she continued determined to take the bull by the horns im staying there andi think itunkind that juliahasnt beento see me thats all  howd you do miss longestaffe she doesnt know them and sir damask folding his hands together raising his eyebrows and standing on the rug looked as though he had solved the whole difficulty  she knows me sir damask  oh yesshe knows you thats a matter of course were delighted to see you miss longestaffei am always wish we could have had you at ascot but then he looked as though he had again explained everything  ive told her that you dont want me to go to the melmottes said lady monogram  well nonot just to go there stay and have lunch miss longestaffe  no thank you  now youre here youd better said lady monogram  no thank you im sorry that i have not been able to make you understand me i could not allow our very long friendship to be dropped without a word  dont saydropped exclaimed the baronet  i do say dropped sir damask i thought we should have understood each otheryour wife and i but we havent wherever she might have gone i should have made it my business to see her but she feels differently goodbye  goodbye my dear if you will quarrel it isnt my doing then sir damask led miss longestaffe out and put her into madame melmottes carriage its the most absurd thing i ever knew in my life said the wife as soon as her husband had returned to her she hasnt been able to bear to remain down in the country for one season when all the world knows that her father cant afford to have a house for them in town then she condescends to come and stay with these abominations and pretends to feel surprised that her old friends dont run after her she is old enough to have known better  i suppose she likes parties said sir damask  likes parties shed like to get somebody to take her its twelve years now since georgiana longestaffe came out i remember being told of the time when i was first entered myself yes my dear you know all about it i dare say and there she is still i can feel for her and do feel for her but if she will let herself down in that way she cant expect not to be dropped you remember the womandont you  what woman  madame melmotte  never saw her in my life  oh yes you did you took me there that night when princedanced with the girl dont you remember the blowsy fat woman at the top of the stairsa regular horror  didnt look at her i was only thinking what a lot of money it all cost  i remember her and if georgiana longestaffe thinks im going there to make an acquaintance with madame melmotte she is very much mistaken and if she thinks that that is the way to get married i think she is mistaken again nothing perhaps is so efficacious in preventing men from marrying as the tone in which married women speak of the struggles made in that direction by their unmarried friends     chapter xxxiii  john crumb   sir felix carbury made an appointment for meeting ruby ruggles a second time at the bottom of the kitchengarden belonging to sheeps acre farm which appointment he neglected and had indeed made without any intention of keeping it but ruby was there and remained hanging about among the cabbages till her grandfather returned from harlestone market an early hour had been named but hours may be mistaken and ruby had thought that a fine gentleman such as was her lover used to live among fine people up in london might well mistake the afternoon for the morning if he would come at all she could easily forgive such a mistake but he did not come and late in the afternoon she was obliged to obey her grandfathers summons as he called her into the house  after that for three weeks she heard nothing of her london lover but she was always thinking of himand though she could not altogether avoid her country lover she was in his company as little as possible one afternoon her grandfather returned from bungay and told her that her country lover was coming to see her john crumb be a coming over byandby said the old man see and have a bit o supper ready for him  john crumb coming here grandfather hes welcome to stay away then for me  that be dommed the old man thrust his old hat on to his head and seated himself in a wooden armchair that stood by the kitchenfire whenever he was angry he put on his hat and the custom was well understood by ruby why not welcome and he all one as your husband look ye here ruby im going to have an eend o this john crumb is to marry you next month and the banns is to be said  the parson may say what he pleases grandfather i cant stop his saying of em it isnt likely i shall try neither but no parson among em all can marry me without im willing  and why should you no be willing you contrairy young jade you  youve been adrinking grandfather  he turned round at her sharp and threw his old hat at her head nothing to rubys consternation as it was a practice to which she was well accustomed she picked it up and returned it to him with a cool indifference which was intended to exasperate him look ye here ruby he said out o this place you go if you go as john crumbs wife youll go with five hunerd pound and well have a dinner here and a dance and all bungay  who cares for all bungaya set of beery chaps as knows nothing but swilling and smokingand john crumb the main of em all there never was a chap for beer like john crumb  never saw him the worse o liquor in all my life and the old farmer as he gave this grand assurance rattled his fist down upon the table  it ony just makes him stoopider and stoopider the more he swills you cant tell me grandfather about john crumb i knows him  didnt ye say as how yed have him didnt ye give him a promise  if i did i aint the first girl as has gone back of her wordand i shant

hunerd pound and there aint ere a farmer in suffolk or norfolk paying rent for a bit of land like this can do as well for his darter as thatlet alone only a granddarter you never thinks o thatyou dont if you dont like to take itleave it but youll leave sheeps acre too  bother sheeps acre who wants to stop at sheeps acre its the stoopidest place in all england  then find another then find another thats all aboot it john crumbs a coming up for a bit o supper you tell him your own mind im dommed if i trouble aboot it ony you dont stay here sheeps acre aint good enough for you and youd best find another home stoopid is it youll have to put up wi places stoopider nor sheeps acre afore youve done  in regard to the hospitality promised to mr crumb miss ruggles went about her work with sufficient alacrity she was quite willing that the young man should have a supper and she did understand that so far as the preparation of the supper went she owed her service to her grandfather she therefore went to work herself and gave directions to the servant girl who assisted her in keeping her grandfathers house but as she did this she determined that she would make john crumb understand that she would never be his wife upon that she was now fully resolved as she went about the kitchen taking down the ham and cutting the slices that were to be broiled and as she trussed the fowl that was to be boiled for john crumb she made mental comparisons between him and sir felix carbury she could see as though present to her at the moment the mealy floury head of the one with hair stiff with perennial dust from his sacks and the sweet glossy dark wellcombed locks of the other so bright so seductive that she was ever longing to twine her fingers among them and she remembered the heavy flat broad honest face of the mealman with his mouth slow in motion and his broad nose looking like a huge white promontory and his great staring eyes from the corners of which he was always extracting meal and gritand then also she remembered the white teeth the beautiful soft lips the perfect eyebrows and the rich complexion of her london lover surely a lease of paradise with the one though but for one short year would be well purchased at the price of a life with the other its no good going against love she said to herself and i wont try he shall have his supper and be told all about it and then go home he cares more for his supper than he do for me and then with this final resolution firmly made she popped the fowl into the pot her grandfather wanted her to leave sheeps acre very well she had a little money of her own and would take herself off to london she knew what people would say but she cared nothing for old womens tales she would know how to take care of herself and could always say in her own defence that her grandfather had turned her out of sheeps acre  seven had been the hour named and punctually at that hour john crumb knocked at the back door of sheeps acre farmhouse nor did he come alone he was accompanied by his friend joe mixet the baker of bungay who as all bungay knew was to be his best man at his marriage john crumbs character was not without any fine attributes he could earn moneyand having earned it could spend and keep it in fair proportion he was afraid of no work andto give him his due was afraid of no man he was honest and ashamed of nothing that he did and after his fashion he had chivalrous ideas about women he was willing to thrash any man that illused a woman and would certainly be a most dangerous antagonist to any man who would misuse a woman belonging to him but ruby had told the truth of him in saying that he was slow of speech and what the world calls stupid in regard to all forms of expression he knew good meal from bad as well as any man and the price at which he could buy it so as to leave himself a fair profit at the selling he knew the value of a clear conscience and without much argument had discovered for himself that honesty is in truth the best policy joe mixet who was dapper of person and glib of tongue had often declared that any one buying john crumb for a fool would lose his money joe mixet was probably right but there had been a want of prudence a lack of worldly sagacity in the way in which crumb had allowed his proposed marriage with ruby ruggles to become a source of gossip to all bungay his love was now an old affair and though he never talked much whenever he did talk he talked about that he was proud of rubys beauty and of her fortune and of his own status as her acknowledged loverand he did not hide his light under a bushel perhaps the publicity so produced had some effect in prejudicing ruby against the man whose offer she had certainly once accepted now when he came to settle the dayhaving heard more than once or twice that there was a difficulty with rubyhe brought his friend mixet with him as though to be present at his triumph if here isnt joe mixet said ruby to herself was there ever such a stoopid as john crumb theres no end to his being stoopid  the old man had slept off his anger and his beer while ruby had been preparing the feast and now roused himself to entertain his guests what joe mixet is that thou thourt welcome come in man well john how is it wi you rubys stewing o something for us to eat a bit dont e smell itjohn crumb lifted up his great nose sniffed and grinned  john didnt like going home in the dark like said the baker with his little joke so i just come along to drive away the bogies  the more the merrierthe more the merrier rubyll have enough for the two o you ill go bail so john crumbs afraid of bogiesis he the more need he to have some un in his house to scart em away  the lover had seated himself without speaking a word but now he was instigated to ask a question where be she muster ruggles they were seated in the outside or front kitchen in which the old man and his granddaughter always lived while ruby was at work in the back kitchen as john crumb asked this question she could be heard distinctly among the pots and the plates she now came out and wiping her hands on her apron shook hands with the two young men she had enveloped herself in a big household apron when the cooking was in hand and had not cared to take it off for the greeting of this lover grandfather said as how you was a coming out for your supper so ive been a seeing to it youll excuse the apron mr mixet  you couldnt look nicer miss if you was to try ever so my mother says as its housifery as recommends a girl to the young men what do you say john  i loiks to see her loik o that said john rubbing his hands down the back of his trowsers and stooping till he had brought his eyes down to a level with those of his sweetheart  it looks homely dont it john said mixet  bother said ruby turning round sharp and going back to the other kitchen john crumb turned round also and grinned at his friend and then grinned at the old man  youve got it all afore you said the farmerleaving the lover to draw what lesson he might from this oracular proposition  and i dont care how soon i hae it in hondthat i dont said john  thats the chat said joe mixet there aint nothing wanting in his houseis there john its all therecradle caudlecup and the rest of it a young woman going to john knows what shell have to eat when she gets up and what shell lie down upon when she goes to bed this he declared in a loud voice for the benefit of ruby in the back kitchen  that she do said john grinning again theres a hunerd and fifty poond o things in my house forbye what mother left behind her  after this there was no more conversation till ruby reappeared with the boiled fowl and without her apron she was followed by the girl with a dish of broiled ham and an enormous pyramid of cabbage then the old man got up slowly and opening some private little door of which he kept the key in his breeches pocket drew a jug of ale and placed it on the table and from a cupboard of which he also kept the key he brought out a bottle of gin everything being thus prepared the three men sat round the table john crumb looking at his chair again and again before he ventured to occupy it if youll sit yourself down ill give you a bit of something to eat said ruby at last then he sank at once into has chair ruby cut up the fowl standing and dispensed the other good things not even placing a chair for herself at the tableand apparently not expected to do so for no one invited her is it to be spirits or ale mr crumb she said when the other two men had helped themselves he turned round and gave her a look of love that might have softened the heart of an amazon but instead of speaking he held up his tumbler and bobbed his head at the beer jug then she filled it to the brim frothing it in the manner in which he loved to have it frothed he raised it to his mouth slowly and poured the liquor in as though to a vat then she filled it again he had been her lover and she would be as kind to him as she knew howshort of love  there was a good deal of eating done for more ham came in and another mountain of cabbage but very little or nothing was said john crumb ate whatever was given to him of the fowl sedulously picking the bones and almost swallowing them and then finished the second dish of ham and after that the second instalment of cabbage he did not ask for more beer but took it as often as ruby replenished his glass when the eating was done ruby retired into the back kitchen and there regaled herself with some bone or merrythought of the fowl which she had with prudence reserved sharing her spoils however with the other maiden this she did standing and then went to work cleaning the dishes the men lit their pipes and smoked in silence while ruby went through her domestic duties so matters went on for half an hour during which ruby escaped by the back door went round into the house got into her own room and formed the grand resolution of going to bed she began her operations in fear and trembling not being sure that her grandfather would bring the man upstairs to her as she thought of this she stayed her hand and looked to the door she knew well that there was no bolt there it would be terrible to her to be invaded by john crumb after his fifth or sixth glass of beer and she declared to herself that should he come he would be sure to bring joe mixet with him to speak his mind for him so she paused and listened  when they had smoked for some half hour the old man called for his granddaughter but called of course in vain where the mischief is the jade gone he said slowly making his way into the back kitchen the maid as soon as she heard her master moving escaped into the yard and made no response while the old man stood bawling at the back door the devils in them theyre off some gates he said aloud shell make the place hot for her if she goes on this way then he returned to the two young men shes playing off her games somewheres he said take a glass of sperrits and water mr crumb and ill see after her  ill just take a drop of yell said john crumb apparently quite unmoved by the absence of his sweetheart  it was sad work for the old man he went down the yard and into the garden hobbling among the cabbages not daring to call very loud as he did not wish to have it supposed that the girl was lost but still anxious and sore at heart as to the ingratitude shown to him he was not bound to give the girl a home at all she was not his own child and he had offered her £500 domm her he said aloud as he made his way back to the house after much search and considerable loss of time he returned to the kitchen in which the two men were sitting leading ruby in his hand she was not smart in her apparel for she had half undressed herself and been then compelled by her grandfather to make herself fit to appear in public she had acknowledged to herself that she had better go down and tell john crumb the truth for she was still determined that she would never be john crumbs wife you can answer him as well as i grandfather she had said then the farmer had cuffed her and told her that she was an idiot oh if it comes to that said ruby im not afraid of john crumb nor yet of nobody else only i didnt think youd go to strike me grandfather ill knock the life out of thee if thou goest on this gate he had said but she had consented to come down and they entered the room together  were a disturbing you amost too late miss said mr mixet  it aint that at all mr mixet if grandfather chooses to have a few friends i aint nothing against it i wish hed have a few friends a deal oftener than he do i likes nothing better than to do for em only when ive done for em and theyre smoking their pipes and that like i dont see why i aint to leave em to emselves  but weve come here on a hauspicious occasion miss ruby  i dont know nothing about auspicious mr mixet if you and mr crumbve come out to sheeps acre farm for a bit of supper  which we aint said john crumb very loudlynor yet for beernot by no means  weve come for the smiles of beauty said joe mixet ruby chucked up her head mr mixet if youll be so good as to stow that there aint no beauty here as i knows of and if there was it isnt nothing to you  except in the way of friendship said mixet  im just as sick of all this as a man can be said mr ruggles who was sitting low in his chair with his back bent and his head forward i wont put up with it no more  who wants you to put up with it said ruby who wants em to come here with their trash who brought em tonight i dont know what business mr mixet has interfering along o me i never interfere along o him  john crumb have you anything to say asked the old man  then john crumb slowly arose from his chair and stood up at his full height i hove said he swinging his head to one side  then say it  i will said he he was still standing bolt upright with his hands down by his side then he stretched out his left to his glass which was half full of beer and strengthened himself as far as that would strengthen him having done this he slowly deposited the pipe which he still held in his right hand  now speak your mind like a man said mixet  i intends it said john but he still stood dumb looking down upon old ruggles who from his crouched position was looking up at him ruby was standing with both her hands upon the table and her eyes intent upon the wall over the fireplace  youve asked miss ruby to be your wife a dozen timeshavent you john suggested mixet  i hove  and you mean to be as good as your word  i do  and she has promised to have you  she hove  more nor once or twice to this proposition crumb found it only necessary to bob his head youre readyand willing  i am  youre wishing to have the banns said without any more delay  there aint no delay bout menever was  everything is ready in your own house  they is  and you will expect miss ruby to come to the scratch  i sholl  thats about it i think said joe mixet turning to the grandfather i dont think there was ever anything much more straightforward than that you know i know miss ruby knows all about john crumb john crumb didnt come to bungay yesterday nor yet the day before theres been a talk of five hundred pounds mr ruggles mr ruggles made a slight gesture of assent with his head five hundred pounds is very comfortable and added to what john has will make things that snug that things never was snugger but john crumb isnt after miss ruby along of her fortune  nohows said the lover shaking his head and still standing upright with his hands by his side  not heit isnt his ways and them as knows himll never say it of him john has a heart in his buzsom  i has said john raising his hand a little above his stomach  and feelings as a man its true love as has brought john crumb to sheeps acre farm this nightlove of that young lady if shell let me make so free hes a proposed to her and shes a

tell you in earnest theres some folk wants such a deal of telling  you dont meannever  i do mean never mr crumb  didnt you say as you would ruby didnt you say so as plain as the nose on my face john as he asked these questions could hardly refrain from tears  young women is allowed to change their minds said ruby  brute exclaimed old ruggles pig jade ill tell you what john shell go out o this

her grandfather but oh she has a mind to put me so abouts that ill have to go home and hang myself  dash it miss ruby you aint a going to serve a young man that way said the baker  if youll jist keep yourself to yourself ill be obliged to you mr mixet said ruby if you hadnt come here at all things might have been different  hark at that now said john looking at his friend almost with indignation  mr mixet who was fully aware of his rare eloquence and of the absolute necessity there had been for its exercise if any arrangement were to be made at all could not trust himself to words after this he put on his hat and walked out through the back kitchen into the yard declaring that his friend would find him there round by the pigsty wall whenever he was ready to return to bungay as soon as mixet was gone john looked at his sweetheart out of the corners of his eyes and made a slow motion towards her putting out his right hand as a feeler hes aff now ruby said john  and youd better be aff after him said the cruel girl  and whenll i come back again  never it aint no use whats the good of more words mr crumb  domm her domm her said old ruggles ill even it to her shell have to be out on the roads this night  she shall have the best bed in my house if shell come for it said john and the old woman to look arter her and i wont come nigh her till she sends for me  i can find a place for myself thank ye mr crumb old ruggles sat grinding his teeth and swearing to himself taking his hat off and putting it on again and meditating vengeance  and now if you please mr crumb ill go upstairs to my own room  you dont go up to any room here you jade you the old man as he said this got up from his chair as though to fly at her and he would have struck her with his stick but that he was stopped by john crumb  dont hit the girl no gate mr ruggles  domm her john she breaks my heart while her lover held her grandfather ruby escaped and seated herself on the bedside again afraid to undress lest she should be disturbed by her grandfather aint it more nor a man ought to have to bearaint it mr crumb said the grandfather appealing to the young man  its the ways on em mr ruggles  ways on em a whipping at the carttail ought to be the ways on her shes been and seen some young buck  then john crumb turned red all over through the flour and sparks of anger flashed from his eyes you aint a meaning of it master  im told theres been the squoires cousin aboothim as they call the baronite  been along wi ruby the old man nodded at him by the mortials ill baronite himi wull said john seizing his hat and stalking off through the back kitchen after his friend     chapter xxxiv  ruby ruggles obeys her grandfather   the next day there was a great surprise at sheeps acre farm which communicated itself to the towns of bungay and beccles and even affected the ordinary quiet life of carbury manor ruby ruggles had gone away and at about twelve oclock in the day the old farmer became aware of the fact she had started early at about seven in the morning but ruggles himself had been out long before that and had not condescended to ask for her when he returned to the house for his breakfast there had been a bad scene up in the bedroom overnight after john crumb had left the farm the old man in his anger had tried to expel the girl but she had hung on to the bedpost and would not go and he had been frightened when the maid came up crying and screaming murder youll be out o this tomorrow as sure as my names dannel ruggles said the farmer panting for breath but for the gin which he had taken he would hardly have struck herbut he had struck her and pulled her by the hair and knocked her aboutand in the morning she took him at his word and was away about twelve he heard from the servant girl that she had gone she had packed a box and had started up the road carrying the box herself grandfather says im to go and im gone she had said to the girl at the first cottage she had got a boy to carry her box into beccles and to beccles she had walked for an hour or two ruggles sat quiet within the house telling himself that she might do as she pleased with herselfthat he was well rid of her and that from henceforth he would trouble himself no more about her but by degrees there came upon him a feeling half of compassion and half of fear with perhaps some mixture of love instigating him to make search for her she had been the same to him as a child and what would people say of him if he allowed her to depart from him after this fashion then he remembered his violence the night before and the fact that the servant girl had heard if she had not seen it he could not drop his responsibility in regard to ruby even if he would so as a first step he sent in a message to john crumb at bungay to tell him that ruby ruggles had gone off with a box to beccles john crumb went openmouthed with the news to joe mixet and all bungay soon knew that ruby ruggles had run away  after sending his message to crumb the old man still sat thinking and at last made up his mind that he would go to his landlord he held a part of his farm under roger carbury and roger carbury would tell him what he ought to do a great trouble had come upon him he would fain have been quiet but his conscience and his heart and his terrors all were at work togetherand he found that he could not eat his dinner so he had out his cart and horse and drove himself off to carbury hall  it was past four when he started and he found the squire seated on the terrace after an early dinner and with him was father barham the priest the old man was shown at once round into the garden and was not long in telling his story there had been words between him and his granddaughter about her lover her lover had been accepted and had come to the farm to claim his bride ruby had behaved very badly the old man made the most of rubys bad behaviour and of course as little as possible of his own violence but he did explain that there had been threats used when ruby refused to take the man and that ruby had this day taken herself off  i always thought it was settled that they were to be man and wife said roger  it was settled squoireand he war to have five hunerd pound downmoney as id saved myself drat the jade  didnt she like him daniel  she liked him well enough till shed seed somebody else then old daniel paused and shook his head and was evidently the owner of a secret the squire got up and walked round the garden with himand then the secret was told the farmer was of opinion that there was something between the girl and sir felix sir felix some weeks since had been seen near the farm and on the same occasion ruby had been observed at some little distance from the house with her best clothes on  hes been so little here daniel said the squire  it goes as tinder and a spark o fire that does said the farmer girls like ruby dont want no time to be wooed by one such as that though theyll falllall with a man like john crumb for years  i suppose shes gone to london  dont know nothing of where shes gone squoireonly she have gone someeres may be its lowestoft theres lots of quality at lowestoft awashing theyselves in the sea  then they returned to the priest who might be supposed to be cognizant of the guiles of the world and competent to give advice on such an occasion as this if she was one of our people said father barham we should have her back quick enough  would ye now said ruggles wishing at the moment that he and all his family had been brought up as roman catholics  i dont see how you would have more chance of catching her than we have said carbury  shed catch herself wherever she might be shed go to the priest and he wouldnt leave her till hed seen her put on the way back to her friends  with a flea in her lug suggested the farmer  your people never go to a clergyman in their distress its the last thing theyd think of any one might more probably be regarded as a friend than the parson but with us the poor know where to look for sympathy  she aint that poor neither said the grandfather  she had money with her  i dont know just what she had but she aint been brought up poor and i dont think as our rubyd go of herself to any clergyman it never was her way  it never is the way with a protestant said the priest  well say no more about that for the present said roger who was waxing wroth with the priest that a man should be fond of his own religion is right but roger carbury was beginning to think that father barham was too fond of his religion what had we better do i suppose we shall hear something of her at the railway there are not so many people leaving beccles but that she may be remembered so the waggonette was ordered and they all prepared to go off to the station together  but before they started john crumb rode up to the door he had gone at once to the farm on hearing of rubys departure and had followed the farmer from thence to carbury now he found the squire and the priest and the old man standing around as the horses were being put to the carriage ye aint a found her mr ruggles ha ye he asked as he wiped the sweat from his brow  noawe aint a found no one yet  if it was as she was to come to harm mr carbury id never forgive myselfnever said crumb  as far as i can understand it is no doing of yours my friend said the squire  in one way it aint and in one way it is i was over there last night a bothering of her shed a come round may be if shed a been left alone she wouldnt a been off now only for our going over to sheeps acre butoh  what is it mr crumb  hes a coosin o yours squoire and long as ive known suffolk ive never known nothing but good o you and yourn but if your baronite has been and done this oh mr carbury if i was to wring his neck round you wouldnt say as how i was wrong would ye now roger could hardly answer the question on general grounds the wringing of sir felixs neck let the immediate cause for such a performance have been what it might would have seemed to him to be a good deed the world would be better according to his thinking with sir felix out of it than in it but still the young man was his cousin and a carbury and to such a one as john crumb he was bound to defend any member of his family as far as he might be defensible they says as how he was groping about sheeps acre when he was last here a hiding himself and skulking behind hedges drat em all theyve gals enough of their ownthem fellows why cant they let a fellow alone ill do him a mischief master roger i wullif hes had a hand in this poor john crumb when he had his mistress to win he could find no words for himself but was obliged to take an eloquent baker with him to talk for him now in his anger he could talk freely enough  but you must first learn that sir felix has had anything to do with this mr crumb  in coorse in coorse thats right thats right must larn as he did it afore i does it but when i have larned and john crumb clenched his fist as though a very short lesson would suffice for him upon this occasion  they all went to the beccles station and from thence to the beccles postofficeso that beccles soon knew as much about it as bungay at the railway station ruby was distinctly remembered she had taken a secondclass ticket by the morning train for london and had gone off without any appearance of secrecy she had been decently dressed with a hat and cloak and her luggage had been such as she might have been expected to carry had all her friends known that she was going so much was made clear at the railway station but nothing more could be learned there then a message was sent by telegraph to the station in london and they all waited loitering about the postoffice for a reply one of the porters in london remembered seeing such a girl as was described but the man who was supposed to have carried her box for her to a cab had gone away for the day it was believed that she had left the station in a fourwheel cab ill be arter her ill be arter her at once said john crumb but there was no train till night and roger carbury was doubtful whether his going would do any good it was evidently fixed on crumbs mind that the first step towards finding ruby would be the breaking of every bone in the body of sir felix carbury now it was not at all apparent to the squire that his cousin had had anything to do with this affair it had been made quite clear to him that the old man had quarrelled with his granddaughter and had threatened to turn her out of his house not because she had misbehaved with sir felix but on account of her refusing to marry john crumb john crumb had gone over to the farm expecting to arrange it all and up to that time there had been no fear about felix carbury nor was it possible that there should have been communication between ruby and felix since the quarrel at the farm even if the old man were right in supposing that ruby and the baronet had been acquaintedand such acquaintance could not but be prejudicial to the girlnot on that account would the baronet be responsible for her abduction john crumb was thirsting for blood and was not very capable in his present mood of arguing the matter out coolly and roger little as he toyed his cousin was not desirous that all suffolk should know that sir felix carbury had been thrashed within an inch of his life by john crumb of bungay ill tell you what ill do said he putting his hand kindly on the old mans shoulder ill go up myself by the first train tomorrow i can trace her better than mr crumb can do and you will both trust me  theres not one in the two counties id trust so soon said the old man  but youll let us know the very truth said john crumb roger carbury made him an indiscreet promise that he would let him know the truth so the matter was settled and the grandfather and lover returned together to bungay     chapter xxxv  melmottes glory   augustus melmotte was becoming greater and greater in every direction mightier and mightier every day he was learning to despise mere lords and to feel that he might almost domineer over a duke in truth he did recognize it as a fact that he must either domineer over dukes or else go to the wall it can hardly be said of him that he had intended to play so high a game but the game that he had intended to play had become thus high of its own accord a man cannot always restrain his own doings and keep them within the limits which he had himself planned for them they will very often fall short of the magnitude to which his ambition has aspired they will sometimes soar higher than his own imagination so it had now been with mr melmotte he had contemplated great things but the things which he was achieving were beyond his contemplation  the reader will not have thought much of fisker on his arrival in england fisker was perhaps not a man worthy of much thought he had never read a book he had never written a line worth reading he had never said a prayer he cared nothing for humanity he had sprung out of some californian gully was perhaps ignorant of his own father and mother and had tumbled up in the world on the strength of his own audacity but such as he was he had sufficed to give the necessary impetus for rolling augustus melmotte onwards into almost unprecedented commercial greatness when mr melmotte took his offices in abchurch lane he was undoubtedly a great man but nothing so great as when the south central pacific and mexican railway had become not only an established fact but a fact established in abchurch lane the great company indeed had an office of its own where the board was held but everything was really managed in mr melmottes own commercial sanctum obeying no doubt some inscrutable law of commerce the grand enterpriseperhaps the grandest when you consider the amount of territory manipulated which has ever opened itself before the eyes of a great commercial people as mr fisker with his peculiar eloquence observed through his nose about this time to a meeting of shareholders at san franciscohad swung itself across from california to london turning itself to the centre of the commercial world as the needle turns to the pole till mr fisker almost regretted the deed which himself had done and melmotte was not only the head but the body also and the feet of it all the shares seemed to be all in melmottes pocket so that he could distribute them as he would and it seemed also that when distributed and sold and when bought again and sold again they came back to melmottes pocket men were contented to buy their shares and to pay their money simply on melmottes word sir felix had realized a large portion of his winnings at cardswith commendable prudence for one so young and extravagantand had brought his savings to the great man the great man had swept the earnings of the beargarden into his till and had told sir felix that the shares were his sir felix had been not only contented but supremely happy he could now do as paul montague was doingand lord alfred grendall he could realize a perennial income buying and selling it was only after the reflection of a day or two that he found that he had as yet got nothing to sell it was not only sir felix that was admitted into these good things after this fashion sir felix was but one among hundreds in the meantime the bills in grosvenor square were no doubt paid with punctualityand these bills must have been stupendous the very servants were as tall as gorgeous almost as numerous as the servants of royaltyand remunerated by much higher wages there were four coachmen with egregious wigs and eight footmen not one with a circumference of calf less than eighteen inches  and now there appeared a paragraph in the morning breakfast table and another appeared in the evening pulpit telling the world that mr melmotte had bought pickering park the magnificent sussex property of adolphus longestaffe esq of caversham and it was so the father and son who never had agreed before and who now had come to no agreement in the presence of each other had each considered that their affairs would be safe in the hands of so great a man as mr melmotte and had been brought to terms the purchasemoney which was large was to be divided between them the thing was done with the greatest easethere being no longer any delay as is the case when small people are at work the magnificence of mr melmotte affected even the longestaffe lawyers were i to buy a little property some humble cottage with a gardenor you o reader unless you be magnificentthe money to the last farthing would be wanted or security for the money more than sufficient before we should be able to enter in upon our new home but money was the very breath of melmottes nostrils and therefore his breath was taken for money pickering was his and before a week was over a london builder had collected masons and carpenters by the dozen down at chichester and was at work upon the house to make it fit to be a residence for madame melmotte there were rumours that it was to be made ready for the goodwood week and that the melmotte entertainment during that festival would rival the dukes  but there was still much to be done in london before the goodwood week should come round in all of which mr melmotte was concerned and of much of which mr melmotte was the very centre a member for westminster had succeeded to a peerage and thus a seat was vacated it was considered to be indispensable to the country that mr melmotte should go into parliament and what constituency could such a man as melmotte so fitly represent as one combining as westminster does all the essences of the metropolis there was the popular element the fashionable element the legislative element the legal element and the commercial element melmotte undoubtedly was the man for westminster his thorough popularity was evinced by testimony which perhaps was never before given in favour of any candidate for any county or borough in westminster there must of course be a contest a seat for westminster is a thing not to be abandoned by either political party without a struggle but at the beginning of the affair when each party had to seek the most suitable candidate which the country could supply each party put its hand upon melmotte and when the seat and the battle for the seat were suggested to melmotte then for the first time was that great man forced to descend from the altitudes on which his mind generally dwelt and to decide whether he would enter parliament as a conservative or a liberal he was not long in convincing himself that the conservative element in british society stood the most in need of that fiscal assistance which it would be in his province to give and on the next day every hoarding in london declared to the world that melmotte was the conservative candidate for westminster it is needless to say that his committee was made up of peers bankers and publicans with all that absence of class prejudice for which the party has become famous since the ballot was introduced among us some unfortunate liberal was to be made to run against him for the sake of the party but the odds were ten to one on melmotte  this no doubt was a great matterthis affair of the seat but the dinner to be given to the emperor of china was much greater it was the middle of june and the dinner was to be given on monday 8th july now three weeks hencebut all london was already talking of it the great purport proposed was to show to the emperor by this banquet what an english merchantcitizen of london could do of course there was a great amount of scolding and a loud clamour on the occasion some men said that melmotte was not a citizen of london others that he was not a merchant others again that he was not an englishman but no man could deny that he was both able and willing to spend the necessary money and as this combination of ability and will was the chief thing necessary they who opposed the arrangement could only storm and scold on the 20th of june the tradesmen were at work throwing up a building behind knocking down walls and generally transmuting the house in grosvenor square in such a fashion that two hundred guests might be able to sit down to dinner in the diningroom of a british merchant  but who were to be the two hundred it used to be the case that when a gentleman gave a dinner he asked his own guestsbut when affairs become great society can hardly be carried on after that simple fashion the emperor of china could not be made to sit at table without english royalty and english royalty must know whom it has to meetmust select at any rate some of its comrades the minister of the day also had his candidates for the dinnerin which arrangement there was however no private patronage as the list was confined to the cabinet and their wives the prime minister took some credit to himself in that he would not ask for a single ticket for a private friend but the opposition as a body desired their share of seats melmotte had elected to stand for westminster on the conservative interest and was advised that he must insist on having as it were a conservative cabinet present with its conservative wives he was told that he owed it to his party and that his party exacted payment of the debt but the great difficulty lay with the city merchants this was to be a city merchants private feast and it was essential that the emperor should meet this great merchants brother merchants at the merchants board no doubt the emperor would see all the merchants at the guildhall but that would be a semipublic affair paid for out of the funds of a corporation this was to be a private dinner now the lord mayor had set his face against it and what was to be done meetings were held a committee was appointed merchant guests were selected to the number of fifteen with their fifteen wivesand subsequently the lord mayor was made a baronet on the occasion of receiving the emperor in the city the emperor with his suite was twenty royalty had twenty tickets each ticket for guest and wife the existing cabinet was fourteen but the coming was numbered at about eleven onlyeach one for self and wife five ambassadors and five ambassadresses were to be asked there were to be fifteen real merchants out of the city ten great peerswith their peeresses were selected by the general committee of management there were to be three wise men two poets three independent members of the house of commons two royal academicians three editors of papers an african traveller who had just come home and a novelistbut all these latter gentlemen were expected to come as bachelors three tickets were to be kept over for presentation to bores endowed with a power of making themselves absolutely unendurable if not admitted at the last moment and ten were left for the giver of the feast and his own family and friends it is often difficult to make things go smoothbut almost all roughnesses may be smoothed at last with patience and care and money and patronage  but the dinner was not to be all eight hundred additional tickets were to be issued for madame melmottes evening entertainment and the fight for these was more internecine than for seats at the dinner the dinnerseats indeed were handled in so statesmanlike a fashion that there was not much visible fighting about them royalty manages its affairs quietly the existing cabinet was existing and though there were two or three members of it who could not have got themselves elected at a single unpolitical club in london they had a right to their seats at melmottes table what disappointed ambition there might be among conservative candidates was never known to the public those gentlemen do not wash their dirty linen in public the ambassadors of course were quiet but we may be sure that the minister from the united states was among the favoured five the city bankers and bigwigs as has been already said were at first unwilling to be present and therefore they who were not chosen could not afterwards express their displeasure no grumbling was heard among the peers and that which came from the peeresses floated down into the current of the great fight about the evening entertainment the poet laureate was of course asked and the second poet was as much a matter of course only two academicians had in this year painted royalty so that there was no ground for jealousy there there were three and only three specially insolent and specially disagreeable independent members of parliament at that time in the house and there was no difficulty in selecting them the wise men were chosen by their age among editors of newspapers there was some illblood that mr alf and mr broune should be selected was almost a matter of course they were hated accordingly but still this was expected but why was mr booker there was it because he had praised the prime ministers translation of catullus the african traveller chose himself by living through all his perils and coming home a novelist was selected but as royalty wanted another ticket at the last moment the gentleman was only asked to come in after dinner his proud heart however resented the treatment and he joined amicably with his literary brethren in decrying the festival altogether  we should be advancing too rapidly into this portion of our story were we to concern ourselves deeply at the present moment with the feud as it raged before the evening came round but it may be right to indicate that the desire for tickets at last became a burning passion and a passion which in the great majority of cases could not be indulged the value of the privilege was so great that madame melmotte thought that she was doing almost more than friendship called for when she informed her guest miss longestaffe that unfortunately there would be no seat for her at the dinnertable but that as payment for her loss she should receive an evening ticket for herself and a joint ticket for a gentleman and his wife georgiana was at first indignant but she accepted the compromise what she did with her tickets shall be hereafter told  from all this i trust it will be understood that the mr melmotte of the present hour was a very different man from that mr melmotte who was introduced to the reader in the early chapters of this chronicle royalty was not to be smuggled in and out of his house now without his being allowed to see it no manoeuvres now were necessary to catch a simple duchess duchesses were willing enough to come lord alfred when he was called by his christian name felt no aristocratic twinges he was only too anxious to make himself more and more necessary to the great man it is true that all this came as it were by jumps so that very often a part of the world did not know on what ledge in the world the great man was perched at that moment miss longestaffe who was staying in the house did not at all know how great a man her host was lady monogram when she refused to go to grosvenor square or even to allow any one to come out of the house in grosvenor square to her parties was groping in outer darkness madame melmotte did not know marie melmotte did not know the great man did not quite know himself where from time to time he was standing but the world at large knew the world knew that mr melmotte was to be member for westminster that mr melmotte was to entertain the emperor of china that mr melmotte carried the south central pacific and mexican railway in his pocketand the world worshipped mr melmotte  in the meantime mr melmotte was much troubled about his private affairs he had promised his daughter to lord nidderdale and as he rose in the world had lowered the price which he offered for this marriagenot so much in the absolute amount of fortune to be ultimately given as in the manner of giving it fifteen thousand a year was to be settled on marie and on her eldest son and twenty thousand pounds were to be paid into nidderdales hands six months after the marriage melmotte gave his reasons for not paying this sum at once nidderdale would be more likely to be quiet if he were kept waiting for that short time melmotte was to purchase and furnish for them a house in town it was too almost understood that the young people were to have pickering park for themselves except for a week or so at the end of july it was absolutely given out in the papers that pickering was to be theirs it was said on all sides that nidderdale was doing very well for himself the absolute money was not perhaps so great as had been at first asked but then at that time melmotte was not the strong rock the impregnable tower of commerce the very navel of the commercial enterprise of the worldas all men now regarded him nidderdales father and nidderdale himself were in the present condition of things content with a very much less stringent bargain than that which they had endeavoured at first to exact  but in the midst of all this marie who had at one time consented at her fathers instance to accept the young lord and who in some speechless fashion had accepted him told both the young lord and her father very roundly that she had changed her mind her father scowled at her and told her that her mind in the matter was of no concern he intended that she should marry lord nidderdale and himself fixed some day in august for the wedding it is no use father for i will never have him said marie  is it about that other scamp he asked angrily  if you mean sir felix carbury it is about him he has been to you and told you and therefore i dont know why i need hold my tongue  youll both starve my lady thats all marie however was not so wedded to the grandeur which she encountered in grosvenor square as to be afraid of the starvation which she thought she might have to suffer if married to sir felix carbury melmotte had not time for any long discussion as he left her he took hold of her and shook her by he said if you run rusty after all ive done for you ill make you suffer you little fool that mans a beggar he hasnt the price of a petticoat or a pair of stockings hes looking only for what you havent got and shant have if you marry him he wants money not you you little fool  but after that she was quite settled in her purpose when nidderdale spoke to her they had been engaged and then it had been offand now the young nobleman having settled everything with the father expected no great difficulty in resettling everything with the girl he was not very skilful at making lovebut he was thoroughly goodhumoured from his nature anxious to please and averse to give pain there was hardly any injury which he could not forgive and hardly any kindness which he would not doso that the labour upon himself was not too great well miss melmotte he said governors are stern beings are they not  is yours stern my lord  what i mean is that sons and daughters have to obey them i think you understand what i mean i was awfully spoony on you that time before i was indeed  i hope it didnt hurt you much lord nidderdale  thats so like a woman that is you know well enough that you and i cant marry without leave from the governors  nor with it said marie holding her head  i dont know how that may be there was some hitch somewherei dont quite know where the hitch had been with himself as he demanded ready money but its all right now the old fellows are agreed cant we make a match of it miss melmotte  no lord nidderdale i dont think we can  do you mean that  i do mean it when that was going on before i knew nothing about it i have seen more of things since then  and youve seen somebody you like better than me  i say nothing about that lord nidderdale i dont think you ought to blame me my lord  oh dear no  there was something before but it was you that was off first wasnt it now  the governors were off i think  the governors have a right to be off i suppose but i dont think any governor has a right to make anybody marry any one  i agree with you therei do indeed said lord nidderdale  and no governor shall make me marry ive thought a great deal about it since that other time and thats what ive come to determine  but i dont know why you shouldntjust marry mebecause youlike me  onlyjust because i dont well i do like you lord nidderdale  thanksso much  i like you ever soonly marrying a person is different  theres something in that to be sure  and i dont mind telling you said marie with an almost solemn expression on her countenance because you are goodnatured and wont get me into a scrape if you can help it that i do like somebody elseoh so much  i supposed that was it  that is it  its a deuced pity the governors had settled everything and we should have been awfully jolly id have gone in for all the things you go in for and though your governor was screwing us up a bit there would have been plenty of tin to go on with you couldnt think of it again  i tell you my lord imin love  oh ahyes so you were saying its an awful bore thats all i shall come to the party all the same if you send me a ticket and so nidderdale took his dismissal and went awaynot however without an idea that the marriage would still come off there was alwaysso he thoughtsuch a bother about things before they would get themselves fixed this happened some days after mr brounes proposal to lady carbury more than a week since marie had seen sir felix as soon as lord nidderdale was gone she wrote again to sir felix begging that she might hear from himand entrusted her letter to didon     chapter xxxvi  mr brounes perils   lady carbury had allowed herself two days for answering mr brounes proposition it was made on tuesday night and she was bound by her promise to send a reply some time on thursday but early on the wednesday morning she had made up her mind and at noon on that day her letter was written she had spoken to hetta about the man and she had seen that hetta had disliked him she was not disposed to be much guided by hettas opinion in regard to her daughter she was always influenced by a vague idea that hetta was an unnecessary trouble there was an excellent match ready for her if she would only accept it there was no reason why hetta should continue to add herself to the family burden she never said this even to herselfbut she felt it and was not therefore inclined to consult hettas comfort on this occasion but nevertheless what her daughter said had its effect she had encountered the troubles of one marriage and they had been very bad she did not look upon that marriage as a mistakehaving even up to this day a consciousness that it had been the business of her life as a portionless girl to obtain maintenance and position at the expense of suffering and servility but that had been done the maintenance was indeed again doubtful because of her sons vices but it might so probably be again securedby means of her sons beauty hetta had said that mr broune liked his own way had not she herself found that all men liked their own way and she liked her own way she liked the comfort of a home to herself personally she did not want the companionship of a husband and what scenes would there be between felix and the man and added to all this there was something within her almost amounting to conscience which told her that it was not right that she should burden any one with the responsibility and inevitable troubles of such a son as her son felix what would she do were her husband to command her to separate herself from her son in such circumstances she would certainly separate herself from her husband having considered these things deeply she wrote as follows to mr broune      dearest friend     i need not tell you that i have thought much of your generous and    affectionate offer how could i refuse such a prospect as you offer    me without much thought i regard your career as the most noble    which a mans ambition can achieve and in that career no one is    your superior i cannot but be proud that such a one as you should    have asked me to be his wife but my friend life is subject to    wounds which are incurable and my life has been so wounded i have    not strength left me to make my heart whole enough to be worthy of    your acceptance i have been so cut and scotched and lopped by the    sufferings which i have endured that i am best alone it cannot all    be describedand yet with you i would have no reticence i would    put the whole history before you to read with all my troubles past    and still present all my hopes and all my fearswith every    circumstance as it has passed by and every expectation that    remains were it not that the poor tale would be too long for your    patience the result of it would be to make you feel that i am no    longer fit to enter in upon a new home i should bring showers    instead of sunshine melancholy in lieu of mirth     i will however be bold enough to assure you that could i bring    myself to be the wife of any man i would now become your wife but    i shall never marry again     nevertheless i am your most affectionate friend     matilda carbury   about six oclock in the afternoon she sent this letter to mr brounes rooms in pall mall east and then sat for awhile alonefull of regrets she had thrown away from her a firm footing which would certainly have served her for her whole life even at this moment she was in debtand did not know how to pay her debts without mortgaging her life income she longed for some staff on which she could lean she was afraid of the future when she would sit with her paper before her preparing her future work for the press copying a bit here and a bit there inventing historical details dovetailing her chronicle her head would sometimes seem to be going round as she remembered the unpaid baker and her sons horses and his unmeaning dissipation and all her doubts about the marriage as regarded herself mr broune would have made her securebut that now was all over poor woman this at any rate may be said for herthat had she accepted the man her regrets would have been as deep  mr brounes feelings were more decided in their tone than those of the lady he had not made his offer without consideration and yet from the very moment in which it had been made he repented it that gently sarcastic appellation by which lady carbury had described him to herself when he had kissed her best explained that side of mr brounes character which showed itself in this matter he was a susceptible old goose had she allowed him to kiss her without objection the kissing might probably have gone on and whatever might have come of it there would have been no offer of marriage he had believed that her little manoeuvres had indicated love on her part and he had felt himself constrained to reciprocate the passion she was beautiful in his eyes she was bright she wore her clothes like a lady andif it was written in the book of the fates that some lady was to sit at the top of his tablelady carbury would look as well there as any other she had repudiated the kiss and therefore he had felt himself bound to obtain for himself the right to kiss her  the offer had no sooner been made than he met her son reeling in drunk at the front door as he made his escape the lad had insulted him this perhaps helped to open his eyes when he woke the next morning or rather late in the next day after his nights work he was no longer able to tell himself that the world was all right with him who does not know that sudden thoughtfulness at waking that first matutinal retrospection and prospection into things as they have been and are to be and the lowness of heart the blankness of hope which follows the first remembrance of some folly lately done some word illspoken some money misspentor perhaps a cigar too much or a glass of brandy and sodawater which he should have left untasted and when things have gone well how the waker comforts himself among the bedclothes as he claims for himself to be whole all over teres atque rotundusso to have managed his little affairs that he has to fear no harm and to blush inwardly at no error mr broune the way of whose life took him among many perils who in the course of his work had to steer his bark among many rocks was in the habit of thus auditing his daily account as he shook off sleep about noonfor such was his lot that he seldom was in bed before four or five in the morning on this wednesday he found that he could not balance his sheet comfortably he had taken a very great step and he feared that he had not taken it with wisdom as he drank the cup of tea with which his servant supplied him while he was yet in bed he could not say of himself teres atque rotundus as he was wont to do when things were well with him everything was to be changed as he lit a cigarette he bethought himself that lady carbury would not like him to smoke in her bedroom then he remembered other things ill be d if he shall live in my house he said to himself  and there was no way out of it it did not occur to the man that his offer could be refused during the whole of that day he went about among his friends in a melancholy fashion saying little snappish uncivil things at the club and at last dining by himself with about fifteen newspapers around him after dinner he did not speak a word to any man but went early to the office of the newspaper in trafalgar square at which he did his nightly work here he was lapped in comfortsif the best of chairs of sofas of writing tables and of reading lamps can make a man comfortable who has to read nightly thirty columns of a newspaper or at any rate to make himself responsible for their contents  he seated himself to his work like a man but immediately saw lady carburys letter on the table before him it was his custom when he did not dine at home to have such documents brought to him at his office as had reached his home during his absenceand here was lady carburys letter he knew her writing well and was aware that here was the confirmation of his fate it had not been expected as she had given herself another day for her answerbut here it was beneath his hand surely this was almost unfeminine haste he chucked the letter unopened a little from him and endeavoured to fix his attention on some printed slip that was ready for him for some ten minutes his eyes went rapidly down the lines but he found that his mind did not follow what he was reading he struggled again but still his thoughts were on the letter he did not wish to open it having some vague idea that till the letter should have been read there was a chance of escape the letter would not become due to be read till the next day it should not have been there now to tempt his thoughts on this night but he could do nothing while it lay there it shall be a part of the bargain that i shall never have to see him he said to himself as he opened it the second line told him that the danger was over  when he had read so far he stood up with his back to the fireplace leaving the letter on the table then after all the woman wasnt in love with him but that was a reading of the affair which he could hardly bring himself to look upon as correct the woman had shown her love by a thousand signs there was no doubt however that she now had her triumph a woman always has a triumph when she rejects a man and more especially when she does so at a certain time of life would she publish her triumph mr broune would not like to have it known about among brother editors or by the world at large that he had offered to marry lady carbury and that lady carbury had refused him he had escaped but the sweetness of his present safety was not in proportion to the bitterness of his late fears  he could not understand why lady carbury should have refused him as he reflected upon it all memory of her son for the moment passed away from him full ten minutes had passed during which he had still stood upon the rug before he read the entire letter cut and scotched and lopped i suppose she has been he said to himself he had heard much of sir patrick and knew well that the old general had been no lamb i shouldnt have cut her or scotched her or lopped her when he had read the whole letter patiently there crept upon him gradually a feeling of admiration for her greater than he had ever yet felt and for awhile he almost thought that he would renew his offer to her showers instead of sunshine melancholy instead of mirth he repeated to himself i should have done the best for her taking the showers and the melancholy if they were necessary  he went to his work in a mixed frame of mind but certainly without that dragging weight which had oppressed him when he entered the room gradually through the night he realized the conviction that he had escaped and threw from him altogether the idea of repeating his offer before he left he wrote her a line  be it so it need not break our friendship  n b  this he sent by a special messenger who returned with a note to his lodgings long before he was up on the following morning  nono certainly not no word of this will ever pass my mouth  m c  mr broune thought that he was very well out of the danger and resolved that lady carbury should never want anything that his friendship could do for her     chapter xxxvii  the boardroom   on friday the 21st june the board of the south central pacific and mexican railway sat in its own room behind the exchange as was the boards custom every friday on this occasion all the members were there as it had been understood that the chairman was to make a special statement there was the great chairman as a matter of course in the midst of his numerous and immense concerns he never threw over the railway or delegated to other less experienced hands those cares which the commercial world had intrusted to his own lord alfred was there with mr cohenlupe the hebrew gentleman and paul montague and lord nidderdaleand even sir felix carbury sir felix had come being very anxious to buy and sell and not as yet having had an opportunity of realizing his golden hopes although he had actually paid a thousand pounds in hard money into mr melmottes hands the secretary mr miles grendall was also present as a matter of course the board always met at three and had generally been dissolved at a quarter past three lord alfred and mr cohenlupe sat at the chairmans right and left hand paul montague generally sat immediately below with miles grendall opposite to himbut on this occasion the young lord and the young baronet took the next places it was a nice little family party the great chairman with his two aspiring sonsinlaw his two particular friendsthe social friend lord alfred and the commercial friend mr cohenlupeand miles who was lord alfreds son it would have been complete in its friendliness but for paul montague who had lately made himself disagreeable to mr melmotteand most ungratefully so for certainly no one had been allowed so free a use of the shares as the younger member of the house of fisker montague and montague  it was understood that mr melmotte was to make a statement lord nidderdale and sir felix had conceived that this was to be done as it were out of the great mans heart of his own wish so that something of the condition of the company might be made known to the directors of the company but this was not perhaps exactly the truth paul montague had insisted on giving vent to certain doubts at the last meeting but one and having made himself very disagreeable indeed had forced this trouble on the great chairman on the intermediate friday the chairman had made himself very unpleasant to paul and this had seemed to be an effort on his part to frighten the inimical director out of his opposition so that the promise of a statement need not be fulfilled what nuisance can be so great to a man busied with immense affairs as to have to explainor to attempt to explainsmall details to men incapable of understanding them but montague had stood to his guns he had not intended he said to dispute the commercial success of the company but he felt very strongly and he thought that his brother directors should feel as strongly that it was necessary that they should know more than they did know lord alfred had declared that he did not in the least agree with his brother director if anybody dont understand its his own fault said mr cohenlupe but paul would not give way and it was understood that mr melmotte would make a statement  the boards were always commenced by the reading of a certain record of the last meeting out of a book this was always done by miles grendall and the record was supposed to have been written by him but montague had discovered that this statement in the book was always prepared and written by a satellite of melmottes from abchurch lane who was never present at the meeting the adverse director had spoken to the secretaryit will be remembered that they were both members of the beargardenand miles had given a somewhat evasive reply a cussed deal of trouble and all that you know hes used to it and its what hes meant for im not going to flurry myself about stuff of that kind montague after this had spoken on the subject both to nidderdale and felix carbury he couldnt do it if it was ever so nidderdale had said i dont think id bully him if i were you he gets £500 ayear and if you knew all he owes and all he hasnt got you wouldnt try to rob him of it with felix carbury montague had as little success sir felix hated the secretary had detected him cheating at cards had resolved to expose himand had then been afraid to do so he had told dolly longestaffe and the reader will perhaps remember with what effect he had not mentioned the affair again and had gradually fallen back into the habit of playing at the club loo however had given way to whist and sir felix had satisfied himself with the change he still meditated some dreadful punishment for miles grendall but in the meantime felt himself unable to oppose him at the board since the day at which the aces had been manipulated at the club he had not spoken to miles grendall except in reference to the affairs of the whist table the board was now commenced as usual miles read the short record out of the bookstumbling over every other word and going through the performance so badly that had there been anything to understand no one could have understood it gentlemen said mr melmotte in his usual hurried way is it your pleasure that i shall sign the record paul montague rose to say that it was not his pleasure that the record should be signed but melmotte had made his scrawl and was deep in conversation with mr cohenlupe before paul could get upon his legs  melmotte however had watched the little struggle melmotte whatever might be his faults had eyes to see and ears to hear he perceived that montague had made a little struggle and had been cowed and he knew how hard it is for one man to persevere against five or six and for a young man to persevere against his elders nidderdale was filliping bits of paper across the table at carbury miles grendall was poring over the book which was in his charge lord alfred sat back in his chair the picture of a model director with his right hand within his waistcoat he looked aristocratic respectable and almost commercial in that room he never by any chance opened his mouth except when called on to say that mr melmotte was right and was considered by the chairman really to earn his money melmotte for a minute or two went on conversing with cohenlupe having perceived that montague for the moment was cowed then paul put both his hands upon the table intending to rise and ask some perplexing question melmotte saw this also and was upon his legs before montague had risen from his chair gentlemen said mr melmotte it may perhaps be as well if i take this occasion of saying a few words to you about the affairs of the company then instead of going on with his statement he sat down again and began to turn over sundry voluminous papers very slowly whispering a word or two every now and then to mr cohenlupe lord alfred never changed his posture and never took his hand from his breast nidderdale and carbury filliped their paper pellets backwards and forwards montague sat profoundly listeningor ready to listen when anything should be said as the chairman had risen from his chair to commence his statement paul felt that he was bound to be silent when a speaker is in possession of the floor he is in possession even though he be somewhat dilatory in looking to his references and whispering to his neighbour and when that speaker is a chairman of course some additional latitude must be allowed to him montague understood this and sat silent it seemed that melmotte had much to say to cohenlupe and cohenlupe much to say to melmotte since cohenlupe had sat at the board he had never before developed such powers of conversation  nidderdale didnt quite understand it he had been there twenty minutes was tired of his present amusement having been unable to hit carbury on the nose and suddenly remembered that the beargarden would now be open he was no respecter of persons and had got over any little feeling of awe with which the big table and the solemnity of the room may have first inspired him i suppose thats about all he said looking up at melmotte  wellperhaps as your lordship is in a hurry and as my lord here is engaged elsewhere turning round to lord alfred who had not uttered a syllable or made a sign since he had been in his seat we had better adjourn this meeting for another week  i cannot allow that said paul montague  i suppose then we must take the sense of the board said the chairman  i have been discussing certain circumstances with our friend and chairman said cohenlupe and i must say that it is not expedient just at present to go into matters too freely  my lords and gentlemen said melmotte i hope that you trust me  lord alfred bowed down to the table and muttered something which was intended to convey most absolute confidence hear hear said mr cohenlupe all right said lord nidderdale go on and he fired another pellet with improved success  i trust said the chairman that my young friend sir felix doubts neither my discretion nor my ability  oh dear nonot at all said the baronet much tattered at being addressed in this kindly tone he had come there with objects of his own and was quite prepared to support the chairman on any matter whatever  my lords and gentlemen continued melmotte i am delighted to receive this expression of your confidence if i know anything in the world i know something of commercial matters i am able to tell you that we are prospering i do not know that greater prosperity has ever been achieved in a shorter time by a commercial company i think our friend here mr montague should be as feelingly aware of that as any gentleman  what do you mean by that mr melmotte asked paul  what do i meancertainly nothing adverse to your character sir your firm in san francisco sir know very well how the affairs of the company are being transacted on this side of the water no doubt you are in correspondence with mr fisker ask him the telegraph wires are open to you sir but my lords and gentlemen i am able to inform you that in affairs of this nature great discretion is necessary on behalf of the shareholders at large whose interests are in our hands i think it expedient that any general statement should be postponed for a short time and i flatter myself that in that opinion i shall carry the majority of this board with me mr melmotte did not make his speech very fluently but being accustomed to the place which he occupied he did manage to get the words spoken in such a way as to make them intelligible to the company i now move that this meeting be adjourned to this day week he added  i second that motion said lord alfred without moving his hand from his breast  i understood that we were to have a statement said montague  youve had a statement said mr cohenlupe  i will put my motion to the vote said the chairman i shall move an amendment said paul determined that he would not be altogether silenced  there is nobody to second it said mr cohenlupe  how do you know till ive made it asked the rebel i shall ask lord nidderdale to second it and when he has heard it i think that he will not refuse  oh gracious me why me nodont ask me ive got to go away i have indeed  at any rate i claim the right of saying a few words i do not say whether every affair of this company should or should not be published to the world  youd break up everything if you did said cohenlupe  perhaps everything ought to be broken up but i say nothing about that what i do say is this that as we sit here as directors and will be held to be responsible as such by the public we ought to know what is being done we ought to know where the shares really are i for one do not even know what scrip has been issued  youve bought and sold enough to know something about it said melmotte  paul montague became very red in the face i at any rate began he said by putting what was to me a large sum of money into the affair  thats more than i know said melmotte whatever shares you have were issued at san francisco and not here  i have taken nothing that i havent paid for said montague nor have i yet had allotted to me anything like the number of shares which my capital would represent but i did not intend to speak of my own concerns  it looks very like it said cohenlupe  so far from it that i am prepared to risk the not improbable loss of everything i have in the world i am determined to know what is being done with the shares or to make it public to the world at large that i one of the directors of the company do not in truth know anything about it i cannot i suppose absolve myself from further responsibility but i can at any rate do what is right from this time forwardand that course i intend to take  the gentleman had better resign his seat at this board said melmotte there will be no difficulty about that  bound up as i am with fisker and montague in california i fear that there will be difficulty  not in the least continued the chairman you need only gazette your resignation and the thing is done i had intended gentlemen to propose an addition to our number when i name to you a gentleman personally known to many of you and generally esteemed throughout england as a man of business as a man of probity and as a man of fortune a man standing deservedly high in all british circles i mean mr longestaffe of caversham  young dolly or old asked lord nidderdale  i mean mr adolphus longestaffe senior of caversham i am sure that you will all be glad to welcome him among you i had thought to strengthen our number by this addition but if mr montague is determined to leave usand no one will regret the loss of his services so much as i shallit will be my pleasing duty to move that adolphus longestaffe senior esquire of caversham be requested to take his place if on consideration mr montague shall determine to remain with usand i for one most sincerely hope that such reconsideration may lead to such determinationthen i shall move that an additional director be added to our number and that mr longestaffe be requested to take the chair of that additional director the latter speech mr melmotte got through very glibly and then immediately left the chair so as to show that the business of the board was closed for that day without any possibility of reopening it  paul went up to him and took him by the sleeve signifying that he wished to speak to him before they parted certainly said the great man bowing carbury he said looking round on the young baronet with his blandest smile if you are not in a hurry wait a moment for me i have a word or two to say before you go now mr montague what can i do for you paul began his story expressing again the opinion which he had already very plainly expressed at the table but melmotte stopped him very shortly and with much less courtesy than he had shown in the speech which he had made from the chair the thing is about this way i take it mr montagueyou think you know more of this matter than i do  not at all mr melmotte  and i think that i know more of it than you do either of us may be right but as i dont intend to give way to you perhaps the less we speak together about it the better you cant be in earnest in the threat you made because you would be making public things communicated to you under the seal of privacyand no gentleman would do that but as long as you are hostile to me i cant help youand so good afternoon then without giving montague the possibility of a reply he escaped into an inner room which had the word private painted on the door and which was supposed to belong to the chairman individually he shut the door behind him and then after a few moments put out his head and beckoned to sir felix carbury nidderdale was gone lord alfred with his son were already on the stairs cohenlupe was engaged with melmottes clerk on the recordbook paul montague finding himself without support and alone slowly made his way out into the court  sir felix had come into the city intending to suggest to the chairman that having paid his thousand pounds he should like to have a few shares to go on with he was indeed at the present moment very nearly penniless and had negotiated or lost at cards all the ious which were in any degree serviceable he still had a pocketbook full of those issued by miles grendall but it was now an understood thing at the beargarden that no one was to be called upon to take them except miles grendall himselfan arrangement which robbed the cardtable of much of its delight beyond this also he had lately been forced to issue a little paper himselfin doing which he had talked largely of his shares in the railway his case certainly was hard he had actually paid a thousand pounds down in hard cash a commercial transaction which as performed by himself he regarded as stupendous it was almost incredible to himself that he should have paid any one a thousand pounds but he had done it with much difficultyhaving carried dolly junior with him all the way into the cityin the belief that he would thus put himself in the way of making a continual and unfailing income he understood that as a director he would be always entitled to buy shares at par and as a matter of course always able to sell them at the market price this he understood to range from ten to fifteen and twenty per cent profit he would have nothing to do but to buy and sell daily he was told that lord alfred was allowed to do it to a small extent and that melmotte was doing it to an enormous extent but before he could do it he must get somethinghe hardly knew whatout of melmottes hands melmotte certainly did not seem to shun him and therefore there could be no difficulty about the shares as to dangerwho could think of danger in reference to money intrusted to the hands of augustus melmotte  i am delighted to see you here said melmotte shaking him cordially by the hand you come regularly and youll find that it will be worth your while theres nothing like attending to business you should be here every friday  i will said the baronet  and let me see you sometimes up at my place in abchurch lane i can put you more in the way of understanding things there than i can here this is all a mere formal sort of thing you can see that  oh yes i see that  we are obliged to have this kind of thing for men like that fellow montague bythebye is he a friend of yours  not particularly he is a friend of a cousin of mine and the women know him at home he isnt a pal of mine if you mean that  if he makes himself disagreeable hell have to go to the wallthats all but never mind him at present was your mother speaking to you of what i said to her  no mr melmotte said sir felix staring with all his eyes  i was talking to her about you and i thought that perhaps she might have told you this is all nonsense you know about you and marie sir felix looked into the mans face it was not savage as he had seen it but there had suddenly come upon his brow that heavy look of a determined purpose which all who knew the man were wont to mark sir felix had observed it a few minutes since in the boardroom when the chairman was putting down the rebellious director you understand that dont you sir felix still looked at him but made no reply its all d nonsense you havent got a brass farthing you know youve no income at all youre just living on your mother and im afraid shes not very well off how can you suppose that i shall give my girl to you felix still looked at him but did not dare to contradict a single statement made yet when the man told him that he had not a brass farthing he thought of his own thousand pounds which were now in the mans pocket youre a baronet and thats about all you know continued melmotte the carbury property which is a very small thing belongs to a distant cousin who may leave it to me if he pleasesand who isnt very much older than you are yourself  oh come mr melmotte hes a great deal older than me  it wouldnt matter if he were as old as adam the thing is out of the question and you must drop it then the look on his brow became a little heavier you hear what i say she is going to marry lord nidderdale she was engaged to him before you ever saw her what do you expect to get by it  sir felix had not the courage to say that he expected to get the girl he loved but as the man waited for an answer he was obliged to say something i suppose its the old story he said  just sothe old story you want my money and she wants you just because she has been told to take somebody else you want something to live onthats what you want comeout with it is not that it when we understand each other ill put you in the way of making money  of course im not very well off said felix  about as badly as any young man that i can hear of you give me your written promise that youll drop this affair with marie and you shant want for money  a written promise  yesa written promise i give nothing for nothing ill put you in the way of doing so well with these shares that you shall be able to marry any other girl you pleaseor to live without marrying which youll find to be better  there was something worthy of consideration in mr melmottes proposition marriage of itself simply as a domestic institution had not specially recommended itself to sir felix carbury a few horses at leighton ruby ruggles or any other beauty and life at the beargarden were much more to his taste and then he was quite alive to the fact that it was possible that he might find himself possessed of the wife without the money marie indeed had a grand plan of her own with reference to that settled income but then marie might be mistakenor she might be lying if he were sure of making money in the way melmotte now suggested the loss of marie would not break his heart but then also melmotte might belying bythebye mr melmotte said he could you let me have those shares  what shares and the heavy brow became still heavier  dont you knowi gave you a thousand pounds and i was to have ten shares  you must come about that on the proper day to the proper place  when is the proper day  it is the twentieth of each month i think sir felix looked very blank at hearing this knowing that this present was the twentyfirst of the month but what does that signify do you want a little money  well i do said sir felix a lot of fellows owe me money but its so hard to get it  that tells a story of gambling said mr melmotte you think id give my girl to a gambler  nidderdales in it quite as thick as i am  nidderdale has a settled property which neither he nor his father can destroy but dont you be such a fool as to argue with me you wont get anything by it if youll write that letter here now  whatto marie  nonot to marie at all but to me it need never be known to her if youll do that ill stick to you and make a man of you and if you want a couple of hundred pounds ill give you a cheque for it before you leave the room mind i can tell you this on my word of honour as a gentleman if my daughter were to marry you shed never have a single shilling i should immediately make a will and leave all my property to st georges hospital i have quite made up my mind about that  and couldnt you manage that i should have the shares before the twentieth of next month  ill see about it perhaps i could let you have a few of my own at any rate i wont see you short of money  the terms were enticing and the letter was of course written melmotte himself dictated the words which were not romantic in their nature the reader shall see the letter      dear sir     in consideration of the offers made by you to me and on a clear    understanding that such a marriage would be disagreeable to you    and to the ladys mother and would bring down a fathers curse    upon your daughter i hereby declare and promise that i will not    renew my suit to the young lady which i hereby altogether    renounce     i am dear sir     your obedient servant     felix carbury     augustus melmotte esq    grosvenor square   the letter was dated 21st july and bore the printed address of the offices of the south central pacific and mexican railway  youll give me that cheque for £200 mr melmotte the financier hesitated for a moment but did give the baronet the cheque as promised and youll see about letting me have those shares  you can come to me in abchurch lane you know sir felix said that he would call in abchurch lane  as he went westward towards the beargarden the baronet was not happy in his mind ignorant as he was as to the duties of a gentleman indifferent as he was to the feelings of others still he felt ashamed of himself he was treating the girl very badly even he knew that he was behaving badly he was so conscious of it that he tried to console himself by reflecting that his writing such a letter as that would not prevent his running away with the girl should he on consideration find it to be worth his while to do so  that night he was again playing at the beargarden and he lost a great part of mr melmottes money he did in fact lose much more than the £200 but when he found his ready money going from him he issued paper     chapter xxxviii  paul montagues troubles   paul montague had other troubles on his mind beyond this trouble of the mexican railway it was now more than a fortnight since he had taken mrs hurtle to the play and she was still living in lodgings at islington he had seen her twice once on the following day when he was allowed to come and go without any special reference to their engagement and again three or four days afterwards when the meeting was by no means so pleasant she had wept and after weeping had stormed she had stood upon what she called her rights and had dared him to be false to her did he mean to deny that he had promised to marry her was not his conduct to her ever since she had now been in london a repetition of that promise and then again she became soft and pleaded with him but for the storm he might have given way at the moment he had felt that any fate in life would be better than a marriage on compulsion her tears and her pleadings nevertheless touched him very nearly he had promised her most distinctly he had loved her and had won her love and she was lovely the very violence of the storm made the sunshine more sweet she would sit down on a stool at his feet and it was impossible to drive her away from him she would look up in his face and he could not but embrace her then there had come a passionate flood of tears and she was in his arms how he had escaped he hardly knew but he did know that he had promised to be with her again before two days should have passed  on the day named he wrote to her a letter excusing himself which was at any rate true in words he had been summoned he said to liverpool on business and must postpone seeing her till his return and he explained that the business on which he was called was connected with the great american railway and being important demanded his attention in words this was true he had been corresponding with a gentleman at liverpool with whom he had become acquainted on his return home after having involuntarily become a partner in the house of fisker montague and montague this man he trusted and had consulted and the gentleman mr ramsbottom by name had suggested that he should come to him at liverpool he had gone and his conduct at the board had been the result of the advice which he had received but it may be doubted whether some dread of the coming interview with mrs hurtle had not added strength to mr ramsbottoms invitation  in liverpool he had heard tidings of mrs hurtle though it can hardly be said that he obtained any trustworthy information the lady after landing from an american steamer had been at mr ramsbottoms office inquiring for him paul and mr ramsbottom had thought that the inquiries were made in a manner indicating danger he therefore had spoken to a fellowtraveller with mrs hurtle and the fellowtraveller had opined that mrs hurtle was a queer card on board ship we all gave it up to her that she was about the handsomest woman we had ever seen but we all said that there was a bit of the wild cat in her breeding then mr ramsbottom had asked whether the lady was a widow there was a man on board from kansas said the fellowtraveller who knew a man named hurtle at leavenworth who was separated from his wife and is still alive there was according to him a queer story about the man and his wife having fought a duel with pistols and then having separated this mr ramsbottom who in an earlier stage of the affair had heard something of paul and mrs hurtle together managed to communicate to the young man his advice about the railway company was very clear and general and such as an honest man would certainly give but it might have been conveyed by letter the information such as it was respecting mrs hurtle could only be given vivâ voce and perhaps the invitation to liverpool had originated in mr ramsbottoms appreciation of this fact as she was asking after you here perhaps it is well that you should know his friend said to him paul had only thanked him not daring on the spur of the moment to speak of his own difficulties  in all this there had been increased dismay but there had also been some comfort it had only been at moments in which he had been subject to her softer influences that paul had doubted as to his adherence to the letter which he had written to her breaking off his engagement when she told him of her wrongs and of her love of his promise and his former devotion to her when she assured him that she had given up everything in life for him and threw her arms round him looking into his eyesthen he would almost yield but when what the traveller called the breeding of the wild cat showed itselfand when having escaped from her he thought of hetta carbury and of her breedinghe was fully determined that let his fate be what it might it should not be that of being the husband of mrs hurtle that he was in a mass of troubles from which it would be very difficult for him to extricate himself he was well awarebut if it were true that mr hurtle was alive that fact might help him she certainly had declared him to be not separated or even divorcedbut dead and if it were true also that she had fought a duel with one husband that also ought to be a reason why a gentleman should object to become her second husband these facts would at any rate justify himself to himself and would enable himself to break from his engagement without thinking himself to be a false traitor  but he must make up his mind as to some line of conduct she must be made to know the truth if he meant to reject the lady finally on the score of her being a wild cat he must tell her so he felt very strongly that he must not flinch from the wild cats claws that he would have to undergo some severe handling an amount of clawing which might perhaps go near his life he could perceive having done what he had done he would have no right to shrink from such usage he must tell her to her face that he was not satisfied with her past life and that therefore he would not marry her of course he might write to herbut when summoned to her presence he would be unable to excuse himself even to himself for not going it was his misfortuneand also his faultthat he had submitted to be loved by a wild cat  but it might be well that before he saw her he should get hold of information that might have the appearance of real evidence he returned from liverpool to london on the morning of the friday on which the board was held and thought even more of all this than he did of the attack which he was prepared to make on mr melmotte if he could come across that traveller he might learn something the husbands name had been caradoc carson hurtle if caradoc carson hurtle had been seen in the state of kansas within the last two years that certainly would be sufficient evidence as to the duel he felt that it might be very hard to prove that and that if proved it might be hard to found upon the fact any absolute right on his part to withdraw from the engagement but there was a rumour also though not corroborated during his last visit to liverpool that she had shot a gentleman in oregon could he get at the truth of that story if they were all true surely he could justify himself to himself  but this detectives work was very distasteful to him after having had the woman in his arms how could he undertake such inquiries as these and it would be almost necessary that he should take her in his arms again while he was making themunless indeed he made them with her knowledge was it not his duty as a man to tell everything to herself to speak to her thusi am told that your life with your last husband was to say the least of it eccentric that you even fought a duel with him i could not marry a woman who had fought a duel certainly not a woman who had fought with her own husband i am told also that you shot another gentleman in oregon it may well be that the gentleman deserved to be shot but there is something in the deed so repulsive to meno doubt irrationallythat on that score also i must decline to marry you i am told also that mr hurtle has been seen alive quite lately i had understood from you that he is dead no doubt you may have been deceived but as i should not have engaged myself to you had i known the truth so now i consider myself justified in absolving myself from an engagement which was based on a misconception it would no doubt be difficult to get through all these details but it might be accomplished graduallyunless in the process of doing so he should incur the fate of the gentleman in oregon at any rate he would declare to her as well as he could the ground on which he claimed a right to consider himself free and would bear the consequences such was the resolve which he made on his journey up from liverpool and that trouble was also on his mind when he rose up to attack mr melmotte singlehanded at the board  when the board was over he also went down to the beargarden perhaps with reference to the board the feeling which hurt him most was the conviction that he was spending money which he would never have had to spend had there been no board he had been twitted with this at the boardmeeting and had justified himself by referring to the money which had been invested in the company of fisker montague and montague which money was now supposed to have been made over to the railway but the money which he was spending had come to him after a loose fashion and he knew that if called upon for an account he could hardly make out one which would be square and intelligible to all parties nevertheless he spent much of his time at the beargarden dining there when no engagement carried him elsewhere on this evening he joined his table with nidderdales at the young lords instigation what made you so savage at old melmotte today said the young lord  i didnt mean to be savage but i think that as we call ourselves directors we ought to know something about it  i suppose we ought i dont know you know ill tell you what ive been thinking i cant make out why the mischief they made me a director  because youre a lord said paul bluntly  i suppose theres something in that but what good can i do them nobody thinks that i know anything about business of course im in parliament but i dont often go there unless they want me to vote everybody knows that im hard up i cant understand it the governor said that i was to do it and so ive done it  they say you knowtheres something between you and melmottes daughter  but if there is what has that to do with a railway in the city and why should carbury be there and heaven and earth why should old grendall be a director im impecunious but if you were to pink out the two most hopeless men in london in regard to money they would be old grendall and young carbury ive been thinking a good deal about it and i cant make it out  i have been thinking about it too said paul  i suppose old melmotte is all right asked nidderdale this was a question which montague found it difficult to answer how could he be justified in whispering suspicions to the man who was known to be at any rate one of the competitors for marie melmottes hand you can speak out to me you know said nidderdale nodding his head  ive got nothing to speak people say that he is about the richest man alive  he lives as though he were  i dont see why it shouldnt be all true nobody i take it knows very much about him  when his companion had left him nidderdale sat down thinking of it all it occurred to him that he would be coming a cropper rather were he to marry melmottes daughter for her money and then find that she had got none  a little later in the evening he invited montague to go up to the cardroom carbury and grasslough and dolly longestaffe are there waiting he said but paul declined he was too full of his troubles for play poor miles isnt there if youre afraid of that said nidderdale  miles grendall wouldnt hinder me said montague  nor me either of course its a confounded shame i know that as well as anybody but god bless me i owe a fellow down in leicestershire heaven knows how much for keeping horses and thats a shame  youll pay him some day  i suppose i shallif i dont die first but i should have gone on with the horses just the same if there had never been anything to comeonly they wouldnt have given me tick you know as far as im concerned its just the same i like to live whether ive got money or not and i fear i dont have many scruples about paying but then i like to let live too theres carbury always saying nasty things about poor miles hes playing himself without a rap to back him if he were to lose vossner wouldnt stand him a £10 note but because he has won he goes on as though he were old melmotte himself youd better come up  but montague wouldnt go up without any fixed purpose he left the club and slowly sauntered northwards through the streets till he found himself in welbeck street he hardly knew why he went there and certainly had not determined to call on lady carbury when he left the beargarden his mind was full of mrs hurtle as long as she was present in londonas long at any rate as he was unable to tell himself that he had finally broken away from herhe knew himself to be an unfit companion for henrietta carbury and indeed he was still under some promise made to roger carbury not that he would avoid hettas company but that for a certain period as yet unexpired he would not ask her to be his wife it had been a foolish promise made and then repented without much attention to wordsbut still it was existing and paul knew well that roger trusted that it would be kept nevertheless paul made his way up to welbeck street and almost unconsciously knocked at the door nolady carbury was not at home she was out somewhere with mr roger carbury up to that moment paul had not heard that roger was in town but the reader may remember that he had come up in search of ruby ruggles miss carbury was at home the page went on to say would mr montague go up and see miss carbury without much consideration mr montague said that he would go up and see miss carbury mamma is out with roger said hetta endeavouring to save herself from confusion there is a soirée of learned people somewhere and she made poor roger take her the ticket was only for her and her friend and therefore i could not go  i am so glad to see you what an age it is since we met  hardly since the melmottes ball said hetta  hardly indeed i have been here once since that what has brought roger up to town  i dont know what it is some mystery i think whenever there is a mystery i am always afraid that there is something wrong about felix i do get so unhappy about felix mr montague  i saw him today in the city at the railway board  but roger says the railway board is all a shampaul could not keep himself from blushing as he heard thisand that felix should not be there and then there is something going on about that horrid mans daughter  she is to marry lord nidderdale i think  is she they are talking of her marrying felix and of course it is for her money and i believe that man is determined to quarrel with them  what man miss carbury  mr melmotte himself its all horrid from beginning to end  but i saw them in the city today and they seemed to b the greatest friends when i wanted to see mr melmotte he bolted himself into an inner room but he took your brother with him he would not have done that if they had not been friends when i saw it i almost thought that he had consented to the marriage  roger has the greatest dislike to mr melmotte  i know he has said paul  and roger is always right it is always safe to trust him dont you think so mr montague paul did think so and was by no means disposed to deny to his rival the praise which rightly belonged to him but still he found the subject difficult of course i will never go against mamma continued hetta but i always feel that my cousin roger is a rock of strength so that if one did whatever he said one would never get wrong i never found any one else that i thought that of but i do think it of him  no one has more reason to praise him than i have  i think everybody has reason to praise him that has to do with him and ill tell you why i think it is whenever he thinks anything he says itor at least he never says anything that he doesnt think if he spent a thousand pounds everybody would know that hed got it to spend but other people are not like that  youre thinking of melmotte  im thinking of everybody mr montagueof everybody except roger  is he the only man you can trust but it is abominable to me to seem even to contradict you roger carbury has been to me the best friend that any man ever had i think as much of him as you do  i didnt say he was the only personor i didnt mean to say so but all my friends  am i among the number miss carbury  yesi suppose so of course you are why not of course you are a friendbecause you are his friend  look here hetta he said it is no good going on like this i love roger carburyas well as one man can love another he is all that you sayand more you hardly know how he denies himself and how he thinks of everybody near him he is a gentleman all round and every inch he never lies he never takes what is not his own i believe he does love his neighbour as himself  oh mr montague i am so glad to hear you speak of him like that  i love him better than any manas well as a man can love a man if you will say that you love him as well as a woman can love a mani will leave england at once and never return to it  theres mamma said henriettafor at that moment there was a double knock at the door     chapter xxxix  i do love him   so it was lady carbury had returned home from the soirée of learned people and had brought roger carbury with her they both came up to the drawingroom and found paul and henrietta together it need hardly be said that they were both surprised roger supposed that montague was still at liverpool and knowing that he was not a frequent visitor in welbeck street could hardly avoid a feeling that a meeting between the two had now been planned in the mothers absence the reader knows that it was not so roger certainly was a man not liable to suspicion but the circumstances in this case were suspicious there would have been nothing to suspectno reason why paul should not have been therebut from the promise which had been given there was indeed no breach of that promise proved by pauls presence in welbeck street but roger felt rather than thought that the two could hardly have spent the evening together without such breach whether paul had broken the promise by what he had already said the reader must be left to decide  lady carbury was the first to speak this is quite an unexpected pleasure mr montague whether roger suspected anything or not she did the moment she saw paul the idea occurred to her that the meeting between hetta and him had been preconcerted  yes he said making a lame excuse where no excuse should have been madei had nothing to do and was lonely and thought that i would come up and see you lady carbury disbelieved him altogether but roger felt assured that his coming in lady carburys absence had been an accident the man had said so and that was enough  i thought you were at liverpool said roger  i came back todayto be present at that board in the city i have had a good deal to trouble me i will tell you all about it just now what has brought you to london  a little business said roger  then there was an awkward silence lady carbury was angry and hardly knew whether she ought not to show her anger for henrietta it was very awkward she too could not but feel that she had been caught though no innocence could be whiter than hers she knew well her mothers mind and the way in which her mothers thoughts would run silence was frightful to her and she found herself forced to speak have you had a pleasant evening mamma  have you had a pleasant evening my dear said lady carbury forgetting herself in her desire to punish her daughter  indeed no said hetta attempting to laugh i have been trying to work hard at dante but one never does any good when one has to try to work i was just going to bed when mr montague came in what did you think of the wise men and the wise women roger  i was out of my element of course but i think your mother liked it  i was very glad indeed to meet dr palmoil it seems that if we can only open the interior of africa a little further we can get everything that is wanted to complete the chemical combination necessary for feeding the human race isnt that a grand idea roger  a little more elbow grease is the combination that i look to  surely roger if the bible is to go for anything we are to believe that labour is a curse and not a blessing adam was not born to labour  but he fell and i doubt whether dr palmoil will be able to put his descendants back into eden  roger for a religious man you do say the strangest things i have quite made up my mind to thisif ever i can see things so settled here as to enable me to move i will visit the interior of africa it is the garden of the world  this scrap of enthusiasm so carried them through their immediate difficulties that the two men were able to take their leave and to get out of the room with fair comfort as soon as the door was closed behind them lady carbury attacked her daughter what brought him here  he brought himself mamma  dont answer me in that way hetta of course he brought himself that is insolent  insolent mamma how can you say such hard words i meant that he came of his own accord  how long was he here  two minutes before you came in why do you crossquestion me like this i could not help his coming i did not desire that he might be shown up  you did not know that he was to come  mamma if i am to be suspected all is over between us  what do you mean by that  if you can think that i would deceive you you will think so always if you will not trust me how am i to live with you as though you did i knew nothing of his coming  tell me this hetta are you engaged to marry him  noi am not  has he asked you to marry him  hetta paused a moment considering before she answered this question i do not think he ever has  you do not think  i was going on to explain he never has asked me but he has said that which makes me know that he wishes me to be his wife  what has he said when did he say it  again she paused but again she answered with straightforward simplicity just before you came in he said i dont know what he said but it meant that  you told me he had been here but a minute  it was but very little more if you take me at my word in that way of course you can make me out to be wrong mamma it was almost no time and yet he said it  he had come prepared to say it  how could heexpecting to find you  psha he expected nothing of the kind  i think you do him wrong mamma i am sure you are doing me wrong i think his coming was an accident and that what he said wasan accident  an accident  it was not intendednot then mamma i have known it ever so long and so have you it was natural that he should say so when we were alone together  and youwhat did you say  nothing you came  i am sorry that my coming should have been so inopportune but i must ask one other question hetta what do you intend to say hetta was again silent and now for a longer space she put her hand up to her brow and pushed back her hair as she thought whether her mother had a right to continue this crossexamination she had told her mother everything as it had happened she had kept back no deed done no word spoken either now or at any time but she was not sure that her mother had a right to know her thoughts feeling as she did that she had so little sympathy from her mother how do you intend to answer him demanded lady carbury  i do not know that he will ask again  that is prevaricating  no mammai do not prevaricate it is unfair to say that to me i do love him there i think it ought to have been enough for you to know that i should never give him encouragement without telling you about it i do love him and i shall never love any one else  he is a ruined man your cousin says that all this company in which he is involved will go to pieces  hetta was too clever to allow this argument to pass she did not doubt that roger had so spoken of the railway to her mother but she did doubt that her mother had believed the story if so said she mr melmotte will be a ruined man too and yet you want felix to marry marie melmotte  it makes me ill to hear you talkas if you understood these things and you think you will marry this man because he is to make a fortune out of the railway lady carbury was able to speak with an extremity of scorn in reference to the assumed pursuit by one of her children of an advantageous position which she was doing all in her power to recommend to the other child  i have not thought of his fortune i have not thought of marrying him mamma i think you are very cruel to me you say things so hard that i cannot bear them  why will you not marry your cousin  i am not good enough for him  nonsense  very well you say so but that is what i think he is so much above me that though i do love him i cannot think of him in that way and i have told you that i do love some one else i have no secret from you now good night mamma she said coming up to her mother and kissing her do be kind to me and praypraydo believe me lady carbury then allowed herself to be kissed and allowed her daughter to leave the room  there was a great deal said that night between roger carbury and paul montague before they parted as they walked together to rogers hotel he said not a word as to pauls presence in welbeck street paul had declared his visit in lady carburys absence to have been accidental and therefore there was nothing more to be said montague then asked as to the cause of carburys journey to london i do not wish it to be talked of said roger after a pauseand of course i could not speak of it before hetta a girl has gone away from our neighbourhood you remember old ruggles  you do not mean that ruby has levanted she was to have married john crumb  just sobut she has gone off leaving john crumb in an unhappy frame of mind john crumb is an honest man and almost too good for her  ruby is very pretty has she gone with any one  noshe went alone but the horror of it is this they think down there that felix haswell made love to her and that she has been taken to london by him  that would be very bad  he certainly has known her though he lied as he always lies when i first spoke to him i brought him to admit that he and she had been friends down in suffolk of course we know what such friendship means but i do not think that she came to london at his instance of course he would lie about that he would lie about anything if his horse cost him a hundred pounds he would tell one man that he gave fifty and another two hundred but he has not lived long enough yet to be able to lie and tell the truth with the same eye when he is as old as i am hell be perfect  he knows nothing about her coming to town  he did not when i first asked him i am not sure but i fancy that i was too quick after her she started last saturday morning i followed on the sunday and made him out at his club i think that he knew nothing then of her being in town he is very clever if he did since that he has avoided me i caught him once but only for half a minute and then he swore that he had not seen her  you still believed him  nohe did it very well but i knew that he was prepared for me i cannot say how it may have been to make matters worse old ruggles has now quarrelled with crumb and is no longer anxious to get back his granddaughter he was frightened at first but that has gone off and he is now reconciled to the loss of the girl and the saving of his money  after that paul told all his own storythe double story both in regard to melmotte and to mrs hurtle as regarded the railway roger could only tell him to follow explicitly the advice of his liverpool friend i never believed in the thing you know  nor did i but what could i do  im not going to blame you indeed knowing you as i do feeling sure that you intend to be honest i would not for a moment insist on my own opinion if it did not seem that mr ramsbottom thinks as i do in such a matter when a man does not see his own way clearly it behoves him to be able to show that he has followed the advice of some man whom the world esteems and recognizes you have to bind your character to another mans character and that other mans character if it be good will carry you through from what i hear mr ramsbottoms character is sufficiently goodbut then you must do exactly what he tells you  but the railway business though it comprised all that montague had in the world was not the heaviest of his troubles what was he to do about mrs hurtle he had now for the first time to tell his friend that mrs hurtle had come to london and that he had been with her three or four times there was this great difficulty in the matter toothat it was very hard to speak of his engagement with mrs hurtle without in some sort alluding to his love for henrietta carbury roger knew of both loveshad been very urgent with his friend to abandon the widow and at any rate equally urgent with him to give up the other passion were he to marry the widow all danger on the other side would be at an end and yet in discussing the question of mrs hurtle he was to do so as though there were no such person existing as henrietta carbury the discussion did take place exactly as though there were no such person as henrietta carbury paul told it allthe rumoured duel the rumoured murder and the rumour of the existing husband  it may be necessary that you should go out to kansas and to oregon said roger  but even if the rumours be untrue i will not marry her said paul roger shrugged his shoulders he was doubtless thinking of hetta carbury but he said nothing and what would she do remaining here continued paul roger admitted that it would be awkward i am determined that under no circumstances will i marry her i know i have been a fool i know i have been wrong but of course if there be a fair cause for my broken word i will use it if i can  you will get out of it honestly if you can but you will get out of it honestly orany other way  did you not advise me to get out of it rogerbefore we knew as much as we do now  i didand i do if you make a bargain with the devil it may be dishonest to cheat himand yet i would have you cheat him if you could as to this woman i do believe she has deceived you if i were you nothing should induce me to marry hernot though her claws were strong enough to tear me utterly in pieces ill tell you what ill do ill go and see her if you like it  but paul would not submit to this he felt he was bound himself to incur the risk of those claws and that no substitute could take his place they sat long into the night and it was at last resolved between them that on the next morning paul should go to islington should tell mrs hurtle all the stories which he had heard and should end by declaring his resolution that under no circumstances would he marry her they both felt how improbable it was that he should ever be allowed to get to the end of such a storyhow almost certain it was that the breeding of the wild cat would show itself before that time should come but still that was the course to be pursued as far as circumstances would admit and paul was at any rate to declare claws or no claws husband or no husbandwhether the duel or the murder was admitted or deniedthat he would never make mrs hurtle his wife i wish it were over old fellow said roger  so do i said paul as he took his leave  he went to bed like a man condemned to die on the next morning and he awoke in the same condition he had slept well but as he shook from him his happy dream the wretched reality at once overwhelmed him but the man who is to be hung has no choice he cannot when he wakes declare that he has changed his mind and postpone the hour it was quite open to paul montague to give himself such instant relief he put his hand up to his brow and almost made himself believe that his head was aching this was saturday would it not be as well that he should think of it further and put off his execution till monday monday was so far distant that he felt that he could go to islington quite comfortably on monday was there not some hitherto forgotten point which it would be well that he should discuss with his friend roger before he saw the lady should he not rush down to liverpool and ask a few more questions of mr ramsbottom why should he go forth to execution seeing that the matter was in his own hands  at last he jumped out of bed and into his tub and dressed himself as quickly as he could he worked himself up into a fit of fortitude and resolved that the thing should be done before the fit was over he ate his breakfast about nine and then asked himself whether he might not be too early were he to go at once to islington but he remembered that she was always early in every respect she was an energetic woman using her time for some purpose either good or bad not sleeping it away in bed if one has to be hung on a given day would it not be well to be hung as soon after waking as possible i can fancy that the hangman would hardly come early enough and if one had to be hung in a given week would not one wish to be hung on the first day of the week even at the risk of breaking ones last sabbath day in this world whatever be the misery to be endured get it over the horror of every agony is in its anticipation paul had realized something of this when he threw himself into a hansom cab and ordered the man to drive to islington  how quick that cab went nothing ever goes so quick as a hansom cab when a man starts for a dinnerparty a little too earlynothing so slow when he starts too late of all cabs this surely was the quickest paul was lodging in suffolk street close to pall mall whence the way to islington across oxford street across tottenham court road across numerous squares northeast of the museum seems to be long the end of goswell road is the outside of the world in that direction and islington is beyond the end of goswell road and yet that hansom cab was there before paul montague had been able to arrange the words with which he would begin the interview he had given the street and the number of the street it was not till after he had started that it occurred to him that it might be well that he should get out at the end of the street and walk to the houseso that he might as it were fetch breath before the interview was commenced but the cabman dashed up to the door in a manner purposely devised to make every inmate of the house aware that a cab had just arrived before it there was a little garden before the house we all know the gardentwentyfour feet long by twelve broadand an irongrated door with the landladys name on a brass plate paul when he had paid the cabmangiving the man halfacrown and asking for no change in his agonypushed in the iron gate and walked very quickly up to the door rang rather furiously and before the door was well opened asked for mrs hurtle  mrs hurtle is out for the day said the girl who opened the door leastways she went out yesterday and wont be back till tonight providence had sent him a reprieve but he almost forgot the reprieve as he looked at the girl and saw that she was ruby ruggles oh laws mr montague is that you ruby ruggles had often seen paul down in suffolk and recognized him as quickly as he did her it occurred to her at once that he had come in search of herself she knew that roger carbury was up in town looking for her so much she had of course learned from sir felixfor at this time she had seen the baronet more than once since her arrival montague she knew was roger carburys intimate friend and now she felt that she was caught in her terror she did not at first remember that the visitor had asked for mrs hurtle  yes it is i i was sorry to hear miss ruggles that you had left your home  im all right mr montaguei am mrs pipkin is my aunt or leastways my mothers brothers widow though grandfather never would speak to her shes quite respectable and has five children and lets lodgings theres a lady here now and has gone away with her just for one night down to southend theyll be back this evening and ive the children to mind with the servant girl im quite respectable here mr montague and nobody need be a bit afraid about me  mrs hurtle has gone down to southend  yes mr montague she wasnt quite well and wanted a breath of air she said and aunt didnt like she should go alone as mrs hurtle is such a stranger and mrs hurtle said as she didnt mind paying for two and so theyve gone and the baby with them mrs pipkin said as the baby shouldnt be no trouble and mrs hurtleshes most as fond of the baby as aunt do you know mrs hurtle sir  yes shes a friend of mine  oh i didnt know i did know as there was some friend as was expected and as didnt come be i to say sir as you was here  paul thought it might be as well to shift the subject and to ask ruby a few questions about herself while he made up his mind what message he would leave for mrs hurtle im afraid they are very unhappy about you down at bungay miss ruggles  then theyve got to be unhappy thats all about it mr montague grandfather is that provoking as a young woman cant live with him nor yet i wont try never again he lugged me all about the room by my hair mr montague how is a young woman to put up with that and i did everything for himthat careful that no one wont do it againdid his linen and his victuals and even cleaned his boots of a sunday cause he was that mean he wouldnt have anybody about the place only me and the girl who had to milk the cows there wasnt nobody to do anything only me and then he went to drag me about by the hairs of my head you wont see me again at sheeps acre mr montaguenor yet wont the squire  but i thought there was somebody else was to give you a home  john crumb oh yes theres john crumb theres plenty of people to give me a home mr montague  you were to have been married to john crumb i thought  ladies is to change their minds if they like it mr montague im sure youve heard that before grandfather made me say id have him but i never cared that for him  im afraid miss ruggles you wont find a better man up here in london  i didnt come here to look for a man mr montague i can tell you that they has to look at me if they want me but i am looked after and that by one as john crumb aint fit to touch that told the whole story paul when he heard the little boast was quite sure that rogers fear about felix was well founded and as for john crumbs fitness to touch sir felix paul felt that the bungay mealman might have an opinion of his own on that matter but theres betsy acrying upstairs and i promised not to leave them children for one minute  i will tell the squire that i saw you miss ruggles  what does the squire want o me i aint nothing to the squire except that i respects him you can tell if you please mr montague of course im a coming my darling  paul made his way into mrs hurtles sittingroom and wrote a note for her in pencil he had come he said immediately on his return from liverpool and was sorry to find that she was away for the day when should he call again if she would make an appointment he would attend to it he felt as he wrote this that he might very safely have himself made an appointment for the morrow but he cheated himself into half believing that the suggestion he now made was the more gracious and civil at any rate it would certainly give him another day mrs hurtle would not return till late in the evening and as the following day was sunday there would be no delivery by post when the note was finished he left it on the table and called to ruby to tell her that he was going mr montague she said in a confidential whisper as she tripped down the stairs i dont see why you need be saying anything about me you know  mr carbury is up in town looking after you  what am i to mr carbury  your grandfather is very anxious about you  not a bit of it mr montague grandfather knows very well where i am there grandfather doesnt want me back and i aint a going why should the squire bother himself about me i dont bother myself about him  hes afraid miss ruggles that you are trusting yourself to a young man who is not trustworthy  i can mind myself very well mr montague  tell me this have you seen sir felix carbury since youve been in town ruby whose blushes came very easily now flushed up to her forehead you may be sure that he means no good to you what can come of an intimacy between you and such a one as he  i dont see why i shouldnt have my friend mr montague as well as you howsomever if youll not tell ill be ever so much obliged  but i must tell mr carbury  then i aint obliged to you one bit said ruby shutting the door  paul as he walked away could not help thinking of the justice of rubys reproach to him what business had he to take upon himself to be a mentor to any one in regard to an affair of lovehe who had engaged himself to marry mrs hurtle and who the evening before had for the first time declared his love to hetta carbury  in regard to mrs hurtle he had got a reprieve as he thought for two daysbut it did not make him happy or even comfortable as he walked back to his lodgings he knew it would have been better for him to have had the interview over but at any rate he could now think of hetta carbury and the words he had spoken to her had he heard that declaration which she had made to her mother he would have been able for the hour to have forgotten mrs hurtle     chapter xl  unanimity is the very soul of these things   that evening montague was surprised to receive at the beargarden a note from mr melmotte which had been brought thither by a messenger from the citywho had expected to have an immediate answer as though montague lived at the club  dear sir said the letter     if not inconvenient would you call on me in grosvenor square    tomorrow sunday at half past eleven if you are going to    church perhaps you will make an appointment in the afternoon    if not the morning will suit best i want to have a few words    with you in private about the company my messenger will wait    for answer if you are at the club     yours truly     augustus melmotte     paul montague esq    the beargarden   paul immediately wrote to say that he would call at grosvenor square at the hour appointedabandoning any intentions which he might have had in reference to sunday morning service but this was not the only letter he received that evening on his return to his lodgings he found a note containing only one line which mrs hurtle had found the means of sending to him after her return from southend i am sorry to have been away i will expect you all tomorrow w h the period of the reprieve was thus curtailed to less than a day  on the sunday morning he breakfasted late and then walked up to grosvenor square much pondering what the great man could have to say to him the great man had declared himself very plainly in the boardroomespecially plainly after the board had risen paul had understood that war was declared and had understood also that he was to fight the battle singlehanded knowing nothing of such strategy as would be required while his antagonist was a great master of financial tactics he was prepared to go to the wall in reference to his money only hoping that in doing so he might save his character and keep the reputation of an honest man he was quite resolved to be guided altogether by mr ramsbottom and intended to ask mr ramsbottom to draw up for him such a statement as would be fitting for him to publish but it was manifest now that mr melmotte would make some proposition and it was impossible that he should have mr ramsbottom at his elbow to help him  he had been in melmottes house on the night of the ball but had contented himself after that with leaving a card he had heard much of the splendour of the place but remembered simply the crush and the crowd and that he had danced there more than once or twice with hetta carbury when he was shown into the hail he was astonished to find that it was not only stripped but was full of planks and ladders and trussels and mortar the preparations for the great dinner had been already commenced through all this he made his way to the stairs and was taken up to a small room on the second floor where the servant told him that mr melmotte would come to him here he waited a quarter of an hour looking out into the yard at the back there was not a book in the room or even a picture with which he could amuse himself he was beginning to think whether his own personal dignity would not be best consulted by taking his departure when melmotte himself with slippers on his feet and enveloped in a magnificent dressinggown bustled into the room my dear sir i am so sorry you are a punctual man i see so am i a man of business should be punctual but they aint always brehgertfrom the house of todd brehgert and goldsheiner you knowhas just been with me we had to settle something about the moldavian loan he came a quarter late and of course he went a quarter late and how is a man to catch a quarter of an hour i never could do it montague assured the great man that the delay was of no consequence and i am so sorry to ask you into such a place as this i had brehgert in my room downstairs and then the house is so knocked about we get into a furnished house a little way off in bruton street tomorrow longestaffe lets me his house for a month till this affair of the dinner is over bythe by montague if youd like to come to the dinner ive got a ticket i can let you have you know how theyre run after montague had heard of the dinner but had perhaps heard as little of it as any man frequenting a club at the west end of london he did not in the least want to be at the dinner and certainly did not wish to receive any extraordinary civility from mr melmottes hands  but he was very anxious to know why mr melmotte should offer it he excused himself saying that he was not particularly fond of big dinners and that he did not like standing in the way of other people ah indeed said melmotte there are ever so many people of title would give anything for a ticket youd be astonished at the persons who have asked weve had to squeeze in a chair on one side for the master of the buckhounds and on the other for the bishop of i forget what bishop it is but we had the two archbishops before they say he must come because he has something to do with getting up the missionaries for tibet but ive got the ticket if youll have it this was the ticket which was to have taken in georgiana longestaffe as one of the melmotte family had not melmotte perceived that it might be useful to him as a bribe but paul would not take the bribe youre the only man in london then said melmotte somewhat offended but at any rate youll come in the evening and ill have one of madame melmottes tickets sent to you paul not knowing how to escape said that he would come in the evening i am particularly anxious continued he to be civil to those who are connected with our great railway and of course in this country your name stands firstnext to my own  then the great man paused and paul began to wonder whether it could be possible that he had been sent for to grosvenor square on a sunday morning in order that he might be asked to dine in the same house a fortnight later but that was impossible have you anything special to say about the railway he asked  well yes it is so hard to get things said at the board of course there are some there who do not understand matters  i doubt if there be any one there who does understand this matter said paul  melmotte affected to laugh well well i am not prepared to go quite so far as that my friend cohenlupe has had great experience in these affairs and of course you are aware that he is in parliament and lord alfred sees farther into them than perhaps you give him credit for  he may easily do that  well well perhaps you dont know quite as well as i do the scowl began to appear on mr melmottes brow hitherto it had been banished as well as he knew how to banish it what i wanted to say to you was this we didnt quite agree at the last meeting  no we did not  i was very sorry for it unanimity is everything in the direction of such an undertaking as this with unanimity we can doeverything mr melmotte in the ecstasy of his enthusiasm lifted up both his hands over his head without unanimity we can donothing and the two hands fell unanimity should be printed everywhere about a boardroom it should indeed mr montague  but suppose the directors are not unanimous  they should be unanimous they should make themselves unanimous god bless my soul you dont want to see the thing fall to pieces  not if it can be carried on honestly  honestly who says that anything is dishonest again the brow became very heavy look here mr montague if you and i quarrel in the boardroom there is no knowing the amount of evil we may do to every individual shareholder in the company i find the responsibility on my shoulders so great that i say the thing must be stopped damme mr montague it must be stopped we mustnt ruin widows and children mr montague we mustnt let those shares run down 20 below par for a mere chimera ive known a fine property blasted mr montague sent straight to the dogsannihilated sirso that it all vanished into thin air and widows and children past counting were sent out to starve about the streetsjust because one director sat in another directors chair i did by g what do you think of that mr montague gentlemen who dont know the nature of credit how strong it isas the airto buoy you up how slight it isas a mere vapour when roughly touched can do an amount of mischief of which they themselves dont in the least understand the extent what is it you want mr montague  what do i want melmottes description of the peculiar susceptibility of great mercantile speculations had not been given without some effect on montague but this direct appeal to himself almost drove that effect out of his mind i only want justice  but you should know what justice is before you demand it at the expense of other people look here mr montague i suppose you are like the rest of us in this matter you want to make money out of it  for myself i want interest for my capital that is all but i am not thinking of myself  you are getting very good interest if i understand the matter and here melmotte pulled out a little book showing thereby how careful he was in mastering detailsyou had about £6000 embarked in the business when fisker joined your firm you imagine yourself to have that still  i dont know what ive got  i can tell you then you have that and youve drawn nearly a thousand pounds since fisker came over in one shape or another thats not bad interest on your money  there was back interest due to me  if so its due still ive nothing to do with that look here mr montague i am most anxious that you should remain with us i was about to propose only for that little rumpus the other day that as youre an unmarried man and have time on your hands you should go out to california and probably across to mexico in order to get necessary information for the company were i of your age unmarried and without impediment it is just the thing i should like of course youd go at the companys expense i would see to your own personal interests while you were awayor you could appoint any one by power of attorney your seat at the board would be kept for you but should anything occur amisswhich it wont for the thing is as sound as anything i knowof course you as absent would not share the responsibility thats what i was thinking it would be a delightful tripbut if you dont like it you can of course remain at the board and be of the greatest use to me indeed after a bit i could devolve nearly the whole management on youand i must do something of the kind as i really havent the time for it butif it is to be that waydo be unanimous unanimity is the very soul of these thingsthe very soul mr montague  but if i cant be unanimous  wellif you cant and if you wont take my advice about going out which pray think about for you would be most useful it might be the very making of the railwaythen i can only suggest that you should take your £6000 and leave us i myself should be greatly distressed but if you are determined that way i will see that you have your money i will make myself personally responsible for the payment of itsome time before the end of the year  paul montague told the great man that he would consider the whole matter and see him in abchurch lane before the next board day and now goodbye said mr melmotte as he bade his young friend adieu in a hurry im afraid that im keeping sir gregory gribe the bank director waiting downstairs     chapter xli  all prepared   during all these days miss melmotte was by no means contented with her lovers prowess though she would not allow herself to doubt his sincerity she had not only assured him of her undying affection in the presence of her father and mother had not only offered to be chopped in pieces on his behalf but had also written to him telling how she had a large sum of her fathers money within her power and how willing she was to make it her own to throw over her father and mother and give herself and her fortune to her lover she felt that she had been very gracious to her lover and that her lover was a little slow in acknowledging the favours conferred upon him but nevertheless she was true to her lover and believed that he was true to her didon had been hitherto faithful marie had written various letters to sir felix and had received two or three very short notes in reply containing hardly more than a word or two each but now she was told that a day was absolutely fixed for her marriage with lord nidderdale and that her things were to be got ready she was to be married in the middle of august and here they were approaching the end of june you may buy what you like mamma she said and if papa agrees about felix why then i suppose theyll do but theyll never be of any use about lord nidderdale if you were to sew me up in the things by main force i wouldnt have him madame melmotte groaned and scolded in english french and german and wished that she were dead she told marie that she was a pig and ass and a toad and a dog and ended as she always did end by swearing that melmotte must manage the matter himself nobody shall manage this matter for me said marie i know what im about now and i wont marry anybody just because it will suit papa que nous étions encore à frankfort ou newyork said the elder lady remembering the humbler but less troubled times of her earlier life marie did not care for frankfort or new york for paris or for londonbut she did care for sir felix carbury  while her father on sunday morning was transacting business in his own house with paul montague and the great commercial magnates of the citythough it may be doubted whether that very respectable gentleman sir gregory gribe was really in grosvenor square when his name was mentionedmarie was walking inside the gardens didon was also there at some distance from her and sir felix carbury was there also close alongside of her marie had the key of the gardens for her own use and had already learned that her neighbours in the square did not much frequent the place during church time on sunday morning her lovers letter to her father had of course been shown to her and she had taxed him with it immediately sir felix who had thought much of the letter as he came from welbeck street to keep his appointmenthaving been assured by didon that the gate should be left unlocked and that she would be there to close it after he had come inwas of course ready with a lie it was the only thing to do marieit was indeed  but you said you had accepted some offer  you dont suppose i wrote the letter  it was your handwriting felix  of course it was i copied just what he put down hed have sent you clean away where i couldnt have got near you if i hadnt written it  and you have accepted nothing  not at all as it is he owes me money is not that odd i gave him a thousand pounds to buy shares and i havent got anything from him yet sir felix no doubt forgot the cheque for £200  nobody ever does who gives papa money said the observant daughter  dont they dear me but i just wrote it because i thought anything better than a downright quarrel  i wouldnt have written it if it had been ever so  its no good scolding marie i did it for the best what do you think wed best do now marie looked at him almost with scorn surely it was for him to propose and for her to yield i wonder whether youre right about that money which you say is settled  im quite sure mamma told me in parisjust when we were coming awaythat it was done so that there might be something if things went wrong and papa told me that he should want me to sign something from time to time and of course i said i would but of course i wontif i should have a husband of my own felix walked along pondering the matter with his hands in his trousers pockets he entertained those very fears which had latterly fallen upon lord nidderdale there would be no cropper which a man could come so bad as would be his cropper were he to marry marie melmotte and then find that he was not to have a shilling and were he now to run off with marie after having written that letter the father would certainly not forgive him this assurance of maries as to the settled money was too doubtful the game to be played was too full of danger and in that case he would certainly get neither his £800 nor the shares and if he were true to melmotte melmotte would probably supply him with ready money but then there was the girl at his elbow and he no more dared to tell her to her face that he meant to give her up than he dared to tell melmotte that he intended to stick to his engagement some half promise would be the only escape for the present what are you thinking of felix she asked  its d difficult to know what to do  but you do love me  of course i do if i didnt love you why should i be here walking round this stupid place they talk of your being married to nidderdale about the end of august  some day in august but thats all nonsense you know they cant take me up and marry me as they used to do the girls ever so long ago i wont marry him he dont care a bit for me and never did i dont think you care much felix  yes i do a fellow cant go on saying so over and over again in a beastly place like this if we were anywhere jolly together then i could say it often enough  i wish we were felix i wonder whether we ever shall be  upon my word i hardly see my way as yet  youre not going to give it up  oh nonot give it up certainly not but the bother is a fellow doesnt know what to do  youve heard of young mr goldsheiner havent you suggested marie  hes one of those city chaps  and lady julia start  shes old lady catchboys daughter yes ive heard of them they got spliced last winter  yessomewhere in switzerland i think at any rate they went to switzerland and now theyve got a house close to albert gate  how jolly for them he is awfully rich isnt he  i dont suppose hes half so rich as papa they did all they could to prevent her going but she met him down at folkestone just as the tidal boat was starting didon says that nothing was easier  ohah didon knows all about it  that she does  but shed lose her place  there are plenty of places she could come and live with us and be my maid if you would give her £50 for herself shed arrange it all  and would you come to folkstone  i think that would be stupid because lady julia did that we should make it a little different if you liked i wouldnt mind going tonew york and then perhaps we mightgetmarried you know on board thats what didon thinks  and would didon go too  thats what she proposes she could go as my aunt and id call myself by her nameany french name you know i should go as a french girl and you could call yourself smith and be an american we wouldnt go together but wed get on board just at the last moment if they wouldntmarry us on board they would at new york instantly  thats didons plan  thats what she thinks bestand shell do it if youll give her £50 for herself you know the adriaticthats a white star boat goes on thursday week at noon theres an early train that would take us down that morning you had better go and sleep at liverpool and take no notice of us at all till we meet on board we could be back in a monthand then papa would be obliged to make the best of it  sir felix at once felt that it would be quite unnecessary for him to go to herr vossner or to any other male counsellor for advice as to the best means of carrying off his love the young lady had it all at her fingers endseven to the amount of the fee required by the female counsellor but thursday week was very near and the whole thing was taking uncomfortably defined proportions where was he to get funds if he were to resolve that he would do this thing he had been fool enough to intrust his ready money to melmotte and now he was told that when melmotte got hold of ready money he was not apt to release it and he had nothing to showno security that he could offer to vossner and thenthis idea of starting to new york with melmottes daughter immediately after he had written to melmotte renouncing the girl frightened him      there is a tide in the affairs of men      which taken at the flood leads on to fortune  sir felix did not know these lines but the lesson taught by them came home to him at this moment now was the tide in his affairs at which he might make himself or utterly mar himself its deuced important he said at last with a groan  its not more important for you than me said marie  if youre wrong about the money and he shouldnt come round where should we be then  nothing venture nothing have said the heiress  thats all very well but one might venture everything and get nothing after all  youd get me said marie with a pout  yesand im awfully fond of you of course i should get you but  very well thenif thats your love said marie turning back from him  sir felix gave a great sigh and then announced his resolution ill venture it  oh felix how grand it will be  theres a great deal to do you know i dont know whether it can be thursday week he was putting in the cowards plea for a reprieve  i shall be afraid of didon if its delayed long  theres the money to get and all that  i can get some money mamma has money in the house  how much asked the baronet eagerly  a hundred pounds perhapsperhaps two hundred  that would help certainly i must go to your father for money wont that be a sell to get it from him to take you away  it was decided that they were to go to new york on a thursdayon thursday week if possible but as to that he was to let her know in a day or two didon was to pack up the clothes and get them sent out of the house didon was to have £50 before she went on board and as one of the men must know about it and must assist in having the trunks smuggled out of the house he was to have £10 all had been settled beforehand so that sir felix really had no need to think about anything and now said marie theres didon nobodys looking and she can open that gate for you when were gone do you creep out the gate can be left you know then well get out on the other side marie melmotte was certainly a clever girl     chapter xlii  can you be ready in ten minutes   after leaving melmottes house on sunday morning paul montague went to roger carburys hotel and found his friend just returning from church he was bound to go to islington on that day but had made up his mind that he would defer his visit till the evening he would dine early and be with mrs hurtle about seven oclock but it was necessary that roger should hear the news about ruby ruggles its not so bad as you thought said he as she is living with her aunt  i never heard of such an aunt  she says her grandfather knows where she is and that he doesnt want her back again  does she see felix carbury  i think she does said paul  then it doesnt matter whether the womans her aunt or not ill go and see her and try to get her back to bungay  why not send for john crumb  roger hesitated for a moment and then answered hed give felix such a thrashing as no man ever had before my cousin deserves it as well as any man ever deserved a thrashing but there are reasons why i should not like it and he could not force her back with him i dont suppose the girl is all badif she could see the truth  i dont think shes bad at all  at any rate ill go and see her said roger perhaps i shall see your widow at the same time paul sighed but said nothing more about his widow at that moment ill walk up to welbeck street now said roger taking his hat perhaps i shall see you tomorrow paul felt that he could not go to welbeck street with his friend  he dined in solitude at the beargarden and then again made that journey to islington in a cab as he went he thought of the proposal that had been made to him by melmotte if he could do it with a clear conscience if he could really make himself believe in the railway such an expedition would not be displeasing to him he had said already more than he had intended to say to hetta carbury and though he was by no means disposed to flatter himself yet he almost thought that what he had said had been well received at the moment they had been disturbed but she as she heard the sound of her mother coming had at any rate expressed no anger he had almost been betrayed into breaking a promise were he to start now on this journey the period of the promise would have passed by before his return of course he would take care that she should know that he had gone in the performance of a duty and then he would escape from mrs hurtle and would be able to make those inquiries which had been suggested to him it was possible that mrs hurtle should offer to go with himan arrangement which would not at all suit him  that at any rate must be avoided but then how could he do this without a belief in the railway generally and how was it possible that he should have such belief mr ramsbottom did not believe in it nor did roger carbury he himself did not in the least believe in fisker and fisker had originated the railway then would it not be best that he should take the chairmans offer as to his own money if he could get his £6000 back and have done with the railway he would certainly think himself a lucky man but he did not know how far he could with honesty lay aside his responsibility and then he doubted whether he could put implicit trust in melmottes personal guarantee for the amount this at any rate was clear to himthat melmotte was very anxious to secure his absence from the meetings of the board  now he was again at mrs pipkins door and again it was opened by ruby ruggles his heart was in his mouth as he thought of the things he had to say the ladies have come back from southend miss ruggles  oh yes sir and mrs hurtle is expecting you all the day then she put in a whisper on her own account you didnt tell him as youd seen me mr montague  indeed i did miss ruggles  then you might as well have left it alone and not have been illnaturedthats all said ruby as she opened the door of mrs hurtles room  mrs hurtle got up to receive him with her sweetest smileand her smile could be very sweet she was a witch of a woman and as like most witches she could be terrible so like most witches she could charm only fancy she said that you should have come the only day i have been two hundred yards from the house except that evening when you took me to the play i was so sorry  why should you be sorry it is easy to come again  because i dont like to miss you even for a day but i wasnt well and i fancied that the house was stuffy and mrs pipkin took a bright idea and proposed to carry me off to southend she was dying to go herself she declared that southend was paradise  a cockney paradise  oh what a place it is do your people really go to southend and fancy that that is the sea  i believe they do i never went to southend myselfso that you know more about it than i do  how very english it isa little yellow riverand you call it the sea ahyou never were at newport  but ive been at san francisco  yes youve been at san francisco and heard the seals howling well thats better than southend  i suppose we do have the sea here in england its generally supposed were an island  of coursebut things are so small if you choose to go to the west of ireland i suppose youd find the atlantic but nobody ever does go there for fear of being murdered paul thought of the gentleman in oregon but said nothingthought perhaps of his own condition and remembered that a man might be murdered without going either to oregon or the west of ireland but we went to southend i and mrs pipkin and the baby and upon my word i enjoyed it she was so afraid that the baby would annoy me and i thought the baby was so much the best of it and then we ate shrimps and she was so humble you must acknowledge that with us nobody would be so humble of course i paid she has got all her children and nothing but what she can make out of these lodgings people are just as poor with usand other people who happen to be a little better off pay for them but nobody is humble to another as you are here of course we like to have money as well as you do but it doesnt make so much difference  he who wants to receive all the world over will make himself as agreeable as he can to him who can give  but mrs pipkin was so humble however we got back all right yesterday evening and then i found that you had been hereat last  you knew that i had to go to liverpool  im not going to scold did you get your business done at liverpool  yesone generally gets something done but never anything very satisfactorily of course its about this railway  i should have thought that that was satisfactory everybody talks of it as being the greatest thing ever invented i wish i was a man that i might be concerned with a really great thing like that i hate little peddling things i should like to manage the greatest bank in the world or to be captain of the biggest fleet or to make the largest railway it would be better even than being president of a republic because one would have more of ones own way what is it that you do in it paul  they want me now to go out to mexico about it said he slowly  shall you go said she throwing herself forward and asking the question with manifest anxiety  i think not  why not do go oh paul i would go with you why should you not go it is just the thing for such a one as you to do the railway will make mexico a new country and then you would be the man who had done it why should you throw away such a chance as that it will never come again emperors and kings have tried their hands at mexico and have been able to do nothing emperors and kings never can do anything think what it would be to be the regenerator of mexico  think what it would be to find ones self there without the means of doing anything and to feel that one had been sent there merely that one might be out of the way  i would make the means of doing something  means are money how can i make that  there is money going there must be money where there is all this buying and selling of shares where does your uncle get the money with which he is living like a prince at san francisco where does fisker get the money with which he is speculating in new york where does melmotte get the money which makes him the richest man in the world why should not you get it as well as the others  if i were anxious to rob on my own account perhaps i might do it  why should it be robbery i do not want you to live in a palace and spend millions of dollars on yourself but i want you to have ambition go to mexico and chance it take san francisco in your way and get across the country i will go every yard with you make people there believe that you are in earnest and there will be no difficulty about the money  he felt that he was taking no steps to approach the subject which he should have to discuss before he left heror rather the statement which he had resolved that he would make indeed every word which he allowed her to say respecting this mexican project carried him farther away from it he was giving reasons why the journey should not be made but was tacitly admitting that if it were to be made she might be one of the travellers the very offer on her part implied an understanding that his former abnegation of the engagement had been withdrawn and yet he shrunk from the cruelty of telling her in a sideway fashion that he would not submit to her companionship either for the purpose of such a journey or for any other purpose the thing must be said in a solemn manner and must be introduced on its own basis but such preliminary conversation as this made the introduction of it infinitely more difficult  you are not in a hurry she said  oh no  youre going to spend the evening with me like a good man then ill ask them to let us have tea she rang the bell and ruby came in and the tea was ordered that young lady tells me that you are an old friend of hers  ive known about her down in the country and was astonished to find her here yesterday  theres some lover isnt theresome wouldbe husband whom she does not like  and some wontbe husband i fear whom she does like  thats quite of course if the other is true miss ruby isnt the girl to have come to her time of life without a preference the natural liking of a young woman for a man in a station above her because he is softer and cleaner and has better parts of speechjust as we keep a pretty dog if we keep a dog at allis one of the evils of the inequality of mankind the girl is content with the love without having the love justified because the object is more desirable she can only have her love justified with an object less desirable if all men wore coats of the same fabric and had to share the soil of the work of the world equally between them that evil would come to an end a woman here and there might go wrong from fantasy and diseased passions but the everexisting temptation to go wrong would be at an end  if men were equal tomorrow and all wore the same coats they would wear different coats the next day  slightly different but there would be no more purple and fine linen and no more blue woad it isnt to be done in a day of course nor yet in a centurynor in a decade of centuries but every human being who looks into it honestly will see that his efforts should be made in that direction i remember you never take sugar give me that  neither had he come here to discuss the deeply interesting questions of womens difficulties and immediate or progressive equality but having got on to these rockshaving as the reader may perceive been taken on to them wilfully by the skill of the womanhe did not know how to get his bark out again into clear waters but having his own subject before him with all its dangers the wildcats claws and the possible fate of the gentleman in oregon he could not talk freely on the subjects which she introduced as had been his wont in former years thanks he said changing his cup how well you remember  do you think i shall ever forget your preferences and dislikings do you recollect telling me about that blue scarf of mine that i should never wear blue  she stretched herself out towards him waiting for an answer so that he was obliged to speak of course i do black is your colourblack and grey or whiteand perhaps yellow when you choose to be gorgeous crimson possibly but not blue or green  i never thought much of it before but i have taken your word for gospel it is very good to have an eye for such thingsas you have paul but i fancy that taste comes with or at any rate forebodes an effete civilization  i am sorry that mine should be effete he said smiling  you know what i mean paul i speak of nations not individuals civilization was becoming effete or at any rate men were in the time of the great painters but savonarola and galileo were individuals you should throw your lot in with a new people this railway to mexico gives you the chance  are the mexicans a new people  they who will rule the mexicans are all american women i dare say have bad taste in gownsand so the vain ones and rich ones send to paris for their finery but i think our taste in men is generally good we like our philosophers we like our poets we like our genuine workmenbut we love our heroes i would have you a hero paul he got up from his chair and walked about the room in an agony of despair to be told that he was expected to be a hero at the very moment in his life in which he felt more devoid of heroism more thoroughly given up to cowardice than he had ever been before was not to be endured and yet with what utmost stretch of courageeven though he were willing to devote himself certainly and instantly to the worst fate that he had pictured to himselfcould he immediately rush away from these abstract speculations encumbered as they were with personal flattery into his own most unpleasant most tragic matter it was the unfitness that deterred him and not the possible tragedy nevertheless through it all he was surenearly surethat she was playing her game and playing it in direct antagonism to the game which she knew that he wanted to play would it not be better that he should go away and write another letter in a letter he could at any rate say what he had to sayand having said it he would then strengthen himself to adhere to it  what makes you so uneasy she asked still speaking in her most winning way caressing him with the tones of her voice do you not like me to say that i would have you be a hero  winifred he said i came here with a purpose and i had better carry it out  what purpose she still leaned forward but now supported her face on her two hands with her elbows resting on her knees looking at him intently but one would have said that there was only love in her eyeslove which might be disappointed but still love the wild cat if there was all within still hidden from sight paul stood with his hands on the back of a chair propping himself up and trying to find fitting words for the occasion stop my dear she said must the purpose be told tonight  why not tonight  paul i am not welli am weak now i am a coward you do not know the delight to me of having a few words of pleasant talk to an old friend after the desolation of the last weeks mrs pipkin is not very charming even her baby cannot supply all the social wants of my life i had intended that everything should be sweet tonight oh paul if it was your purpose to tell me of your love to assure me that you are still my dear dear friend to speak with hope of future days or with pleasure of those that are pastthen carry out your purpose but if it be cruel or harsh or painful if you had come to speak daggersthen drop your purpose for tonight try and think what my solitude must have been to me and let me have one hour of comfort  of course he was conquered for that night and could only have that solace which a most injurious reprieve could give him i will not harass you if you are ill he said  i am ill it was because i was afraid that i should be really ill that i went to southend the weather is hot though of course the sun here is not as we have it but the air is heavywhat mrs pipkin calls muggy i was thinking if i were to go somewhere for a week it would do me good where had i better go paul suggested brighton that is full of people is it nota fashionable place  not at this time of the year  but it is a big place i want some little place that would be pretty you could take me down could you not not very far you knownot that any place can be very far from here paul in his john bull displeasure suggested penzance telling her untruly that it would take twentyfour hours not penzance then which i know is your very ultima thulenot penzance nor yet orkney is there no other place except southend  there is cromer in norfolkperhaps ten hours  is cromer by the sea  yeswhat we call the sea  i mean really the sea paul  if you start from cromer right away a hundred miles would perhaps take you across to holland a ditch of that kind wouldnt do perhaps  ahnow i see you are laughing at me is cromer pretty  well yesi think it is i was there once but i dont remember much theres ramsgate  mrs pipkin told me of ramsgate i dont think i should like ramsgate  theres the isle of wight the isle of wight is very pretty  thats the queens place there would not be room for her and me too  or lowestoft lowestoft is not so far as cromer and there is a railway all the distance  and sea  sea enough for anything if you cant see across it and if there are waves and wind enough to knock you down and shipwrecks every other day i dont see why a hundred miles isnt as good as a thousand  a hundred miles is just as good as a thousand but paul at southend it isnt a hundred miles across to the other side of the river you must admit that but you will be a better guide than mrs pipkin you would not have taken me to southend when i expressed a wish for the oceanwould you let it be lowestoft is there an hotel  a small little place  very small uncomfortably small but almost any place would do for me  they make up i believe about a hundred beds but in the states it would be very small  paul said she delighted to have brought him back to this humour if i were to throw the tea things at you it would serve you right this is all because i did not lose myself in awe at the sight of the southend ocean it shall be lowestoft then she rose up and came to him and took his arm you will take me down will you not it is desolate for a woman to go into such a place all alone i will not ask you to stay and i can return by myself she had put both hands on one arm and turned herself round and looked into his face you will do that for old acquaintance sake for a moment or two he made no answer and his face was troubled and his brow was black he was endeavouring to thinkbut he was only aware of his danger and could see no way through it i dont think you will let me ask in vain for such a favour as that she said  no he replied i will take you down when will you go he had cockered himself up with some vain idea that the railway carriage would be a good place for the declaration of his purpose or perhaps the sands at lowestoft  when will i go when will you take me you have boards to attend and shares to look to and mexico to regenerate i am a poor woman with nothing on hand but mrs pipkins baby can you be ready in ten minutesbecause i could paul shook his head and laughed ive named a time and that doesnt suit now sir you name another and ill promise it shall suit paul suggested saturday the 29th he must attend the next board and had promised to see melmotte before the board day saturday of course would do for mrs hurtle should she meet him at the railway station of course he undertook to come and fetch her  then as he took his leave she stood close against him and put her cheek up for him to kiss there are moments in which a man finds it utterly impossible that he should be prudentas to which when he thought of them afterwards he could never forgive himself for prudence let the danger have been what it may of course he took her in his arms and kissed her lips as well as her cheeks     chapter xliii  the city road   the statement made by ruby as to her connection with mrs pipkin was quite true rubys father had married a pipkin whose brother had died leaving a widow behind him at islington the old man at sheeps acre farm had greatly resented this marriage had never spoken to his daughterinlawor to his son after the marriage and had steeled himself against the whole pipkin race when he undertook the charge of ruby he had made it matter of agreement that she should have no intercourse with the pipkins this agreement ruby had broken corresponding on the sly with her uncles widow at islington when therefore she ran away from suffolk she did the best she could with herself in going to her aunts house mrs pipkin was a poor woman and could not offer a permanent home to ruby but she was goodnatured and came to terms ruby was to be allowed to stay at any rate for a month and was to work in the house for her bread but she made it a part of her bargain that she should be allowed to go out occasionally mrs pipkin immediately asked after a lover im all right said ruby if the lover was what he ought to be had he not better come and see her this was mrs pipkins suggestion mrs pipkin thought that scandal might in this way be avoided thats as it may be byandby said ruby  then she told all the story of john crumbhow she hated john crumb how resolved she was that nothing should make her marry john crumb and she gave her own account of that night on which john crumb and mr mixet ate their supper at the farm and of the manner in which her grandfather had treated her because she would not have john crumb mrs pipkin was a respectable woman in her way always preferring respectable lodgers if she could get thembut bound to live she gave ruby very good advice of course if she was deadset against john crumb that was one thing but then there was nothing a young woman should look to so much as a decent house over her headand victuals whats all the love in the world ruby if a man cant do for you ruby declared that she knew somebody who could do for her and could do very well for her she knew what she was about and wasnt going to be put off it mrs pipkins morals were good wearing morals but she was not straitlaced if ruby chose to manage in her own way about her lover she must mrs pipkin had an idea that young women in these days did have and would have and must have more liberty than was allowed when she was young the world was being changed very fast mrs pipkin knew that as well as others and therefore when ruby went to the theatre once and againby herself as far as mrs pipkin knew but probably in company with her loverand did not get home till past midnight mrs pipkin said very little about it attributing such novel circumstances to the altered condition of her country she had not been allowed to go to the theatre with a young man when she had been a girlbut that had been in the earlier days of queen victoria fifteen years ago before the new dispensation had come ruby had never yet told the name of her lover to mrs pipkin having answered all inquiries by saying that she was right sir felixs name had never even been mentioned in islington till paul montague had mentioned it she had been managing her own affairs after her own fashionnot altogether with satisfaction but still without interruption but now she knew that interference would come mr montague had found her out and had told her grandfathers landlord the squire would be after her and then john crumb would come accompanied of course by mr mixetand after that as she said to herself on retiring to the couch which she shared with two little pipkins the fat would be in the fire  who do you think was at our place yesterday said ruby one evening to her lover they were sitting together at a musichallhalf musichall half theatre which pleasantly combined the allurements of the ginpalace the theatre and the ballroom trenching hard on those of other places sir felix was smoking dressed as he himself called it incognito with a tomandjerry hat and a blue silk cravat and a green coat ruby thought it was charming felix entertained an idea that were his west end friends to see him in this attire they would not know him he was smoking and had before him a glass of hot brandy and water which was common to himself and ruby he was enjoying life poor ruby she was halfashamed of herself halffrightened and yet supported by a feeling that it was a grand thing to have got rid of restraints and be able to be with her young man why not the miss longestaffes were allowed to sit and dance and walk about with their young menwhen they had any why was she to be given up to a great mass of stupid dust like john crumb without seeing anything of the world but yet as she sat sipping her lovers brandy and water between eleven and twelve at the musichall in the city road she was not altogether comfortable she saw things which she did not like to see and she heard things which she did not like to hear and her lover though he was beautifuloh so beautiful was not all that a lover should be she was still a little afraid of him and did not dare as yet to ask him for the promise which she expected him to make to her her mind was set uponmarriage but the word had hardly passed between them to have his arm round her waist was heaven to her could it be possible that he and john crumb were of the same order of human beings but how was this to go on even mrs pipkin made disagreeable allusions and she could not live always with mrs pipkin coming out at nights to drink brandy and water and hear music with sir felix carbury she was glad therefore to take the first opportunity of telling her lover that something was going to happen who do you suppose was at our place yesterday  sir felix changed colour thinking of marie melmotte thinking that perhaps some emissary from marie melmotte had been there perhaps didon herself he was amusing himself during these last evenings of his in london but the business of his life was about to take him to new york that project was still being elaborated he had had an interview with didon and nothing was wanting but the money didon had heard of the funds which had been intrusted by him to melmotte and had been very urgent with him to recover them therefore though his body was not unfrequently present late in the night at the city road musichall his mind was ever in grosvenor square who was it ruby  a friend of the squires a mr montague i used to see him about in bungay and beccles  paul montague  do you know him felix  wellrather hes a member of our club and i see him constantly in the cityand i know him at home  is he nice  wellthat depends on what you call nice hes a prig of a fellow  hes got a lady friend where i live  the devil he has sir felix of course had heard of roger carburys suit to his sister and of the opposition to this suit on the part of hetta which was supposed to have been occasioned by her preference for paul montague who is she ruby  wellshes a mrs hurtle such a stunning woman aunt says shes an american shes got lots of money  is montague going to marry her  oh dear yes its all arranged mr montague comes quite regular to see hernot so regular as he ought though when gentlemen are fixed as theyre to be married they never are regular afterwards i wonder whether itll be the same with you  wasnt john crumb regular ruby  bother john crumb that wasnt none of my doings oh hed been regular enough if id let him hed been like clockworkonly the slowest clock out but mr montague has been and told the squire as he saw me he told me so himself the squires coming about john crumb i know that what am i to tell him felix  tell him to mind his own business he cant do anything to you  nohe cant do nothing i aint done nothing wrong and he cant send for the police to have me took back to sheeps acre but he can talkand he can look i aint one of those felix as dont mind about their charactersso dont you think it shall i tell him as im with you  gracious goodness no what would you say that for  i didnt know i must say something  tell him youre nothing to him  but aunt will be letting on about my being out late onights i know she will and who am i with hell be asking that  your aunt does not know  noive told nobody yet but it wont do to go on like that you knowwill it you dont want it to go on always like thatdo you  its very jolly i think  it aint jolly for me of course felix i like to be with you thats jolly but i have to mind them brats all the day and to be doing the bedrooms and thats not the worst of it  what is the worst of it  im pretty nigh ashamed of myself yes i am and now ruby burst out into tears because i wouldnt have john crumb i didnt mean to be a bad girl nor yet i wont but whatll i do if everybody turns against me aunt wont go on for ever in this way she said last night that  bother what she says felix was not at all anxious to hear what aunt pipkin might have to say upon such an occasion  shes right too of course she knows theres somebody she aint such a fool as to think that im out at these hours to sing psalms with a lot of young women she says that whoever it is ought to speak out his mind therethats what she says and shes right a girl has to mind herself though shes ever so fond of a young man  sir felix sucked his cigar and then took a long drink of brandy and water having emptied the beaker before him he rapped for the waiter and called for another he intended to avoid the necessity of making any direct reply to rubys importunities he was going to new york very shortly and looked on his journey thither as an horizon in his future beyond which it was unnecessary to speculate as to any farther distance he had not troubled himself to think how it might be with ruby when he was gone he had not even considered whether he would or would not tell her that he was going before he started it was not his fault that she had come up to london she was an awfully jolly girl and he liked the feeling of the intrigue better perhaps than the girl herself but he assured himself that he wasnt going to give himself any dd trouble the idea of john crumb coming up to london in his wrath had never occurred to himor he would probably have hurried on his journey to new york instead of delaying it as he was doing now lets go in and have a dance he said  ruby was very fond of dancingperhaps liked it better than anything in the world it was heaven to her to be spinning round the big room with her lovers arm tight round her waist with one hand in his and her other hanging over his back she loved the music and loved the motion her ear was good and her strength was great and she never lacked breath she could spin along and dance a whole room down and feel at the time that the world could have nothing to give better worth having than thatand such moments were too precious to be lost she went and danced resolving as she did so that she would have some answer to her question before she left her lover on that night  and now i must go she said at last youll see me as far as the angel wont you of course he was ready to see her as far as the angel what am i to say to the squire  say nothing  and what am i to say to aunt  say to her just say what you have said all along  ive said nothing all alongjust to oblige you felix i must say something a girl has got herself to mind what have you got to say to me felix  he was silent for about a minute meditating his answer if you bother me i shall cut it you know  cut it  yescut it cant you wait till i am ready to say something  waiting will be the ruin o me if i wait much longer where am i to go if mrs pipkin wont have me no more  ill find a place for you  you find a place no that wont do ive told you all that before id sooner go into service or  go back to john crumb  john crumb has more respect for me nor you hed make me his wife tomorrow and only be too happy  i didnt tell you to come away from him said sir felix  yes you did you told me as i was to come up to london when i saw you at sheepstone beechesdidnt you and you told me you loved me didnt you and that if i wanted anything youd get it done for me didnt you  so i will what do you want i can give you a couple of sovereigns if thats what it is  no it isntand i wont have your money id sooner work my fingers off i want you to say whether you mean to marry me there  as to the additional lie which sir felix might now have told that would have been nothing to him he was going to new york and would be out of the way of any trouble and he thought that lies of that kind to young women never went for anything young women he thought didnt believe them but liked to be able to believe afterwards that they had been deceived it wasnt the lie that stuck in his throat but the fact that he was a baronet it was in his estimation confounded impudence on the part of ruby ruggles to ask to be his wife he did not care for the lie but he did not like to seem to lower himself by telling such a lie as that at her dictation marry ruby no i dont ever mean to marry its the greatest bore out i know a trick worth two of that  she stopped in the street and looked at him this was a state of things of which she had never dreamed she could imagine that a man should wish to put it off but that he should have the face to declare to his young woman that he never meant to marry at all was a thing that she could not understand what business had such a man to go after any young woman and what do you mean that im to do sir felix she said  just go easy and not make yourself a bother  not make myself a bother oh but i will i will im to be carrying on with you and nothing to come of it but for you to tell me that you dont mean to marry never at all never  dont you see lots of old bachelors about ruby  of course i does theres the squire but he dont come asking girls to keep him company  thats more than you know ruby  if he did hed marry her out of handbecause hes a gentleman thats what he is every inch of him he never said a word to a girlnot to do her any harm im sure and ruby began to cry you mustnt come no further now and ill never see you againnever i think youre the falsest young man and the basest and the lowestminded that i ever heard tell of i know there are them as dont keep their words things turn up and they cant or they gets to like others better or there aint nothing to live on but for a young man to come after a young woman and then say right out as he never means to marry at all is the lowestspirited fellow that ever was i never read of such a one in none of the books no i wont you go your way and ill go mine in her passion she was as good as her word and escaped from him running all the way to her aunts door there was in her mind a feeling of anger against the man which she did not herself understand in that he would incur no risk on her behalf he would not even make a lovers easy promise in order that the present hour might be made pleasant ruby let herself into her aunts house and cried herself to sleep with a child on each side of her  on the next day roger called she had begged mrs pipkin to attend the door and had asked her to declare should any gentleman ask for ruby ruggles that ruby ruggles was out mrs pipkin had not refused to do so but having heard sufficient of roger carbury to imagine the cause which might possibly bring him to the house and having made up her mind that rubys present condition of independence was equally unfavourable to the lodginghouse and to ruby herself she determined that the squire if he did come should see the young lady when therefore ruby was called into the little back parlour and found roger carbury there she thought that she had been caught in a trap she had been very cross all the morning though in her rage she had been able on the previous evening to dismiss her titled lover and to imply that she never meant to see him again now when the remembrance of the loss came upon her amidst her daily workwhen she could no longer console herself in her drudgery by thinking of the beautiful things that were in store for her and by flattering herself that though at this moment she was little better than a maid of all work in a lodginghouse the time was soon coming in which she would bloom forth as a baronets bridenow in her solitude she almost regretted the precipitancy of her own conduct could it be that she would never see him againthat she would dance no more in that gilded bright saloon and might it not be possible that she had pressed him too hard a baronet of course would not like to be brought to book as she could bring to book such a one as john crumb but yetthat he should have said neverthat he would never marry looking at it in any light she was very unhappy and this coming of the squire did not serve to cure her misery  roger was very kind to her taking her by the hand and bidding her sit down and telling her how glad he was to find that she was comfortably settled with her aunt we were all alarmed of course when you went away without telling anybody where you were going  grandfatherd been that cruel to me that i couldnt tell him  he wanted you to keep your word to an old friend of yours  to pull me all about by the hairs of my head wasnt the way to make a girl keep her wordwas it mr carbury thats what he did thenand sally hockett who is there heard it ive been good to grandfather whatever i may have been to john crumb and he shouldnt have treated me like that no girld like to be pulled about the room by the hairs of her head and she with her things all off just getting into bed  the squire had no answer to make to this that old ruggles should be a violent brute under the influence of gin and water did not surprise him and the girl when driven away from her home by such usage had not done amiss in coming to her aunt but roger had already heard a few words from mrs pipkin as to rubys late hours had heard also that there was a lover and knew very well who that lover was he also was quite familiar with john crumbs state of mind john crumb was a gallant loving fellow who might be induced to forgive everything if ruby would only go back to him but would certainly persevere after some slow fashion of his own and see the matter out as he would say himself if she did not go back as you found yourself obliged to run away said roger im glad that you should be here but you dont mean to stay here always  i dont know said ruby  you must think of your future life you dont want to be always your aunts maid  oh dear no  it would be very odd if you did when you may be the wife of such a man as mr crumb  oh mr crumb everybody is going on about mr crumb i dont like mr crumb and i never will like him  now look here ruby i have come to speak to you very seriously and i expect you to hear me nobody can make you marry mr crumb unless you please  nobody cant of course sir  but i fear you have given him up for somebody else who certainly wont marry you and who can only mean to ruin you  nobody wont ruin me said ruby a girl has to look to herself and i mean to look to myself  im glad to hear you say so but being out at night with such a one as sir felix carbury is not looking to yourself that means going to the devil head foremost  i aint a going to the devil said ruby sobbing and blushing  but you will if you put yourself into the hands of that young man hes as bad as bad can be hes my own cousin and yet im obliged to tell you so he has no more idea of marrying you than i have but were he to marry you he could not support you he is ruined himself and would ruin any young woman who trusted him im almost old enough to be your father and in all my experience i never came across so vile a young man as he is he would ruin you and cast you from him without a pang of remorse he has no heart in his bosomnone ruby had now given way altogether and was sobbing with her apron to her eyes in one corner of the room thats what sir felix carbury is said the squire standing up so that he might speak with the more energy and talk her down more thoroughly and if i understand it rightly he continued it is for a vile thing such as he that you have left a man who is as much above him in character as the sun is above the earth you think little of john crumb because he does not wear a fine coat  i dont care about any mans coat said ruby but john hasnt ever a word to say was it ever so  words to say what do words matter he loves you he loves you after that fashion that he wants to make you happy and respectable not to make you a byeword and a disgrace ruby struggled hard to make some opposition to the suggestion but found herself to be incapable of speech at the moment he thinks more of you than of himself and would give you all that he has what would that other man give you if you were once married to john crumb would any one then pull you by the hairs of your head would there be any want then or any disgrace  there aint no disgrace mr carbury  no disgrace in going about at midnight with such a one as felix carbury you are not a fool and you know that it is disgraceful if you are not unfit to be an honest mans wife go back and beg that mans pardon  john crumbs pardon no  oh ruby if you knew how highly i respect that man and how lowly i think of the other how i look on the one as a noble fellow and regard the other as dust beneath my feet you would perhaps change your mind a little  her mind was being changed his words did have their effect though the poor girl struggled against the conviction that was borne in upon her she had never expected to hear any one call john crumb noble but she had never respected any one more highly than squire carbury and he said that john crumb was noble amidst all her misery and trouble she still told herself that it was but a dusty mealyand also a dumb nobility  ill tell you what will take place continued roger mr crumb wont put up with this you know  he cant do nothing to me sir  thats true enough unless it be to take you in his arms and press you to his heart he wants to do nothing to you do you think hed injure you if he could you dont know what a mans love really means ruby but he could do something to somebody else how do you think it would be with felix carbury if they two were in a room together and nobody else by  johns mortial strong mr carbury  if two men have equal pluck strength isnt much needed one is a brave man and the othera coward which do you think is which  hes your own cousin and i dont know why you should say everything again him  you know im telling you the truth you know it as well as i do myselfand youre throwing yourself away and throwing the man who loves you overfor such a fellow as that go back to him ruby and beg his pardon  i never willnever  ive spoken to mrs pipkin and while youre here she will see that you dont keep such hours any longer you tell me that youre not disgraced and yet you are out at midnight with a young blackguard like that ive said what ive got to say and im going away but ill let your grandfather know  grandfather dont want me no more  and ill come again if you want money to go home i will let you have it take my advice at least in thisdo not see sir felix carbury any more then he took his leave if he had failed to impress her with admiration for john crumb he had certainly been efficacious in lessening that which she had entertained for sir felix     chapter xliv  the coming election   the very greatness of mr melmottes popularity the extent of the admiration which was accorded by the public at large to his commercial enterprise and financial sagacity created a peculiar bitterness in the opposition that was organized against him at westminster as the high mountains are intersected by deep valleys as puritanism in one age begets infidelity in the next as in many countries the thickness of the winters ice will be in proportion to the number of the summer musquitoes so was the keenness of the hostility displayed on this occasion in proportion to the warmth of the support which was manifested as the great man was praised so also was he abused as he was a demigod to some so was he a fiend to others and indeed there was hardly any other way in which it was possible to carry on the contest against him from the moment in which mr melmotte had declared his purpose of standing for westminster in the conservative interest an attempt was made to drive him down the throats of the electors by clamorous assertions of his unprecedented commercial greatness it seemed that there was but one virtue in the world commercial enterpriseand that melmotte was its prophet it seemed too that the orators and writers of the day intended all westminster to believe that melmotte treated his great affairs in a spirit very different from that which animates the bosoms of merchants in general he had risen above feeling of personal profit his wealth was so immense that there was no longer place for anxiety on that score he already possessedso it was saidenough to found a dozen families and he had but one daughter but by carrying on the enormous affairs which he held in his hands he would be able to open up new worlds to afford relief to the oppressed nationalities of the overpopulated old countries he had seen how small was the good done by the peabodys and the bairds and resolving to lend no ear to charities and religions was intent on projects for enabling young nations to earn plentiful bread by the moderate sweat of their brows he was the head and front of the railway which was to regenerate mexico it was presumed that the contemplated line from ocean to ocean across british america would become a fact in his hands it was he who was to enter into terms with the emperor of china for farming the teafields of that vast country he was already in treaty with russia for a railway from moscow to khiva he had a fleetor soon would have a fleet of emigrant ships ready to carry every discontented irishman out of ireland to whatever quarter of the globe the milesian might choose for the exercise of his political principles it was known that he had already floated a company for laying down a submarine wire from penzance to point de galle round the cape of good hopeso that in the event of general wars england need be dependent on no other country for its communications with india and then there was the philanthropic scheme for buying the liberty of the arabian fellahs from the khedive of egypt for thirty millions sterlingthe compensation to consist of the concession of a territory about four times as big as great britain in the lately annexed country on the great african lakes it may have been the case that some of these things were as yet only matters of conversationspeculations as to which mr melmottes mind and imagination had been at work rather than his pocket or even his credit but they were all sufficiently matured to find their way into the public press and to be used as strong arguments why melmotte should become member of parliament for westminster  all this praise was of course gall to those who found themselves called upon by the demands of their political position to oppose mr melmotte you can run down a demigod only by making him out to be a demidevil these very persons the leading liberals of the leading borough in england as they called themselves would perhaps have cared little about melmottes antecedents had it not become their duty to fight him as a conservative had the great man found at the last moment that his own british politics had been liberal in their nature these very enemies would have been on his committee it was their business to secure the seat and as melmottes supporters began the battle with an attempt at what the liberals called bounceto carry the borough with a rush by an overwhelming assertion of their candidates virtuesthe other party was driven to make some enquiries as to that candidates antecedents they quickly warmed to the work and were not less loud in exposing the satan of speculation than had been the conservatives in declaring the commercial jove emissaries were sent to paris and frankfort and the wires were used to vienna and new york it was not difficult to collect storiestrue or false and some quiet men who merely looked on at the game expressed an opinion that melmotte might have wisely abstained from the glories of parliament  nevertheless there was at first some difficulty in finding a proper liberal candidate to run against him the nobleman who had been elevated out of his seat by the death of his father had been a great whig magnate whose family was possessed of immense wealth and of popularity equal to its possessions one of that family might have contested the borough at a much less expense than any other person and to them the expense would have mattered but little but there was no such member of it forthcoming lord this and lord thatand the honourable this and the honourable that sons of other cognate lords already had seats which they were unwilling to vacate in the present state of affairs there was but one other session for the existing parliament and the odds were held to be very greatly in melmottes favour many an outsider was tried but the outsiders were either afraid of melmottes purse or his influence lord buntingford was asked and he and his family were good old whigs but he was nephew to lord alfred grendall first cousin to miles grendall and abstained on behalf of his relatives an overture was made to sir damask monogram who certainly could afford the contest but sir damask did not see his way melmotte was a working bee while he was a droneand he did not wish to have the difference pointed out by mr melmottes supporters moreover he preferred his yacht and his fourinhand  at last a candidate was selected whose nomination and whose consent to occupy the position created very great surprise in the london world the press had of course taken up the matter very strongly the morning breakfast table supported mr melmotte with all its weight there were people who said that this support was given by mr broune under the influence of lady carbury and that lady carbury in this way endeavoured to reconcile the great man to a marriage between his daughter and sir felix but it is more probable that mr broune sawor thought that he sawwhich way the wind sat and that he supported the commercial hero because he felt that the hero would be supported by the country at large in praising a book or putting foremost the merits of some official or military claimant or writing up a charity in some small matter of merely personal interestthe editor of the morning breakfast table might perhaps allow himself to listen to a lady whom he loved but he knew his work too well to jeopardize his paper by such influences in any matter which might probably become interesting to the world of his readers there was a strong belief in melmotte the clubs thought that he would be returned for westminster the dukes and duchesses fêted him the cityeven the city was showing a wavering disposition to come round bishops begged for his name on the list of promoters of their pet schemes royalty without stint was to dine at his table melmotte himself was to sit at the right hand of the brother of the sun and of the uncle of the moon and british royalty was to be arranged opposite so that every one might seem to have the place of most honour how could a conscientious editor of a morning breakfast table seeing how things were going do other than support mr melmotte in fair justice it may be well doubted whether lady carbury had exercised any influence in the matter  but the evening pulpit took the other side now this was the more remarkable the more sure to attract attention inasmuch as the evening pulpit had never supported the liberal interest as was said in the first chapter of this work the motto of that newspaper implied that it was to be conducted on principles of absolute independence had the evening pulpit like some of its contemporaries lived by declaring from day to day that all liberal elements were godlike and all their opposites satanic as a matter of course the same line of argument would have prevailed as to the westminster election but as it had not been so the vigour of the evening pulpit on this occasion was the more alarming and the more noticeableso that the short articles which appeared almost daily in reference to mr melmotte were read by everybody now they who are concerned in the manufacture of newspapers are well aware that censure is infinitely more attractive than eulogybut they are quite as well aware that it is more dangerous no proprietor or editor was ever brought before the courts at the cost of ever so many hundred poundswhich if things go badly may rise to thousandsbecause he had attributed all but divinity to some very poor specimen of mortality no man was ever called upon for damages because he had attributed grand motives it might be well for politics and literature and artand for truth in general if it was possible to do so but a new law of libel must be enacted before such salutary proceedings can take place censure on the other hand is open to very grave perils let the editor have been ever so conscientious ever so beneficenteven ever so truelet it be ever so clear that what he has written has been written on behalf of virtue and that he has misstated no fact exaggerated no fault never for a moment been allured from public to private mattersand he may still be in danger of ruin a very long purse or else a very high courage is needed for the exposure of such conduct as the evening pulpit attributed to mr melmotte the paper took up this line suddenly after the second article mr alf sent back to mr miles grendall who in the matter was acting as mr melmottes secretary the ticket of invitation for the dinner with a note from mr alf stating that circumstances connected with the forthcoming election for westminster could not permit him to have the great honour of dining at mr melmottes table in the presence of the emperor of china miles grendall showed the note to the dinner committee and without consultation with mr melmotte it was decided that the ticket should be sent to the editor of a thoroughgoing conservative journal this conduct on the part of the evening pulpit astonished the world considerably but the world was more astonished when it was declared that mr ferdinand alf himself was going to stand for westminster on the liberal interest  various suggestions were made some said that as mr alf had a large share in the newspaper and as its success was now an established fact he himself intended to retire from the laborious position which he filled and was therefore free to go into parliament others were of opinion that this was the beginning of a new era in literature of a new order of things and that from this time forward editors would frequently be found in parliament if editors were employed of sufficient influence in the world to find constituencies mr broune whispered confidentially to lady carbury that the man was a fool for his pains and that he was carried away by pride very cleverand dashing said mr broune but he never had ballast lady carbury shook her head she did not want to give up mr alf if she could help it he had never said a civil word of her in his paperbut still she had an idea that it was well to be on good terms with so great a power she entertained a mysterious awe for mr alfmuch in excess of any similar feeling excited by mr broune in regard to whom her awe had been much diminished since he had made her an offer of marriage her sympathies as to the election of course were with mr melmotte she believed in him thoroughly she still thought that his nod might be the means of making felixor if not his nod then his money without the nod  i suppose he is very rich she said speaking to mr broune respecting mr alf  i dare say he has put by something but this election will cost him £10000and if he goes on as he is doing now he had better allow another £10000 for action for libel theyve already declared that they will indict the paper  do you believe about the austrian insurance company this was a matter as to which mr melmotte was supposed to have retired from paris not with clean hands  i dont believe the evening pulpit can prove itand im sure that they cant attempt to prove it without an expense of three or four thousand pounds thats a game in which nobody wins but the lawyers i wonder at alf i should have thought that he would have known how to get all said that he wanted to have said without running with his head into the lions mouth he has been so clever up to this god knows he has been bitter enough but he has always sailed within the wind  mr alf had a powerful committee by this time an animus in regard to the election had been created strong enough to bring out the men on both sides and to produce heat when otherwise there might only have been a warmth or possibly frigidity the whig marquises and the whig barons came forward and with them the liberal professional men and the tradesmen who had found that party to answer best and the democratical mechanics if melmottes money did not at last utterly demoralise the lower class of voters there would still be a good fight and there was a strong hope that under the ballot melmottes money might be taken without a corresponding effect upon the voting it was found upon trial that mr alf was a good speaker and though he still conducted the evening pulpit he made time for addressing meetings of the constituency almost daily and in his speeches he never spared melmotte no one he said had a greater reverence for mercantile grandeur than himself but let them take care that the grandeur was grand how great would be the disgrace to such a borough as that of westminster if it should find that it had been taken in by a false spirit of speculation and that it had surrendered itself to gambling when it had thought to do honour to honest commerce this connected as of course it was with the articles in the paper was regarded as very open speaking and it had its effect some men began to say that melmotte had not been known long enough to deserve confidence in his riches and the lord mayor was already beginning to think that it might be wise to escape the dinner by some excuse  melmottes committee was also very grand if alf was supported by marquises and barons he was supported by dukes and earls but his speaking in public did not of itself inspire much confidence he had very little to say when he attempted to explain the political principles on which he intended to act after a little he confined himself to remarks on the personal attacks made on him by the other side and even in doing that was reiterative rather than diffusive let them prove it he defied them to prove it englishmen were too great too generous too honest too noblethe men of westminster especially were a great deal too highminded to pay any attention to such charges as these till they were proved then he began again let them prove it such accusations as these were mere lies till they were proved he did not say much himself in public as to actions for libelbut assurances were made on his behalf to the electors especially by lord alfred grendall and his son that as soon as the election was over all speakers and writers would be indicted for libel who should be declared by proper legal advice to have made themselves liable to such action the evening pulpit and mr alf would of course be the first victims  the dinner was fixed for monday july the 8th the election for the borough was to be held on tuesday the 9th it was generally thought that the proximity of the two days had been arranged with the view of enhancing melmottes expected triumph but such in truth was not the case it had been an accident and an accident that was distressing to some of the melmottites there was much to be done about the dinner which could not be omitted and much also as to the electionwhich was imperative the two grendalls father and son found themselves to be so driven that the world seemed for them to be turned topsyturvy the elder had in old days been accustomed to electioneering in the interest of his own family and had declared himself willing to make himself useful on behalf of mr melmotte but he found westminster to be almost too much for him he was called here and sent there till he was very near rebellion if this goes on much longer i shall cut it he said to his son  think of me governor said the son i have to be in the city four or five times a week  youve a regular salary  come governor youve done pretty well for that whats my salary to the shares youve had the thing iswill it last  how last  there are a good many who say that melmotte will burst up  i dont believe it said lord alfred they dont know what theyre talking about there are too many in the same boat to let him burst up it would be the bursting up of half london but i shall tell him after this that he must make it easier he wants to know whos to have every ticket for the dinner and theres nobody to tell him except me and ive got to arrange all the places and nobody to help me except that fellow from the heralds office i dont know about peoples rank which ought to come first a director of the bank or a fellow who writes books miles suggested that the fellow from the heralds office would know all about that and that his father need not trouble himself with petty details  and you shall come to us for three daysafter its over said lady monogram to miss longestaffe a proposition to which miss longestaffe acceded willingly indeed but not by any means as though a favour had been conferred upon her now the reason why lady monogram had changed her mind as to inviting her old friend and thus threw open her hospitality for three whole days to the poor young lady who had disgraced herself by staying with the melmottes was as follows miss longestaffe had the disposal of two evening tickets for madame melmottes grand reception and so greatly had the melmottes risen in general appreciation that lady monogram had found that she was bound on behalf of her own position in society to be present on that occasion it would not do that her name should not be in the printed list of the guests therefore she had made a serviceable bargain with her old friend miss longestaffe she was to have her two tickets for the reception and miss longestaffe was to be received for three days as a guest by lady monogram it had also been conceded that at any rate on one of these nights lady monogram should take miss longestaffe out with her and that she should herself receive company on another there was perhaps something slightly painful at the commencement of the negotiation but such feelings soon fade away and lady monogram was quite a woman of the world     chapter xlv  mr melmotte is pressed for time   about this time a fortnight or nearly so before the election mr longestaffe came up to town and saw mr melmotte very frequently he could not go into his own house as he had let that for a month to the great financier nor had he any establishment in town but he slept at an hotel and lived at the carlton he was quite delighted to find that his new friend was an honest conservative and he himself proposed the honest conservative at the club there was some idea of electing mr melmotte out of hand but it was decided that the club could not go beyond its rule and could only admit mr melmotte out of his regular turn as soon as he should occupy a seat in the house of commons mr melmotte who was becoming somewhat arrogant was heard to declare that if the club did not take him when he was willing to be taken it might do without him if not elected at once he should withdraw his name so great was his prestige at this moment with his own party that there were some mr longestaffe among the number who pressed the thing on the committee mr melmotte was not like other men it was a great thing to have mr melmotte in the party mr melmottes financial capabilities would in themselves be a tower of strength rules were not made to control the club in a matter of such importance as this a noble lord one among seven who had been named as a fit leader of the upper house on the conservative side in the next session was asked to take the matter up and men thought that the thing might have been done had he complied but he was oldfashioned perhaps pigheaded and the club for the time lost the honour of entertaining mr melmotte  it may be remembered that mr longestaffe had been anxious to become one of the directors of the mexican railway and that he was rather snubbed than encouraged when he expressed his wish to mr melmotte like other great men mr melmotte liked to choose his own time for bestowing favours since that request was made the proper time had come and he had now intimated to mr longestaffe that in a somewhat altered condition of things there would be a place for him at the board and that he and his brother directors would be delighted to avail themselves of his assistance the alliance between mr melmotte and mr longestaffe had become very close the melmottes had visited the longestaffes at caversham georgiana longestaffe was staying with madame melmotte in london the melmottes were living in mr longestaffes town house having taken it for a month at a very high rent mr longestaffe now had a seat at mr melmottes board and mr melmotte had bought mr longestaffes estate at pickering on terms very favourable to the longestaffes it had been suggested to mr longestaffe by mr melmotte that he had better qualify for his seat at the board by taking shares in the company to the amount ofperhaps two or three thousand pounds and mr longestaffe had of course consented there would be no need of any transaction in absolute cash the shares could of course be paid for out of mr longestaffes half of the purchase money for pickering park and could remain for the present in mr melmottes hands to this also mr longestaffe had consented not quite understanding why the scrip should not be made over to him at once  it was a part of the charm of all dealings with this great man that no ready money seemed ever to be necessary for anything great purchases were made and great transactions apparently completed without the signing even of a cheque mr longestaffe found himself to be afraid even to give a hint to mr melmotte about ready money in speaking of all such matters melmotte seemed to imply that everything necessary had been done when he had said that it was done pickering had been purchased and the titledeeds made over to mr melmotte but the £80000 had not been paidhad not been absolutely paid though of course mr melmottes note assenting to the terms was security sufficient for any reasonable man the property had been mortgaged though not heavily and mr melmotte had no doubt satisfied the mortgagee but there was still a sum of £50000 to come of which dolly was to have one half and the other was to be employed in paying off mr longestaffes debts to tradesmen and debts to the bank it would have been very pleasant to have had this at oncebut mr longestaffe felt the absurdity of pressing such a man as mr melmotte and was partly conscious of the gradual consummation of a new era in money matters if your banker is pressing you refer him to me mr melmotte had said as for many years past we have exchanged paper instead of actual money for our commodities so now it seemed that under the new melmotte regime an exchange of words was to suffice  but dolly wanted his money dolly idle as he was foolish as he was dissipated as he was and generally indifferent to his debts liked to have what belonged to him it had all been arranged £5000 would pay off all his tradesmens debts and leave him comfortably possessed of money in hand while the other £20000 would make his own property free there was a charm in this which awakened even dolly and for the time almost reconciled him to his fathers society but now a shade of impatience was coming over him he had actually gone down to caversham to arrange the terms with his fatherand had in fact made his own terms his father had been unable to move him and had consequently suffered much in spirit dolly had been almost triumphantthinking that the money would come on the next day or at any rate during the next week now he came to his father early in the morningat about two oclockto inquire what was being done he had not as yet been made blessed with a single tenpound note in his hand as the result of the sale  are you going to see melmotte sir he asked somewhat abruptly  yesim to be with him tomorrow and he is to introduce me to the board  youre going in for that are you sir do they pay anything  i believe not  nidderdale and young carbury belong to it its a sort of beargarden affair  a beargarden affair adolphus how so  i mean the club we had them all there for dinner one day and a jolly dinner we gave them miles grendall and old alfred belong to it i dont think theyd go in for it if there was no money going id make them fork out something if i took the trouble of going all that way  i think that perhaps adolphus you hardly understand these things  no i dont i dont understand much about business i know what i want to understand is when melmotte is going to pay up this money  i suppose hell arrange it with the banks said the father  i beg that he wont arrange my money with the banks sir youd better tell him not a cheque upon his bank which i can pay in to mine is about the best thing going youll be in the city tomorrow and youd better tell him if you dont like you know ill get squercum to do it mr squercum was a lawyer whom dolly had employed of late years much to the annoyance of his parent mr squercums name was odious to mr longestaffe  i beg youll do nothing of the kind it will be very foolish if you doperhaps ruinous  then hed better pay up like anybody else said dolly as he left the room the father knew the son and was quite sure that squercum would have his finger in the pie unless the money were paid quickly when dolly had taken an idea into his head no power on earthno power at least of which the father could avail himselfwould turn him  on that same day melmotte received two visits in the city from two of his fellow directors at the time he was very busy though his electioneering speeches were neither long nor pithy still he had to think of them beforehand members of his committee were always trying to see him orders as to the dinner and the preparation of the house could not be given by lord alfred without some reference to him and then those gigantic commercial affairs which were enumerated in the last chapter could not be adjusted without much labour on his part his hands were not empty but still he saw each of these young men for a few minutes my dear young friend what can i do for you he said to sir felix not sitting down so that sir felix also should remain standing  about that money mr melmotte  what money my dear fellow you see that a good many money matters pass through my hands  the thousand pounds i gave you for shares if you dont mind and as the shares seem to be a bother ill take the money back  it was only the other day you had £200 said melmotte showing that he could apply his memory to small transactions when he pleased  exactlyand you might as well let me have the £800  ive ordered the sharesgave the order to my broker the other day  then id better take the shares said sir felix feeling that it might very probably be that day fortnight before he could start for new york could i get them mr melmotte  my dear fellow i really think you hardly calculate the value of my time when you come to me about such an affair as this  id like to have the money or the shares said sir felix who was not specially averse to quarrelling with mr melmotte now that he had resolved upon taking that gentlemans daughter to new york in direct opposition to his written promise their quarrel would be so thoroughly internecine when the departure should be discovered that any present anger could hardly increase its bitterness what felix thought of now was simply his money and the best means of getting it out of melmottes hands  youre a spendthrift said melmotte apparently relenting and im afraid a gambler i suppose i must give you £200 more on account  sir felix could not resist the touch of ready money and consented to take the sum offered as he pocketed the cheque he asked for the name of the brokers who were employed to buy the shares but here melmotte demurred no my friend said melmotte you are only entitled to shares for £600 pounds now i will see that the thing is put right so sir felix departed with £200 only marie had said that she could get £200 perhaps if he bestirred himself and wrote to some of miless big relations he could obtain payment of a part of that gentlemans debt to him  sir felix going down the stairs in abchurch lane met paul montague coming up carbury on the spur of the moment thought that he would take a rise as he called it out of montague whats this i hear about a lady at islington he asked  who has told you anything about a lady at islington  a little bird there are always little birds about telling of ladies im told that im to congratulate you on your coming marriage  then youve been told an infernal falsehood said montague passing on he paused a moment and added i dont know who can have told you but if you hear it again ill trouble you to contradict it as he was waiting in melmottes outer room while the dukes nephew went in to see whether it was the great mans pleasure to see him he remembered whence carbury must have heard tidings of mrs hurtle of course the rumour had come through ruby ruggles  miles grendall brought out word that the great man would see mr montague but he added a caution hes awfully full of work just nowyou wont forget thatwill you montague assured the dukes nephew that he would be concise and was shown in  i should not have troubled you said paul only that i understood that i was to see you before the board met  exactlyof course it was quite necessaryonly you see i am a little busy if this dd dinner were over i shouldnt mind its a deal easier to make a treaty with an emperor than to give him a dinner i can tell you that welllet me see ohi was proposing that you should go out to pekin  to mexico  yes yesto mexico ive so many things running in my head well if youll say when youre ready to start well draw up something of instructions youd know better however than we can tell you what to do youll see fisker of course you and fisker will manage it the chief thing will be a cheque for the expenses eh we must get that passed at the next board  mr melmotte had been so quick that montague had been unable to interrupt him there need be no trouble about that mr melmotte as i have made up my mind that it would not be fit that i should go  oh indeed  there had been a shade of doubt on montagues mind till the tone in which melmotte had spoken of the embassy grated on his ears the reference to the expenses disgusted him altogether noeven did i see my way to do any good in america my duties here would not be compatible with the undertaking  i dont see that at all what duties have you got here what good are you doing the company if you do stay i hope youll be unanimous thats allor perhaps you intend to go out if thats it ill look to your money i think i told you that before  that mr melmotte is what i should prefer  very wellvery well ill arrange it sorry to lose youthats all miles isnt mr goldsheiner waiting to see me  youre a little too quick mr melmotte said paul  a man with my business on his hands is bound to be quick sir  but i must be precise i cannot tell you as a fact that i shall withdraw from the board till i receive the advice of a friend with whom i am consulting i hardly yet know what my duty may be  ill tell you sir what can not be your duty it cannot be your duty to make known out of that boardroom any of the affairs of the company which you have learned in that boardroom it cannot be your duty to divulge the circumstances of the company or any differences which may exist between directors of the company to any gentleman who is a stranger to the company it cannot be your duty  thank you mr melmotte on matters such as that i think that i can see my own way i have been in fault in coming in to the board without understanding what duties i should have to perform  very much in fault i should say replied melmotte whose arrogance in the midst of his inflated glory was overcoming him  but in reference to what i may or may not say to any friend or how far i should be restricted by the scruples of a gentleman i do not want advice from you  very wellvery well i cant ask you to stay because a partner from the house of todd brehgert and goldsheiner is waiting to see me about matters which are rather more important than this of yours montague had said what he had to say and departed  on the following day threequarters of an hour before the meeting of the board of directors old mr longestaffe called in abchurch lane he was received very civilly by miles grendall and asked to sit down mr melmotte quite expected him and would walk with him over to the offices of the railway and introduce him to the board mr longestaffe with some shyness intimated his desire to have a few moments conversation with the chairman before the board met fearing his son especially fearing squercum he had made up his mind to suggest that the little matter about pickering park should be settled miles assured him that the opportunity should be given him but that at the present moment the chief secretary of the russian legation was with mr melmotte either the chief secretary was very tedious with his business or else other big men must have come in for mr longestaffe was not relieved till he was summoned to walk off to the board five minutes after the hour at which the board should have met he thought that he could explain his views in the street but on the stairs they were joined by mr cohenlupe and in three minutes they were in the board room mr longestaffe was then presented and took the chair opposite to miles grendall montague was not there but had sent a letter to the secretary explaining that for reasons with which the chairman was acquainted he should absent himself from the present meeting all right said melmotte i know all about it go on im not sure but that mr montagues retirement from among us may be an advantage he could not be made to understand that unanimity in such an enterprise as this is essential i am confident that the new director whom i have had the pleasure of introducing to you today will not sin in the same direction then mr melmotte bowed and smiled very sweetly on mr longestaffe  mr longestaffe was astonished to find how soon the business was done and how very little he had been called on to do miles grendall had read something out of a book which he had been unable to follow then the chairman had read some figures mr cohenlupe had declared that their prosperity was unprecedentedand the board was over when mr longestaffe explained to miles grendall that he still wished to speak to mr melmotte miles explained to him that the chairman had been obliged to run off to a meeting of gentlemen connected with the interior of africa which was now being held at the cannon street hotel     chapter xlvi  roger carbury and his two friends   roger carbury having found ruby ruggles and having ascertained that she was at any rate living in a respectable house with her aunt returned to carbury he had given the girl his advice and had done so in a manner that was not altogether ineffectual he had frightened her and had also frightened mrs pipkin he had taught mrs pipkin to believe that the new dispensation was not yet so completely established as to clear her from all responsibility as to her nieces conduct having done so much and feeling that there was no more to be done he returned home it was out of the question that he should take ruby with him in the first place she would not have gone and thenhad she gonehe would not have known where to bestow her for it was now understood throughout bungayand the news had spread to becclesthat old farmer ruggles had sworn that his granddaughter should never again be received at sheeps acre farm the squire on his return home heard all the news from his own housekeeper john crumb had been at the farm and there had been a fierce quarrel between him and the old man the old man had called ruby by every name that is most distasteful to a woman and john had stormed and had sworn that he would have punched the old mans head but for his age he wouldnt believe any harm of rubyor if he did he was ready to forgive that harm but as for the baronitethe baronite had better look to himself old ruggles had declared that ruby should never have a shilling of his moneyhereupon crumb had anathematised old ruggles and his money too telling him that he was an old hunx and that he had driven the girl away by his cruelty roger at once sent over to bungay for the dealer in meal who was with him early on the following morning  did ye find her squoire  oh yes mr crumb i found her shes living with her aunt mrs pipkin at islington  eh nowlook at that  you knew she had an aunt of that name up in london  yees i knewd it squoire i a heard tell of mrs pipkin but i never seed her  i wonder it did not occur to you that ruby would go there john crumb scratched his head as though acknowledging the shortcoming of his own intellect of course if she was to go to london it was the proper thing for her to do  i knew shed do the thing as was right i said that all along darned if i didnt you ask mixet squoirehim as is baker down bardsey lane i allays guy it her that shed do the thing as was right but how about she and the baronite  roger did not wish to speak of the baronet just at present i suppose the old man down here did illuse her  oh dreadfulthere aint no manner of doubt o that dragged her about awfulas he ought to be took up only for the rumpus like dye think shes seed the baronite since shes been in lonon muster carbury  i think shes a good girl if you mean that  im sure she be i dont want none to tell me that squoire tho squoire its better to me nor a ten pun note to hear you say so i allays had a leaning to you squoire but ill more nor lean to you now ive said all through she was good and if eer a man in bungay said she warnt well i was there and ready  i hope nobody has said so  you cant stop them women squoire there aint no dropping into them but lord love ee she shall come and be missus of my house tomorrow and whatll it matter her then what they say but squoire did ye hear if the baronite had been a hanging about that place  about islington you mean  he goes a hanging about he do he dont come out straight forrard and tell a girl as he loves her afore all the parish there aint one in bungay nor yet in mettingham nor yet in all the ilketsals and all the elmhams as dont know as im set on ruby ruggles huggerymuggery is pison to me squoire  we all know that when youve made up your mind you have made up your mind  i hove its made up ever so as to ruby what sort of a one is her aunt now squoire  she keeps lodgingsa very decent sort of a woman i should say  she wont let the baronite come there  certainly not said roger who felt that he was hardly dealing sincerely with this most sincere of mealmen hitherto he had shuffled off every question that had been asked him about felix though he knew that ruby had spent many hours with her fashionable lover mrs pipkin wont let him come there  if i was to give her a geown nowor a blue cloakthem lodginghouse women is mostly hard put to itor a chest of drawers like for her best bedroom wouldnt that make her more o my side squoire  i think shell try to do her duty without that  they do like things the like o that any ways ill go up squoire arter saxnam market and see how things is lying  i wouldnt go just yet mr crumb if i were you she hasnt forgotten the scene at the farm yet  i said nothing as wasnt as kind as kind  but her own perversity runs in her own head if you had been unkind she could have forgiven that but as you were goodnatured and she was cross she cant forgive that john crumb again scratched his head and felt that the depths of a womans character required more gauging than he had yet given to it and to tell you the truth my friend i think that a little hardship up at mrs pipkins will do her good  dont she have a bellyful o vittels asked john crumb with intense anxiety  i dont quite mean that i dare say she has enough to eat but of course she has to work for it with her aunt she has three or four children to look after  that moight come in handy byandbymoightnt it squoire said john crumb grinning  as you say shell be learning something that may be useful to her in another sphere of course there is a good deal to do and i should not be surprised if she were to think after a bit that your house in bungay was more comfortable than mrs pipkins kitchen in london  my little back parloureh squoire and ive got a fourposter most as big as any in bungay  i am sure you have everything comfortable for her and she knows it herself let her think about all thatand do you go and tell her again in a months time shell be more willing to settle matters then than she is now  but the baronite  mrs pipkin will allow nothing of that  girls is so cute ruby is awful cute it makes me feel as though i had two hunerdweight o meal on my stomach lying awake o nights and thinking as how he is may bepulling of her about if i thought that shed let him oh id swing for it muster carbury theyd have to make an eend o me at bury if it was that way they would then  roger assured him again and again that he believed ruby to be a good girl and promised that further steps should be taken to induce mrs pipkin to keep a close watch upon her niece john crumb made no promise that he would abstain from his journey to london after saxmundham fair but left the squire with a conviction that his purpose of doing so was shaken he was still however resolved to send mrs pipkin the price of a new blue cloak and declared his purpose of getting mixet to write the letter and enclose the money order john crumb had no delicacy as to declaring his own deficiency in literary acquirements he was able to make out a bill for meal or pollards but did little beyond that in the way of writing letters  this happened on a saturday morning and on that afternoon roger carbury rode over to lowestoft to a meeting there on church matters at which his friend the bishop presided after the meeting was over he dined at the inn with half a dozen clergymen and two or three neighbouring gentlemen and then walked down by himself on to the long strand which has made lowestoft what it is it was now just the end of june and the weather was delightfulbut people were not as yet flocking to the seashore every shopkeeper in every little town through the country now follows the fashion set by parliament and abstains from his annual holiday till august or september the place therefore was by no means full here and there a few of the townspeople who at a bathing place are generally indifferent to the sea were strolling about and another few indifferent to fashion had come out from the lodginghouses and from the hotel which had been described as being small and insignificantand making up only a hundred beds roger carbury whose house was not many miles distant from lowestoft was fond of the seashore and always came to loiter there for a while when any cause brought him into the town now he was walking close down upon the marge of the tideso that the last little roll of the rising water should touch his feetwith his hands joined behind his back and his face turned down towards the shore when he came upon a couple who were standing with their backs to the land looking forth together upon the waves he was close to them before he saw them and before they had seen him then he perceived that the man was his friend paul montague leaning on pauls arm a lady stood dressed very simply in black with a dark straw hat on her head very simple in her attire but yet a woman whom it would be impossible to pass without notice the lady of course was mrs hurtle  paul montague had been a fool to suggest lowestoft but his folly had been natural it was not the first place he had named but when fault had been found with others he had fallen back upon the sea sands which were best known to himself lowestoft was just the spot which mrs hurtle required when she had been shown her room and taken down out of the hotel on to the strand she had declared herself to be charmed she acknowledged with many smiles that of course she had had no right to expect that mrs pipkin should understand what sort of place she needed but paul would understandand had understood i think the hotel charming she said i dont know what you mean by your fun about the american hotels but i think this quite gorgeous and the people so civil hotel people always are civil before the crowds come of course it was impossible that paul should return to london by the mail train which started about an hour after his arrival he would have reached london at four or five in the morning and have been very uncomfortable the following day was sunday and of course he promised to stay till monday of course he had said nothing in the train of those stern things which he had resolved to say of course he was not saying them when roger carbury came upon him but was indulging in some poetical nonsense some probably very trite raptures as to the expanse of the ocean and the endless ripples which connected shore with shore mrs hurtle too as she leaned with friendly weight upon his arm indulged also in moonshine and romance though at the back of the heart of each of them there was a devouring care still they enjoyed the hour we know that the man who is to be hung likes to have his breakfast well cooked and so did paul like the companionship of mrs hurtle because her attire though simple was becoming because the colour glowed in her dark face because of the brightness of her eyes and the happy sharpness of her words and the dangerous smile which played upon her lips he liked the warmth of her close vicinity and the softness of her arm and the perfume from her hairthough he would have given all that he possessed that she had been removed from him by some impassable gulf as he had to be hanged and this womans continued presence would be as bad as death to him he liked to have his meal well dressed  he certainly had been foolish to bring her to lowestoft and the close neighbourhood of carbury manorand now he felt his folly as soon as he saw roger carbury he blushed up to his forehead and then leaving mrs hurtles arm he came forward and shook hands with his friend it is mrs hurtle he said i must introduce you and the introduction was made roger took off his hat and bowed but he did so with the coldest ceremony mrs hurtle who was quick enough at gathering the minds of people from their looks was just as cold in her acknowledgment of the courtesy in former days she had heard much of roger carbury and surmised that he was no friend to her i did not know that you were thinking of coming to lowestoft said roger in a voice that was needlessly severe but his mind at the present moment was severe and he could not hide his mind  i was not thinking of it mrs hurtle wished to get to the sea and as she knew no one else here in england i brought her  mr montague and i have travelled so many miles together before now she said that a few additional will not make much difference  do you stay long asked roger in the same voice  i go back probably on monday said montague  as i shall be here a whole week and shall not speak a word to any one after he has left me he has consented to bestow his company on me for two days will you join us at dinner mr carbury this evening  thank you madami have dined  then mr montague i will leave you with your friend my toilet though it will be very slight will take longer than yours we dine you know in twenty minutes i wish you could get your friend to join us so saying mrs hurtle tripped back across the sand towards the hotel  is this wise demanded roger in a voice that was almost sepulchral as soon as the lady was out of hearing  you may well ask that carbury nobody knows the folly of it so thoroughly as i do  then why do you do it do you mean to marry her  no certainly not  is it honest then or like a gentleman that you should be with her in this way does she think that you intend to marry her  i have told her that i would not i have told her then he stopped he was going on to declare that he had told her that he loved another woman but he felt that he could hardly touch that matter in speaking to roger carbury  what does she mean then has she no regard for her own character  i would explain it to you all carbury if i could but you would never have the patience to hear me  i am not naturally impatient  but this would drive you mad i wrote to her assuring her that it must be all over then she came here and sent for me was i not bound to go to her  yesto go to her and repeat what you had said in your letter  i did do so i went with that very purpose and did repeat it  then you should have left her  ah but you do not understand she begged that i would not desert her in her loneliness we have been so much together that i could not desert her  i certainly do not understand that paul you have allowed yourself to be entrapped into a promise of marriage and then for reasons which we will not go into now but which we both thought to be adequate you resolved to break your promise thinking that you would be justified in doing so but nothing can justify you in living with the lady afterwards on such terms as to induce her to suppose that your old promise holds good  she does not think so she cannot think so  then what must she be to be here with you and what must you be to be here in public with such a one as she is i dont know why i should trouble you or myself about it people live now in a way that i dont comprehend if this be your way of living i have no right to complain  for gods sake carbury do not speak in that way it sounds as though you meant to throw me over  i should have said that you had thrown me over you come down here to this hotel where we are both known with this lady whom you are not going to marryand i meet you just by chance had i known it of course i could have turned the other way but coming on you by accident as i did how am i not to speak to you and if i speak what am i to say of course i think that the lady will succeed in marrying you  never  and that such a marriage will be your destruction doubtless she is goodlooking  yes and clever and you must remember that the manners of her country are not as the manners of this country  then if i marry at all said roger with all his prejudice expressed strongly in his voice i trust i may not marry a lady of her country she does not think that she is to marry you and yet she comes down here and stays with you paul i dont believe it i believe you but i dont believe her she is here with you in order that she may marry you she is cunning and strong you are foolish and weak believing as i do that marriage with her would be destruction i should tell her my mindand leave her paul at the moment thought of the gentleman in oregon and of certain difficulties in leaving thats what i should do you must go in now i suppose and eat your dinner  i may come to the hall as i go back home  certainly you may come if you please said roger then he bethought himself that his welcome had not been cordial i mean that i shall be delighted to see you he added marching away along the strand paul did go into the hotel and did eat his dinner in the meantime roger carbury marched far away along the strand in all that he had said to montague he had spoken the truth or that which appeared to him to be the truth he had not been influenced for a moment by any reference to his own affairs and yet he feared he almost knew that this man who had promised to marry a strange american woman and who was at this very moment living in close intercourse with the woman after he had told her that he would not keep his promisewas the chief barrier between himself and the girl that he loved as he had listened to john crumb while john spoke of ruby ruggles he had told himself that he and john crumb were alike with an honest true heartfelt desire they both panted for the companionship of a fellowcreature whom each had chosen and each was to be thwarted by the makebelieve regard of unworthy youth and fatuous good looks crumb by dogged perseverance and indifference to many things would probably be successful at last but what chance was there of success for him ruby as soon as want or hardship told upon her would return to the strong arm that could be trusted to provide her with plenty and comparative ease but hetta carbury if once her heart had passed from her own dominion into the possession of another would never change her love it was possible no doubtnay how probablethat her heart was still vacillating roger thought that he knew that at any rate she had not as yet declared her love if she were now to knowif she could now learnof what nature was the love of this other man if she could be instructed that he was living alone with a lady whom not long since he had promised to marry if she could be made to understand this whole story of mrs hurtle would not that open her eyes would she not then see where she could trust her happiness and where by so trusting it she would certainly be shipwrecked  never said roger to himself hitting at the stones on the beach with his stick never then he got his horse and rode back to carbury manor     chapter xlvii  mrs hurtle at lowestoft   when paul got down into the diningroom mrs hurtle was already there and the waiter was standing by the side of the table ready to take the cover off the soup she was radiant with smiles and made herself especially pleasant during dinner but paul felt sure that everything was not well with her though she smiled and talked and laughed there was something forced in her manner he almost knew that she was only waiting till the man should have left the room to speak in a different strain and so it was as soon as the last lingering dish had been removed and when the door was finally shut behind the retreating waiter she asked the question which no doubt had been on her mind since she had walked across the strand to the hotel your friend was hardly civil was he paul  do you mean that he should have come in i have no doubt it was true that he had dined  i am quite indifferent about his dinnerbut there are two ways of declining as there are of accepting i suppose he is on very intimate terms with you  oh yes  then his want of courtesy was the more evidently intended for me in point of fact he disapproves of me is not that it to this question montague did not feel himself called upon to make any immediate answer i can well understand that it should be so an intimate friend may like or dislike the friend of his friend without offence but unless there be strong reason he is bound to be civil to his friends friend when accident brings them together you have told me that mr carbury was your beau ideal of an english gentleman  so he is  then why didnt he behave as such and mrs hurtle again smiled did not you yourself feel that you were rebuked for coming here with me when he expressed surprise at your journey has he authority over you  of course he has not what authority could he have  nay i do not know he may be your guardian in this safegoing country young men perhaps are not their own masters till they are past thirty i should have said that he was your guardian and that he intended to rebuke you for being in bad company i dare say he did after i had gone  this was so true that montague did not know how to deny it nor was he sure that it would be well that he should deny it the time must come and why not now as well as at any future moment he had to make her understand that he could not join his lot with herchiefly indeed because his heart was elsewhere a reason on which he could hardly insist because she could allege that she had a prior right to his heartbut also because her antecedents had been such as to cause all his friends to warn him against such a marriage so he plucked up courage for the battle it was nearly that he said  there are manyand probably the greater portion of my readers will be among the numberwho will declare to themselves that paul montague was a poor creature in that he felt so great a repugnance to face this woman with the truth his folly in falling at first under the battery of her charms will be forgiven him his engagement unwise as it was and his subsequent determination to break his engagement will be pardoned women and perhaps some men also will feel that it was natural that he should have been charmed natural that he should have expressed his admiration in the form which unmarried ladies expect from unmarried men when any such expression is to be made at all natural also that he should endeavour to escape from the dilemma when he found the manifold dangers of the step which he had proposed to take no woman i think will be hard upon him because of his breach of faith to mrs hurtle but they will be very hard on him on the score of his cowardiceas i think unjustly in social life we hardly stop to consider how much of that daring spirit which gives mastery comes from hardness of heart rather than from high purpose or true courage the man who succumbs to his wife the mother who succumbs to her daughter the master who succumbs to his servant is as often brought to servility by a continual aversion to the giving of pain by a softness which causes the fretfulness of others to be an agony to himselfas by any actual fear which the firmness of the imperious one may have produced there is an inner softness a thinness of the minds skin an incapability of seeing or even thinking of the troubles of others with equanimity which produces a feeling akin to fear but which is compatible not only with courage but with absolute firmness of purpose when the demand for firmness arises so strongly as to assert itself with this man it was not really that he feared the womanor at least such fears did not prevail upon him to be silent but he shrank from subjecting her to the blank misery of utter desertion after what had passed between them he could hardly bring himself to tell her that he wanted her no further and to bid her go but that was what he had to do and for that his answer to her last question prepared the way it was nearly that he said  mr carbury did take it upon himself to rebuke you for showing yourself on the sands at lowestoft with such a one as i am  he knew of the letter which i wrote to you  you have canvassed me between you  of course we have is that unnatural would you have had me be silent about you to the oldest and the best friend i have in the world  no i would not have had you be silent to your oldest and best friend i presume you would declare your purpose but i should not have supposed you would have asked his leave when i was travelling with you i thought you were a man capable of managing your own actions i had heard that in your country girls sometimes hold themselves at the disposal of their friendsbut i did not dream that such could be the case with a man who had gone out into the world to make his fortune  paul montague did not like it the punishment to be endured was being commenced of course you can say bitter things he replied  is it my nature to say bitter things have i usually said bitter things to you when i have hung round your neck and have sworn that you should be my god upon earth was that bitter i am alone and i have to fight my own battles a womans weapon is her tongue say but one word to me paul as you know how to say it and there will be soon an end to that bitterness what shall i care for mr carbury except to make him the cause of some innocent joke if you will speak but that one word and think what it is i am asking do you remember how urgent were once your own prayers to mehow you swore that your happiness could only be secured by one word of mine though i loved you i doubted there were considerations of money which have now vanished but i spoke itbecause i loved you and because i believed you give me that which you swore you had given before i made my gift to you  i cannot say that word  do you mean that after all i am to be thrown off like an old glove i have had many dealings with men and have found them to be false cruel unworthy and selfish but i have met nothing like that no man has ever dared to treat me like that no man shall dare  i wrote to you  wrote to meyes and i was to take that as sufficient no i think but little of my life and have but little for which to live but while i do live i will travel over the worlds surface to face injustice and to expose it before i will put up with it you wrote to me heaven and earthi can hardly control myself when i hear such impudence she clenched her fist upon the knife that lay on the table as she looked at him and raising it dropped it again at a further distance wrote to me could any mere letter of your writing break the bond by which we were bound together had not the distance between us seemed to have made you safe would you have dared to write that letter the letter must be unwritten it has already been contradicted by your conduct to me since i have been in this country  i am sorry to hear you say that  am i not justified in saying it  i hope not when i first saw you i told you everything if i have been wrong in attending to your wishes since i regret it  this comes from your seeing your master for two minutes on the beach you are acting now under his orders no doubt he came with the purpose had you told him you were to be here  his coming was an accident  it was very opportune at any rate wellwhat have you to say to me or am i to understand that you suppose yourself to have said all that is required of you perhaps you would prefer that i should argue the matter out with yourfriend mr carbury  what has to be said i believe i can say myself  say it then or are you so ashamed of it that the words stick in your throat  there is some truth in that i am ashamed of it i must say that which will be painful and which would not have been to be said had i been fairly careful  then he paused dont spare me she said i know what it all is as well as though it were already told i know the lies with which they have crammed you at san francisco you have heard that up in oregon i shot a man that is no lie i did i brought him down dead at my feet then she paused and rose from her chair and looked at him do you wonder that that is a story that a woman should hesitate to tell but not from shame do you suppose that the sight of that dying wretch does not haunt me that i do not daily hear his drunken screech and see him bound from the earth and then fall in a heap just below my hand but did they tell you also that it was thus alone that i could save myselfand that had i spared him i must afterwards have destroyed myself if i were wrong why did they not try me for his murder why did the women flock around me and kiss the very hems of my garments in this soft civilization of yours you know nothing of such necessity a woman here is protectedunless it be from lies  it was not that only he whispered  no they told you other things she continued still standing over him they told you of quarrels with my husband i know the lies and who made them and why did i conceal from you the character of my former husband did i not tell you that he was a drunkard and a scoundrel how should i not quarrel with such a one ah paul you can hardly know what my life has been  they told me thatyou fought him  pshafought him yesi was always fighting him what are you to do but to fight cruelty and fight falsehood and fight fraud and treacherywhen they come upon you and would overwhelm you but for fighting you have not been fool enough to believe that fable about a duel i did stand once armed and guarded my bedroom door from him and told him that he should only enter it over my body he went away to the tavern and i did not see him for a week afterwards that was the duel and they have told you that he is not dead  yesthey have told me that  who has seen him alive i never said to you that i had seen him dead how should i  there would be a certificate  certificatein the back of texasfive hundred miles from galveston and what would it matter to you i was divorced from him according to the law of the state of kansas does not the law make a woman free here to marry againand why not with us i sued for a divorce on the score of cruelty and drunkenness he made no appearance and the court granted it me am i disgraced by that  i heard nothing of the divorce  i do not remember when we were talking of these old days before you did not care how short i was in telling my story you wanted to hear little or nothing then of caradoc hurtle now you have become more particular i told you that he was deadas i believed myself and do believe whether the other story was told or not i do not know  it was not told  then it was your own faultbecause you would not listen and they have made you believe i suppose that i have failed in getting back my property  i have heard nothing about your property but what you yourself have said unasked i have asked no question about your property  you are welcome at last i have made it again my own and now sir what else is there i think i have been open with you is it because i protected myself from drunken violence that i am to be rejected am i to be cast aside because i saved my life while in the hands of a reprobate husband and escaped from him by means provided by lawor because by my own energy i have secured my own property if i am not to be condemned for these things then say why am i condemned  she had at any rate saved him the trouble of telling the story but in doing so had left him without a word to say she had owned to shooting the man well it certainly may be necessary that a woman should shoot a manespecially in oregon as to the duel with her husbandshe had half denied and half confessed it he presumed that she had been armed with a pistol when she refused mr hurtle admittance into the nuptial chamber as to the question of hurtles deathshe had confessed that perhaps he was not dead but thenas she had askedwhy should not a divorce for the purpose in hand be considered as good as a death he could not say that she had not washed herself cleanand yet from the story as told by herself what man would wish to marry her she had seen so much of drunkenness had become so handy with pistols and had done so much of a mans work that any ordinary man might well hesitate before he assumed to be her master i do not condemn you he replied  at any rate paul do not lie she answered if you tell me that you will not be my husband you do condemn me is it not so  i will not lie if i can help it i did ask you to be my wife  wellrather how often before i consented  it matters little at any rate till you did consent i have since satisfied myself that such a marriage would be miserable for both of us  you have  i have of course you can speak of me as you please and think of me as you please i can hardly defend myself  hardly i think  but with whatever result i know that i shall now be acting for the best in declaring that i will not becomeyour husband  you will not she was still standing and stretched out her right hand as though again to grasp something  he also now rose from his chair if i speak with abruptness it is only to avoid a show of indecision i will not  oh god what have i done that it should be my lot to meet man after man false and cruel as this you tell me to my face that i am to bear it who is the jade that has done it has she moneyor rank or is it that you are afraid to have by your side a woman who can speak for herselfand even act for herself if some action be necessary perhaps you think that i amold he was looking at her intently as she spoke and it did seem to him that many years had been added to her face it was full of lines round the mouth and the light play of drollery was gone and the colour was fixed and her eyes seemed to be deep in her head speak manis it that you want a younger wife  you know it is not  know how should any one know anything from a liar from what you tell me i know nothing i have to gather what i can from your character i see that you are a coward it is that man that came to you and who is your master that has forced you to this between me and him you tremble and are a thing to be pitied as for knowing what you would be at from anything that you would saythat is impossible once again i have come across a mean wretch oh foolthat men should be so vile and think themselves masters of the world my last word to you is that you area liar now for the present you can go ten minutes since had i had a weapon in my hand i should have shot another man  paul montague as he looked round the room for his hat could not but think that perhaps mrs hurtle might have had some excuse it seemed at any rate to be her custom to have a pistol with herthough luckily for his comfort she had left it in her bedroom on the present occasion i will say goodbye to you he said when he had found his hat  say no such thing tell me that you have triumphed and got rid of me pluck up your spirits if you have any and show me your joy tell me that an englishman has dared to illtreat an american woman you wouldwere you not afraid to indulge yourself he was now standing in the doorway and before he escaped she gave him an imperative command i shall not stay here now she saidi shall return on monday i must think of what you have said and must resolve what i myself will do i shall not bear this without seeking a means of punishing you for your treachery i shall expect you to come to me on monday  he closed the door as he answered her i do not see that it will serve any purpose  it is for me sir to judge of that i suppose you are not so much a coward that you are afraid to come to me if so i shall come to you and you may be assured that i shall not be too timid to show myself and to tell my story he ended by saying that if she desired it he would wait upon her but that he would not at present fix a day on his return to town he would write to her  when he was gone she went to the door and listened awhile then she closed it and turning the lock stood with her back against the door and with her hands clasped after a few moments she ran forward and falling on her knees buried her face in her hands upon the table then she gave way to a flood of tears and at last lay rolling upon the floor  was this to be the end of it should she never know restnever have one draught of cool water between her lips was there to be no end to the storms and turmoils and misery of her life in almost all that she had said she had spoken the truth though doubtless not all the truth as which among us would in giving the story of his life she had endured violence and had been violent she had been schemed against and had schemed she had fitted herself to the life which had befallen her but in regard to money she had been honest and she had been loving of heart with her heart of hearts she had loved this young englishmanand now after all her scheming all her daring with all her charms this was to be the end of it oh what a journey would this be which she must now make back to her own country all alone  but the strongest feeling which raged within her bosom was that of disappointed love full as had been the vials of wrath which she had poured forth over montagues head violent as had been the storm of abuse with which she had assailed him there had been after all something counterfeited in her indignation but her love was no counterfeit at any moment if he would have returned to her and taken her in his arms she would not only have forgiven him but have blessed him also for his kindness she was in truth sick at heart of violence and rough living and unfeminine words when driven by wrongs the old habit came back upon her but if she could only escape the wrongs if she could find some niche in the world which would be bearable to her in which free from harsh treatment she could pour forth all the genuine kindness of her womans naturethen she thought she could put away violence and be gentle as a young girl when she first met this englishman and found that he took delight in being near her she had ventured to hope that a haven would at last be open to her but the reek of the gunpowder from that first pistol shot still clung to her and she now told herself again as she had often told herself before that it would have been better for her to have turned the muzzle against her own bosom  after receiving his letter she had run over on what she had told herself was a vain chance though angry enough when that letter first reached her she had with that force of character which marked her declared to herself that such a resolution on his part was natural in marrying her he must give up all his old allies all his old haunts the whole world must be changed to him she knew enough of herself and enough of englishwomen to be sure that when her past life should be known as it would be known she would be avoided in england with all the little ridicule she was wont to exercise in speaking of the old country there was ever mixed as is so often the case in the minds of american men and women an almost envious admiration of english excellence to have been allowed to forget the past and to live the life of an english lady would have been heaven to her but she who was sometimes scorned and sometimes feared in the eastern cities of her own country whose name had become almost a proverb for violence out in the far westhow could she dare to hope that her lot should be so changed for her  she had reminded paul that she had required to be asked often before she had consented to be his wife but she did not tell him that that hesitation had arisen from her own conviction of her own unfitness but it had been so circumstances had made her what she was circumstances had been cruel to her but she could not now alter them then gradually as she came to believe in his love as she lost herself in love for him she told herself that she would be changed she had however almost known that it could not be so but this man had relatives had business had property in her own country though she could not be made happy in england might not a prosperous life be opened for him in the far west then had risen the offer of that journey to mexico with much probability that work of no ordinary kind might detain him there for years with what joy would she have accompanied him as his wife for that at any rate she would have been fit  she was conscious perhaps too conscious of her own beauty that at any rate she felt had not deserted her she was hardly aware that time was touching it and she knew herself to be clever capable of causing happiness and mirth and comfort she had the qualities of a good comradewhich are so much in a woman she knew all this of herself if he and she could be together in some country in which those stories of her past life would be matter of indifference could she not make him happy but what was she that a man should give up everything and go away and spend his days in some halfbarbarous country for her alone she knew it all and was hardly angry with him in that he had decided against her but treated as she had been she must play her game with such weapons as she possessed it was consonant with her old character it was consonant with her present plans that she should at any rate seem to be angry  sitting there alone late into the night she made many plans but the plan that seemed best to suit the present frame of her mind was the writing of a letter to paul bidding him adieu sending him her fondest love and telling him that he was right she did write the letter but wrote it with a conviction that she would not have the strength to send it to him the reader may judge with what feeling she wrote the following words      dear paul     you are right and i am wrong our marriage would not have been    fitting i do not blame you i attracted you when we were    together but you have learned and have learned truly that you    should not give up your life for such attractions if i have    been violent with you forgive me you will acknowledge that i    have suffered     always know that there is one woman who will love you better    than any one else i think too that you will love me even when    some other woman is by your side god bless you and make you    happy write me the shortest shortest word of adieu not to do    so would make you think yourself heartless but do not come to    me     for ever     w h   this she wrote on a small slip of paper and then having read it twice she put it into her pocketbook she told herself that she ought to send it but told herself as plainly that she could not bring herself to do so it was early in the morning before she went to bed but she had admitted no one into the room after montague had left her  paul when he escaped from her presence roamed out on to the seashore and then took himself to bed having ordered a conveyance to take him to carbury manor early in the morning at breakfast he presented himself to the squire i have come earlier than you expected he said  yes indeedmuch earlier are you going back to lowestoft  then he told the whole story roger expressed his satisfaction recalling however the pledge which he had given as to his return let her follow you and bear it he said of course you must suffer the effects of your own imprudence on that evening paul montague returned to london by the mail train being sure that he would thus avoid a meeting with mrs hurtle in the railwaycarriage     chapter xlviii  ruby a prisoner   ruby had run away from her lover in great dudgeon after the dance at the music hall and had declared that she never wanted to see him again but when reflection came with the morning her misery was stronger than her wrath what would life be to her now without her lover when she escaped from her grandfathers house she certainly had not intended to become nurse and assistant maidofallwork at a london lodginghouse the daily toil she could endure and the hard life as long as she was supported by the prospect of some coming delight a dance with felix at the music hall though it were three days distant from her would so occupy her mind that she could wash and dress all the children without complaint mrs pipkin was forced to own to herself that ruby did earn her bread but when she had parted with her lover almost on an understanding that they were never to meet again things were very different with her and perhaps she had been wrong a gentleman like sir felix did not of course like to be told about marriage if she gave him another chance perhaps he would speak at any rate she could not live without another dance and so she wrote him a letter  ruby was glib enough with her pen though what she wrote will hardly bear repeating she underscored all her loves to him she underscored the expression of her regret if she had vexed him she did not want to hurry a gentleman but she did want to have another dance at the music hall would he be there next saturday sir felix sent her a very short reply to say that he would be at the music hall on the tuesday as at this time he proposed to leave london on the wednesday on his way to new york he was proposing to devote his very last night to the companionship of ruby ruggles  mrs pipkin had never interfered with her nieces letters it is certainly a part of the new dispensation that young women shall send and receive letters without inspection but since roger carburys visit mrs pipkin had watched the postman and had also watched her niece for nearly a week ruby said not a word of going out at night she took the children for an airing in a broken perambulator nearly as far as holloway with exemplary care and washed up the cups and saucers as though her mind was intent upon them but mrs pipkins mind was intent on obeying mr carburys behests she had already hinted something as to which ruby had made no answer it was her purpose to tell her and to swear to her mostsolemnly should she find her preparing herself to leave the house after six in the eveningthat she should be kept out the whole night having a purpose equally clear in her own mind that she would break her oath should she be unsuccessful in her effort to keep ruby at home but on the tuesday when ruby went up to her room to deck herself a bright idea as to a better precaution struck mrs pipkins mind ruby had been carelesshad left her lovers scrap of a note in an old pocket when she went out with the children and mrs pipkin knew all about it it was nine oclock when ruby went upstairsand then mrs pipkin locked both the front door and the area gate mrs hurtle had come home on the previous day you wont be wanting to go out tonightwill you mrs hurtle said mrs pipkin knocking at her lodgers door mrs hurtle declared her purpose of remaining at home all the evening if you should hear words between me and my niece dont you mind maam  i hope theres nothing wrong mrs pipkin  shell be wanting to go out and i wont have it it isnt right is it maam shes a good girl but theyve got such a way nowadays of doing just as they pleases that one doesnt know whats going to come next mrs pipkin must have feared downright rebellion when she thus took her lodger into her confidence  ruby came down in her silk frock as she had done before and made her usual little speech im just going to step out aunt for a little time tonight ive got the key and ill let myself in quite quiet  indeed ruby you wont said mrs pipkin  wont what aunt  wont let yourself in if you go out if you go out tonight youll stay out thats all about it if you go out tonight you wont come back here any more i wont have it and it isnt right that i should youre going after that young man that they tell me is the greatest scamp in all england  they tell you lies then aunt pipkin  very well no girl is going out any more at nights out of my house so thats all about it if you had told me you was going before you neednt have gone up and bedizened yourself for now its all to take off again  ruby could hardly believe it she had expected some oppositionwhat she would have called a few words but she had never imagined that her aunt would threaten to keep her in the streets all night it seemed to her that she had bought the privilege of amusing herself by hard work nor did she believe now that her aunt would be as hard as her threat ive a right to go if i like she said  thats as you think you havent a right to come back again any way  yes i have ive worked for you a deal harder than the girl downstairs and i dont want no wages ive a right to go out and a right to come backand go i shall  youll be no better than you should be if you do  am i to work my very nails off and push that perambulator about all day till my legs wont carry meand then i aint to go out not once in a week  not unless i know more about it ruby i wont have you go and throw yourself into the gutternot while youre with me  whos throwing themselves into the gutter ive thrown myself into no gutter i know what im about  theres two of us that way rubyfor i know what im about  i shall just go then and ruby walked off towards the door  you wont get out that way any way for the doors lockedand the area gate youd better be said ruby and just take your things off  poor ruby for the moment was struck dumb with mortification mrs pipkin had given her credit for more outrageous perseverance than she possessed and had feared that she would rattle at the front door or attempt to climb over the area gate she was a little afraid of ruby not feeling herself justified in holding absolute dominion over her as over a servant and though she was now determined in her conductbeing fully resolved to surrender neither of the keys which she held in her pocketstill she feared that she might so far collapse as to fall away into tears should ruby be violent but ruby was crushed her lover would be there to meet her and the appointment would be broken by her aunt pipkin she said let me go just this once  no rubyit aint proper  you dont know what youre a doing of aunt you dont youll ruin meyou will dear aunt pipkin do do ill never ask again if you dont like  mrs pipkin had not expected this and was almost willing to yield but mr carbury had spoken so very plainly it aint the thing ruby and i wont do it  and im to bea prisoner what have i done to bea prisoner i dont believe as youve any right to lock me up  ive a right to lock my own doors  then i shall go away tomorrow  i cant help that my dear the door will be open tomorrow if you choose to go out  then why not open it tonight wheres the difference but mrs pipkin was stern and ruby in a flood of tears took herself up to her garret  mrs pipkin knocked at mrs hurtles door again shes gone to bed she said  im glad to hear it there wasnt any noise about itwas there  not as i expected mrs hurtle certainly but she was put out a bit poor girl ive been a girl too and used to like a bit of outing as well as any oneand a dance too only it was always when mother knew she aint got a mother poor dear and as good as no father and shes got it into her head that shes that pretty that a great gentleman will marry her  she is pretty  but whats beauty mrs hurtle its no more nor skin deep as the scriptures tell us and whatd a grand gentleman see in ruby to marry her she says shell leave tomorrow  and where will she go  just nowhere after this gentlemanand you know what that means youre going to be married yourself mrs hurtle  we wont mind about that now mrs pipkin  and thisll be your second and you know how these things are managed no gentlemanll marry her because she runs after him girls as knows what theyre about should let the gentlemen run after them thats my way of looking at it  dont you think they should be equal in that respect  anyways the girls shouldnt let on as they are running after the gentlemen a gentlemen goes here and he goes there and he speaks up free of course in my time girls usent to do that but then maybe im oldfashioned added mrs pipkin thinking of the new dispensation  i suppose girls do speak for themselves more than they did formerly  a deal more mrs hurtle quite different you hear them talk of spooning with this fellow and spooning with that fellowand that before their very fathers and mothers when i was young we used to do it i supposeonly not like that  you did it on the sly  i think we got married quicker than they do anyway when the gentlemen had to take more trouble they thought more about it but if you wouldnt mind speaking to ruby tomorrow mrs hurtle shed listen to you when she wouldnt mind a word i said to her i dont want her to go away from this out into the street till she knows where shes to go to decent as for going to her young manthats just walking the streets  mrs hurtle promised that she would speak to ruby though when making the promise she could not but think of her unfitness for the task she knew nothing of the country she had not a single friend in it but paul montagueand she had run after him with as little discretion as ruby ruggles was showing in running after her lover who was she that she should take upon herself to give advice to any female  she had not sent her letter to paul but she still kept it in her pocketbook at some moments she thought that she would send it and at others she told herself that she would never surrender this last hope till every stone had been turned it might still be possible to shame him into a marriage she had returned from lowestoft on the monday and had made some trivial excuse to mrs pipkin in her mildest voice the place had been windy and too cold for herand she had not liked the hotel mrs pipkin was very glad to see her back again     chapter xlix  sir felix makes himself ready   sir felix when he promised to meet ruby at the music hall on the tuesday was under an engagement to start with marie melmotte for new york on the thursday following and to go down to liverpool on the wednesday there was no reason he thought why he should not enjoy himself to the last and he would say a parting word to poor little ruby the details of his journey were settled between him and marie with no inconsiderable assistance from didon in the garden of grosvenor square on the previous sundaywhere the lovers had again met during the hours of morning service sir felix had been astonished at the completion of the preparations which had been made mind you go by the 5 pm train marie said that will take you into liverpool at 1015 theres an hotel at the railway station didon has got our tickets under the names of madame and mademoiselle racine we are to have one cabin between us you must get yours tomorrow she has found out that there is plenty of room  ill be all right  pray dont miss the train that afternoon somebody would be sure to suspect something if we were seen together in the same train we leave at 7 am i shant go to bed all night so as to be sure to be in time roberthes the manwill start a little earlier in the cab with my heavy box what do you think is in it  clothes suggested felix  yes but what clothesmy wedding dresses think of that what a job to get them and nobody to know anything about it except didon and madame craik at the shop in mount street they havent come yet but i shall be there whether they come or not and i shall have all my jewels im not going to leave them behind theyll go off in our cab we can get the things out behind the house into the mews then didon and i follow in another cab nobody ever is up before near nine and i dont think we shall be interrupted  if the servants were to hear  i dont think theyd tell but if i was to be brought back again i should only tell papa that it was no good he cant prevent me marrying  wont your mother find out  she never looks after anything i dont think shed tell if she knew papa leads her such a life felix i hope you wont be like thatand she looked up into his face and thought that it would be impossible that he should be  im all right said felix feeling very uncomfortable at the time this great effort of his life was drawing very near there had been a pleasurable excitement in talking of running away with the great heiress of the day but now that the deed had to be executedand executed after so novel and stupendous a fashion he almost wished that he had not undertaken it it must have been much nicer when men ran away with their heiresses only as far as gretna green and even goldsheiner with lady julia had nothing of a job in comparison with this which he was expected to perform and then if they should be wrong about the girls fortune he almost repented he did repent but he had not the courage to recede how about money though he said hoarsely  you have got some  i have just the two hundred pounds which your father paid me and not a shilling more i dont see why he should keep my money and not let me have it back  look here said marie and she put her hand into her pocket i told you i thought i could get some there is a cheque for two hundred and fifty pounds i had money of my own enough for the tickets  and whose is this said felix taking the bit of paper with much trepidation  it is papas cheque mamma gets ever so many of them to carry on the house and pay for things but she gets so muddled about it that she doesnt know what she pays and what she doesnt felix looked at the cheque and saw that it was payable to house or bearer and that it was signed by augustus melmotte if you take it to the bank youll get the money said marie or shall i send didon and give you the money on board the ship  felix thought over the matter very anxiously if he did go on the journey he would much prefer to have the money in his own pocket he liked the feeling of having money in his pocket perhaps if didon were entrusted with the cheque she also would like the feeling but then might it not be possible that if he presented the cheque himself he might be arrested for stealing melmottes money i think didon had better get the money he said and bring it to me tomorrow at four oclock in the afternoon to the club if the money did not come he would not go down to liverpool nor would he be at the expense of his ticket for new york you see he said im so much in the city that they might know me at the bank to this arrangement marie assented and took back the cheque and then ill come on board on thursday morning he said without looking for you  oh dear yeswithout looking for us and dont know us even till we are out at sea wont it be fun when we shall be walking about on the deck and not speaking to one another and felixwhat do you think didon has found out that there is to be an american clergyman on board i wonder whether hed marry us  of course he will  wont that be jolly i wish it was all done then directly its done and when we get to new york well telegraph and write to papa and well be ever so penitent and good wont we of course hell make the best of it  but hes so savage isnt he  when theres anything to getor just at the moment but i dont think he minds afterwards hes always for making the best of everything misfortunes and all things go wrong so often that if he was to go on thinking of them always theyd be too many for anybody itll be all right in a months time i wonder how lord nidderdale will look when he hears that weve gone off i should so like to see him he never can say that ive behaved bad to him we were engaged but it was he broke it do you know felix that though we were engaged to be married and everybody knew it he never once kissed me felix at this moment almost wished that he had never done so as to what the other man had done he cared nothing at all  then they parted with the understanding that they were not to see each other again till they met on board the boat all arrangements were made but felix was determined that he would not stir in the matter unless didon brought him the full sum of £250 and he almost thought and indeed hoped that she would not either she would be suspected at the bank and apprehended or she would run off with the money on her own account when she got itor the cheque would have been missed and the payment stopped some accident would occur and then he would be able to recede from his undertaking he would do nothing till after monday afternoon  should he tell his mother that he was going his mother had clearly recommended him to run away with the girl and must therefore approve of the measure his mother would understand how great would be the expense of such a trip and might perhaps add something to his stock of money he determined that he could tell his motherthat is if didon should bring him full change for the cheque  he walked into the beargarden exactly at four oclock on the monday and there he found didon standing in the hall his heart sank within him as he saw her now must he certainly go to new york she made him a little curtsey and without a word handed him an envelope soft and fat with rich enclosures he bade her wait a moment and going into a little waitingroom counted the notes the money was all therethe full sum of £250 he must certainly go to new york cest tout èn regle said didon in a whisper as he returned to the hall sir felix nodded his head and didon took her departure  yes he must go now he had melmottes money in his pocket and was therefore bound to run away with melmottes daughter it was a great trouble to him as he reflected that melmotte had more of his money than he had of melmottes and now how should he dispose of his time before he went gambling was too dangerous even he felt that where would he be were he to lose his ready money he would dine that night at the club and in the evening go up to his mother on the tuesday he would take his place for new york in the city and would spend the evening with ruby at the music hall on the wednesday he would start for liverpoolaccording to his instructions he felt annoyed that he had been so fully instructed but should the affair turn out well nobody would know that all the fellows would give him credit for the audacity with which he had carried off the heiress to america  at ten oclock he found his mother and hetta in welbeck street what felix exclaimed lady carbury  youre surprised are you not then he threw himself into a chair mother he said would you mind coming into the other room lady carbury of course went with him ive got something to tell you he said  good news she asked clasping her hands together from his manner she thought that it was good news money had in some way come into his handsor at any rate a prospect of money  thats as may be he said and then he paused  dont keep me in suspense felix  the long and the short of it is that im going to take marie off  oh felix  you said you thought it was the right thing to doand therefore im going to do it the worst of it is that one wants such a lot of money for this kind of thing  but when  immediately i wouldnt tell you till i had arranged everything ive had it in my mind for the last fortnight  and how is it to be oh felix i hope it may succeed  it was your own idea you know were going towhere do you think  how can i thinkboulogne  you say that just because goldsheiner went there that wouldnt have done at all for us were going tonew york  to new york but when will you be married  there will be a clergyman on board its all fixed i wouldnt go without telling you  oh i wish you hadnt told me  come nowthats kind you dont mean to say it wasnt you that put me up to it ive got to get my things ready  of course if you tell me that you are going on a journey i will have your clothes got ready for you when do you start  wednesday afternoon  for new york we must get some things readymade oh felix how will it be if he does not forgive her he attempted to laugh when i spoke of such a thing as possible he had not sworn then that he would never give her a shilling  they always say that  you are going to risk it  i am going to take your advice this was dreadful to the poor mother there is money settled on her  settled on whom  on mariemoney which he cant get back again  how much  she doesnt knowbut a great deal enough for them all to live upon if things went amiss with them  but thats only a form felix that money cant be her own to give to her husband  melmotte will find that it is unless he comes to terms thats the pull weve got over him marie knows what shes about shes a great deal sharper than any one would take her to be what can you do for me about money mother  i have none felix  i thought youd be sure to help me as you wanted me so much to do it  thats not true felix i didnt want you to do it oh i am so sorry that that word ever passed my mouth i have no money there isnt £20 at the bank altogether  they would let you overdraw for £50 or £60  i will not do it i will not starve myself and hetta you had ever so much money only lately i will get some things for you and pay for them as i can if you cannot pay for them after your marriagebut i have not money to give you  thats a blue lookout said he turning himself in his chair just when £60 or £70 might make a fellow for life you could borrow it from your friend broune  i will do no such thing felix £50 or £60 would make very little difference in the expense of such a trip as this i suppose you have some money  someyes some but im so short that any little thing would help me before the evening was over she absolutely did give him a cheque for £30 although she had spoken the truth in saying that she had not so much at her bankers  after this he went back to his club although he himself understood the danger he could not bear the idea of going to bed quietly at home at halfpast ten he got into a cab and was very soon up in the cardroom he found nobody there and went to the smokingroom where dolly longestaffe and miles grendall were sitting silently together with pipes in their mouths heres carbury said dolly waking suddenly into life now we can have a game at threehanded loo  thank ye not for me said sir felix i hate threehanded loo  dummy suggested dolly  i dont think ill play tonight old fellow i hate three fellows sticking down together miles sat silent smoking his pipe conscious of the baronets dislike to play with him bytheby grendall look here and sir felix in his most friendly tone whispered into his enemys ear a petition that some of the ious might be converted into cash  pon my word i must ask you to wait till next week said miles  its always waiting till next week with you said sir felix getting up and standing with his back to the fireplace there were other men in the room and this was said so that every one should hear it i wonder whether any fellow would buy these for five shillings in the pound and he held up the scraps of paper in his hand he had been drinking freely before he went up to welbeck street and had taken a glass of brandy on reentering the club  dont lets have any of that kind of thing down here said dolly if there is to be a row about cards let it be in the cardroom  of course said miles i wont say a word about the matter down here it isnt the proper thing  come up into the cardroom then said sir felix getting up from his chair it seems to me that it makes no difference to you what room youre in come up now and dolly longestaffe shall come and hear what you say but miles grendall objected to this arrangement he was not going up into the cardroom that night as no one was going to play he would be there tomorrow and then if sir felix carbury had anything to say he could say it  how i do hate a row said dolly one has to have rows with ones own people but there ought not to be rows at a club  he likes a rowcarbury does said miles  i should like my money if i could get it said sir felix walking out of the room  on the next day he went into the city and changed his mothers cheque this was done after a little hesitation the money was given to him but a gentleman from behind the desks begged him to remind lady carbury that she was overdrawing her account dear dear said sir felix as he pocketed the notes im sure she was unaware of it then he paid for his passage from liverpool to new york under the name of walter jones and felt as he did so that the intrigue was becoming very deep this was on tuesday he dined again at the club alone and in the evening went to the music hall there he remained from ten till nearly twelve very angry at the nonappearance of ruby ruggles as he smoked and drank in solitude he almost made up his mind that he had intended to tell her of his departure for new york of course he would have done no such thing but now should she ever complain on that head he would have his answer ready he had devoted his last night in england to the purpose of telling her and she had broken her appointment everything would now be her fault whatever might happen to her she could not blame him  having waited till he was sick of the music hallfor a music hall without ladies society must be somewhat dullhe went back to his club he was very cross as brave as brandy could make him and well inclined to expose miles grendall if he could find an opportunity up in the cardroom he found all the accustomed menwith the exception of miles grendall nidderdale grasslough dolly paul montague and one or two others were there there was at any rate comfort in the idea of playing without having to encounter the dead weight of miles grendall ready money was on the tableand there was none of the peculiar beargarden paper flying about indeed the men at the beargarden had become sick of paper and there had been formed a halfexpressed resolution that the play should be somewhat lower but the payments punctual the ious had been nearly all converted into moneywith the assistance of herr vossnerexcepting those of miles grendall the resolution mentioned did not refer back to grendalls former indebtedness but was intended to include a clause that he must in future pay ready money nidderdale had communicated to him the determination of the committee bygones are bygones old fellow but you really must stump up you know after this miles had declared that he would stump up but on this occasion miles was absent  at three oclock in the morning sir felix had lost over a hundred pounds in ready money on the following night about one he had lost a further sum of two hundred pounds the reader will remember that he should at that time have been in the hotel at liverpool  but sir felix as he played on in the almost desperate hope of recovering the money which he so greatly needed remembered how fisker had played all night and how he had gone off from the club to catch the early train for liverpool and how he had gone on to new york without delay     chapter l  the journey to liverpool   marie melmotte as she had promised sat up all night as did also the faithful didon i think that to marie the night was full of pleasure or at any rate of pleasurable excitement with her door locked she packed and unpacked and repacked her treasureshaving more than once laid out on the bed the dress in which she purposed to be married she asked didon her opinion whether that american clergyman of whom they had heard would marry them on board and whether in that event the dress would be fit for the occasion didon thought that the man if sufficiently paid would marry them and that the dress would not much signify she scolded her young mistress very often during the night for what she called nonsense but was true to her and worked hard for her they determined to go without food in the morning so that no suspicion should be raised by the use of cups and plates they could get refreshment at the railwaystation  at six they started robert went first with the big boxes having his ten pounds already in his pocketand marie and didon with smaller luggage followed in a second cab no one interfered with them and nothing went wrong the very civil man at euston square gave them their tickets and even attempted to speak to them in french they had quite determined that not a word of english was to be spoken by marie till the ship was out at sea at the station they got some very bad tea and almost uneatable foodbut maries restrained excitement was so great that food was almost unnecessary to her they took their seats without any impedimentand then they were off  during a great part of the journey they were alone and then marie gabbled to didon about her hopes and her future career and all the things she would dohow she had hated lord nidderdaleespecially when after she had been awed into accepting him he had given her no token of lovepas un baiser didon suggested that such was the way with english lords she herself had preferred lord nidderdale but had been willing to join in the present planas she said from devoted affection to marie marie went on to say that nidderdale was ugly and that sir felix was as beautiful as the morning bah exclaimed didon who was really disgusted that such considerations should prevail didon had learned in some indistinct way that lord nidderdale would be a marquis and would have a castle whereas sir felix would never be more than sir felix and of his own would never have anything at all she had striven with her mistress but her mistress liked to have a will of her own didon no doubt had thought that new york with £50 and other perquisites in hand might offer her a new career she had therefore yielded but even now could hardly forbear from expressing disgust at the folly of her mistress marie bore it with imperturbable good humour she was running awayand was running to a distant continentand her lover would be with her she gave didon to understand that she cared nothing for marquises  as they drew near to liverpool didon explained that they must still be very careful it would not do for them to declare at once their destination on the platformso that every one about the station should know that they were going on board the packet for new york they had time enough they must leisurely look for the big boxes and other things and need say nothing about the steam packet till they were in a cab maries big box was directed simply madame racine passenger to liverpoolso also was directed a second box nearly as big which was didons property didon declared that her anxiety would not be over till she found the ship moving under her marie was sure that all their dangers were overif only sir felix was safe on board poor marie sir felix was at this moment in welbeck street striving to find temporary oblivion for his distressing situation and loss of money and some alleviation for his racking temples beneath the bedclothes  when the train ran into the station at liverpool the two women sat for a few moments quite quiet they would not seek remark by any hurry or noise the door was opened and a wellmannered porter offered to take their luggage didon handed out the various packages keeping however the jewelcase in her own hands she left the carriage first and then marie but marie had hardly put her foot on the platform before a gentleman addressed her touching his hat you i think are miss melmotte marie was struck dumb but said nothing didon immediately became voluble in french no the young lady was not miss melmotte the young lady was mademoiselle racine her niece she was madame racine melmotte what was melmotte they knew nothing about melmottes would the gentleman kindly allow them to pass on to their cab  but the gentleman would by no means kindly allow them to pass on to their cab with the gentleman was another gentlemanwho did not seem to be quite so much of a gentlemanand again not far in the distance didon quickly espied a policeman who did not at present connect himself with the affair but who seemed to have his time very much at command and to be quite ready if he were wanted didon at once gave up the gameas regarded her mistress  i am afraid i must persist in asserting that you are miss melmotte said the gentleman and that this otherperson is your servant elise didon you speak english miss melmotte marie declared that she spoke french and english too said the gentleman i think you had better make up your minds to go back to london i will accompany you  ah didon nous sommes perdues exclaimed marie didon plucking up her courage for the moment asserted the legality of her own position and of that of her mistress they had both a right to come to liverpool they had both a right to get into the cab with their luggage nobody had a right to stop them they had done nothing against the laws why were they to be stopped in this way what was it to anybody whether they called themselves melmotte or racine  the gentleman understood the french oratory but did not commit himself to reply in the same language you had better trust yourself to me you had indeed said the gentleman  but why demanded marie  then the gentleman spoke in a very low voice a cheque has been changed which you took from your fathers house no doubt your father will pardon that when you are once with him but in order that we may bring you back safely we can arrest you on the score of the cheque if you force us to do so we certainly shall not let you go on board if you will travel back to london with me you shall be subjected to no inconvenience which can be avoided  there was certainly no help to be found anywhere it may be well doubted whether upon the whole the telegraph has not added more to the annoyances than to the comforts of life and whether the gentlemen who spent all the public money without authority ought not to have been punished with special severity in that they had injured humanity rather than pardoned because of the good they had produced who is benefited by telegrams the newspapers are robbed of all their old interest and the very soul of intrigue is destroyed poor marie when she heard her fate would certainly have gladly hanged mr scudamore  when the gentleman had made his speech she offered no further opposition looking into didons face and bursting into tears she sat down on one of the boxes but didon became very clamorous on her own behalfand her clamour was successful who was going to stop her what had she done why should not she go where she pleased did anybody mean to take her up for stealing anybodys money if anybody did that person had better look to himself she knew the law she would go where she pleased so saying she began to tug the rope of her box as though she intended to drag it by her own force out of the station the gentleman looked at his telegramlooked at another document which he now held in his hand ready prepared should it be wanted elise didon had been accused of nothing that brought her within the law the gentleman in imperfect french suggested that didon had better return with her mistress but didon clamoured only the more no she would go to new york she would go wherever she pleasedall the world over nobody should stop her then she addressed herself in what little english she could command to halfadozen cabmen who were standing round and enjoying the scene they were to take her trunk at once she had money and she could pay she started off to the nearest cab and no one stopped her but the box in her hand is mine said marie not forgetting her trinkets in her misery didon surrendered the jewelcase and ensconced herself in the cab without a word of farewell and her trunk was hoisted on to the roof then she was driven away out of the stationand out of our story she had a firstclass cabin all to herself as far as new york but what may have been her fate after that it matters not to us to enquire  poor marie we who know how recreant a knight sir felix had proved himself who are aware that had miss melmotte succeeded in getting on board the ship she would have passed an hour of miserable suspense looking everywhere for her lover and would then at last have been carried to new york without him may congratulate her on her escape and indeed we who know his character better than she did may still hope in her behalf that she may be ultimately saved from so wretched a marriage but to her her present position was truly miserable she would have to encounter an enraged father and whenwhen should she see her lover again poor poor felix what would be his feelings when he should find himself on his way to new york without his love but in one matter she made up her mind steadfastly she would be true to him they might chop her in pieces yesshe had said it before and she would say it again there was however doubt in her mind from time to time whether one course might not be better even than constancy if she could contrive to throw herself out of the carriage and to be killedwould not that be the best termination to her present disappointment would not that be the best punishment for her father but how then would it be with poor felix after all i dont know that he cares for me she said to herself thinking over it all  the gentleman was very kind to her not treating her at all as though she were disgraced as they got near town he ventured to give her a little advice put a good face on it he said and dont be cast down  oh i wont she answered i dont mean  your mother will be delighted to have you back again  i dont think that mamma cares its papa id do it again tomorrow if i had the chance the gentleman looked at her not having expected so much determination i would why is a girl to be made to marry to please any one but herself i wont and its very mean saying that i stole the money i always take what i want and papa never says anything about it  two hundred and fifty pounds is a large sum miss melmotte  it is nothing in our house it isnt about the money its because papa wants me to marry another manand i wont it was downright mean to send and have me taken up before all the people  you wouldnt have come back if he hadnt done that  of course i wouldnt said marie  the gentleman had telegraphed up to grosvenor square while on the journey and at euston square they were met by one of the melmotte carriages marie was to be taken home in the carriage and the box was to follow in a cabto follow at some interval so that grosvenor square might not be aware of what had taken place grosvenor square of course very soon knew all about it and are you to come marie asked speaking to the gentleman the gentleman replied that he had been requested to see miss melmotte home all the people will wonder who you are said marie laughing then the gentleman thought that miss melmotte would be able to get through her troubles without much suffering  when she got home she was hurried up at once to her mothers roomand there she found her father alone this is your game is it said he looking down at her  well papayes you made me do it  you fool you you were going to new yorkwere you to this she vouchsafed no reply as if i hadnt found out all about it who was going with you  if you have found out all about it you know papa  of course i knowbut you dont know all about it you little idiot  no doubt im a fool and an idiot you always say so  where do you suppose sir felix carbury is now then she opened her eyes and looked at him an hour ago he was in bed at his mothers house in welbeck street  i dont believe it papa  you dont dont you youll find it true if you had gone to new york youd have gone alone if id known at first that he had stayed behind i think id have let you go  im sure he didnt stay behind  if you contradict me ill box your ears you jade he is in london at this moment what has become of the woman that went with you  shes gone on board the ship  and where is the money you took from your mother marie was silent who got the cheque changed  didon did  and has she got the money  no papa  have you got it  no papa  did you give it to sir felix carbury  yes papa  then ill be hanged if i dont prosecute him for stealing it  oh papa dont do thatpray dont do that he didnt steal it i only gave it him to take care of for us hell give it you back again  i shouldnt wonder if he lost it at cards and therefore didnt go to liverpool will you give me your word that youll never attempt to marry him again if i dont prosecute him marie considered unless you do that i shall go to a magistrate at once  i dont believe you can do anything to him he didnt steal it i gave it to him  will you promise me  no papa i wont whats the good of promising when i should only break it why cant you let me have the man i love whats the good of all the money if people dont have what they like  all the moneywhat do you know about the money look here and he took her by the arm ive been very good to you youve had your share of everything that has been goingcarriages and horses bracelets and brooches silks and gloves and every thing else he held her very hard and shook her as he spoke  let me go papa you hurt me i never asked for such things i dont care a straw about bracelets and brooches  what do you care for  only for somebody to love me said marie looking down  youll soon have nobody to love you if you go on this fashion youve had everything done for you and if you dont do something for me in return by g you shall have a hard time of it if you werent such a fool youd believe me when i say that i know more than you do  you cant know better than me whatll make me happy  do you think only of yourself if youll marry lord nidderdale youll have a position in the world which nothing can take from you  then i wont said marie firmly upon this he shook her till she cried and calling for madame melmotte desired his wife not to let the girl for one minute out of her presence  the condition of sir felix was i think worse than that of the lady with whom he was to have run away he had played at the beargarden till four in the morning and had then left the club on the breakingup of the cardtable intoxicated and almost penniless during the last half hour he had made himself very unpleasant at the club saying all manner of harsh things of miles grendallof whom indeed it was almost impossible to say things too hard had they been said in a proper form and at a proper time he declared that grendall would not pay his debts that he had cheated when playing looas to which sir felix appealed to dolly longestaffe and he ended by asserting that grendall ought to be turned out of the club they had a desperate row dolly of course had said that he knew nothing about it and lord grasslough had expressed an opinion that perhaps more than one person ought to be turned out at four oclock the party was broken up and sir felix wandered forth into the streets with nothing more than the change of a ten pound note in his pocket all his luggage was lying in the hall of the club and there he left it  there could hardly have been a more miserable wretch than sir felix wandering about the streets of london that night though he was nearly drunk he was not drunk enough to forget the condition of his affairs there is an intoxication that makes merry in the midst of affliction and there is an intoxication that banishes affliction by producing oblivion but again there is an intoxication which is conscious of itself though it makes the feet unsteady and the voice thick and the brain foolish and which brings neither mirth nor oblivion sir felix trying to make his way to welbeck street and losing it at every turn feeling himself to be an object of ridicule to every wanderer and of dangerous suspicion to every policeman got no good at all out of his intoxication what had he better do with himself he fumbled in his pocket and managed to get hold of his ticket for new york should he still make the journey then he thought of his luggage and could not remember where it was at last as he steadied himself against a letterpost he was able to call to mind that his portmanteaus were at the club by this time he had wandered into marylebone lane but did not in the least know where he was but he made an attempt to get back to his club and stumbled half down bond street then a policeman enquired into his purposes and when he said that he lived in welbeck street walked back with him as far as oxford street having once mentioned the place where he lived he had not strength of will left to go back to his purpose of getting his luggage and starting for liverpool  between six and seven he was knocking at the door in welbeck street he had tried his latchkey but had found it inefficient as he was supposed to be at liverpool the door had in fact been locked at last it was opened by lady carbury herself he had fallen more than once and was soiled with the gutter most of my readers will not probably know how a man looks when he comes home drunk at six in the morning but they who have seen the thing will acknowledge that a sorrier sight cannot meet a mothers eye than that of a son in such a condition oh felix she exclaimed  itsh all up he said stumbling in  what has happened felix  discovered and be d to it the old shapsh stopped ush drunk as he was he was able to lie at that moment the old shap was fast asleep in grosvenor square altogether ignorant of the plot and marie joyful with excitement was getting into the cab in the mews bettersh go to bed and so he stumbled upstairs by daylight the wretched mother helping him she took off his clothes for him and his boots and having left him already asleep she went down to her own room a miserable woman     chapter li  which shall it be   paul montague reached london on his return from suffolk early on the monday morning and on the following day he wrote to mrs hurtle as he sat in his lodgings thinking of his condition he almost wished that he had taken melmottes offer and gone to mexico he might at any rate have endeavoured to promote the railway earnestly and then have abandoned it if he found the whole thing false in such case of course he would never have seen hetta carbury again but as things were of what use to him was his loveof what use to him or to her the kind of life of which he dreamed such a life in england as was that of roger carbury or as such life would be if roger had a wife whom he loved seemed to be far beyond his reach nobody was like roger carbury would it not be well that he should go away and as he went write to hetta and bid her marry the best man that ever lived in the world  but the journey to mexico was no longer open to him he had repudiated the proposition and had quarrelled with melmotte it was necessary that he should immediately take some further step in regard to mrs hurtle twice lately he had gone to islington determined that he would see that lady for the last time then he had taken her to lowestoft and had been equally firm in his resolution that he would there put an end to his present bonds now he had promised to go again to islingtonand was aware that if he failed to keep his promise she would come to him in this way there would never be an end to it  he would certainly go again as he had promisedif she should still require it but he would first try what a letter would doa plain unvarnished tale might it still be possible that a plain tale sent by post should have sufficient efficacy this was his plain tale as he now told it      tuesday 2nd july 1873     my dear mrs hurtle     i promised that i would go to you again in islington and so i    will if you still require it but i think that such a meeting    can be of no service to either of us what is to be gained i do    not for a moment mean to justify my own conduct it is not to be    justified when i met you on our journey hither from san    francisco i was charmed with your genius your beauty and your    character they are now what i found them to be then but    circumstances have made our lives and temperaments so far    different that i am certain that were we married we should    not make each other happy of course the fault was mine but it    is better to own that fault and to take all the blameand    the evil consequences let them be what they may to be shot    for instance like the gentleman in oregon than to be married    with the consciousness that even at the very moment of the    ceremony such marriage will be a matter of sorrow and    repentance as soon as my mind was made up on this i wrote to    you i can noti dare notblame you for the step you have    since taken but i can only adhere to the resolution i then    expressed     the first day i saw you here in london you asked me whether i    was attached to another woman i could answer you only by the    truth but i should not of my own accord have spoken to you of    altered affections it was after i had resolved to break my    engagement with you that i first knew this girl it was not    because i had come to love her that i broke it i have no    grounds whatever for hoping that my love will lead to any    results     i have now told you as exactly as i can the condition of my    mind if it were possible for me in any way to compensate the    injury i have done youor even to undergo retribution for    iti would do so but what compensation can be given or what    retribution can you exact i think that our further meeting can    avail nothing but if after this you wish me to come again i    will come for the last timebecause i have promised     your most sincere friend     paul montague   mrs hurtle as she read this was torn in two ways all that paul had written was in accordance with the words written by herself on a scrap of paper which she still kept in her own pocket those words fairly transcribed on a sheet of notepaper would be the most generous and the fittest answer she could give and she longed to be generous she had all a womans natural desire to sacrifice herself but the sacrifice which would have been most to her taste would have been of another kind had she found him ruined and penniless she would have delighted to share with him all that she possessed had she found him a cripple or blind or miserably struck with some disease she would have stayed by him and have nursed him and given him comfort even had he been disgraced she would have fled with him to some far country and have pardoned all his faults no sacrifice would have been too much for her that would have been accompanied by a feeling that he appreciated all that she was doing for him and that she was loved in return but to sacrifice herself by going away and never more being heard of was too much for her what woman can endure such sacrifice as that to give up not only her love but her wrath alsothat was too much for her the idea of being tame was terrible to her her life had not been very prosperous but she was what she was because she had dared to protect herself by her own spirit now at last should she succumb and be trodden on like a worm should she be weaker even than an english girl should she allow him to have amused himself with her love to have had a good time and then to roam away like a bee while she was so dreadfully scorched so mutilated and punished had not her whole life been opposed to the theory of such passive endurance she took out the scrap of paper and read it and in spite of all she felt that there was a feminine softness in it that gratified her  but noshe could not send it she could not even copy the words and so she gave play to all her strongest feelings on the other side being in truth torn in two directions then she sat herself down to her desk and with rapid words and flashing thoughts wrote as follows      paul montague     i have suffered many injuries but of all injuries this is the    worst and most unpardonableand the most unmanly surely there    never was such a coward never so false a liar the poor wretch    that i destroyed was mad with liquor and was only acting after    his kind even caradoc hurtle never premeditated such wrong as    this what you are to bind yourself to me by the most solemn    obligation that can join a man and a woman together and then    tell mewhen they have affected my whole lifethat they are    to go for nothing because they do not suit your view of things    on thinking over it you find that an american wife would not    make you so comfortable as some english girland therefore it    is all to go for nothing i have no brother no man nearme or    you would not dare to do this you can not but be a coward     you talk of compensation do you mean money you do not dare to    say so but you must mean it it is an insult the more but as    to retribution yes you shall suffer retribution i desire you    to come to meaccording to your promiseand you will find me    with a horsewhip in my hand i will whip you till i have not a    breath in my body and then i will see what you will dare to    dowhether you will drag me into a court of law for the    assault     yes come you shall come and now you know the welcome you    shall find i will buy the whip while this is reaching you and    you shall find that i know how to choose such a weapon i call    upon you so come but should you be afraid and break your    promise i will come to you i will make london too hot to hold    youand if i do not find you i will go with my story to every    friend you have     i have now told you as exactly as i can the condition of my    mind     winifred hurtle   having written this she again read the short note and again gave way to violent tears but on that day she sent no letter on the following morning she wrote a third and sent that this was the third letter  yes come        w h  this letter duly reached paul montague at his lodgings he started immediately for islington he had now no desire to delay the meeting he had at any rate taught her that his gentleness towards her his going to the play with her and drinking tea with her at mrs pipkins and his journey with her to the sea were not to be taken as evidence that he was gradually being conquered he had declared his purpose plainly enough at lowestoftand plainly enough in his last letter she had told him down at the hotel that had she by chance have been armed at the moment she would have shot him she could arm herself now if she pleasedbut his real fear had not lain in that direction the pang consisted in having to assure her that he was resolved to do her wrong the worst of that was now over  the door was opened for him by ruby who by no means greeted him with a happy countenance it was the second morning after the night of her imprisonment and nothing had occurred to alleviate her woe at this very moment her lover should have been in liverpool but he was in fact abed in welbeck street yes sir shes at home said ruby with a baby in her arms and a little child hanging on to her dress dont pull so sally please sir is sir felix still in london ruby had written to sir felix the very night of her imprisonment but had not as yet received any reply paul whose mind was altogether intent on his own troubles declared that at present he knew nothing about sir felix and was then shown into mrs hurtles room  so you have come she said without rising from her chair  of course i came when you desired it  i dont know why you should my wishes do not seem to affect you much will you sit down there she said pointing to a seat at some distance from herself so you think it would be best that you and i should never see each other again she was very calm but it seemed to him that the quietness was assumed and that at any moment it might be converted into violence he thought that there was that in her eye which seemed to foretell the spring of the wildcat  i did think so certainly what more can i say  oh nothing clearly nothing her voice was very low why should a gentleman trouble himself to say any more than that he has changed his mind why make a fuss about such little things as a womans life or a womans heart then she paused and having come in consequence of my unreasonable request of course you are wise to hold your peace  i came because i promised  but you did not promise to speakdid you  what would you have me say  ah what am i to be so weak as to tell you now what i would have you say suppose you were to say i am a gentleman and a man of my word and i repent me of my intended perfidy do you not think you might get your release that way might it not be possible that i should reply that as your heart was gone from me your hand might go after itthat i scorned to be the wife of a man who did not want me as she asked this she gradually raised her voice and half lifted herself in her seat stretching herself towards him  you might indeed he replied not well knowing what to say  but i should not i at least will be true i should take you paul still take you with a confidence that i should yet win you to me by my devotion i have still some kindness of feeling towards younone to that woman who is i suppose younger than i and gentler and a maid she still looked as though she expected a reply but there was nothing to be said in answer to this now that you are going to leave me paul is there any advice you can give me as to what i shall do next i have given up every friend in the world for you i have no home mrs pipkins room here is more my home than any other spot on the earth i have all the world to choose from but no reason whatever for a choice i have my property what shall i do with it paul if i could die and be no more heard of you should be welcome to it there was no answer possible to all this the questions were asked because there was no answer possible you might at any rate advise me paul you are in some degree responsibleare you notfor my loneliness  i am but you know that i cannot answer your questions  you cannot wonder that i should be somewhat in doubt as to my future life as far as i can see i had better remain here i do good at any rate to mrs pipkin she went into hysterics yesterday when i spoke of leaving her that woman paul would starve in our country and i shall be desolate in this then she paused and there was absolute silence for a minute you thought my letter very short did you not  it said i suppose all you had to say  no indeed i did have much more to say that was the third letter i wrote now you shall see the other two i wrote three and had to choose which i would send you i fancy that yours to me was easier written than either one of mine you had no doubts you know i had many doubts i could not send them all by post together but you may see them all now there is one you may read that first while i was writing it i was determined that that should go then she handed him the sheet of paper which contained the threat of the horsewhip  i am glad you did not send that he said  i meant it  but you have changed your mind  is there anything in it that seems to you to be unreasonable speak out and tell me  i am thinking of you not of myself  think of me then is there anything said there which the usage to which i have been subjected does not justify  you ask me questions which i cannot answer i do not think that under any provocation a woman should use a horsewhip  it is certainly more comfortable for gentlemenwho amuse themselvesthat women should have that opinion but upon my word i dont know what to say about that as long as there are men to fight for women it may be well to leave the fighting to the men but when a woman has no one to help her is she to bear everything without turning upon those who illuse her shall a woman be flayed alive because it is unfeminine in her to fight for her own skin what is the good of being feminine as you call it have you asked yourself that that men may be attracted i should say but if a woman finds that men only take advantage of her assumed weakness shall she not throw it off if she be treated as prey shall she not fight as a beast of prey oh noit is so unfeminine i also paul had thought of that the charm of womanly weakness presented itself to my mind in a soft momentand then i wrote this other letter you may as well see them all and so she handed him the scrap which had been written at lowestoft and he read that also  he could hardly finish it because of the tears which filled his eyes but having mastered its contents he came across the room and threw himself on his knees at her feet sobbing i have not sent it you know she said i only show it you that you may see how my mind has been at work  it hurts me more than the other he replied  nay i would not hurt younot at this moment sometimes i feel that i could tear you limb from limb so great is my disappointment so ungovernable my rage whywhy should i be such a victim why should life be an utter blank to me while you have everything before you there you have seen them all which will you have  i cannot now take that other as the expression of your mind  but it will be when you have left meand was when you were with me at the seaside and it was so i felt when i got your first letter in san francisco why should you kneel there you do not love me a man should kneel to a woman for love not for pardon but though she spoke thus she put her hand upon his forehead and pushed back his hair and looked into his face i wonder whether that other woman loves you i do not want an answer paul i suppose you had better go she took his hand and pressed it to her breast tell me one thing when you spoke ofcompensation did you meanmoney  no indeed no  i hope noti hope not that well therego you shall be troubled no more with winifred hurtle she took the sheet of paper which contained the threat of the horsewhip and tore it into scraps  and am i to keep the other he asked  no for what purpose would you have it to prove my weakness that also shall be destroyed but she took it and restored it to her pocketbook  goodbye my friend he said  nay this parting will not bear a farewell go and let there be no other word spoken and so he went  as soon as the front door was closed behind him she rang the bell and begged ruby to ask mrs pipkin to come to her mrs pipkin she said as soon as the woman had entered the room everything is over between me and mr montague she was standing upright in the middle of the room and as she spoke there was a smile on her face  lord a mercy said mrs pipkin holding up both her hands  as i have told you that i was to be married to him i think it right now to tell you that im not going to be married to him  and why notand he such a nice young manand quiet too  as to the why not i dont know that i am prepared to speak about that but it is so i was engaged to him  im well sure of that mrs hurtle  and now im no longer engaged to him thats all  dearie me and you going down to lowestoft with him and all mrs pipkin could not bear to think that she should hear no more of such an interesting story  we did go down to lowestoft together and we both came back not together and theres an end of it  im sure its not your fault mrs hurtle when a marriage is to be and doesnt come off it never is the ladys fault  theres an end of it mrs pipkin if you please we wont say anything more about it  and are you going to leave maam said mrs pipkin prepared to have her apron up to her eyes at a moments notice where should she get such another lodger as mrs hurtlea lady who not only did not inquire about victuals but who was always suggesting that the children should eat this pudding or finish that pie and who had never questioned an item in a bill since she had been in the house  well say nothing about that yet mrs pipkin then mrs pipkin gave utterance to so many assurances of sympathy and help that it almost seemed that she was prepared to guarantee to her lodger another lover in lieu of the one who was now dismissed     chapter lii  the results of love and wine   two three four and even five oclock still found sir felix carbury in bed on that fatal thursday more than once or twice his mother crept up to his room but on each occasion he feigned to be fast asleep and made no reply to her gentle words but his condition was one which only admits of short snatches of uneasy slumber from head to foot he was sick and ill and sore and could find no comfort anywhere to lie where he was trying by absolute quiescence to soothe the agony of his brows and to remember that as long as he lay there he would be safe from attack by the outer world was all the solace within his reach lady carbury sent the page up to him and to the page he was awake the boy brought him tea he asked for soda and brandy but there was none to be had and in his present condition he did not dare to hector about it till it was procured for him  the world surely was now all over to him he had made arrangements for running away with the great heiress of the day and had absolutely allowed the young lady to run away without him the details of their arrangement had been such that she absolutely would start upon her long journey across the ocean before she could find out that he had failed to keep his appointment melmottes hostility would be incurred by the attempt and hers by the failure then he had lost all his moneyand hers he had induced his poor mother to assist in raising a fund for himand even that was gone he was so cowed that he was afraid even of his mother and he could remember something but no details of some row at the clubbut still with a conviction on his mind that he had made the row ahwhen would he summon courage to enter the club again when could he show himself again anywhere all the world would know that marie melmotte had attempted to run off with him and that at the last moment he had failed her what lie could he invent to cover his disgrace and his clothes all his things were at the clubor he thought that they were not being quite certain whether he had not made some attempt to carry them off to the railway station he had heard of suicide if ever it could be well that a man should cut his own throat surely the time had come for him now but as this idea presented itself to him he simply gathered the clothes around him and tried to sleep the death of cato would hardly have for him persuasive charms  between five and six his mother again came up to him and when he appeared to sleep stood with her hand upon his shoulder there must be some end to this he must at any rate be fed she wretched woman had been sitting all daythinking of it as regarded her son himself his condition told his story with sufficient accuracy what might be the fate of the girl she could not stop to inquire she had not heard all the details of the proposed scheme but she had known that felix had proposed to be at liverpool on the wednesday night and to start on thursday for new york with the young lady and with the view of aiding him in his object she had helped him with money she had bought clothes for him and had been busy with hetta for two days preparing for his long journeyhaving told some lie to her own daughter as to the cause of her brothers intended journey he had not gone but had come drunk and degraded back to the house she had searched his pockets with less scruple than she had ever before felt and had found his ticket for the vessel and the few sovereigns which were left to him about him she could read the riddle plainly he had stayed at his club till he was drunk and had gambled away all his money when she had first seen him she had asked herself what further lie she should now tell to her daughter at breakfast there was instant need for some story mary says that felix came back this morning and that he has not gone at all hetta exclaimed the poor woman could not bring herself to expose the vices of the son to her daughter she could not say that he had stumbled into the house drunk at six oclock hetta no doubt had her own suspicions yes he has come back said lady carbury brokenhearted by her troubles it was some plan about the mexican railway i believe and has broken through he is very unhappy and not well i will see to him after that hetta had said nothing during the whole day and now about an hour before dinner lady carbury was standing by her sons bedside determined that he should speak to her  felix she saidspeak to me felixi know that you are awake he groaned and turned himself away from her burying himself further under the bedclothes you must get up for your dinner it is near six oclock  all right he said at last  what is the meaning of this felix you must tell me it must be told sooner or later i know you are unhappy you had better trust your mother  i am so sick mother  you will be better up what were you doing last night what has come of it all where are your things  at the clubyou had better leave me now and let sam come up to me sam was the page  i will leave you presently but felix you must tell me about this what has been done  it hasnt come off  but how has it not come off  i didnt get away whats the good of asking  you said this morning when you came in that mr melmotte had discovered it  did i then i suppose he has oh mother i wish i could die i dont see whats the use of anything i wont get up to dinner id rather stay here  you must have something to eat felix  sam can bring it me do let him get me some brandy and water im so faint and sick with all this that i can hardly bear myself i cant talk now if hell get me a bottle of soda water and some brandy ill tell you all about it then  where is the money felix  i paid it for the ticket said he with both his hands up to his head  then his mother again left him with the understanding that he was to be allowed to remain in bed till the next morning but that he was to give her some further explanation when he had been refreshed and invigorated after his own prescription the boy went out and got him soda water and brandy and meat was carried up to him and then he did succeed for a while in finding oblivion from his misery in sleep  is he ill mamma hetta asked  yes my dear  had you not better send for a doctor  no my dear he will be better tomorrow  mamma i think you would be happier if you would tell me everything  i cant said lady carbury bursting out into tears dont ask whats the good of asking it is all misery and wretchedness there is nothing to tellexcept that i am ruined  has he done anything mamma  no what should he have done how am i to know what he does he tells me nothing dont talk about it any more oh godhow much better it would be to be childless  oh mamma do you mean me said hetta rushing across the room and throwing herself close to her mothers side on the sofa mamma say that you do not mean me  it concerns you as well as me and him i wish i were childless  oh mamma do not be cruel to me am i not good to you do i not try to be a comfort to you  then marry your cousin roger carbury who is a good man and who can protect you you can at any rate find a home for yourself and a friend for us you are not like felix you do not get drunk and gamblebecause you are a woman but you are stiffnecked and will not help me in my trouble  shall i marry him mamma without loving him  love have i been able to love do you see much of what you call love around you why should you not love him he is a gentleman and a good mansofthearted of a sweet nature whose life would be one effort to make yours happy you think that felix is very bad  i have never said so  but ask yourself whether you do not give as much pain seeing what you could do for us if you would but it never occurs to you to sacrifice even a fantasy for the advantage of others  hetta retired from her seat on the sofa and when her mother again went upstairs she turned it all over in her mind could it be right that she should marry one man when she loved another could it be right that she should marry at all for the sake of doing good to her family this man whom she might marry if she wouldwho did in truth worship the ground on which she trodwas she well knew all that her mother had said and he was more than that her mother had spoken of his soft heart and his sweet nature but hetta knew also that he was a man of high honour and a noble courage in such a condition as was hers now he was the very friend whose advice she could have asked had he not been the very lover who was desirous of making her his wife hetta felt that she could sacrifice much for her mother money if she had it she could have given though she left herself penniless her time her inclinations her very hearts treasure and as she thought her life she could give she could doom herself to poverty and loneliness and heartrending regrets for her mothers sake but she did not know how she could give herself into the arms of a man she did not love  i dont know what there is to explain said felix to his mother she had asked him why he had not gone to liverpool whether he had been interrupted by melmotte himself whether news had reached him from marie that she had been stopped or whetheras might have been possiblemarie had changed her own mind but he could not bring himself to tell the truth or any story bordering on the truth it didnt come off he said and of course that knocked me off my legs well yes i did take some champagne when i found how it was a fellow does get cut up by that kind of thing oh i heard it at the clubthat the whole thing was off i cant explain anything more and then i was so mad i cant tell what i was after i did get the ticket there it is that shows i was in earnest i spent the £30 in getting it i suppose the change is there dont take it for i havent another shilling in the world of course he said nothing of maries money or of that which he had himself received from melmotte and as his mother had heard nothing of these sums she could not contradict what he said she got from him no further statement but she was sure that there was a story to be told which would reach her ears sooner or later  that evening about nine oclock mr broune called in welbeck street he very often did call now coming up in a cab staying for a cup of tea and going back in the same cab to the office of his newspaper since lady carbury had so devotedly abstained from accepting his offer mr broune had become almost sincerely attached to her there was certainly between them now more of the intimacy of real friendship than had ever existed in earlier days he spoke to her more freely about his own affairs and even she would speak to him with some attempt at truth there was never between them now even a shade of lovemaking she did not look into his eyes nor did he hold her hand as for kissing herhe thought no more of it than of kissing the maidservant but he spoke to her of the things that worried himthe unreasonable exactions of proprietors and the perilous inaccuracy of contributors he told her of the exceeding weight upon his shoulders under which an atlas would have succumbed and he told her something too of his triumphshow he had had this fellow bowled over in punishment for some contradiction and that man snuffed out for daring to be an enemy and he expatiated on his own virtues his justice and clemency ahif men and women only knew his good nature and his patriotismhow he had spared the rod here how he had made the fortune of a man there how he had saved the country millions by the steadiness of his adherence to some grand truth lady carbury delighted in all this and repaid him by flattery and little confidences of her own under his teaching she had almost made up her mind to give up mr alf of nothing was mr broune more certain than that mr alf was making a fool of himself in regard to the westminster election and those attacks on melmotte the world of london generally knows what it is about said mr broune and the london world believes mr melmotte to be sound i dont pretend to say that he has never done anything that he ought not to do i am not going into his antecedents but he is a man of wealth power and genius and alf will get the worst of it under such teaching as this lady carbury was almost obliged to give up mr alf  sometimes they would sit in the front room with hetta to whom also mr broune had become attached but sometimes lady carbury would be in her own sanctum on this evening she received him there and at once poured forth all her troubles about felix on this occasion she told him everything and almost told him everything truly he had already heard the story the young lady went down to liverpool and sir felix was not there  he could not have been there he has been in bed in this house all day did she go  so i am toldand was met at the station by the senior officer of the police at liverpool who brought her back to london without letting her go down to the ship at all she must have thought that her lover was on boardprobably thinks so now i pity her  how much worse it would have been had she been allowed to start said lady carbury  yes that would have been bad she would have had a sad journey to new york and a sadder journey back has your son told you anything about money  what money  they say that the girl entrusted him with a large sum which she had taken from her father if that be so he certainly ought to lose no time in restoring it it might be done through some friend i would do it for that matter if it be soto avoid unpleasantnessit should be sent back at once it will be for his credit this mr broune said with a clear intimation of the importance of his advice  it was dreadful to lady carbury she had no money to give back nor as she was well aware had her son she had heard nothing of any money what did mr broune mean by a large sum that would be dreadful she said  had you not better ask him about it  lady carbury was again in tears she knew that she could not hope to get a word of truth from her son what do you mean by a large sum  two or three hundred pounds perhaps  i have not a shilling in the world mr broune then it all came outthe whole story of her poverty as it had been brought about by her sons misconduct she told him every detail of her money affairs from the death of her husband and his will up to the present moment  he is eating you up lady carbury lady carbury thought that she was nearly eaten up already but she said nothing you must put a stop to this  but how  you must rid yourself of him it is dreadful to say so but it must be done you must not see your daughter ruined find out what money he got from miss melmotte and i will see that it is repaid that must be doneand we will then try to get him to go abroad nodo not contradict me we can talk of the money another time i must be off now as i have stayed too long do as i bid you make him tell you and send me word down to the office if you could do it early tomorrow that would be best god bless you and so he hurried off  early on the following morning a letter from lady carbury was put into mr brounes hands giving the story of the money as far as she had been able to extract it from sir felix sir felix declared that mr melmotte had owed him £600 and that he had received £250 out of this from miss melmotteso that there was still a large balance due to him lady carbury went on to say that her son had at last confessed that he had lost this money at play the story was fairly true but lady carbury in her letter acknowledged that she was not justified in believing it because it was told to her by her son     chapter liii  a day in the city   melmotte had got back his daughter and was half inclined to let the matter rest there he would probably have done so had he not known that all his own household were aware that she had gone off to meet sir felix carbury and had he not also received the condolence of certain friends in the city it seemed that about two oclock in the day the matter was known to everybody of course lord nidderdale would hear of it and if so all the trouble that he had taken in that direction would have been taken in vain stupid fool of a girl to throw away her chancenay to throw away the certainty of a brilliant career in that way but his anger against sir felix was infinitely more bitter than his anger against his daughter the man had pledged himself to abstain from any step of this kindhad given a written pledgehad renounced under his own signature his intention of marrying marie melmotte had of course learned all the details of the cheque for £250how the money had been paid at the bank to didon and how didon had given it to sir felix marie herself acknowledged that sir felix had received the money if possible he would prosecute the baronet for stealing his money  had melmotte been altogether a prudent man he would probably have been satisfied with getting back his daughter and would have allowed the money to go without further trouble at this especial point in his career ready money was very valuable to him but his concerns were of such magnitude that £250 could make but little difference but there had grown upon the man during the last few months an arrogance a selfconfidence inspired in him by the worship of other men which clouded his intellect and robbed him of much of that power of calculation which undoubtedly he naturally possessed he remembered perfectly his various little transactions with sir felix indeed it was one of his gifts to remember with accuracy all money transactions whether great or small and to keep an account book in his head which was always totted up and balanced with accuracy he knew exactly how he stood even with the crossingsweeper to whom he had given a penny last tuesday as with the longestaffes father and son to whom he had not as yet made any payment on behalf of the purchase of pickering but sir felixs money had been consigned into his hands for the purchase of sharesand that consignment did not justify six felix in taking another sum of money from his daughter in such a matter he thought that an english magistrate and an english jury would all be on his sideespecially as he was augustus melmotte the man about to be chosen for westminster the man about to entertain the emperor of china  the next day was fridaythe day of the railway board early in the morning he sent a note to lord nidderdale      my dear nidderdale     pray come to the board todayor at any rate come to me in the    city i specially want to speak to you     yours     a m   this he wrote having made up his mind that it would be wise to make a clear breast of it with his hopedfor soninlaw if there was still a chance of keeping the young lord to his guns that chance would be best supported by perfect openness on his part the young lord would of course know what marie had done but the young lord had for some weeks past been aware that there had been a difficulty in regard to sir felix carbury and had not on that account relaxed his suit it might be possible to persuade the young lord that as the young lady had now tried to elope and tried in vain his own chance might on the whole be rather improved than injured  mr melmotte on that morning had many visitors among whom one of the earliest and most unfortunate was mr longestaffe at that time there had been arranged at the offices in abchurch lane a mode of double ingress and egressa front stairs and a back stairs approach and exit as is always necessary with very great menin reference to which arrangement the honour and dignity attached to each is exactly contrary to that which generally prevails in the world the front stairs being intended for everybody and being both slow and uncertain whereas the back stairs are quick and sure and are used only for those who are favoured miles grendall had the command of the stairs and found that he had plenty to do in keeping people in their right courses mr longestaffe reached abchurch lane before onehaving altogether failed in getting a moments private conversation with the big man on that other friday when he had come later he fell at once into miless hands and was ushered through the front stairs passage and into the front stairs waitingroom with much external courtesy miles grendall was very voluble did mr longestaffe want to see mr melmotte ohmr longestaffe wanted to see mr melmotte as soon as possible of course mr longestaffe should see mr melmotte he miles knew that mr melmotte was particularly desirous of seeing mr longestaffe mr melmotte had mentioned mr longestaffes name twice during the last three days would mr longestaffe sit down for a few minutes had mr longestaffe seen the morning breakfast table mr melmotte undoubtedly was very much engaged at this moment a deputation from the canadian government was with himand sir gregory gribe was in the office waiting for a few words but miles thought that the canadian government would not be longand as for sir gregory perhaps his business might be postponed miles would do his very best to get an interview for mr longestaffemore especially as mr melmotte was so very desirous himself of seeing his friend it was astonishing that such a one as miles grendall should have learned his business so well and should have made himself so handy we will leave mr longestaffe with the morning breakfast table in his hands in the front waitingroom merely notifying the fact that there he remained for something over two hours  in the meantime both mr broune and lord nidderdale came to the office and both were received without delay mr broune was the first miles knew who he was and made no attempt to seat him in the same room with mr longestaffe ill just send him a note said mr broune and he scrawled a few words at the office counter im commissioned to pay you some money on behalf of miss melmotte those were the words and they at once procured him admission to the sanctum the canadian deputation must have taken its leave and sir gregory could hardly have as yet arrived lord nidderdale who had presented himself almost at the same moment with the editor was shown into a little private room which was indeed miles grendalls own retreat whats up with the governor asked the young lord  anything particular do you mean said miles there are always so many things up here  he has sent for me  yesyoull go in directly theres that fellow who does the breakfast table in with him i dont know what hes come about you know what he has sent for you for  lord nidderdale answered this question by another i suppose all this about miss melmotte is true  she did go off yesterday morning said miles in a whisper  but carbury wasnt with her  well noi suppose not he seems to have mulled it hes such a d brute hed be sure to go wrong whatever he had in hand  you dont like him of course miles for that matter ive no reason to love him he couldnt have gone he staggered out of the club yesterday morning at four oclock as drunk as cloe hed lost a pot of money and had been kicking up a row about you for the last hour  brute exclaimed miles with honest indignation  i dare say but though he was able to make a row im sure he couldnt get himself down to liverpool and i saw all his things lying about the club hall late last nightno end of portmanteaux and bags just what a fellow would take to new york by george fancy taking a girl to new york it was plucky  it was all her doing said miles who was of course intimate with mr melmottes whole establishment and had had means therefore of hearing the true story  what a fiasco said the young lord i wonder what the old boy means to say to me about it then there was heard the clear tingle of a little silver bell and miles told lord nidderdale that his time had come  mr broune had of late been very serviceable to mr melmotte and melmotte was correspondingly gracious on seeing the editor he immediately began to make a speech of thanks in respect of the support given by the breakfast table to his candidature but mr broune cut him short i never talk about the breakfast table said he we endeavour to get along as right as we can and the less said the soonest mended melmotte bowed i have come now about quite another matter and perhaps the less said the sooner mended about that also sir felix carbury on a late occasion received a sum of money in trust from your daughter circumstances have prevented its use in the intended manner and therefore as sir felixs friend i have called to return the money to you mr broune did not like calling himself the friend of sir felix but he did even that for the lady who had been good enough to him not to marry him  oh indeed said mr melmotte with a scowl on his face which he would have repressed if he could  no doubt you understand all about it  yesi understand d scoundrel  we wont discuss that mr melmotte ive drawn a cheque myself payable to your orderto make the matter all straight the sum was £250 i think and mr broune put a cheque for that amount down upon the table  i dare say its all right said mr melmotte but remember i dont think that this absolves him he has been a scoundrel  at any rate he has paid back the money which chance put into his hands to the only person entitled to receive it on the young ladys behalf good morning mr melmotte did put out his hand in token of amity then mr broune departed and melmotte tinkled his bell as nidderdale was shown in he crumpled up the cheque and put it into his pocket he was at once clever enough to perceive that any idea which he might have had of prosecuting sir felix must be abandoned well my lord and how are you said he with his pleasantest smile nidderdale declared himself to be as fresh as paint you dont look down in the mouth my lord  then lord nidderdalewho no doubt felt that it behoved him to show a good face before his late intended fatherinlawsang the refrain of an old song which it is trusted my readers may remember      cheer up sam      dont let your spirits go down      theres many a girl that i know well      is waiting for you in the town  ha ha ha laughed melmotte very good ive no doubt there is many a one but you wont let this stupid nonsense stand in your way with marie  upon my word sir i dont know about that miss melmotte has given the most convincing proof of her partiality for another gentleman and of her indifference to me  a foolish baggage a silly little romantic baggage shes been reading novels till she has learned to think she couldnt settle down quietly till she had run off with somebody  she doesnt seem to have succeeded on this occasion mr melmotte  noof course we had her back again from liverpool  but they say that she got further than the gentleman  he is a dishonest drunken scoundrel my girl knows very well what he is now shell never try that game again of course my lord im very sorry you know that ive been on the square with you always shes my only child and sooner or later she must have all that i possess what she will have at once will make any man wealthythat is if she marries with my sanction and in a year or two i expect that i shall be able to double what i give her now without touching my capital of course you understand that i desire to see her occupying high rank i think that in this country that is a noble object of ambition had she married that sweep i should have broken my heart now my lord i want you to say that this shall make no difference to you i am very honest with you i do not try to hide anything the thing of course has been a misfortune girls will be romantic but you may be sure that this little accident will assist rather than impede your views after this she will not be very fond of sir felix carbury  i dare say not though by jove girls will forgive anything  she wont forgive him by george she shant she shall hear the whole story youll come and see her just the same as ever  i dont know about that mr melmotte  why not youre not so weak as to surrender all your settled projects for such a piece of folly as that he didnt even see her all the time  that wasnt her fault  the money will all be there lord nidderdale  the moneys all right ive no doubt and there isnt a man in all london would be better pleased to settle down with a good income than i would but by jove its a rather strong order when a girl has just run away with another man everybody knows it  in three months time everybody will have forgotten it  to tell you the truth sir i think miss melmotte has got a will of her own stronger than you give her credit for she has never given me the slightest encouragement ever so long ago about christmas she did once say that she would do as you bade her but she is very much changed since then the thing was off  she had nothing to do with that  nobut she has taken advantage of it and i have no right to complain  you just come to the house and ask her again tomorrow or come on sunday morning dont let us be done out of all our settled arrangements by the folly of an idle girl will you come on sunday morning about noon lord nidderdale thought of his position for a few moments and then said that perhaps he would come on sunday morning after that melmotte proposed that they two should go and get a bit of lunch at a certain conservative club in the city there would be time before the meeting of the railway board nidderdale had no objection to the lunch but expressed a strong opinion that the board was rot thats all very well for you young man said the chairman but i must go there in order that you may be able to enjoy a splendid fortune then he touched the young man on the shoulder and drew him back as he was passing out by the front stairs come this way nidderdalecome this way i must get out without being seen there are people waiting for me there who think that a man can attend to business from morning to night without ever having a bit in his mouth and so they escaped by the back stairs  at the club the city conservative worldwhich always lunches wellwelcomed mr melmotte very warmly the election was coming on and there was much to be said he played the part of the big city man to perfection standing about the room with his hat on and talking loudly to a dozen men at once and he was glad to show the club that lord nidderdale had come there with him the club of course knew that lord nidderdale was the accepted suitor of the rich mans daughter accepted that is by the rich man himselfand the club knew also that the rich mans daughter had tried but had failed to run away with sir felix carbury there is nothing like wiping out a misfortune and having done with it the presence of lord nidderdale was almost an assurance to the club that the misfortune had been wiped out and as it were abolished a little before three mr melmotte returned to abchurch lane intending to regain his room by the back way while lord nidderdale went westward considering within his own mind whether it was expedient that he should continue to show himself as a suitor for miss melmottes hand he had an idea that a few years ago a man could not have done such a thingthat he would be held to show a poor spirit should he attempt it but that now it did not much matter what a man didif only he were successful after all its only an affair of money he said to himself  mr longestaffe in the meantime had progressed from weariness to impatience from impatience to illhumour and from illhumour to indignation more than once he saw miles grendall but miles grendall was always ready with an answer that canadian deputation was determined to settle the whole business this morning and would not take itself away and sir gregory gribe had been obstinate beyond the ordinary obstinacy of a bank director the rate of discount at the bank could not be settled for tomorrow without communication with mr melmotte and that was a matter on which the details were always most oppressive at first mr longestaffe was somewhat stunned by the deputation and sir gregory gribe but as he waxed wroth the potency of those institutions dwindled away and as at last he waxed hungry they became as nothing to him was he not mr longestaffe of caversham a deputylieutenant of his county and accustomed to lunch punctually at two oclock when he had been in that waitingroom for two hours it occurred to him that he only wanted his own and that he would not remain there to be starved for any mr melmotte in europe it occurred to him also that that thorn in his side squercum would certainly get a finger into the pie to his infinite annoyance then he walked forth and attempted to see grendall for the fourth time but miles grendall also liked his lunch and was therefore declared by one of the junior clerks to be engaged at that moment on most important business with mr melmotte then say that i cant wait any longer said mr longestaffe stamping out of the room with angry feet  at the very door he met mr melmotte ah mr longestaffe said the great financier seizing him by the hand you are the very man i am desirous of seeing  i have been waiting two hours up in your place said the squire of caversham  tut tut tutand they never told me  i spoke to mr grendall half a dozen times  yesyes and he did put a slip with your name on it on my desk i do remember my dear sir i have so many things on my brain that i hardly know how to get along with them you are coming to the board its just the time now  nosaid mr longestaffe i can stay no longer in the city it was cruel that a man so hungry should be asked to go to a board by a chairman who had just lunched at his club  i was carried away to the bank of england and could not help myself said melmotte and when they get me there i can never get away again  my son is very anxious to have the payments made about pickering said mr longestaffe absolutely holding melmotte by the collar of his coat  payments for pickering said melmotte assuming an air of unimportant doubtof doubt as though the thing were of no real moment havent they been made  certainly not said mr longestaffe unless made this morning  there was something about it but i cannot just remember what my second cashier mr smith manages all my private affairs and they go clean out of my head im afraid hes in grosvenor square at this moment let me seepickering wasnt there some question of a mortgage im sure there was something about a mortgage  there was a mortgage of coursebut that only made three payments necessary instead of two  but there was some unavoidable delay about the paperssomething occasioned by the mortgagee i know there was but you shant be inconvenienced mr longestaffe  its my son mr melmotte hes got a lawyer of his own  i never knew a young man that wasnt in a hurry for his money said melmotte laughing oh yesthere were three payments to be made one to you one to your son and one to the mortgagee i will speak to mr smith myself tomorrowand you may tell your son that he really need not trouble his lawyer he will only be losing his money for lawyers are expensive what you wont come to the board i am sorry for that mr longestaffe having after a fashion said what he had to say declined to go to the board a painful rumour had reached him the day before which had been communicated to him in a very quiet way by a very old friendby a member of a private firm of bankers whom he was accustomed to regard as the wisest and most eminent man of his acquaintancethat pickering had been already mortgaged to its full value by its new owner mind i know nothing said the banker the report has reached me and if it be true it shows that mr melmotte must be much pressed for money it does not concern you at all if you have got your price but it seems to be rather a quick transaction i suppose you have or he wouldnt have the titledeeds mr longestaffe thanked his friend and acknowledged that there had been something remiss on his part therefore as he went westward he was low in spirits but nevertheless he had been reassured by melmottes manner  sir felix carbury of course did not attend the board nor did paul montague for reasons with which the reader has been made acquainted lord nidderdale had declined having had enough of the city for that day and mr longestaffe had been banished by hunger the chairman was therefore supported only by lord alfred and mr cohenlupe but they were such excellent colleagues that the work was got through as well as though those absentees had all attended when the board was over mr melmotte and mr cohenlupe retired together  i must get that money for longestaffe said melmotte to his friend  what eighty thousand pounds you cant do it this weeknor yet before this day week  it isnt eighty thousand pounds ive renewed the mortgage and that makes it only fifty if i can manage the half of that which goes to the son i can put the father off  you must raise what you can on the whole property  ive done that already said melmotte hoarsely  and wheres the money gone  brehgert has had £40000 i was obliged to keep it up with them you can manage £25000 for me by monday mr cohenlupe said that he would try but intimated his opinion that there would be considerable difficulty in the operation     chapter liv  the india office   the conservative party at this particular period was putting its shoulder to the wheelnot to push the coach up any hill but to prevent its being hurried along at a pace which was not only dangerous but manifestly destructive the conservative party now and then does put its shoulder to the wheel ostensibly with the great national object above named but also actuated by a natural desire to keep its own head well above water and be generally doing something so that other parties may not suppose that it is moribund there are no doubt members of it who really think that when some object has been achievedwhen for instance a good old tory has been squeezed into parliament for the borough of porcorum which for the last three parliaments has been represented by a liberalthe coach has been really stopped to them in their delightful faith there comes at these triumphant moments a conviction that after all the people as a people have not been really in earnest in their efforts to take something from the greatness of the great and to add something to the lowliness of the lowly the handle of the windlass has been broken the wheel is turning fast the reverse way and the rope of radical progress is running back who knows what may not be regained if the conservative party will only put its shoulder to the wheel and take care that the handle of the windlass be not mended sticinthemud which has ever been a doubtful little borough has just been carried by a majority of fifteen a long pull a strong pull and a pull altogetherand the old day will come back again venerable patriarchs think of lord liverpool and other heroes and dream dreams of conservative bishops conservative lordlieutenants and of a conservative ministry that shall remain in for a generation  such a time was now present porcorum and sticinthemud had done their duty valiantlywith much management but westminster if this special seat for westminster could be carried the country then could hardly any longer have a doubt on the matter if only mr melmotte could be got in for westminster it would be manifest that the people were sound at heart and that all the great changes which had been effected during the last forty yearsfrom the first reform in parliament down to the ballothad been managed by the cunning and treachery of a few ambitious men not however that the ballot was just now regarded by the party as an unmitigated evil though it was the last triumph of radical wickedness the ballot was on the whole popular with the party a short time since no doubt it was regarded by the party as being one and the same as national ruin and national disgrace but it had answered well at porcorum and with due manipulation had been found to be favourable at sticinthemud the ballot might perhaps help the long pull and the strong pulland in spite of the ruin and disgrace was thought by some just now to be a highly conservative measure it was considered that the ballot might assist melmotte at westminster very materially  any one reading the conservative papers of the time and hearing the conservative speeches in the boroughany one at least who lived so remote as not to have learned what these things really meanwould have thought that englands welfare depended on melmottes return in the enthusiasm of the moment the attacks made on his character were answered by eulogy as loud as the censure was bitter the chief crime laid to his charge was connected with the ruin of some great continental assurance company as to which it was said that he had so managed it as to leave it utterly stranded with an enormous fortune of his own it was declared that every shilling which he had brought to england with him had consisted of plunder stolen from the shareholders in the company now the evening pulpit in its endeavour to make the facts of this transaction known had placed what it called the domicile of this company in paris whereas it was ascertained that its official headquarters had in truth been placed at vienna was not such a blunder as this sufficient to show that no merchant of higher honour than mr melmotte had ever adorned the exchanges of modern capitals and then two different newspapers of the time both of them antagonistic to melmotte failed to be in accord on a material point one declared that mr melmotte was not in truth possessed of any wealth the other said that he had derived his wealth from those unfortunate shareholders could anything betray so bad a cause as contradictions such as these could anything be so false so weak so malignant so useless so wicked so selfcondemnedin fact so liberal as a course of action such as this the belief naturally to be deduced from such statements nay the unavoidable conviction on the mindsof at any rate the conservative newspaperswas that mr melmotte had accumulated an immense fortune and that he had never robbed any shareholder of a shilling  the friends of melmotte had moreover a basis of hope and were enabled to sound premonitory notes of triumph arising from causes quite external to their party the breakfast table supported melmotte but the breakfast table was not a conservative organ this support was given not to the great mans political opinions as to which a wellknown writer in that paper suggested that the great man had probably not as yet given very much attention to the party questions which divided the countrybut to his commercial position it was generally acknowledged that few men livingperhaps no man alive had so acute an insight into the great commercial questions of the age as mr augustus melmotte in whatever part of the world he might have acquired his commercial experiencefor it had been said repeatedly that melmotte was not an englishmanhe now made london his home and great britain his country and it would be for the welfare of the country that such a man should sit in the british parliament such were the arguments used by the breakfast table in supporting mr melmotte this was of course an assistanceand not the less so because it was asserted in other papers that the country would be absolutely disgraced by his presence in parliament the hotter the opposition the keener will be the support honest good men men who really loved their country fine gentlemen who had received unsullied names from great ancestors shed their money right and left and grew hot in personally energetic struggles to have this man returned to parliament as the head of the great conservative mercantile interests of great britain  there was one man who thoroughly believed that the thing at the present moment most essentially necessary to englands glory was the return of mr melmotte for westminster this man was undoubtedly a very ignorant man he knew nothing of any one political question which had vexed england for the last half centurynothing whatever of the political history which had made england what it was at the beginning of that half century of such names as hampden somers and pitt he had hardly ever heard he had probably never read a book in his life he knew nothing of the working of parliament nothing of nationality had no preference whatever for one form of government over another never having given his mind a moments trouble on the subject he had not even reflected how a despotic monarch or a federal republic might affect himself and possibly did not comprehend the meaning of those terms but yet he was fully confident that england did demand and ought to demand that mr melmotte should be returned for westminster this man was mr melmotte himself  in this conjunction of his affairs mr melmotte certainly lost his head he had audacity almost sufficient for the very dangerous game which he was playing but as crisis heaped itself upon crisis he became deficient in prudence he did not hesitate to speak of himself as the man who ought to represent westminster and of those who opposed him as little malignant beings who had mean interests of their own to serve he went about in his open carriage with lord alfred at his left hand with a look on his face which seemed to imply that westminster was not good enough for him he even hinted to certain political friends that at the next general election he should try the city six months since he had been a humble man to a lordbut now he scolded earls and snubbed dukes and yet did it in a manner which showed how proud he was of connecting himself with their social preeminence and how ignorant of the manner in which such preeminence affects english gentlemen generally the more arrogant he became the more vulgar he was till even lord alfred would almost be tempted to rush away to impecuniosity and freedom perhaps there were some with whom this conduct had a salutary effect no doubt arrogance will produce submission and there are men who take other men at the price those other men put upon themselves such persons could not refrain from thinking melmotte to be mighty because he swaggered and gave their hinder parts to be kicked merely because he put up his toe we all know men of this calibreand how they seem to grow in number but the net result of his personal demeanour was injurious and it was debated among some of the warmest of his supporters whether a hint should not be given him couldnt lord alfred say a word to him said the honourable beauchamp beauclerk who himself in parliament a leading man in his party thoroughly well acquainted with the borough wealthy and connected by blood with half the great conservative families in the kingdom had been moving heaven and earth on behalf of the great financial king and working like a slave for his success  alfreds more than half afraid of him said lionel lupton a young aristocrat also in parliament who had been inoculated with the idea that the interests of the party demanded melmotte in parliament but who would have given up his scotch shooting rather than have undergone melmottes company for a day  something really must be done mr beauclerk said mr jones who was the leading member of a very wealthy firm of builders in the borough who had become a conservative politician who had thoughts of the house for himself but who never forgot his own position he is making a great many personal enemies  hes the finest old turkey cock out said lionel lupton  then it was decided that mr beauclerk should speak a word to lord alfred the rich man and the poor man were cousins and had always been intimate alfred said the chosen mentor at the club one afternoon i wonder whether you couldnt say something to melmotte about his manner lord alfred turned sharp round and looked into his companions face they tell me he is giving offence of course he doesnt mean it couldnt he draw it a little milder  lord alfred made his reply almost in a whisper if you ask me i dont think he could if you got him down and trampled on him you might make him mild i dont think theres any other way  you couldnt speak to him then  not unless i did it with a horsewhip  this coming from lord alfred who was absolutely dependent on the man was very strong lord alfred had been much afflicted that morning he had spent some hours with his friend either going about the borough in the open carriage or standing just behind him at meetings or sitting close to him in committeeroomsand had been nauseated with melmotte when spoken to about his friend he could not restrain himself lord alfred had been born and bred a gentleman and found the position in which he was now earning his bread to be almost insupportable it had gone against the grain with him at first when he was called alfred but now that he was told just to open the door and just to give that message he almost meditated revenge lord nidderdale who was quick at observation had seen something of this in grosvenor square and declared that lord alfred had invested part of his recent savings in a cutting whip mr beauclerk when he had got his answer whistled and withdrew but he was true to his party melmotte was not the first vulgar man whom the conservatives had taken by the hand and patted on the back and told that he was a god  the emperor of china was now in england and was to be entertained one night at the india office the secretary of state for the second great asiatic empire was to entertain the ruler of the first this was on saturday the 6th of july and melmottes dinner was to take place on the following monday very great interest was made by the london world generally to obtain admission to the india officethe making of such interest consisting in the most abject begging for tickets of admission addressed to the secretary of state to all the under secretaries to assistant secretaries secretaries of departments chief clerks and to headmessengers and their wives if a petitioner could not be admitted as a guest into the splendour of the reception rooms might not heor shebe allowed to stand in some passage whence the emperors back might perhaps be seenso that if possible the petitioners name might be printed in the list of guests which would be published on the next morning now mr melmotte with his family was of course supplied with tickets he who was to spend a fortune in giving the emperor a dinner was of course entitled to be present at other places to which the emperor would be brought to be shown melmotte had already seen the emperor at a breakfast in windsor park and at a ball in royal halls but hitherto he had not been presented to the emperor presentations have to be restrictedif only on the score of time and it had been thought that as mr melmotte would of course have some communication with the hardworked emperor at his own house that would suffice but he had felt himself to be illused and was offended he spoke with bitterness to some of his supporters of the royal family generally because he had not been brought to the front rank either at the breakfast or at the balland now at the india office was determined to have his due but he was not on the list of those whom the secretary of state intended on this occasion to present to the brother of the sun  he had dined freely at this period of his career he had taken to dining freelywhich was in itself imprudent as he had need at all hours of his best intelligence let it not be understood that he was tipsy he was a man whom wine did not often affect after that fashion but it made him who was arrogant before tower in his arrogance till he was almost sure to totter it was probably at some moment after dinner that lord alfred decided upon buying the cutting whip of which he had spoken melmotte went with his wife and daughter to the india office and soon left them far in the background with a requestwe may say an orderto lord alfred to take care of them it may be observed here that marie melmotte was almost as great a curiosity as the emperor himself and was much noticed as the girl who had attempted to run away to new york but had gone without her lover melmotte entertained some foolish idea that as the india office was in westminster he had a peculiar right to demand an introduction on this occasion because of his candidature he did succeed in getting hold of an unfortunate under secretary of state a studious and invaluable young peer known as earl de griffin he was a shy man of enormous wealth of mediocre intellect and no great physical ability who never amused himself but worked hard night and day and read everything that anybody could write and more than any other person could read about india had mr melmotte wanted to know the exact dietary of the peasants in orissa or the revenue of the punjaub or the amount of crime in bombay lord de griffin would have informed him without a pause but in this matter of managing the emperor the under secretary had nothing to do and would have been the last man to be engaged in such a service he was however second in command at the india office and of his official rank melmotte was unfortunately made aware my lord said he by no means hiding his demand in a whisper i am desirous of being presented to his imperial majesty lord de griffin looked at him in despair not knowing the great manbeing one of the few men in that room who did not know him  this is mr melmotte said lord alfred who had deserted the ladies and still stuck to his master lord de griffin let me introduce you to mr melmotte  ohohoh said lord de griffin just putting out his hand i am delightedah yes and pretending to see somebody he made a weak and quite ineffectual attempt to escape  melmotte stood directly in his way and with unabashed audacity repeated his demand i am desirous of being presented to his imperial majesty will you do me the honour of making my request known to mr wilson mr wilson was the secretary of state who was as busy as a secretary of state is sure to be on such an occasion  i hardly know said lord de griffin im afraid its all arranged i dont know anything about it myself  you can introduce me to mr wilson  hes up there mr melmotte and i couldnt get at him really you must excuse me im very sorry if i see him ill tell him and the poor under secretary again endeavoured to escape  mr melmotte put up his hand and stopped him im not going to stand this kind of thing he said the old marquis of auld reekie was close at hand the father of lord nidderdale and therefore the proposed fatherinlaw of melmottes daughter and he poked his thumb heavily into lord alfreds ribs it is generally understood i believe continued melmotte that the emperor is to do me the honour of dining at my poor house on monday he dont dine there unless im made acquainted with him before he comes i mean what i say i aint going to entertain even an emperor unless im good enough to be presented to him perhaps youd better let mr wilson know as a good many people intend to come  heres a row said the old marquis i wish hed be as good as his word  he has taken a little wine whispered lord alfred melmotte he said still whispering upon my word it isnt the thing theyre only indian chaps and eastern swells who are presented herenot a fellow among em all who hasnt been in india or china or isnt a secretary of state or something of that kind  then they should have done it at windsor or at the ball said melmotte pulling down his waistcoat by george alfred im in earnest and somebody had better look to it if im not presented to his imperial majesty tonight by g there shall be no dinner in grosvenor square on monday im master enough of my own house i suppose to be able to manage that  here was a row as the marquis had said lord de griffin was frightened and lord alfred felt that something ought to be done theres no knowing how far the pigheaded brute may go in his obstinacy lord alfred said to mr lupton who was there it no doubt might have been wise to have allowed the merchant prince to return home with the resolution that his dinner should be abandoned he would have repented probably before the next morning and had he continued obdurate it would not have been difficult to explain to celestial majesty that something preferable had been found for that particular evening even to a banquet at the house of british commerce the government would probably have gained the seat for westminster as melmotte would at once have become very unpopular with the great body of his supporters but lord de griffin was not the man to see this he did make his way up to mr wilson and explained to the amphytrion of the night the demand which was made on his hospitality a thoroughly wellestablished and experienced political minister of state always feels that if he can make a friend or appease an enemy without paying a heavy price he will be doing a good stroke of business bring him up said mr wilson hes going to do something out in the east isnt he nothing in india said lord de griffin the submarine telegraph is quite impossible mr wilson instructing some satellite to find out in what way he might properly connect mr melmotte with china sent lord de griffin away with his commission  my dear alfred just allow me to manage these things myself mr melmotte was saying when the under secretary returned i know my own position and how to keep it there shall be no dinner ill be d if any of the lot shall dine in grosvenor square on monday lord alfred was so astounded that he was thinking of making his way to the prime minister a man whom he abhorred and didnt know and of acquainting him with the terrible calamity which was threatened but the arrival of the under secretary saved him the trouble  if you will come with me whispered lord de griffin it shall be managed it isnt just the thing but as you wish it it shall be done  i do wish it said melmotte aloud he was one of those men whom success never mollified whose enjoyment of a point gained always demanded some hoarse note of triumph from his own trumpet  if you will be so kind as to follow me said lord de griffin and so the thing was done melmotte as he was taken up to the imperial footstool was resolved upon making a little speech forgetful at the moment of interpretersof the double interpreters whom the majesty of china required but the awful quiescent solemnity of the celestial one quelled even him and he shuffled by without saying a word even of his own banquet  but he had gained his point and as he was taken home to poor mr longestaffes house in bruton street was intolerable lord alfred tried to escape after putting madame melmotte and her daughter into the carriage but melmotte insisted on his presence you might as well come alfredthere are two or three things i must settle before i go to bed  im about knocked up said the unfortunate man  knocked up nonsense think what ive been through ive been all day at the hardest work a man can do had he as usual got in first leaving his manofallwork to follow the manofallwork would have escaped melmotte fearing such defection put his hand on lord alfreds shoulder and the poor fellow was beaten as they were taken home a continual sound of cockcrowing was audible but as the words were not distinguished they required no painful attention but when the soda water and brandy and cigars made their appearance in mr longestaffes own back room then the trumpet was sounded with a full blast i mean to let the fellows know whats what said melmotte walking about the room lord alfred had thrown himself into an armchair and was consoling himself as best he might with tobacco give and take is a very good motto if i scratch their back i mean them to scratch mine they wont find many people to spend ten thousand pounds in entertaining a guest of the countrys as a private enterprise i dont know of any other man of business who could do it or would do it its not much any of them can do for me thank god i dont want em but if consideration is to be shown to anybody i intend to be considered the prince treated me very scurvily alfred and i shall take an opportunity of telling him so on monday i suppose a man may be allowed to speak to his own guests  you might turn the election against you if you said anything the prince didnt like  d the election sir i stand before the electors of westminster as a man of business not as a courtieras a man who understands commercial enterprise not as one of the princes toadies some of you fellows in england dont realize the matter yet but i can tell you that i think myself quite as great a man as any prince lord alfred looked at him with strong reminiscences of the old ducal home and shuddered ill teach them a lesson before long didnt i teach em a lesson tonight eh they tell me that lord de griffin has sixty thousand ayear to spend whats sixty thousand a year didnt i make him go on my business and didnt i make em do as i chose you want to tell me this and that but i can tell you that i know more of men and women than some of you fellows do who think you know a great deal  this went on through the whole of a long cigar and afterwards as lord alfred slowly paced his way back to his lodgings in mount street he thought deeply whether there might not be means of escaping from his present servitude beast brute pig he said to himself over and over again as he slowly went to mount street     chapter lv  clerical charities   melmottes success and melmottes wealth and melmottes antecedents were much discussed down in suffolk at this time he had been seen there in the flesh and there is no believing like that which comes from sight he had been staying at caversham and many in those parts knew that miss longestaffe was now living in his house in london the purchase of the pickering estate had also been noticed in all the suffolk and norfolk newspapers rumours therefore of his past frauds rumour also as to the instability of his presumed fortune were as current as those which declared him to be by far the richest man in england miss melmottes little attempt had also been communicated in the papers and sir felix though he was not recognized as being real suffolk himself was so far connected with suffolk by name as to add something to this feeling of reality respecting the melmottes generally suffolk is very oldfashioned suffolk taken as a whole did not like the melmotte fashion suffolk which is i fear persistently and irrecoverably conservative did not believe in melmotte as a conservative member of parliament suffolk on this occasion was rather ashamed of the longestaffes and took occasion to remember that it was barely the other day as suffolk counts days since the original longestaffe was in trade this selling of pickering and especially the selling of it to melmotte was a mean thing suffolk as a whole thoroughly believed that melmotte had picked the very bones of every shareholder in that francoaustrian assurance company  mr hepworth was over with roger one morning and they were talking about himor talking rather of the attempted elopement i know nothing about it said roger and i do not intend to ask of course i did know when they were down here that he hoped to marry her and i did believe that she was willing to marry him but whether the father had consented or not i never inquired  it seems he did not consent  nothing could have been more unfortunate for either of them than such a marriage melmotte will probably be in the gazette before long and my cousin not only has not a shilling but could not keep one if he had it  you think melmotte will turn out a failure  a failure of course hes a failure whether rich or poora miserable imposition a hollow vulgar fraud from beginning to end too insignificant for you and me to talk of were it not that his position is a sign of the degeneracy of the age what are we coming to when such as he is an honoured guest at our tables  at just a table here and there suggested his friend  noit is not that you can keep your house free from him and so can i mine but we set no example to the nation at large they who do set the example go to his feasts and of course he is seen at theirs in return and yet these leaders of the fashion knowat any rate they believethat he is what he is because he has been a swindler greater than other swindlers what follows as a natural consequence men reconcile themselves to swindling though they themselves mean to be honest dishonesty of itself is no longer odious to them then there comes the jealousy that others should be growing rich with the approval of all the worldand the natural aptitude to do what all the world approves it seems to me that the existence of a melmotte is not compatible with a wholesome state of things in general  roger dined with the bishop of elmham that evening and the same hero was discussed under a different heading he has given £200 said the bishop to the curates aid society i dont know that a man could spend his money much better than that  claptrap said roger who in his present mood was very bitter  the money is not claptrap my friend i presume that the money is really paid  i dont feel at all sure of that  our collectors for clerical charities are usually stern menvery ready to make known defalcations on the part of promising subscribers i think they would take care to get the money during the election  and you think that money got in that way redounds to his credit  such a gift shows him to be a useful member of societyand i am always for encouraging useful men  even though their own objects may be vile and pernicious  there you beg ever so many questions mr carbury mr melmotte wishes to get into parliament and if there would vote on the side which you at any rate approve i do not know that his object in that respect is pernicious and as a seat in parliament has been a matter of ambition to the best of our countrymen for centuries i do not know why we should say that it is vile in this man roger frowned and shook his head of course mr melmotte is not the sort of gentleman whom you have been accustomed to regard as a fitting member for a conservative constituency but the country is changing  its going to the dogs i thinkabout as fast as it can go  we build churches much faster than we used to do  do we say our prayers in them when we have built them asked the squire  it is very hard to see into the minds of men said the bishop but we can see the results of their minds work i think that men on the whole do live better lives than they did a hundred years ago there is a wider spirit of justice abroad more of mercy from one to another a more lively charity and if less of religious enthusiasm less also of superstition men will hardly go to heaven mr carbury by following forms only because their fathers followed the same forms before them  i suppose men will go to heaven my lord by doing as they would be done by  there can be no safer lesson but we must hope that some may be saved even if they have not practised at all times that grand selfdenial who comes up to that teaching do you not wish for nay almost demand instant pardon for any trespass that you may commitof temper or manner for instance and are you always ready to forgive in that way yourself do you not writhe with indignation at being wrongly judged by others who condemn you without knowing your actions or the causes of them and do you never judge others after that fashion  i do not put myself forward as an example  i apologise for the personal form of my appeal a clergyman is apt to forget that he is not in the pulpit of course i speak of men in general taking society as a whole the big and the little the rich and the poor i think that it grows better from year to year and not worse i think too that they who grumble at the times as horace did and declare that each age is worse than its forerunner look only at the small things beneath their eyes and ignore the course of the world at large  but roman freedom and roman manners were going to the dogs when horace wrote  but christ was about to be born and men were already being made fit by wider intelligence for christs teaching and as for freedom has not freedom grown almost every year from that to this  in rome they were worshipping just such men as this melmotte do you remember the man who sat upon the seats of the knights and scoured the via sacra with his toga though he had been scourged from pillar to post for his villainies i always think of that man when i hear melmottes name mentioned hoc hoc tribuno militum is this the man to be conservative member for westminster  do you know of the scourges as a fact  i think i know that they are deserved  that is hardly doing to others as you would be done by if the man is what you say he will surely be found out at last and the day of his punishment will come your friend in the ode probably had a bad time of it in spite of his farms and his horses the world perhaps is managed more justly than you think mr carbury  my lord i believe youre a radical at heart said roger as he took his leave  very likelyvery likely only dont say so to the prime minister or i shall never get any of the better things which may be going  the bishop was not hopelessly in love with a young lady and was therefore less inclined to take a melancholy view of things in general than roger carbury to roger everything seemed to be out of joint he had that morning received a letter from lady carbury reminding him of the promise of a loan should a time come to her of great need it had come very quickly roger carbury did not in the least begrudge the hundred pounds which he had already sent to his cousin but he did begrudge any furtherance afforded to the iniquitous schemes of sir felix he felt all but sure that the foolish mother had given her son money for his abortive attempt and that therefore this appeal had been made to him he alluded to no such fear in his letter he simply enclosed the cheque and expressed a hope that the amount might suffice for the present emergency but he was disheartened and disgusted by all the circumstances of the carbury family there was paul montague bringing a woman such as mrs hurtle down to lowestoft declaring his purpose of continuing his visits to her and as roger thought utterly unable to free himself from his toilsand yet on this mans account hetta was cold and hard to him he was conscious of the honesty of his own love sure that he could make her happyconfident not in himself but in the fashion and ways of his own life what would be hettas lot if her heart was really given to paul montague  when he got home he found father barham sitting in his library an accident had lately happened at father barhams own establishment the wind had blown the roof off his cottage and roger carbury though his affection for the priest was waning had offered him shelter while the damage was being repaired shelter at carbury manor was very much more comfortable than the priests own establishment even with the roof on and father barham was in clover father barham was reading his own favourite newspaper the surplice when roger entered the room have you seen this mr carbury he said  whats this i am not likely to have seen anything that belongs peculiarly to the surplice  thats the prejudice of what you are pleased to call the anglican church mr melmotte is a convert to our faith he is a great man and will perhaps be one of the greatest known on the face of the globe  melmotte a convert to romanism ill make you a present of him and thank you to take him but i dont believe that weve any such good riddance  then father barham read a paragraph out of the surplice mr augustus melmotte the great financier and capitalist has presented a hundred guineas towards the erection of an altar for the new church of st fabricius in tothill fields the donation was accompanied by a letter from mr melmottes secretary which leaves but little doubt that the new member for westminster will be a member and no inconsiderable member of the catholic party in the house during the next session  thats another dodge is it said carbury  what do you mean by a dodge mr carbury because money is given for a pious object of which you do not happen to approve must it be a dodge  but my dear father barham the day before the same great man gave £200 to the protestant curates aid society i have just left the bishop exulting in this great act of charity  i dont believe a word of itor it may be a parting gift to the church to which he belonged in his darkness  and you would be really proud of mr melmotte as a convert  i would be proud of the lowest human being that has a soul said the priest but of course we are glad to welcome the wealthy and the great  the great oh dear  a man is great who has made for himself such a position as that of mr melmotte and when such a one leaves your church and joins our own it is a great sign to us that the truth is prevailing roger carbury without another word took his candle and went to bed     chapter lvi  father barham visits london   it was considered to be a great thing to catch the roman catholic vote in westminster for many years it has been considered a great thing both in the house and out of the house to catch roman catholic votes there are two modes of catching these votes this or that individual roman catholic may be promoted to place so that he personally may be made secure or the right hand of fellowship may be extended to the people of the pope generally so that the people of the pope may be taught to think that a general step is being made towards the reconversion of the nation the first measure is the easier but the effect is but slight and soon passes away the promoted one though as far as his prayers go he may remain as good a catholic as ever soon ceases to be one of the party to be conciliated and is apt after a while to be regarded by them as an enemy but the other mode if a step be well taken may be very efficacious it has now and then occurred that every roman catholic in ireland and england has been brought to believe that the nation is coming round to themand in this or that borough the same conviction has been made to grow to catch the protestantthat is the peculiarly protestantvote and the roman catholic vote at the same instant is a feat difficult of accomplishment but it has been attempted before and was attempted now by mr melmotte and his friends it was perhaps thought by his friends that the protestants would not notice the £100 given for the altar to st fabricius but mr alf was wide awake and took care that mr melmottes religious opinions should be a matter of interest to the world at large during all that period of newspaper excitement there was perhaps no article that created so much general interest as that which appeared in the evening pulpit with a special question asked at the head of it for priest or parson in this article which was more than usually delightful as being pungent from the beginning to the end and as being unalloyed with any dry didactic wisdom mr alfs man who did that business declared that it was really important that the nation at large and especially the electors of westminster should know what was the nature of mr melmottes faith that he was a man of a highly religious temperament was most certain by his munificent charities on behalf of religion two noble donations which by chance had been made just at this crisis were doubtless no more than the regular continuation of his ordinary flow of christian benevolence the evening pulpit by no means insinuated that the gifts were intended to have any reference to the approaching election far be it from the evening pulpit to imagine that so great a man as mr melmotte looked for any return in this world from his charitable generosity but still as protestants naturally desired to be represented in parliament by a protestant member and as roman catholics as naturally desired to be represented by a roman catholic perhaps mr melmotte would not object to declare his creed  this was biting and of course did mischief but mr melmotte and his manager were not foolish enough to allow it to actuate them in any way he had thrown his bread upon the waters assisting st fabricius with one hand and the protestant curates with the other and must leave the results to take care of themselves if the protestants chose to believe that he was hyperprotestant and the catholics that he was tending towards papacy so much the better for him any enthusiastic religionists wishing to enjoy such convictions would not allow themselves to be enlightened by the manifestly interested malignity of mr alfs newspaper  it may be doubted whether the donation to the curates aid society did have much effect it may perhaps have induced a resolution in some few to go to the poll whose minds were active in regard to religion and torpid as to politics but the donation to st fabricius certainly had results it was taken up and made much of by the roman catholic party generally till a report got itself spread abroad and almost believed that mr melmotte was going to join the church of rome these manoeuvres require most delicate handling or evil may follow instead of good on the second afternoon after the question had been asked in the evening pulpit an answer to it appeared for priest and not for parson therein various assertions made by roman catholic organs and repeated in roman catholic speeches were brought together so as to show that mr melmotte really had at last made up his mind on this important question all the world knew now said mr alfs writer that with that keen sense of honesty which was the great financiers peculiar characteristicthe great financier was the name which mr alf had specially invented for mr melmottehe had doubted till the truth was absolutely borne in upon him whether he could serve the nation best as a liberal or as a conservative he had solved that doubt with wisdom and now this other doubt had passed through the crucible and by the aid of fire a golden certainty had been produced the world of westminster at last knew that mr melmotte was a roman catholic now nothing was clearer than thisthat though catching the catholic vote would greatly help a candidate no real roman catholic could hope to be returned this last article vexed mr melmotte and he proposed to his friends to send a letter to the breakfast table asserting that he adhered to the protestant faith of his ancestors but as it was suspected by many and was now being whispered to the world at large that melmotte had been born a jew this assurance would perhaps have been too strong do nothing of the kind said mr beauchamp beauclerk if any one asks you a question at any meeting say that you are a protestant but it isnt likely as we have none but our own people dont go writing letters  but unfortunately the gift of an altar to st fabricius was such a godsend that sundry priests about the country were determined to cling to the good man who had bestowed his money so well i think that many of them did believe that this was a great sign of a beauteous stirring of peoples minds in favour of rome the fervent romanists have always this point in their favour that they are ready to believe and they have a desire for the conversion of men which is honest in an exactly inverse ratio to the dishonesty of the means which they employ to produce it father barham was ready to sacrifice anything personal to himself in the good causehis time his health his money when he had any and his life much as he liked the comfort of carbury hall he would never for a moment condescend to ensure its continued enjoyment by reticence as to his religion roger carbury was hard of heart he could see that but the dropping of water might hollow the stone if the dropping should be put an end to by outward circumstances before the stone had been impressed that would not be his fault he at any rate would do his duty in that fixed resolution father barham was admirable but he had no scruple whatsoever as to the nature of the arguments he would useor as to the facts which he would proclaim with the mingled ignorance of his life and the positiveness of his faith he had at once made up his mind that melmotte was a great man and that he might be made a great instrument on behalf of the pope he believed in the enormous proportions of the mans wealthbelieved that he was powerful in all quarters of the globeand believed because he was so told by the surplice that the man was at heart a catholic that a man should be at heart a catholic and live in the world professing the protestant religion was not to father barham either improbable or distressing kings who had done so were to him objects of veneration by such subterfuges and falsehood of life had they been best able to keep alive the spark of heavenly fire there was a mystery and religious intrigue in this which recommended itself to the young priests mind but it was clear to him that this was a peculiar timein which it behoved an earnest man to be doing something he had for some weeks been preparing himself for a trip to london in order that he might spend a week in retreat with kindred souls who from time to time betook themselves to the cells of st fabricius and so just at this season of the westminster election father barham made a journey to london  he had conceived the great idea of having a word or two with mr melmotte himself he thought that he might be convinced by a word or two as to the mans faith and he thought also that it might be a happiness to him hereafter to have had intercourse with a man who was perhaps destined to be the means of restoring the true faith to his country on saturday nightthat saturday night on which mr melmotte had so successfully exercised his greatness at the india officehe took up his quarters in the cloisters of st fabricius he spent a goodly festive sunday among the various romanist church services of the metropolis and on the monday morning he sallied forth in quest of mr melmotte having obtained that address from some circular he went first to abchurch lane but on this day and on the next which would be the day of the election mr melmotte was not expected in the city and the priest was referred to his present private residence in bruton street there he was told that the great man might probably be found in grosvenor square and at the house in the square father barham was at last successful mr melmotte was there superintending the arrangements for the entertainment of the emperor  the servants or more probably the workmen must have been at fault in giving the priest admittance but in truth the house was in great confusion the wreaths of flowers and green boughs were being suspended last daubs of heavy gilding were being given to the wooden capitals of mock pilasters incense was being burned to kill the smell of the paint tables were being fixed and chairs were being moved and an enormous set of open presses were being nailed together for the accommodation of hats and cloaks the hall was chaos and poor father barham who had heard a good deal of the westminster election but not a word of the intended entertainment of the emperor was at a loss to conceive for what purpose these operations were carried on but through the chaos he made his way and did soon find himself in the presence of mr melmotte in the banqueting hall  mr melmotte was attended both by lord alfred and his son he was standing in front of the chair which had been arranged for the emperor with his hat on one side of his head and he was very angry indeed he had been given to understand when the dinner was first planned that he was to sit opposite to his august guestby which he had conceived that he was to have a seat immediately in face of the emperor of emperors of the brother of the sun of the celestial one himself it was now explained to him that this could not be done in face of the emperor there must be a wide space so that his majesty might be able to look down the hall and the royal princesses who sat next to the emperor and the royal princes who sat next to the princesses must also be so indulged and in this way mr melmottes own seat became really quite obscure lord alfred was having a very bad time of it its that fellow from the herald office did it not me he said almost in a passion i dont know how people ought to sit but thats the reason  im d if im going to be treated in this way in my own house were the first words which the priest heard and as father barham walked up the room and came close to the scene of action unperceived by either of the grendalls mr melmotte was trying but trying in vain to move his own seat nearer to imperial majesty a bar had been put up of such a nature that melmotte sitting in the seat prepared for him would absolutely be barred out from the centre of his own hall who the d are you he asked when the priest appeared close before his eyes on the inner or more imperial side of the bar it was not the habit of father barhams life to appear in sleek apparel he was ever clothed in the very rustiest brown black that age can produce in beccles where he was known it signified little but in the halls of the great one in grosvenor square perhaps the strangers welcome was cut to the measure of his outer man a comely priest in glossy black might have been received with better grace  father barham stood humbly with his hat off he was a man of infinite pluck but outward humilityat any rate at the commencement of an enterprisewas the rule of his life i am the rev mr barham said the visitor i am the priest of beccles in suffolk i believe i am speaking to mr melmotte  thats my name sir and what may you want i dont know whether you are aware that you have found your way into my private diningroom without any introduction where the mischief are the fellows alfred who ought to have seen about this i wish youd look to it miles can anybody who pleases walk into my hall  i came on a mission which i hope may be pleaded as my excuse said the priest although he was bold he found it difficult to explain his mission had not lord alfred been there he could have done it better in spite of the very repulsive manner of the great man himself  is it business asked lord alfred  certainly it is business said father barham with a smile  then you had better call at the office in abchurch lanein the city said his lordship  my business is not of that nature i am a poor servant of the cross who is anxious to know from the lips of mr melmotte himself that his heart is inclined to the true faith  some lunatic said melmotte see that there aint any knives about alfred  no otherwise mad sir than they have ever been accounted mad who are enthusiastic in their desire for the souls of others  just get a policeman alfred or send somebody youd better not go away  you will hardly need a policeman mr melmotte continued the priest if i might speak to you alone for a few minutes  certainly notcertainly not i am very busy and if you will not go away youll have to be taken away i wonder whether anybody knows him  mr carbury of carbury hall is my friend  carbury d the carburys did any of the carburys send you here a set of beggars why dont you do something alfred to get rid of him  youd better go said lord alfred dont make a rumpus theres a good fellowbut just go  there shall be no rumpus said the priest waxing wrathful i asked for you at the door and was told to come in by your own servants have i been uncivil that you should treat me in this fashion  youre in the way said lord alfred  its a piece of gross impertinence said melmotte go away  will you not tell me before i go whether i shall pray for you as one whose steps in the right path should be made sure and firm or as one still in error and in darkness  what the mischief does he mean asked melmotte  he wants to know whether youre a papist said lord alfred  what the deuce is it to him almost screamed melmottewhereupon father barham bowed and took his leave  thats a remarkable thing said melmottevery remarkable even this poor priests mad visit added to his inflation i suppose he was in earnest  mad as a hatter said lord alfred  but why did he come to me in his madnessto me especially thats what i want to know ill tell you what it is there isnt a man in all england at this moment thought of so much asyour humble servant i wonder whether the morning pulpit people sent him here now to find out really what is my religion  mad as a hatter said lord alfred againjust that and no more  my dear fellow i dont think youve the gift of seeing very far the truth is they dont know what to make of meand i dont intend that they shall im playing my game and there isnt one of em understands it except myself its no good my sitting here you know i shant be able to move how am i to get at you if i want anything  what can you want therell be lots of servants about  ill have this bar down at any rate and he did succeed in having removed the bar which had been specially put up to prevent his intrusion on his own guests in his own house i look upon that fellows coming here as a very singular sign of the times he went on to say theyll want before long to know where i have my clothes made and who measures me for my boots perhaps the most remarkable circumstance in the career of this remarkable man was the fact that he came almost to believe in himself  father barham went away certainly disgusted and yet not altogether disheartened the man had not declared that he was not a roman catholic he had shown himself to be a brute he had blasphemed and cursed he had been outrageously uncivil to a man whom he must have known to be a minister of god he had manifested himself to this priest who had been born an english gentleman as being no gentleman but not the less might he be a good catholicor good enough at any rate to be influential on the right side to his eyes melmotte with all his insolent vulgarity was infinitely a more hopeful man than roger carbury he insulted me said father barham to a brother religionist that evening within the cloisters of st fabricius  did he intend to insult you  certainly he did but what of that it is not by the hands of polished men nor even of the courteous that this work has to be done he was preparing for some great festival and his mind was intent upon that  he entertains the emperor of china this very day said the brother priest who as a resident in london heard from time to time what was being done  the emperor of china ah that accounts for it i do think that he is on our side even though he gave me but little encouragement for saying so will they vote for him here at westminster  our people will they think that he is rich and can help them  there is no doubt of his wealth i suppose said father barham  some people do doubtbut others say he is the richest man in the world  he looked like itand spoke like it said father barham think what such a man might do if he be really the wealthiest man in the world and if he had been against us would he not have said so though he was uncivil i am glad that i saw him father barham with a simplicity that was singularly mingled with his religious cunning made himself believe before he returned to beccles that mr melmotte was certainly a roman catholic     chapter lvii  lord nidderdale tries his hand again   lord nidderdale had half consented to renew his suit to marie melmotte he had at any rate half promised to call at melmottes house on the sunday with the object of so doing as far as that promise had been given it was broken for on the sunday he was not seen in bruton street though not much given to severe thinking he did feel that on this occasion there was need for thought his fathers property was not very large his father and his grandfather had both been extravagant men and he himself had done something towards adding to the family embarrassments it had been an understood thing since he had commenced life that he was to marry an heiress in such families as his when such results have been achieved it is generally understood that matters shall be put right by an heiress it has become an institution like primogeniture and is almost as serviceable for maintaining the proper order of things rank squanders money trade makes itand then trade purchases rank by regilding its splendour the arrangement as it affects the aristocracy generally is well understood and was quite approved of by the old marquisso that he had felt himself to be justified in eating up the property which his sons future marriage would renew as a matter of course nidderdale himself had never dissented had entertained no fanciful theory opposed to this view had never alarmed his father by any liaison tending towards matrimony with any undowered beautybut had claimed his right to have his fling before he devoted himself to the reintegration of the family property his father had felt that it would be wrong and might probably be foolish to oppose so natural a desire he had regarded all the circumstances of the fling with indulgent eyes but there arose some little difference as to the duration of the fling and the father had at last found himself compelled to inform his son that if the fling were carried on much longer it must be done with internecine war between himself and his heir nidderdale whose sense and temper were alike good saw the thing quite in the proper light he assured his father that he had no intention of cutting up rough declared that he was ready for the heiress as soon as the heiress should be put in his way and set himself honestly about the task imposed on him this had all been arranged at auld reekie castle during the last winter and the reader knows the result  but the affair had assumed abnormal difficulties perhaps the marquis had been wrong in flying at wealth which was reputed to be almost unlimited but which was not absolutely fixed a couple of hundred thousand pounds down might have been secured with greater ease but here there had been a prospect of endless moneyof an inheritance which might not improbably make the auld reekie family conspicuous for its wealth even among the most wealthy of the nobility the old man had fallen into the temptation and abnormal difficulties had been the result some of these the reader knows latterly two difficulties had culminated above the others the young lady preferred another gentleman and disagreeable stories were afloat not only as to the way in which the money had been made but even as to its very existence  the marquis however was a man who hated to be beaten as far as he could learn from inquiry the money would be there or at least so much money as had been promised a considerable sum sufficient to secure the bridegroom from absolute shipwreckthough by no means enough to make a brilliant marriagehad in truth been already settled on marie and was indeed in her possession as to that her father had armed himself with a power of attorney for drawing the incomebut had made over the property to his daughter so that in the event of unforeseen accidents on change he might retire to obscure comfort and have the means perhaps of beginning again with whitewashed cleanliness when doing this he had doubtless not anticipated the grandeur to which he would soon rise or the fact that he was about to embark on seas so dangerous that this little harbour of refuge would hardly offer security to his vessel marie had been quite correct in her story to her favoured lover and the marquiss lawyer had ascertained that if marie ever married before she herself had restored this money to her father her husband would be so far safewith this as a certainty and the immense remainder in prospect the marquis had determined to persevere pickering was to be added mr melmotte had been asked to depone the titledeeds and had promised to do so as soon as the day of the wedding should have been fixed with the consent of all the parties the marquiss lawyer had ventured to express a doubt but the marquis had determined to persevere the reader will i trust remember that those dreadful misgivings which are i trust agitating his own mind have been borne in upon him by information which had not as yet reached the marquis in all its details  but nidderdale had his doubts that absurd elopement which melmotte declared really to mean nothingthe romance of a girl who wanted to have one little fling of her own before she settled down for life was perhaps his strongest objection sir felix no doubt had not gone with her but then one doesnt wish to have ones intended wife even attempt to run off with any one but oneself shell be sick of him by this time i should say his father said to him what does it matter if the moneys there the marquis seemed to think that the escapade had simply been the girls revenge against his son for having made his arrangements so exclusively with melmotte instead of devoting himself to her nidderdale acknowledged to himself that he had been remiss he told himself that she was possessed of more spirit than he had thought by the sunday evening he had determined that he would try again he had expected that the plum would fall into his mouth he would now stretch out his hand to pick it  on the monday he went to the house in bruton street at lunch time melmotte and the two grendalls had just come over from their work in the square and the financier was full of the priests visit to him madame melmotte was there and miss longestaffe who was to be sent for by her friend lady monogram that afternoonand after they had sat down marie came in nidderdale got up and shook hands with her of course as though nothing had happened marie putting a brave face upon it struggling hard in the midst of very real difficulties succeeded in saying an ordinary word or two her position was uncomfortable a girl who has run away with her lover and has been brought back again by her friends must for a time find it difficult to appear in society with ease but when a girl has run away without her loverhas run away expecting her lover to go with her and has then been brought back her lover not having stirred her state of mind must be peculiarly harassing but maries courage was good and she ate her lunch even though she sat next to lord nidderdale  melmotte was very gracious to the young lord did you ever hear anything like that nidderdale he said speaking of the priests visit  mad as a hatter said lord alfred  i dont know much about his madness i shouldnt wonder if he had been sent by the archbishop of westminster why dont we have an archbishop of westminster when theyve got one i shall have to see to that when im in the house i suppose there is a bishop isnt there alfred alfred shook his head theres a dean i know for i called on him he told me flat he wouldnt vote for me i thought all those parsons were conservatives it didnt occur to me that the fellow had come from the archbishop or i would have been more civil to him  mad as a hatternothing else said lord alfred  you should have seen him nidderdale it would have been as good as a play to you  i suppose you didnt ask him to the dinner sir  d the dinner im sick of it said melmotte frowning we must go back again alfred those fellows will never get along if they are not looked after come miles ladies i shall expect you to be ready at exactly a quarter before eight his imperial majesty is to arrive at eight precisely and i must be there to receive him you madame will have to receive your guests in the drawingroom the ladies went upstairs and lord nidderdale followed them miss longestaffe took her departure alleging that she couldnt keep her dear friend lady monogram waiting for her then there fell upon madame melmotte the duty of leaving the young people together a duty which she found a great difficulty in performing after all that had happened she did not know how to get up and go out of the room as regarded herself the troubles of these troublous times were becoming almost too much for her she had no pleasure from her grandeurand probably no belief in her husbands achievements it was her present duty to assist in getting marie married to this young man and that duty she could only do by going away but she did not know how to get out of her chair she expressed in fluent french her abhorrence of the emperor and her wish that she might be allowed to remain in bed during the whole evening she liked nidderdale better than any one else who came there and wondered at maries preference for sir felix lord nidderdale assured her that nothing was so easy as kings and emperors because no one was expected to say anything she sighed and shook her head and wished again that she might be allowed to go to bed marie who was by degrees plucking up her courage declared that though kings and emperors were horrors as a rule she thought an emperor of china would be good fun then madame melmotte also plucked up her courage rose from her chair and made straight for the door mamma where are you going said marie also rising madame melmotte putting her handkerchief up to her face declared that she was being absolutely destroyed by a toothache i must see if i cant do something for her said marie hurrying to the door but lord nidderdale was too quick for her and stood with his back to it thats a shame said marie  your mother has gone on purpose that i may speak to you said his lordship why should you grudge me the opportunity  marie returned to her chair and again seated herself she also had thought much of her own position since her return from liverpool why had sir felix not been there why had he not come since her return and at any rate endeavoured to see her why had he made no attempt to write to her had it been her part to do so she would have found a hundred ways of getting at him she absolutely had walked inside the garden of the square on sunday morning and had contrived to leave a gate open on each side but he had made no sign her father had told her that he had not gone to liverpooland had assured her that he had never intended to go melmotte had been very savage with her about the money and had loudly accused sir felix of stealing it the repayment he never mentioneda piece of honesty indeed which had showed no virtue on the part of sir felix but even if he had spent the money why was he not man enough to come and say so marie could have forgiven that faultcould have forgiven even the gambling and the drunkenness which had caused the failure of the enterprise on his side if he had had the courage to come and confess to her what she could not forgive was continued indifferenceor the cowardice which forbade him to show himself she had more than once almost doubted his love though as a lover he had been better than nidderdale but now as far as she could see he was ready to consent that the thing should be considered as over between them no doubt she could write to him she had more than once almost determined to do so but then she had reflected that if he really loved her he would come to her she was quite ready to run away with a lover if her lover loved her but she would not fling herself at a mans head therefore she had done nothing beyond leaving the garden gates open on the sunday morning  but what was she to do with herself she also felt she knew not why that the present turmoil of her fathers life might be brought to an end by some dreadful convulsion no girl could be more anxious to be married and taken away from her home if sir felix did not appear again what should she do she had seen enough of life to be aware that suitors would comewould come as long as that convulsion was staved off she did not suppose that her journey to liverpool would frighten all the men away but she had thought that it would put an end to lord nidderdales courtship and when her father had commanded her shaking her by the shoulders to accept lord nidderdale when he should come on sunday she had replied by expressing her assurance that lord nidderdale would never be seen at that house any more on the sunday he had not come but here he was now standing with his back to the drawingroom door and cutting off her retreat with the evident intention of renewing his suit she was determined at any rate that she would speak up i dont know what you should have to say to me lord nidderdale  why shouldnt i have something to say to you  because oh you know why besides ive told you ever so often my lord i thought a gentleman would never go on with a lady when the lady has told him that she liked somebody else better  perhaps i dont believe you when you tell me  well that is impudent you may believe it then i think ive given you reason to believe it at any rate  you cant be very fond of him now i should think  thats all you know about it my lord why shouldnt i be fond of him accidents will happen you know  i dont want to make any allusion to anything thats unpleasant miss melmotte  you may say just what you please all the world knows about it of course i went to liverpool and of course papa had me brought back again  why did not sir felix go  i dont think my lord that that can be any business of yours  but i think that it is and ill tell you why you might as well let me say what ive got to sayout at once  you may say what you like but it cant make any difference  you knew me before you knew him you know  what does that matter if it comes to that i knew ever so many people before i knew you  and you were engaged to me  you broke it off  listen to me for a moment or two i know i did or rather your father and my father broke it off for us  if we had cared for each other they couldnt have broken it off nobody in the world could break me off as long as i felt that he really loved menot if they were to cut me in pieces but you didnt care not a bit you did it just because your father told you and so did i but i know better than that now you never cared for me a bit more than for the old woman at the crossing you thought i didnt understandbut i did and now youve come again because your father has told you again and youd better go away  theres a great deal of truth in what you say  its all true my lord every word of it  i wish you wouldnt call me my lord  i suppose you are a lord and therefore i shall call you so i never called you anything else when they pretended that we were to be married and you never asked me i never even knew what your name was till i looked it out in the book after i had consented  there is truth in what you saybut it isnt true now how was i to love you when i had seen so little of you i do love you now  then you needntfor it isnt any good  i do love you now and i think youd find that i should be truer to you than that fellow who wouldnt take the trouble to go down to liverpool with you  you dont know why he didnt go  wellperhaps i do but i did not come here to say anything about that  why didnt he go lord nidderdale she asked the question with an altered tone and an altered face if you really know you might as well tell me  no mariethats just what i ought not to do but he ought to tell you do you really in your heart believe that he means to come back to you  i dont know she said sobbing i do love himi do indeed i know that you are goodnatured you are more goodnatured than he is but he did like me you never didno not a bit it isnt true i aint a fool i know nogo away i wont let you now i dont care what he is ill be true to him go away lord nidderdale you oughtnt to go on like that because papa and mamma let you come here i didnt let you come i dont want you to come noi wont say any kind word to you i love sir felix carbury betterthan any personin all the world there i dont know whether you call that kind but its true  say goodbye to me marie  oh i dont mind saying goodbye goodbye my lord and dont come any more  yes i shall goodbye marie youll find the difference between me and him yet so he took his leave and as he sauntered away he thought that upon the whole he had prospered considering the extreme difficulties under which he had laboured in carrying on his suit shes quite a different sort of girl from what i took her to be he said to himself upon my word shes awfully jolly  marie when the interview was over walked about the room almost in dismay it was borne in upon her by degrees that sir felix carbury was not at all points quite as nice as she had thought him of his beauty there was no doubt but then she could trust him for no other good quality why did he not come to her why did he not show some pluck why did he not tell her the truth she had quite believed lord nidderdale when he said that he knew the cause that had kept sir felix from going to liverpool and she had believed him too when he said that it was not his business to tell her but the reason let it be what it might must if known be prejudicial to her love lord nidderdale was she thought not at all beautiful he had a commonplace rough face with a turnup nose high cheek bones no especial complexion sandycoloured whiskers and bright laughing eyesnot at all an adonis such as her imagination had painted but if he had only made love at first as he had attempted to do it now she thought that she would have submitted herself to be cut in pieces for him     chapter lviii  mr squercum is employed   while these things were being done in bruton street and grosvenor square horrid rumours were prevailing in the city and spreading from the city westwards to the house of commons which was sitting this monday afternoon with a prospect of an adjournment at seven oclock in consequence of the banquet to be given to the emperor it is difficult to explain the exact nature of this rumour as it was not thoroughly understood by those who propagated it but it is certainly the case that the word forgery was whispered by more than one pair of lips  many of melmottes staunchest supporters thought that he was very wrong not to show himself that day in the city what good could he do pottering about among the chairs and benches in the banqueting room there were people to manage that kind of thing in such an affair it was his business to do simply as he was told and to pay the bill it was not as though he were giving a little dinner to a friend and had to see himself that the wine was brought up in good order his work was in the city and at such a time as this and in such a crisis as this he should have been in the city men will whisper forgery behind a mans back who would not dare even to think it before his face  of this particular rumour our young friend dolly longestaffe was the parent with unhesitating resolution nothing awed by his father dolly had gone to his attorney mr squercum immediately after that friday on which mr longestaffe first took his seat at the railway board dolly was possessed of fine qualities but it must be owned that veneration was not one of them i dont know why mr melmotte is to be different from anybody else he had said to his father when i buy a thing and dont pay for it it is because i havent got the tin and i suppose its about the same with him its all right no doubt but i dont see why he should have got hold of the place till the money was paid down  of course its all right said the father you think you understand everything when you really understand nothing at all  of course im slow said dolly i dont comprehend these things but then squercum does when a fellow is stupid himself he ought to have a sharp fellow to look after his business  youll ruin me and yourself too if you go to such a man as that why cant you trust mr bideawhile slow and bideawhile have been the family lawyers for a century dolly made some remark as to the old family advisers which was by no means pleasing to the fathers ears and went his way the father knew his boy and knew that his boy would go to squercum all he could himself do was to press mr melmotte for the money with what importunity he could assume he wrote a timid letter to mr melmotte which had no result and then on the next friday again went into the city and there encountered perturbation of spirit and sheer loss of timeas the reader has already learned  squercum was a thorn in the side of all the bideawhiles mr slow had been gathered to his fathers but of the bideawhiles there were three in the business a father and two sons to whom squercum was a pest and a musquito a running sore and a skeleton in the cupboard it was not only in reference to mr longestaffes affairs that they knew squercum the bideawhiles piqued themselves on the decorous and orderly transaction of their business it had grown to be a rule in the house that anything done quickly must be done badly they never were in a hurry for money and they expected their clients never to be in a hurry for work squercum was the very opposite to this he had established himself without predecessors and without a partner and we may add without capital at a little office in fetter lane and had there made a character for getting things done after a marvellous and new fashion and it was said of him that he was fairly honest though it must be owned that among the bideawhiles of the profession this was not the character which he bore he did sharp things no doubt and had no hesitation in supporting the interests of sons against those of their fathers in more than one case he had computed for a young heir the exact value of his share in a property as compared to that of his father and had come into hostile contact with many family bideawhiles he had been closely watched there were some who no doubt would have liked to crush a man who was at once so clever and so pestilential but he had not as yet been crushed and had become quite in vogue with elder sons some three years since his name had been mentioned to dolly by a friend who had for years been at war with his father and squercum had been quite a comfort to dolly  he was a meanlooking little man not yet above forty who always wore a stiff lightcoloured cotton cravat an old dress coat a coloured dingy waistcoat and light trousers of some hue different from his waistcoat he generally had on dirty shoes and gaiters he was lighthaired with light whiskers with puttyformed features a squat nose a large mouth and very bright blue eyes he looked as unlike the normal bideawhile of the profession as a man could be and it must be owned though an attorney would hardly have been taken for a gentleman from his personal appearance he was very quick and active in his motions absolutely doing his law work himself and trusting to his three or four juvenile clerks for little more than scriveners labour he seldom or never came to his office on a saturday and many among his enemies said that he was a jew what evil will not a rival say to stop the flow of grist to the mill of the hated one but this report squercum rather liked and assisted they who knew the inner life of the little man declared that he kept a horse and hunted down in essex on saturday doing a bit of gardening in the summer months and they said also that he made up for this by working hard all sunday such was mr squercuma sign in his way that the old things are being changed  squercum sat at a desk covered with papers in chaotic confusion on a chair which moved on a pivot his desk was against the wall and when clients came to him he turned himself sharp round sticking out his dirty shoes throwing himself back till his body was an inclined plane with his hands thrust into his pockets in this attitude he would listen to his clients story and would himself speak as little as possible it was by his instructions that dolly had insisted on getting his share of the purchase money for pickering into his own hands so that the incumbrance on his own property might be paid off he now listened as dolly told him of the delay in the payment melmottes at pickering asked the attorney then dolly informed him how the tradesmen of the great financier had already half knocked down the house squercum still listened and promised to look to it he did ask what authority dolly had given for the surrender of the titledeeds dolly declared that he had given authority for the sale but none for the surrender his father some time since had put before him for his signature a letter prepared in mr bideawhiles office which dolly said that he had refused even to read and certainly had not signed squercum again said that hed look to it and bowed dolly out of his room theyve got him to sign something when he was tight said squercum to himself knowing something of the habits of his client i wonder whether his father did it or old bideawhile or melmotte himself mr squercum was inclined to think that bideawhile would not have done it that melmotte could have had no opportunity and that the father must have been the practitioner its not the trick of a pompous old fool either said mr squercum in his soliloquy he went to work however making himself detestably odious among the very respectable clerks in mr bideawhiles office men who considered themselves to be altogether superior to squercum himself in professional standing  and now there came this rumour which was so far particular in its details that it inferred the forgery of which it accused mr melmotte to his mode of acquiring the pickering property the nature of the forgery was of course described in various waysas was also the signature said to have been forged but there were many who believed or almost believed that something wrong had been donethat some great fraud had been committed and in connection with this it was ascertainedby some as a matter of certaintythat the pickering estate had been already mortgaged by melmotte to its full value at an assurance office in such a transaction there would be nothing dishonest but as this place had been bought for the great mans own family use and not as a speculation even this report of the mortgage tended to injure his credit and then as the day went on other tidings were told as to other properties houses in the eastend of london were said to have been bought and sold without payment of the purchase money as to the buying and with receipt of the purchase money as to the selling  it was certainly true that squercum himself had seen the letter in mr bideawhiles office which conveyed to the fathers lawyer the sons sanction for the surrender of the titledeeds and that that letter prepared in mr bideawhiles office purported to have dollys signature squercum said but little remembering that his client was not always clear in the morning as to anything he had done on the preceding evening but the signature though it was scrawled as dolly always scrawled it was not like the scrawl of a drunken man  the letter was said to have been sent to mr bideawhiles office with other letters and papers direct from old mr longestaffe such was the statement made at first to mr squercum by the bideawhile party who at that moment had no doubt of the genuineness of the letter or of the accuracy of their statement then squercum saw his client again and returned to the charge at bideawhiles office with the positive assurance that the signature was a forgery dolly when questioned by squercum quite admitted his propensity to be tight he had no reticence no feeling of disgrace on such matters but he had signed no letter when he was tight never did such a thing in my life and nothing could make me said dolly im never tight except at the club and the letter couldnt have been there ill be drawn and quartered if i ever signed it thats flat dolly was intent on going to his father at once on going to melmotte at once on going to bideawhiles at once and making there no end of a rowbut squercum stopped him well just ferret this thing out quietly said squercum who perhaps thought that there would be high honour in discovering the peccadillos of so great a man as mr melmotte mr longestaffe the father had heard nothing of the matter till the saturday after his last interview with melmotte in the city he had then called at bideawhiles office in lincolns inn fields and had been shown the letter he declared at once that he had never sent the letter to mr bideawhile he had begged his son to sign the letter and his son had refused he did not at that moment distinctly remember what he had done with the letter unsigned he believed he had left it with the other papers but it was possible that his son might have taken it away he acknowledged that at the time he had been both angry and unhappy he didnt think that he could have sent the letter back unsignedbut he was not sure he had more than once been in his own study in bruton street since mr melmotte had occupied the houseby that gentlemans leavehaving left various papers there under his own lock and key indeed it had been matter of agreement that he should have access to his own study when he let the house he thought it probable that he would have kept back the unsigned letter and have kept it under lock and key when he sent away the other papers then reference was made to mr longestaffes own letter to the lawyer and it was found that he had not even alluded to that which his son had been asked to sign but that he had said in his own usually pompous style that mr longestaffe junior was still prone to create unsubstantial difficulties mr bideawhile was obliged to confess that there had been a want of caution among his own people this allusion to the creation of difficulties by dolly accompanied as it was supposed to have been by dollys letter doing away with all difficulties should have attracted notice dollys letter must have come in a separate envelope but such envelope could not be found and the circumstance was not remembered by the clerk the clerk who had prepared the letter for dollys signature represented himself as having been quite satisfied when the letter came again beneath his notice with dollys wellknown signature  such were the facts as far as they were known at messrs slow and bideawhiles officefrom whom no slightest rumour emanated and as they had been in part collected by squercum who was probably less prudent the bideawhiles were still perfectly sure that dolly had signed the letter believing the young man to be quite incapable of knowing on any day what he had done on the day before  squercum was quite sure that his client had not signed it and it must be owned on dollys behalf that his manner on this occasion was qualified to convince yes he said to squercum its easy saying that im lackadaisical but i know when im lackadaisical and when im not awake or asleep drunk or sober i never signed that letter and mr squercum believed him  it would be hard to say how the rumour first got into the city on this monday morning though the elder longestaffe had first heard of the matter only on the previous saturday mr squercum had been at work for above a week mr squercums little matter alone might hardly have attracted the attention which certainly was given on this day to mr melmottes private affairsbut other facts coming to light assisted squercums views a great many shares of the south central pacific and mexican railway had been thrown upon the market all of which had passed through the hands of mr cohenlupeand mr cohenlupe in the city had been all to mr melmotte as lord alfred had been at the west end then there was the mortgage of this pickering property for which the money certainly had not been paid and there was the traffic with half a street of houses near the commercial road by which a large sum of money had come into mr melmottes hands it might no doubt all be right there were many who thought that it would all be right there were not a few who expressed the most thorough contempt for these rumours but it was felt to be a pity that mr melmotte was not in the city  this was the day of the dinner the lord mayor had even made up his mind that he would not go to the dinner what one of his brother aldermen said to him about leaving others in the lurch might be quite true but as his lordship remarked melmotte was a commercial man and as these were commercial transactions it behoved the lord mayor of london to be more careful than other men he had always had his doubts and he would not go others of the chosen few of the city who had been honoured with commands to meet the emperor resolved upon absenting themselves unless the lord mayor went the affair was very much discussed and there were no less than six declared city defaulters at the last moment a seventh was taken ill and sent a note to miles grendall excusing himself which was thrust into the secretarys hands just as the emperor arrived  but a reverse worse than this took placea defalcation more injurious to the melmotte interests generally even than that which was caused either by the prudence or by the cowardice of the city magnates the house of commons at its meeting had heard the tidings in an exaggerated form it was whispered about that melmotte had been detected in forging the deed of conveyance of a large property and that he had already been visited by policemen by some it was believed that the great financier would lie in the hands of the philistines while the emperor of china was being fed at his house in the third edition of the evening pulpit came out a mysterious paragraph which nobody could understand but they who had known all about it before a rumour is prevalent that frauds to an enormous extent have been committed by a gentleman whose name we are particularly unwilling to mention if it be so it is indeed remarkable that they should have come to light at the present moment we cannot trust ourselves to say more than this no one wishes to dine with a swindler no one likes even to have dined with a swindlerespecially to have dined with him at a time when his swindling was known or suspected the emperor of china no doubt was going to dine with this man the motions of emperors are managed with such ponderous care that it was held to be impossible now to save the country from what would doubtless be felt to be a disgrace if it should hereafter turn out that a forger had been solicited to entertain the imperial guest of the country nor was the thing as yet so far certain as to justify such a charge were it possible but many men were unhappy in their minds how would the story be told hereafter if melmotte should be allowed to play out his game of host to the emperor and be arrested for forgery as soon as the eastern monarch should have left his house how would the brother of the sun like the remembrance of the banquet which he had been instructed to honour with his presence how would it tell in all the foreign newspapers in new york in paris and vienna that this man who had been cast forth from the united states from france and from austria had been selected as the great and honourable type of british commerce there were those in the house who thought that the absolute consummation of the disgrace might yet be avoided and who were of opinion that the dinner should be postponed the leader of the opposition had a few words on the subject with the prime minister it is the merest rumour said the prime minister i have inquired and there is nothing to justify me in thinking that the charges can be substantiated  they say that the story is believed in the city  i should not feel myself justified in acting upon such a report the prince might probably find it impossible not to go where should we be if mr melmotte tomorrow were able to prove the whole to be a calumny and to show that the thing had been got up with a view of influencing the election at westminster the dinner must certainly go on  and you will go yourself  most assuredly said the prime minister and i hope that you will keep me in countenance his political antagonist declared with a smile that at such a crisis he would not desert his honourable friendbut he could not answer for his followers there was he admitted a strong feeling among the leaders of the conservative party of distrust in melmotte he considered it probable that among his friends who had been invited there would be some who would be unwilling to meet even the emperor of china on the existing terms they should remember said the prime minister that they are also to meet their own prince and that empty seats on such an occasion will be a dishonour to him  just at present i can only answer for myself said the leader of the oppositionat that moment even the prime minister was much disturbed in his mind but in such emergencies a prime minister can only choose the least of two evils to have taken the emperor to dine with a swindler would be very bad but to desert him and to stop the coming of the emperor and all the princes on a false rumour would be worse     chapter lix  the dinner   it does sometimes occur in life that an unambitious man who is in no degree given to enterprises who would fain be safe is driven by the cruelty of circumstances into a position in which he must choose a side and in which though he has no certain guide as to which side he should choose he is aware that he will be disgraced if he should take the wrong side this was felt as a hardship by many who were quite suddenly forced to make up their mind whether they would go to melmottes dinner or join themselves to the faction of those who had determined to stay away although they had accepted invitations some there were not without a suspicion that the story against melmotte had been got up simply as an electioneering trickso that mr alf might carry the borough on the next day as a dodge for an election this might be very well but any who might be deterred by such a manoeuvre from meeting the emperor and supporting the prince would surely be marked men and none of the wives when they were consulted seemed to care a straw whether melmotte was a swindler or not would the emperor and the princes and princesses be there this was the only question which concerned them they did not care whether melmotte was arrested at the dinner or after the dinner so long as they with others could show their diamonds in the presence of eastern and western royalty but yetwhat a fiasco would it be if at this very instant of time the host should be apprehended for common forgery the great thing was to ascertain whether others were going if a hundred or more out of the two hundred were to be absent how dreadful would be the position of those who were present and how would the thing go if at the last moment the emperor should be kept away the prime minister had decided that the emperor and the prince should remain altogether in ignorance of the charges which were preferred against the man but of that these doubters were unaware there was but little time for a man to go about town and pick up the truth from those who were really informed and questions were asked in an uncomfortable and restless manner is your grace going said lionel lupton to the duchess of stevenagehaving left the house and gone into the park between six and seven to pick up some hints among those who were known to have been invited the duchess was lord alfreds sister and of course she was going i usually keep engagements when i make them mr lupton said the duchess she had been assured by lord alfred not a quarter of an hour before that everything was as straight as a die lord alfred had not then even heard of the rumour but ultimately both lionel lupton and beauchamp beauclerk attended the dinner they had received special tickets as supporters of mr melmotte at the electionout of the scanty number allotted to that gentleman himselfand they thought themselves bound in honour to be there but they with their leader and one other influential member of the party were all who at last came as the political friends of the candidate for westminster the existing ministers were bound to attend to the emperor and the prince but members of the opposition by their presence would support the man and the politician and both as a man and as a politician they were ashamed of him  when melmotte arrived at his own door with his wife and daughter he had heard nothing of the matter that a man so vexed with affairs of money so laden with cares encompassed by such dangers should be free from suspicion and fear it is impossible to imagine that such burdens should be borne at all is a wonder to those whose shoulders have never been broadened for such workas is the strength of the blacksmiths arm to men who have never wielded a hammer surely his whole life must have been a life of terrors but of any special peril to which he was at that moment subject or of any embarrassment which might affect the work of the evening he knew nothing he placed his wife in the drawingroom and himself in the hall and arranged his immediate satellites around himamong whom were included the two grendalls young nidderdale and mr cohenlupewith a feeling of gratified glory nidderdale down at the house had heard the rumour but had determined that he would not as yet fly from his colours cohenlupe had also come up from the house where no one had spoken to him though grievously frightened during the last fortnight he had not dared to be on the wing as yet and indeed to what clime could such a bird as he fly in safety he had not only heardbut also knew very much and was not prepared to enjoy the feast since they had been in the hall miles had spoken dreadful words to his father youve heard about it havent you whispered miles lord alfred remembering his sisters question became almost pale but declared that he had heard nothing theyre saying all manner of things in the cityforgery and heaven knows what the lord mayor is not coming lord alfred made no reply it was the philosophy of his life that misfortunes when they came should be allowed to settle themselves but he was unhappy  the grand arrivals were fairly punctual and the very grand people all came the unfortunate emperorwe must consider a man to be unfortunate who is compelled to go through such work as thiswith impassible and awful dignity was marshalled into the room on the ground floor whence he and other royalties were to be marshalled back into the banqueting hall melmotte bowing to the ground walked backwards before him and was probably taken by the emperor for some court master of the ceremonies especially selected to walk backwards on this occasion the princes had all shaken hands with their host and the princesses had bowed graciously nothing of the rumour had as yet been whispered in royal palaces besides royalty the company allowed to enter the room downstairs was very select the prime minister one archbishop two duchesses and an exgovernor of india with whose features the emperor was supposed to be peculiarly familiar were alone there the remainder of the company under the superintendence of lord alfred were received in the drawingroom above everything was going on well and they who had come and had thought of not coming were proud of their wisdom  but when the company was seated at dinner the deficiencies were visible enough and were unfortunate who does not know the effect made by the absence of one or two from a table intended for ten or twelvehow grievous are the empty places how destructive of the outward harmony and grace which the hostess has endeavoured to preserve are these interstices how the lady in her wrath declares to herself that those guilty ones shall never have another opportunity of filling a seat at her table some twenty most of whom had been asked to bring their wives had slunk from their engagements and the empty spaces were sufficient to declare a united purpose a week since it had been understood that admission for the evening could not be had for love or money and that a seat at the dinnertable was as a seat at some banquet of the gods now it looked as though the room were but halffilled there were six absences from the city another six of mr melmottes own political party were away the archbishops and the bishop were there because bishops never hear worldly tidings till after other peoplebut that very master of the buckhounds for whom so much pressure had been made did not come two or three peers were absent and so also was that editor who had been chosen to fill mr alfs place one poet two painters and a philosopher had received timely notice at their clubs and had gone home the three independent members of the house of commons for once agreed in their policy and would not lend the encouragement of their presence to a man suspected of forgery nearly forty places were vacant when the business of the dinner commenced  melmotte had insisted that lord alfred should sit next to himself at the big table and having had the objectionable bar removed and his own chair shoved one step nearer to the centre had carried his point with the anxiety natural to such an occasion he glanced repeatedly round the hall and of course became aware that many were absent how is it that there are so many places empty he said to his faithful achates  dont know said achates shaking his head steadfastly refusing to look round upon the hall  melmotte waited awhile then looked round again and asked the question in another shape hasnt there been some mistake about the numbers theres room for ever so many more  dont know said lord alfred who was unhappy in his mind and repenting himself that he had ever seen mr melmotte  what the deuce do you mean whispered melmotte youve been at it from the beginning and ought to know when i wanted to ask brehgert you swore that you couldnt squeeze a place  cant say anything about it said lord alfred with his eyes fixed upon his plate  ill be d if i dont find out said melmotte theres either some horrible blunder or else theres been imposition i dont see quite clearly wheres sir gregory gribe  hasnt come i suppose  and wheres the lord mayor melmotte in spite of royalty was now sitting with his face turned round upon the hall i know all their places and i know where they were put have you seen the lord mayor  no i havent seen him at all  but he was to come whats the meaning of it alfred  dont know anything about it he shook his head but would not for even a moment look round upon the room  and wheres mr killegrewand sir david boss mr killegrew and sir david were gentlemen of high standing and destined for important offices in the conservative party there are ever so many people not here why theres not above half of them down the room whats up alfred i must know  i tell you i know nothing i could not make them come lord alfreds answers were made not only with a surly voice but also with a surly heart he was keenly alive to the failure and alive also to the feeling that the failure would partly be attached to himself at the present moment he was anxious to avoid observation and it seemed to him that melmotte by the frequency and impetuosity of his questions was drawing special attention to him if you go on making a row he said i shall go away melmotte looked at him with all his eyes just sit quiet and let the thing go on youll know all about it soon enough this was hardly the way to give mr melmotte peace of mind for a few minutes he did sit quiet then he got up and moved down the hall behind the guests  in the meantime imperial majesty and royalties of various denominations ate their dinner without probably observing those banquos seats as the emperor talked manchoo only and as there was no one present who could even interpret manchoo into englishthe imperial interpreter condescending only to interpret manchoo into ordinary chinese which had to be reinterpretedit was not within his imperial majestys power to have much conversation with his neighbours and as his neighbours on each side of him were all cousins and husbands and brothers and wives who saw each constantly under let us presume more comfortable circumstances they had not very much to say to each other like most of us they had their duties to do and like most of us probably found their duties irksome the brothers and sisters and cousins were used to it but that awful emperor solid solemn and silent must if the spirit of an eastern emperor be at all like that of a western man have had a weary time of it he sat there for more than two hours awful solid solemn and silent not eating very muchfor this was not his manner of eating nor drinking very muchfor this was not his manner of drinking but wondering no doubt within his own awful bosom at the changes which were coming when an emperor of china was forced by outward circumstances to sit and hear this buzz of voices and this clatter of knives and forks and this he must have said to himself is what they call royalty in the west if a prince of our own was forced for the good of the country to go among some fardistant outlandish people and there to be poked in the ribs and slapped on the back all round the change to him could hardly be so great  wheres sir gregory said melmotte in a hoarse whisper bending over the chair of a city friend it was old todd the senior partner of todd brehgert and goldsheiner mr todd was a very wealthy man and had a considerable following in the city  aint he here said toddknowing very well who had come from the city and who had declined  noand the lord mayors not comenor postlethwaite nor bunter whats the meaning of it  todd looked first at one neighbour and then at another before he answered im here thats all i can say mr melmotte and ive had a very good dinner they who havent come have lost a very good dinner  there was a weight upon melmottes mind of which he could not rid himself he knew from the old mans manner and he knew also from lord alfreds manner that there was something which each of them could tell him if he would but he was unable to make the men open their mouths and yet it might be so important to him that he should know its very odd he said that gentlemen should promise to come and then stay away there were hundreds anxious to be present whom i should have been glad to welcome if i had known that there would be room i think it is very odd  it is odd said mr todd turning his attention to the plate before him  melmotte had lately seen much of beaucharnp beauclerk in reference to the coming election passing back up the table he found the gentleman with a vacant seat on one side of him there were many vacant seats in this part of the room as the places for the conservative gentlemen had been set apart together there mr melmotte seated himself for a minute thinking that he might get the truth from his new ally prudence should have kept him silent let the cause of these desertions have been what it might it ought to have been clear to him that he could apply no remedy to it now but he was bewildered and dismayed and his mind within him was changing at every moment he was now striving to trust to his arrogance and declaring that nothing should cow him and then again he was so cowed that he was ready to creep to any one for assistance personally mr beauclerk had disliked the man greatly among the vulgar loud upstarts whom he had known melmotte was the vulgarest the loudest and the most arrogant but he had taken the business of melmottes election in hand and considered himself bound to stand by melmotte till that was over and he was now the guest of the man in his own house and was therefore constrained to courtesy his wife was sitting by him and he at once introduced her to mr melmotte you have a wonderful assemblage here mr melmotte said the lady looking up at the royal table  yes maam yes his majesty the emperor has been pleased to intimate that he has been much gratifiedhad the emperor in truth said so no one who looked at him could have believed his imperial wordcan you tell me mr beauchamp why those other gentlemen are not here it looks very odd does it not  ah you mean killegrew  yes mr killegrew and sir david boss and the whole lot i made a particular point of their coming i said i wouldnt have the dinner at all unless they were to be asked they were going to make it a government thing but i said no i insisted on the leaders of our own party and now theyre not here i know the cards were sent and by george i have their answers saying theyd come  i suppose some of them are engaged said mr beauchamp  engaged what business has a man to accept one engagement and then take another and if so why shouldnt he write and make his excuses no mr beauchamp that wont go down  im here at any rate said beauchamp making the very answer that had occurred to mr todd  oh yes youre here youre all right but what is it mr beauchamp theres something up and you must have heard and so it was clear to mr beauchamp that the man knew nothing about it himself if there was anything wrong melmotte was not aware that the wrong had been discovered is it anything about the election tomorrow  one never can tell what is actuating people said mr beauchamp  if you know anything about the matter i think you ought to tell me  i know nothing except that the ballot will be taken tomorrow you and i have got nothing more to do in the matter except to wait the result  well i suppose its all right said melmotte rising and going back to his seat but he knew that things were not all right had his political friends only been absent he might have attributed their absence to some political cause which would not have touched him deeply but the treachery of the lord mayor and of sir gregory gribe was a blow for another hour after he had returned to his place the emperor sat solemn in his chair and then at some signal given by some one he was withdrawn the ladies had already left the room about half an hour according to the programme arranged for the evening the royal guests were to return to the smaller room for a cup of coffee and were then to be paraded upstairs before the multitude who would by that time have arrived and to remain there long enough to justify the invited ones in saying that they had spent the evening with the emperor and the princes and the princesses the plan was carried out perfectly at halfpast ten the emperor was made to walk upstairs and for half an hour sat awful and composed in an armchair that had been prepared for him how one would wish to see the inside of the mind of the emperor as it worked on that occasion  melmotte when his guests ascended his stairs went back into the banquetingroom and through to the hall and wandered about till he found miles grendall  miles he said tell me what the row is  how row asked miles  theres something wrong and you know all about it why didnt the people come miles looking guilty did not even attempt to deny his knowledge come what is it we might as well know all about it at once miles looked down on the ground and grunted something is it about the election  no its not that said miles  then what is it  they got hold of something today in the cityabout pickering  they did did they and what were they saying about pickering come you might as well out with it you dont suppose that i care what lies they tell  they say theres been somethingforged titledeeds i think they say  titledeeds that i have forged titledeeds well thats beginning well and his lordship has stayed away from my house after accepting my invitation because he has heard that story all right miles that will do and the great financier went upstairs into his own drawingroom     chapter lx  miss longestaffes lover   a few days before that period in our story which we have now reached miss longestaffe was seated in lady monograms back drawingroom discussing the terms on which the two tickets for madame melmottes grand reception had been transferred to lady monogramthe place on the cards for the names of the friends whom madame melmotte had the honour of inviting to meet the emperor and the princes having been left blank and the terms also on which miss longestaffe had been asked to spend two or three days with her dear friend lady monogram each lady was disposed to get as much and to give as little as possiblein which desire the ladies carried out the ordinary practice of all parties to a bargain it had of course been settled that lady monogram was to have the two ticketsfor herself and her husbandsuch tickets at that moment standing very high in the market in payment for these valuable considerations lady monogram was to undertake to chaperon miss longestaffe at the entertainment to take miss longestaffe as a visitor for three days and to have one party at her own house during the time so that it might be seen that miss longestaffe had other friends in london besides the melmottes on whom to depend for her london gaieties at this moment miss longestaffe felt herself justified in treating the matter as though she were hardly receiving a fair equivalent the melmotte tickets were certainly ruling very high they had just culminated they fell a little soon afterwards and at ten pm on the night of the entertainment were hardly worth anything at the moment which we have now in hand there was a rush for them lady monogram had already secured the tickets they were in her desk but as will sometimes be the case in a bargain the seller was complaining that as she had parted with her goods too cheap some makeweight should be added to the stipulated price  as for that my dear said miss longestaffe who since the rise in melmotte stock generally had endeavoured to resume something of her old manners i dont see what you mean at all you meet lady julia goldsheiner everywhere and her fatherinlaw is mr brehgerts junior partner  lady julia is lady julia my dear and young mr goldsheiner has in some sort of way got himself in he hunts and damask says that he is one of the best shots at hurlingham i never met old mr goldsheiner anywhere  i have  oh yes i dare say mr melmotte of course entertains all the city people i dont think sir damask would like me to ask mr brehgert to dine here lady monogram managed everything herself with reference to her own parties invited all her own guests and never troubled sir damaskwho again on his side had his own set of friends but she was very clever in the use which she made of her husband there were some aspirants who really were taught to think that sir damask was very particular as to the guests whom he welcomed to his own house  may i speak to sir damask about it asked miss longestaffe who was very urgent on the occasion  well my dear i really dont think you ought to do that there are little things which a man and his wife must manage together without interference  nobody can ever say that i interfered in any family but really julia when you tell me that sir damask cannot receive mr brehgert it does sound odd as for city people you know as well as i do that that kind of thing is all over now city people are just as good as west end people  a great deal better i dare say im not arguing about that i dont make the lines but there they are and one gets to know in a sort of way what they are i dont pretend to be a bit better than my neighbours i like to see people come here whom other people who come here will like to meet im big enough to hold my own and so is sir damask but we aint big enough to introduce newcomers i dont suppose theres anybody in london understands it better than you do georgiana and therefore its absurd my pretending to teach you i go pretty well everywhere as you are aware and i shouldnt know mr brehgert if i were to see him  youll meet him at the melmottes and in spite of all you said once youre glad enough to go there  quite true my dear i dont think that you are just the person to throw that in my teeth but never mind that theres the butcher round the corner in bond street or the man who comes to do my hair i dont at all think of asking them to my house but if they were suddenly to turn out wonderful men and go everywhere no doubt i should be glad to have them here thats the way we live and you are as well used to it as i am mr brehgert at present to me is like the butcher round the corner lady monogram had the tickets safe under lock and key or i think she would hardly have said this  he is not a bit like a butcher said miss longestaffe blazing up in real wrath  i did not say that he was  yes you did and it was the unkindest thing you could possibly say it was meant to be unkind it was monstrous how would you like it if i said that sir damask was like a hairdresser  you can say so if you please sir damask drives four in hand rides as though he meant to break his neck every winter is one of the best shots going and is supposed to understand a yacht as well as any other gentleman out and im rather afraid that before he was married he used to box with all the prizefighters and to be a little too free behind the scenes if that makes a man like a hairdresser well there he is  how proud you are of his vices  hes very goodnatured my dear and as he does not interfere with me i dont interfere with him i hope youll do as well i dare say mr brehgert is goodnatured  hes an excellent man of business and is making a very large fortune  and has five or six grownup children who no doubt will be a comfort  if i dont mind them why need you you have none at all and you find it lonely enough  not at all lonely i have everything that i desire how hard you are trying to be illnatured georgiana  why did you say that he was abutcher  i said nothing of the kind i didnt even say that he was like a butcher what i did say was thisthat i dont feel inclined to risk my own reputation on the appearance of new people at my table of course i go in for what you call fashion some people can dare to ask anybody they meet in the streets i cant ive my own line and i mean to follow it its hard work i can tell you and it would be harder still if i wasnt particular if you like mr brehgert to come here on tuesday evening when the rooms will be full you can ask him but as for having him to dinner iwontdoit so the matter was at last settled miss longestaffe did ask mr brehgert for the tuesday evening and the two ladies were again friends  perhaps lady monogram when she illustrated her position by an allusion to a butcher and a hairdresser had been unaware that mr brehgert had some resemblance to the form which men in that trade are supposed to bear let us at least hope that she was so he was a fat greasy man goodlooking in a certain degree about fifty with hair dyed black and beard and moustache dyed a dark purple colour the charm of his face consisted in a pair of very bright black eyes which were however set too near together in his face for the general delight of christians he was stoutfat all over rather than corpulentand had that look of command in his face which has become common to masterbutchers probably by long intercourse with sheep and oxen but mr brehgert was considered to be a very good man of business and was now regarded as being in a commercial point of view the leading member of the great financial firm of which he was the second partner mr todds day was nearly done he walked about constantly between lombard street the exchange and the bank and talked much to merchants he had an opinion too of his own on particular cases but the business had almost got beyond him and mr brehgert was now supposed to be the moving spirit of the firm he was a widower living in a luxurious villa at fulham with a family not indeed grown up as lady monogram had illnaturedly said but which would be grown up before long varying from an eldest son of eighteen who had just been placed at a desk in the office to the youngest girl of twelve who was at school at brighton he was a man who always asked for what he wanted and having made up his mind that he wanted a second wife had asked miss georgiana longestaffe to fill that situation he had met her at the melmottes had entertained her with madame melmotte and marie at beaudesert as he called his villa had then proposed in the square and two days after had received an assenting answer in bruton street  poor miss longestaffe although she had acknowledged the fact to lady monogram in her desire to pave the way for the reception of herself into society as a married woman she had not as yet found courage to tell her family the man was absolutely a jewnot a jew that had been as to whom there might possibly be a doubt whether he or his father or his grandfather had been the last jew of the family but a jew that was so was goldsheiner a jew whom lady julia start had marriedor at any rate had been one a very short time before he ran away with that lady she counted up ever so many instances on her fingers of decent people who had married jews or jewesses lord frederic framlinghame had married a girl of the berrenhoffers and mr hart had married a miss chute she did not know much of miss chute but was certain that she was a christian lord frederics wife and lady julia goldsheiner were seen everywhere though she hardly knew how to explain the matter even to herself she was sure that there was at present a general heavingup of society on this matter and a change in progress which would soon make it a matter of indifference whether anybody was jew or christian for herself she regarded the matter not at all except as far as it might be regarded by the world in which she wished to live she was herself above all personal prejudices of that kind jew turk or infidel was nothing to her she had seen enough of the world to be aware that her happiness did not lie in that direction and could not depend in the least on the religion of her husband of course she would go to church herself she always went to church it was the proper thing to do as to her husband though she did not suppose that she could ever get him to churchnor perhaps would it be desirable she thought that she might induce him to go nowhere so that she might be able to pass him off as a christian she knew that such was the christianity of young goldsheiner of which the starts were now boasting  had she been alone in the world she thought that she could have looked forward to her destiny with complacency but she was afraid of her father and mother lady pomona was distressingly oldfashioned and had so often spoken with horror even of the approach of a jewand had been so loud in denouncing the iniquity of christians who allowed such people into their houses unfortunately too georgiana in her earlier days had reechoed all her mothers sentiments and then her father if he had ever earned for himself the right to be called a conservative politician by holding a real opinion of his ownit had been on that matter of admitting the jews into parliament when that had been done he was certain that the glory of england was sunk for ever and since that time whenever creditors were more than ordinarily importunate when slow and bideawhile could do nothing for him he would refer to that fatal measure as though it was the cause of every embarrassment which had harassed him how could she tell parents such as these that she was engaged to marry a man who at the present moment went to synagogue on a saturday and carried out every other filthy abomination common to the despised people  that mr brehgert was a fat greasy man of fifty conspicuous for hairdye was in itself distressingbut this minor distress was swallowed up in the greater miss longestaffe was a girl possessing considerable discrimination and was able to weigh her own possessions in just scales she had begun life with very high aspirations believing in her own beauty in her mothers fashion and her fathers fortune she had now been ten years at the work and was aware that she had always flown a little too high for her mark at the time at nineteen and twenty and twentyone she had thought that all the world was before her with her commanding figure regular long features and bright complexion she had regarded herself as one of the beauties of the day and had considered herself entitled to demand wealth and a coronet at twentytwo twentythree and twentyfour any young peer or peers eldest son with a house in town and in the country might have sufficed twentyfive and six had been the years for baronets and squires and even a leading fashionable lawyer or two had been marked by her as sufficient since that time but now she was aware that hitherto she had always fixed her price a little too high on three things she was still determinedthat she would not be poor that she would not be banished from london and that she would not be an old maid mamma she had often said theres one thing certain i shall never do to be poor lady pomona had expressed full concurrence with her child and mamma to do as sophia is doing would kill me fancy having to live at toodlam all ones life with george whitstable lady pomona had agreed to this also though she thought that toodlam hall was a very nice home for her elder daughter and mamma i should drive you and papa mad if i were to stay at home always and what would become of me when dolly was master of everything lady pomona looking forward as well as she was able to the time at which she should herself have departed when her dower and dowerhouse would have reverted to dolly acknowledged that georgiana should provide herself with a home of her own before that time  and how was this to be done lovers with all the glories and all the graces are supposed to be plentiful as blackberries by girls of nineteen but have been proved to be rare hothouse fruits by girls of twentynine brehgert was rich would live in london and would be a husband people did such odd things now and lived them down that she could see no reason why she should not do this and live this down courage was the one thing necessarythat and perseverance she must teach herself to talk about brehgert as lady monogram did of sir damask she had plucked up so much courage as had enabled her to declare her fate to her old friendremembering as she did so how in days long past she and her friend julia triplex had scattered their scorn upon some poor girl who had married a man with a jewish name whose grandfather had possibly been a jew dear me said lady monogram todd brehgert and goldsheiner mr todd isone of us i suppose  yes said georgiana boldly and mr brehgert is a jew his name is ezekiel brehgert and he is a jew you can say what you like about it  i dont say anything about it my dear  and you can think anything you like things are changed since you and i were younger  very much changed it appears said lady monogram sir damasks religion had never been doubted though except on the occasion of his marriage no acquaintance of his had probably ever seen him in church  but to tell her father and mother required a higher spirit than she had shown even in her communication to lady monogram and that spirit had not as yet come to her on the morning before she left the melmottes in bruton street her lover had been with her the melmottes of course knew of the engagement and quite approved of it madame melmotte rather aspired to credit for having had so happy an affair arranged under her auspices it was some setoff against maries unfortunate escapade mr brehgert therefore had been allowed to come and go as he pleased and on that morning he had pleased to come they were sitting alone in some back room and brehgert was pressing for an early day i dont think we need talk of that yet mr brehgert she said  you might as well get over the difficulty and call me ezekiel at once he remarked georgiana frowned and made no soft little attempt at the name as ladies in such circumstances are wont to do mrs brehgerthe alluded of course to the mother of his childrenused to call me ezzy  perhaps i shall do so some day said miss longestaffe looking at her lover and asking herself why she should not have been able to have the house and the money and the name of the wife without the troubles appertaining she did not think it possible that she should ever call him ezzy  and ven shall it be i should say as early in august as possible  in august she almost screamed it was already july  vy not my dear ve would have our little holiday in germany at vienna i have business there and know many friends then he pressed her hard to fix some day in the next month it would be expedient that they should be married from the melmottes house and the melmottes would leave town some time in august there was truth in this unless married from the melmottes house she must go down to caversham for the occasionwhich would be intolerable noshe must separate herself altogether from father and mother and become one with the melmottes and the brehgertstill she could live it down and make a position for herself if the spending of money could do it it should be done  i must at any rate ask mamma about it said georgiana mr brehgert with the customary goodhumour of his people was satisfied with the answer and went away promising that he would meet his love at the great melmotte reception then she sat silent thinking how she should declare the matter to her family would it not be better for her to say to them at once that there must be a division among theman absolute breaking off of all old ties so that it should be tacitly acknowledged that she georgiana had gone out from among the longestaffes altogether and had become one with the melmottes brehgerts and goldsheiners     chapter lxi  lady monogram prepares for the party   when the little conversation took place between lady monogram and miss longestaffe as recorded in the last chapter mr melmotte was in all his glory and tickets for the entertainment were very precious gradually their value subsided lady monogram had paid very dear for hersespecially as the reception of mr brehgert must be considered but high prices were then being paid a lady offered to take marie melmotte into the country with her for a week but this was before the elopement mr cohenlupe was asked out to dinner to meet two peers and a countess lord alfred received various presents a young lady gave a lock of her hair to lord nidderdale although it was known that he was to marry marie melmotte and miles grendall got back an iou of considerable nominal value from lord grasslough who was anxious to accommodate two country cousins who were in london gradually the prices fellnot at first from any doubt in melmotte but through that customary reaction which may be expected on such occasions but at eight or nine oclock on the evening of the party the tickets were worth nothing the rumour had then spread itself through the whole town from pimlico to marylebone men coming home from clubs had told their wives ladies who had been in the park had heard it even the hairdressers had it and ladies maids had been instructed by the footmen and grooms who had been holding horses and seated on the coachboxes it had got into the air and had floated round diningrooms and over toilettables  i doubt whether sir damask would have said a word about it to his wife as he was dressing for dinner had he calculated what might be the result to himself but he came home openmouthed and made no calculation have you heard whats up ju he said rushing halfdressed into his wifes room  what is up  havent you been out  i was shopping and that kind of thing i dont want to take that girl into the park ive made a mistake in having her here but i mean to be seen with her as little as i can  be goodnatured ju whatever you are  oh bother i know what im about what is it you mean  they say melmottes been found out  found out exclaimed lady monogram stopping her maid in some arrangement which would not need to be continued in the event of her not going to the reception what do you mean by found out  i dont know exactly there are a dozen stories told its something about that place he bought of old longestaffe  are the longestaffes mixed up in it i wont have her here a day longer if there is anything against them  dont be an ass ju theres nothing against him except that the poor old fellow hasnt got a shilling of his money  then hes ruinedand theres an end of them  perhaps he will get it now some say that melmotte has forged a receipt others a letter some declare that he has manufactured a whole set of titledeeds you remember dolly  of course i know dolly longestaffe said lady monogram who had thought at one time that an alliance with dolly might be convenient  they say he has found it all out there was always something about dolly more than fellows gave him credit for at any rate everybody says that melmotte will be in quod before long  not tonight damask  nobody seems to know lupton was saying that the policemen would wait about in the room like servants till the emperor and the princes had gone away  is mr lupton going  he was to have been at the dinner but hadnt made up his mind whether hed go or not when i saw him nobody seems to be quite certain whether the emperor will go somebody said that a cabinet council was to be called to know what to do  a cabinet council  why you see its rather an awkward thing letting the prince go to dine with a man who perhaps may have been arrested and taken to gaol before dinnertime thats the worst part of it nobody knows  lady monogram waved her attendant away she piqued herself upon having a french maid who could not speak a word of english and was therefore quite careless what she said in the womans presence but of course everything she did say was repeated downstairs in some language that had become intelligible to the servants generally lady monogram sat motionless for some time while her husband retreating to his own domain finished his operations damask she said when he reappeared one thing is certainwe cant go  after youve made such a fuss about it  it is a pityhaving that girl here in the house you know dont you shes going to marry one of these people  i heard about her marriage yesterday but brehgert isnt one of melmottes set they tell me that brehgert isnt a bad fellow a vulgar cad and all that but nothing wrong about him  hes a jew and hes seventy years old and makes up horribly  what does it matter to you if hes eighty you are determined then you wont go  but lady monogram had by no means determined that she wouldnt go she had paid her price and with that economy which sticks to a woman always in the midst of her extravagances she could not bear to lose the thing that she had bought she cared nothing for melmottes villainy as regarded herself that he was enriching himself by the daily plunder of the innocent she had taken for granted since she had first heard of him she had but a confused idea of any difference between commerce and fraud but it would grieve her greatly to become known as one of an awkward squad of people who had driven to the door and perhaps been admitted to some wretched gathering of wretched peopleand not after all to have met the emperor and the prince but then should she hear on the next morning that the emperor and the princes that the princesses and the duchesses with the ambassadors cabinet ministers and proper sort of world generally had all been therethat the world in short had ignored melmottes villainy then would her grief be still greater she sat down to dinner with her husband and miss longestaffe and could not talk freely on the matter miss longestaffe was still a guest of the melmottes although she had transferred herself to the monograms for a day or two and a horrible idea crossed lady monograms mind what should she do with her friend georgiana if the whole melmotte establishment were suddenly broken up of course madame melmotte would refuse to take the girl back if her husband were sent to gaol i suppose youll go said sir damask as the ladies left the room  of course we shallin about an hour said lady monogram as she left the room looking round at him and rebuking him for his imprudence  because you know and then he called her back if you want me ill stay of course but if you dont ill go down to the club  how can i say yet you neednt mind the club tonight  all rightonly its a bore being here alone  then miss longestaffe asked what was up is there any doubt about our going tonight  i cant say im so harassed that i dont know what im about there seems to be a report that the emperor wont be there  impossible  its all very well to say impossible my dear said lady monogram but still thats what people are saying you see mr melmotte is a very great man but perhapssomething else has turned up so that he may be thrown over things of that kind do happen you had better finish dressing i shall but i shant make sure of going till i hear that the emperor is there then she descended to her husband whom she found forlornly consoling himself with a cigar damask she said you must find out  find out what  whether the prince and the emperor are there  send john to ask suggested the husband  he would be sure to make a blunder about it if youd go yourself youd learn the truth in a minute have a cabjust go into the hall and youll soon know how it all isid do it in a minute if i were you sir damask was the most goodnatured man in the world but he did not like the job what can be the objection asked his wife  go to a mans house and find out whether a mans guests are come before you go yourself i dont just see it ju  guests what nonsense the emperor and all the royal family as if it were like any other party such a thing probably never happened before and never will happen again if you dont go damask i must and i will sir damask after groaning and smoking for half a minute said that he would go he made many remonstrances it was a confounded bore he hated emperors and he hated princes he hated the whole box and dice of that sort of thing he wished to goodness that he had dined at his club and sent word up home that the affair was to be off but at last he submitted and allowed his wife to leave the room with the intention of sending for a cab the cab was sent for and announced but sir damask would not stir till he had finished his big cigar  it was past ten when he left his own house on arriving in grosvenor square he could at once see that the party was going on the house was illuminated there was a concourse of servants round the door and half the square was already blocked up with carriages  it was not without delay that he got to the door and when there he saw the royal liveries there was no doubt about the party the emperor and the princes and the princesses were all there as far as sir damask could then perceive the dinner had been quite a success but again there was a delay in getting away and it was nearly eleven before he could reach home its all right said he to his wife theyre there safe enough  you are sure that the emperor is there  as sure as a man can be without having seen him  miss longestaffe was present at this moment and could not but resent what appeared to be a most unseemly slur cast upon her friends i dont understand it at all she said of course the emperor is there everybody has known for the last month that he was coming what is the meaning of it julia  my dear you must allow me to manage my own little affairs my own way i dare say i am absurd but i have my reason now damask if the carriage is there we had better start the carriage was there and they did start and with a delay which seemed unprecedented even to lady monogram who was accustomed to these things they reached the door there was a great crush in the hall and people were coming downstairs but at last they made their way into the room above and found that the emperor of china and all the royalties had been therebut had taken their departure  sir damask put the ladies into the carriage and went at once to his club     chapter lxii  the party   lady monogram retired from mr melmottes house in disgust as soon as she was able to escape but we must return to it for a short time when the guests were once in the drawingroom the immediate sense of failure passed away the crowd never became so thick as had been anticipated they who were knowing in such matters had declared that the people would not be able to get themselves out of the room till three or four oclock in the morning and that the carriages would not get themselves out of the square till breakfast time with a view to this kind of thing mr melmotte had been told that he must provide a private means of escape for his illustrious guests and with a considerable sacrifice of walls and general house arrangements this had been done no such gathering as was expected took place but still the rooms became fairly full and mr melmotte was able to console himself with the feeling that nothing certainly fatal had as yet occurred  there can be no doubt that the greater part of the people assembled did believe that their host had committed some great fraud which might probably bring him under the arm of the law when such rumours are spread abroad they are always believed there is an excitement and a pleasure in believing them reasonable hesitation at such a moment is dull and phlegmatic if the accused one be near enough to ourselves to make the accusation a matter of personal pain of course we disbelieve but if the distance be beyond this we are almost ready to think that anything may be true of anybody in this case nobody really loved melmotte and everybody did believe it was so probable that such a man should have done something horrible it was only hoped that the fraud might be great and horrible enough  melmotte himself during that part of the evening which was passed upstairs kept himself in the close vicinity of royalty he behaved certainly very much better than he would have done had he had no weight at his heart he made few attempts at beginning any conversation and answered at any rate with brevity when he was addressed with scrupulous care he ticked off on his memory the names of those who had come and whom he knew thinking that their presence indicated a verdict of acquittal from them on the evidence already before them seeing the members of the government all there he wished that he had come forward in westminster as a liberal and he freely forgave those omissions of royalty as to which he had been so angry at the india office seeing that not a prince or princess was lacking of those who were expected he could turn his mind to all this although he knew how great was his danger many things occurred to him as he stood striving to smile as a host should smile it might be the case that halfadozen detectives were already stationed in his own hall perhaps one or two well dressed in the very presence of royalty ready to arrest him as soon as the guests were gone watching him now lest he should escape but he bore the burdenand smiled he had always lived with the consciousness that such a burden was on him and might crush him at any time he had known that he had to run these risks he had told himself a thousand times that when the dangers came dangers alone should never cow him he had always endeavoured to go as near the wind as he could to avoid the heavy hand of the criminal law of whatever country he inhabited he had studied the criminal laws so that he might be sure in his reckonings but he had always felt that he might be carried by circumstances into deeper waters than he intended to enter as the soldier who leads a forlorn hope or as the diver who goes down for pearls or as the searcher for wealth on feverbreeding coasts knows that as his gains may be great so are his perils melmotte had been aware that in his life as it opened itself out to him he might come to terrible destruction he had not always thought or even hoped that he would be as he was now so exalted as to be allowed to entertain the very biggest ones of the earth but the greatness had grown upon himand so had the danger he could not now be as exact as he had been he was prepared himself to bear all mere ignominy with a tranquil mindto disregard any shouts of reprobation which might be uttered and to console himself when the bad quarter of an hour should come with the remembrance that he had garnered up a store sufficient for future wants and placed it beyond the reach of his enemies but as his intellect opened up to him new schemes and as his ambition got the better of his prudence he gradually fell from the security which he had preconceived and became aware that he might have to bear worse than ignominy  perhaps never in his life had he studied his own character and his own conduct more accurately or made sterner resolves than he did as he stood there smiling bowing and acting without impropriety the part of host to an emperor nohe could not run away he soon made himself sure of that he had risen too high to be a successful fugitive even should he succeed in getting off before hands were laid upon him he must bide his ground if only that he might not at once confess his own guilt by flight and he would do so with courage looking back at the hour or two that had just passed he was aware that he had allowed himself not only to be frightened in the dinnerroombut also to seem to be frightened the thing had come upon him unawares and he had been untrue to himself he acknowledged that he should not have asked those questions of mr todd and mr beauclerk and should have been more goodhumoured than usual with lord alfred in discussing those empty seats but for spilt milk there is no remedy the blow had come upon him too suddenly and he had faltered but he would not falter again nothing should cow himno touch from a policeman no warrant from a magistrate no defalcation of friends no scorn in the city no solitude in the west end he would go down among the electors tomorrow and would stand his ground as though all with him were right men should know at any rate that he had a heart within his bosom and he confessed also to himself that he had sinned in that matter of arrogance he could see it nowas so many of us do see the faults which we have committed which we strive but in vain to discontinue and which we never confess except to our own bosoms the task which he had imposed on himself and to which circumstances had added weight had been very hard to bear he should have been goodhumoured to these great ones whose society he had gained he should have bound these people to him by a feeling of kindness as well as by his money he could see it all now and he could see too that there was no help for spilt milk i think he took some pride in his own confidence as to his own courage as he stood there turning it all over in his mind very much might be suspected something might be found out but the task of unravelling it all would not be easy it is the small vermin and the little birds that are trapped at once but wolves and vultures can fight hard before they are caught with the means which would still be at his command let the worst come to the worst he could make a strong fight when a mans frauds have been enormous there is a certain safety in their very diversity and proportions might it not be that the fact that these great ones of the earth had been his guests should speak in his favour a man who had in very truth had the real brother of the sun dining at his table could hardly be sent into the dock and then sent out of it like a common felon  madame melmotte during the evening stood at the top of her own stairs with a chair behind her on which she could rest herself for a moment when any pause took place in the arrivals she had of course dined at the tableor rather sat therebut had been so placed that no duty had devolved upon her she had heard no word of the rumours and would probably be the last person in that house to hear them it never occurred to her to see whether the places down the table were full or empty she sat with her large eyes fixed on the majesty of china and must have wondered at her own destiny at finding herself with an emperor and princes to look at from the diningroom she had gone when she was told to go up to the drawingroom and had there performed her task longing only for the comfort of her bedroom she i think had but small sympathy with her husband in all his work and but little understanding of the position in which she had been placed money she liked and comfort and perhaps diamonds and fine dresses but she can hardly have taken pleasure in duchesses or have enjoyed the company of the emperor from the beginning of the melmotte era it had been an understood thing that no one spoke to madame melmotte  marie melmotte had declined a seat at the dinnertable this at first had been cause of quarrel between her and her father as he desired to have seen her next to young lord nidderdale as being acknowledged to be betrothed to him but since the journey to liverpool he had said nothing on the subject he still pressed the engagement but thought now that less publicity might be expedient she was however in the drawingroom standing at first by madame melmotte and afterwards retreating among the crowd to some ladies she was a person of interest as the young woman who had lately run away under such strange circumstances but no one spoke to her till she saw a girl whom she herself knew and whom she addressed plucking up all her courage for the occasion this was hetta carbury who had been brought hither by her mother  the tickets for lady carbury and hetta had of course been sent before the elopementand also as a matter of course no reference had been made to them by the melmotte family after the elopement lady carbury herself was anxious that that affair should not be considered as having given cause for any personal quarrel between herself and mr melmotte and in her difficulty had consulted mr broune mr broune was the staff on which she leant at present in all her difficulties mr broune was going to the dinner all this of course took place while melmottes name was as yet unsullied as snow mr broune saw no reason why lady carbury should not take advantage of her tickets these invitations were simply tickets to see the emperor surrounded by the princes the young ladys elopement is no affair of yours mr broune had said i should go if it were only for the sake of showing that you did not consider yourself to be implicated in the matter lady carbury did as she was advised and took her daughter with her nonsense said the mother when hetta objected mr broune sees it quite in the right light this is a grand demonstration in honour of the emperor rather than a private partyand we have done nothing to offend the melmottes you know you wish to see the emperor a few minutes before they started from welbeck street a note came from mr broune written in pencil and sent from melmottes house by a commissioner dont mind what you hear but come i am here and as far as i can see it is all right the e is beautiful and ps are as thick as blackberries lady carbury who had not been in the way of hearing the reports understood nothing of this but of course she went and hetta went with her  hetta was standing alone in a corner near to her mother who was talking to mr booker with her eyes fixed on the awful tranquillity of the emperors countenance when marie melmotte timidly crept up to her and asked her how she was hetta probably was not very cordial to the poor girl being afraid of her partly as the daughter of the great melmotte and partly as the girl with whom her brother had failed to run away but marie was not rebuked by this i hope you wont be angry with me for speaking to you hetta smiled more graciously she could not be angry with the girl for speaking to her feeling that she was there as the guest of the girls mother i suppose you know about your brother said marie whispering with her eyes turned to the ground  i have heard about it said hetta he never told me himself  oh i do so wish that i knew the truth i know nothing of course miss carbury i love him i do love him so dearly i hope you dont think i would have done it if i hadnt loved him better than anybody in the world dont you think that if a girl loves a manreally loves himthat ought to go before everything  this was a question that hetta was hardly prepared to answer she felt quite certain that under no circumstances would she run away with a man i dont quite know it is so hard to say she replied  i do whats the good of anything if youre to be brokenhearted i dont care what they say of me or what they do to me if he would only be true to me why doesnt helet me knowsomething about it this also was a question difficult to be answered since that horrid morning on which sir felix had stumbled home drunkwhich was now four days sincehe had not left the house in welbeck street till this evening he had gone out a few minutes before lady carbury had started but up to that time he had almost kept his bed he would not get up till dinnertime would come down after some halfdressed fashion and then get back to his bedroom where he would smoke and drink brandyandwater and complain of headache the theory was that he was illbut he was in fact utterly cowed and did not dare to show himself at his usual haunts he was aware that he had quarrelled at the club aware that all the world knew of his intended journey to liverpool aware that he had tumbled about the streets intoxicated he had not dared to show himself and the feeling had grown upon him from day to day now fairly worn out by his confinement he had crept out intending if possible to find consolation with ruby ruggles do tell me where is he pleaded marie  he has not been very well lately  is he ill oh miss carbury do tell me you can understand what it is to love him as i docant you  he has been ill i think he is better now  why does he not come to me or send to me or let me know something it is cruel is it not tell meyou must knowdoes he really care for me  hetta was exceedingly perplexed the real feeling betrayed by the girl recommended her hetta could not but sympathize with the affection manifested for her own brother though she could hardly understand the want of reticence displayed by marie in thus speaking of her love to one who was almost a stranger felix hardly ever talks about himself to me she said  if he doesnt care for me there shall be an end of it marie said very gravely if i only knew if i thought that he loved me id go throughohall the world for him nothing that papa could say should stop me thats my feeling about it i have never talked to any one but you about it isnt that strange i havent a person to talk to thats my feeling and im not a bit ashamed of it theres no disgrace in being in love but its very bad to get married without being in love thats what i think  it is bad said hetta thinking of roger carbury  but if felix doesnt care for me continued marie sinking her voice to a low whisper but still making her words quite audible to her companion now hetta was strongly of opinion that her brother did not in the least care for marie melmotte and that it would be very much for the best that marie melmotte should know the truth but she had not that sort of strength which would have enabled her to tell it tell me just what you think said marie hetta was still silent ahi see then i must give him up eh  what can i say miss melmotte felix never tells me he is my brotherand of course i love you for loving him this was almost more than hetta meant but she felt herself constrained to say some gracious word  do you oh i wish you did i should so like to be loved by you nobody loves me i think that man there wants to marry me do you know him he is lord nidderdale he is very nice but he does not love me any more than he loves you thats the way with men it isnt the way with me i would go with felix and slave for him if he were poor is it all to be over then you will give him a message from me hetta doubting as to the propriety of the promise promised that she would just tell him i want to know thats all i want to know youll understand i want to know the real truth i suppose i do know it now then i shall not care what happens to me it will be all the same i suppose i shall marry that young man though it will be very bad i shall just be as if i hadnt any self of my own at all but he ought to send me word after all that has passed do not you think he ought to send me word  yes indeed  you tell him then said marie nodding her head as she crept away  nidderdale had been observing her while she had been talking to miss carbury he had heard the rumour and of course felt that it behoved him to be on his guard more specially than any one else but he had not believed what he had heard that men should be thoroughly immoral that they should gamble get drunk run into debt and make love to other mens wives was to him a matter of everyday life nothing of that kind shocked him at all but he was not as yet quite old enough to believe in swindling it had been impossible to convince him that miles grendall had cheated at cards and the idea that mr melmotte had forged was as improbable and shocking to him as that an officer should run away in battle common soldiers he thought might do that sort of thing he had almost fallen in love with marie when he saw her last and was inclined to feel the more kindly to her now because of the hard things that were being said about her father and yet he knew that he must be careful if he came a cropper in this matter it would be such an awful cropper how do you like the party he said to marie  i dont like it at all my lord how do you like it  very much indeed i think the emperor is the greatest fun i ever saw prince fredericone of the german princes who was staying at the time among his english cousinsprince frederic says that hes stuffed with hay and that hes made up fresh every morning at a shop in the haymarket  ive seen him talk  he opens his mouth of course there is machinery as well as hay i think hes the grandest old buffer out and im awfully glad that ive dined with him i couldnt make out whether he really put anything to eat into his jolly old mouth  of course he did  have you been thinking about what we were talking about the other day  no my lordi havent thought about it since why should i  wellits a sort of thing that people do think about you know  you dont think about it  dont i ive been thinking about nothing else the last three months  youve been thinking whether youd get married or not  thats what i mean said lord nidderdale  it isnt what i mean then  ill be shot if i can understand you  perhaps not and you never will understand me oh goodness theyre all going and we must get out of the way is that prince frederic who told you about the hay he is handsome isnt he and who is that in the violet dress with all the pearls  thats the princess dwarza  dear meisnt it odd having a lot of people in ones own house and not being able to speak a word to them i dont think its at all nice good night my lord im glad you like the emperor  and then the people went and when they had all gone melmotte put his wife and daughter into his own carriage telling them that he would follow them on foot to bruton street when he had given some last directions to the people who were putting out the lights and extinguishing generally the embers of the entertainment he had looked round for lord alfred taking care to avoid the appearance of searching but lord alfred had gone lord alfred was one of those who knew when to leave a falling house melmotte at the moment thought of all that he had done for lord alfred and it was something of the real venom of ingratitude that stung him at the moment rather than this additional sign of coming evil he was more than ordinarily gracious as he put his wife into the carriage and remarked that considering all things the party had gone off very well i only wish it could have been done a little cheaper he said laughing then he went back into the house and up into the drawingrooms which were now utterly deserted some of the lights had been put out but the men were busy in the rooms below and he threw himself into the chair in which the emperor had sat it was wonderful that he should come to such a fate as thisthat he the boy out of the gutter should entertain at his own house in london a chinese emperor and english and german royaltyand that he should do so almost with a rope round his neck even if this were to be the end of it all men would at any rate remember him the grand dinner which he had given before he was put into prison would live in history and it would be remembered too that he had been the conservative candidate for the great borough of westminsterperhaps even the elected member he too in his manner assured himself that a great part of him would escape oblivion non omnis moriar in some language of his own was chanted by him within his own breast as he sat there looking out on his own magnificent suite of rooms from the armchair which had been consecrated by the use of an emperor  no policemen had come to trouble him yet no hint that he would be wanted had been made to him there was no tangible sign that things were not to go on as they went before things would be exactly as they were before but for the absence of those guests from the dinnertable and for the words which miles grendall had spoken had he not allowed himself to be terrified by shadows of course he had known that there must be such shadows his life had been made dark by similar clouds before now and he had lived through the storms which had followed them he was thoroughly ashamed of the weakness which had overcome him at the dinnertable and of that palsy of fear which he had allowed himself to exhibit there should be no more shrinking such as that when people talked of him they should say that he was at least a man  as this was passing through his mind a head was pushed in through one of the doors and immediately withdrawn it was his secretary is that you miles he said come in im just going home and came up here to see how the empty rooms would look after they were all gone what became of your father  i suppose he went away  i suppose he did said melmotte unable to hinder himself from throwing a certain tone of scorn into his voiceas though proclaiming the fate of his own house and the consequent running away of the rat it went off very well i think  very well said miles still standing at the door there had been a few words of consultation between him and his fatheronly a very few words youd better see it out tonight as youve had a regular salary and all that i shall hook it i shant go near him tomorrow till i find out how things are going by g ive had about enough of him but hardly enough of his money or it may be presumed that lord alfred would have hooked it sooner  why dont you come in and not stand there said melmotte theres no emperor here now for you to be afraid of  im afraid of nobody said miles walking into the middle of the room  nor am i whats one man that another man should be afraid of him weve got to die and therell be an end of it i suppose  thats about it said miles hardly following the working of his masters mind  i shouldnt care how soon when a man has worked as i have done he gets about tired at my age i suppose id better be down at the committeeroom about ten tomorrow  thats the best i should say  youll be there by that time miles grendall assented slowly and with imperfect assent and tell your father he might as well be there as early as convenient  all right said miles as he took his departure  curs said melmotte almost aloud they neither of them will be there if any evil can be done to me by treachery and desertion they will do it then it occurred to him to think whether the grendall article had been worth all the money that he had paid for it curs he said again he walked down into the hall and through the banquetingroom and stood at the place where he himself had sat what a scene it had been and how frightfully low his heart had sunk within him it had been the defection of the lord mayor that had hit him hardest what cowards they are the men went on with their work not noticing him and probably not knowing him the dinner had been done by contract and the contractors foreman was there the care of the house and the alterations had been confided to another contractor and his foreman was waiting to see the place locked up a confidential clerk who had been with melmotte for years and who knew his ways was there also to guard the property good night croll he said to the man in german croll touched his hat and bade him good night melmotte listened anxiously to the tone of the mans voice trying to catch from it some indication of the mind within did croll know of these rumours and if so what did he think of them croll had known him in some perilous circumstances before and had helped him through them he paused a moment as though he would ask a question but resolved at last that silence would be safest youll see everything safe eh croll croll said that he would see everything safe and melmotte passed out into the square  he had not far to go round through berkeley square into bruton street but he stood for a few moments looking up at the bright stars if he could be there in one of those unknown distant worlds with all his present intellect and none of his present burdens he would he thought do better than he had done here on earth if he could even now put himself down nameless fameless and without possessions in some distant corner of the world he could he thought do better but he was augustus melmotte and he must bear his burdens whatever they were to the end he could reach no place so distant but that he would be known and traced     chapter lxiii  mr melmotte on the day of the election   no election of a member of parliament by ballot in a borough so large as that of westminster had as yet been achieved in england since the ballot had been established by law men who heretofore had known or thought that they knew how elections would go who counted up promises told off professed enemies and weighed the doubtful ones now confessed themselves to be in the dark three days since the odds had been considerably in melmottes favour but this had come from the reputation attached to his name rather than from any calculation as to the politics of the voters then sunday had intervened on the monday melmottes name had continued to go down in the betting from morning to evening early in the day his supporters had thought little of this attributing the fall to that vacillation which is customary in such matters but towards the latter part of the afternoon the tidings from the city had been in everybodys mouth and melmottes committeeroom had been almost deserted at six oclock there were some who suggested that his name should be withdrawn no such suggestion however was made to himperhaps because no one dared to make it on the monday evening all work and strategy for the election as regarded melmotte and his party died away and the interest of the hour was turned to the dinner  but mr alfs supporters were very busy there had been a close consultation among a few of them as to what should be done by their committee as to these charges against the opposite candidate in the pulpit of that evening an allusion had been made to the affair which was of course sufficiently intelligible to those who were immediately concerned in the matter but which had given no name and mentioned no details mr alf explained that this had been put in by the subeditor and that it only afforded such news as the paper was bound to give to the public he himself pointed out the fact that no note of triumph had been sounded and that the rumour had not been connected with the election  one old gentleman was of opinion that they were bound to make the most of it its no more than weve all believed all along said the old gentleman and why are we to let a fellow like that get the seat if we can keep him out he was of opinion that everything should be done to make the rumour with all its exaggerations as public as possible so that there should be no opening for an indictment for libel and the clever old gentleman was full of devices by which this might be effected but the committee generally was averse to fight in this manner public opinion has its bar as well as the law courts if after all melmotte had committed no fraudor as was much more probable should not be convicted of fraudthen it would be said that the accusation had been forged for purely electioneering purposes and there might be a rebound which would pretty well crush all those who had been concerned individual gentlemen could of course say what they pleased to individual voters but it was agreed at last that no overt use should be made of the rumours by mr alfs committee in regard to other matters they who worked under the committee were busy enough the dinner to the emperor was turned into ridicule and the electors were asked whether they felt themselves bound to return a gentleman out of the city to parliament because he had offered to spend a fortune on entertaining all the royalties then assembled in london there was very much said on placards and published in newspapers to the discredit of melmotte but nothing was so printed which would not have appeared with equal venom had the recent rumours never been sent out from the city at twelve oclock at night when mr alfs committeeroom was being closed and when melmotte was walking home to bed the general opinion at the clubs was very much in favour of mr alf  on the next morning melmotte was up before eight as yet no policeman had called for him nor had any official intimation reached him that an accusation was to be brought against him on coming down from his bedroom he at once went into the backparlour on the ground floor which mr longestaffe called his study and which mr melmotte had used since he had been in mr longestaffes house for the work which he did at home he would be there often early in the morning and often late at night after lord alfred had left him there were two heavy desktables in the room furnished with drawers down to the ground one of these the owner of the house had kept locked for his own purposes when the bargain for the temporary letting of the house had been made mr melmotte and mr longestaffe were close friends terms for the purchase of pickering had just been made and no cause for suspicion had as yet arisen everything between the two gentlemen had been managed with the greatest ease oh dear yes mr longestaffe could come whenever he pleased he melmotte always left the house at ten and never returned till six the ladies would never enter that room the servants were to regard mr longestaffe quite as master of the house as far as that room was concerned if mr longestaffe could spare it mr melmotte would take the key of one of the tables the matter was arranged very pleasantly  mr melmotte on entering the room bolted the door and then sitting at his own table took certain papers out of the drawersa bundle of letters and another of small documents from these with very little examination he took three or fourtwo or three perhaps from each these he tore into very small fragments and burned the bitsholding them over a gasburner and letting the ashes fall into a large china plate then he blew the ashes into the yard through the open window this he did to all these documents but one this one he put bit by bit into his mouth chewing the paper into a pulp till he swallowed it when he had done this and had relocked his own drawers he walked across to the other table mr longestaffes table and pulled the handle of one of the drawers it openedand then without touching the contents he again closed it he then knelt down and examined the lock and the hole above into which the bolt of the lock ran having done this he again closed the drawer drew back the bolt of the door and seating himself at his own desk rang the bell which was close to hand the servant found him writing letters after his usual hurried fashion and was told that he was ready for breakfast he always breakfasted alone with a heap of newspapers around him and so he did on this day he soon found the paragraph alluding to himself in the pulpit and read it without a quiver in his face or the slightest change in his colour there was no one to see him nowbut he was acting under a resolve that at no moment either when alone or in a crowd or when suddenly called upon for wordsnot even when the policemen with their first hints of arrest should come upon him would he betray himself by the working of a single muscle or the loss of a drop of blood from his heart he would go through it always armed without a sign of shrinking it had to be done and he would do it  at ten he walked down to the central committeeroom at whitehall place he thought that he would face the world better by walking than if he were taken in his own brougham he gave orders that the carriage should be at the committeeroom at eleven and wait an hour for him if he was not there he went along bond street and piccadilly regent street and through pall mall to charing cross with the blandly triumphant smile of a man who had successfully entertained the great guest of the day as he got near the club he met two or three men whom he knew and bowed to them they returned his bow graciously enough but not one of them stopped to speak to him of one he knew that he would have stopped had it not been for the rumour even after the man had passed on he was careful to show no displeasure on his face he would take it all as it would come and still be the blandly triumphant merchant princeas long as the police would allow him he probably was not aware how very different was the part he was now playing from that which he had assumed at the india office  at the committeeroom he only found a few understrappers and was informed that everything was going on regularly the electors were balloting but with the ballotso said the leader of the understrappersthere never was any excitement the men looked halffrightenedas though they did not quite know whether they ought to seize their candidate and hold him till the constable came they certainly had not expected to see him there has lord alfred been here melmotte asked standing in the inner room with his back to the empty grate nolord alfred had not been there nor mr grendall the senior understrapper knew that melmotte would have asked for his secretary and not for mr grendall but for the rumours it is so hard not to tumble into scylla when you are avoiding charybdis mr grendall had not been there indeed nobody had been there in fact there is nothing more to be done i suppose said mr melmotte the senior understrapper thought that there was nothing more to be done he left word that his brougham should be sent away and strolled out again on foot  he went up into covent garden where there was a polling booth the place seemed to him as one of the chief centres for a contested election to be wonderfully quiet he was determined to face everybody and everything and he went close up to the booth here he was recognised by various men mechanics chiefly who came forward and shook hands with him he remained there for an hour conversing with people and at last made a speech to a little knot around him he did not allude to the rumour of yesterday nor to the paragraph in the pulpit to which his name had not been attached but he spoke freely enough of the general accusations that had been brought against him previously he wished the electors to understand that nothing which had been said against him made him ashamed to meet them here or elsewhere he was proud of his position and proud that the electors of westminster should recognise it he did not he was glad to say know much of the law but he was told that the law would protect him from such aspersions as had been unfairly thrown upon him he flattered himself that he was too good an englishman to regard the ordinary political attacks to which candidates were as a matter of course subject at electionsand he could stretch his back to bear perhaps a little more than these particularly as he looked forward to a triumphant return but things had been said and published which the excitement of an election could not justify and as to these things he must have recourse to the law then he made some allusion to the princes and the emperor and concluded by observing that it was the proudest boast of his life to be an englishman and a londoner  it was asserted afterwards that this was the only good speech he had ever been known to make and it was certainly successful as he was applauded throughout covent garden a reporter for the breakfasttable who was on duty at the place looking for paragraphs as to the conduct of electors gave an account of the speech in that paper and made more of it perhaps than it deserved it was asserted afterwards and given as a great proof of melmottes cleverness that he had planned the thing and gone to covent garden all alone having considered that in that way could he best regain a step in reputation but in truth the affair had not been preconcerted it was while in whitehall place that he had first thought of going to covent garden and he had had no idea of making a speech till the people had gathered round him  it was then noon and he had to determine what he should do next he was half inclined to go round to all the booths and make speeches his success at covent garden had been very pleasant to him but he feared that he might not be so successful elsewhere he had shown that he was not afraid of the electors then an idea struck him that he would go boldly into the cityto his own offices in abchurch lane he had determined to be absent on this day and would not be expected but his appearance there could not on that account be taken amiss whatever enmities there might be or whatever perils he would face them he got a cab therefore and had himself driven to abchurch lane  the clerks were hanging about doing nothing as though it were a holiday the dinner the election and the rumour together had altogether demoralized them but some of them at least were there and they showed no signs of absolute insubordination mr grendall has not been here he asked no mr grendall had not been there but mr cohenlupe was in mr grendalls room at this moment he hardly desired to see mr cohenlupe that gentleman was privy to many of his transactions but was by no means privy to them all mr cohenlupe knew that the estate at pickering had been purchased and knew that it had been mortgaged he knew also what had become of the money which had so been raised but he knew nothing of the circumstances of the purchase although he probably surmised that melmotte had succeeded in getting the titledeeds on credit without paying the money he was afraid that he could hardly see cohenlupe and hold his tongue and that he could not speak to him without danger he and cohenlupe might have to stand in a dock together and cohenlupe had none of his spirit but the clerks would think and would talk were he to leave the office without seeing his old friend he went therefore into his own room and called to cohenlupe as he did so  ve didnt expect you here today said the member for staines  nor did i expect to come but there isnt much to do at westminster while the ballot is going on so i came up just to look at the letters the dinner went off pretty well yesterday eh  uncommonnothing better vy did the lord mayor stay away melmotte  because hes an ass and a cur said mr melmotte with an assumed air of indignation alf and his people had got hold of him there was ever so much fuss about it at firstwhether he would accept the invitation i say it was an insult to the city to take it and not to come i shall be even with him some of these days  things will go on just the same as usual melmotte  go on of course theyll go whats to hinder them  theres ever so much been said whispered cohenlupe  saidyes ejaculated melmotte very loudly youre not such a fool i hope as to believe every word you hear youll have enough to believe if you do  theres no knowing vat anybody does know and vat anybody does not know said cohenlupe  look you here cohenlupeand now melmotte also sank his voice to a whisperkeep your tongue in your mouth go about just as usual and say nothing its all right there has been some heavy pulls upon us  oh dear there has indeed  but any paper with my name to it will come right  thats nothingnothing at all said cohenlupe  and there is nothingnothing at all ive bought some property and have paid for it and i have bought some and have not yet paid for it theres no fraud in that  no nonothing in that  you hold your tongue and go about your business im going to the bank now cohenlupe had been very low in spirits and was still low in spirits but he was somewhat better after the visit of the great man to the city  mr melmotte was as good as his word and walked straight to the bank he kept two accounts at different banks one for his business and one for his private affairs the one he now entered was that which kept what we may call his domestic account he walked straight through after his old fashion to the room behind the bank in which sat the manager and the managers one clerk and stood upon the rug before the fireplace just as though nothing had happenedor as nearly as though nothing had happened as was within the compass of his powers he could not quite do it in keeping up an appearance intended to be natural he was obliged to be somewhat milder than his wont the manager did not behave nearly as well as he did and the clerks manifestly betrayed their emotion melmotte saw that it was sobut he had expected it and had come there on purpose to put it down  we hardly expected to see you in the city today mr melmotte  and i didnt expect to see myself here but it always happens that when one expects that theres most to be done theres nothing to be done at all theyre all at work down at westminster balloting but as i cant go on voting for myself im of no use ive been at covent garden this morning making a stump speech and if all that they say there is true i havent much to be afraid of  and the dinner went off pretty well asked the manager  very well indeed they say the emperor liked it better than anything that has been done for him yet this was a brilliant flash of imagination for a friend to dine with me every day you know i should prefer somebody who had a little more to say for himself but then perhaps you know if you or i were in china we shouldnt have much to say for ourselveseh the manager acceded to this proposition we had one awful disappointment his lordship from over the way didnt come  the lord mayor you mean  the lord mayor didnt come he was frightened at the last moment took it into his head that his authority in the city was somehow compromised but the wonder was that the dinner went on without him then melmotte referred to the purport of his call there that day he would have to draw large cheques for his private wants you dont give a dinner to an emperor of china for nothing you know he had been in the habit of overdrawing on his private accountmaking arrangements with the manager but now in the managers presence he drew a regular cheque on his business account for a large sum and then as a sort of afterthought paid in the £250 which he had received from mr broune on account of the money which sir felix had taken from marie  there dont seem much the matter with him said the manager when melmotte had left the room  he brazens it out dont he said the senior clerk but the feeling of the room after full discussion inclined to the opinion that the rumours had been a political manoeuvre nevertheless mr melmotte would not now have been allowed to overdraw at the present moment     chapter lxiv  the election   mr alfs central committeeroom was in great george street and there the battle was kept alive all the day it had been decided as the reader has been told that no direct advantage should be taken of that loud blast of accusation which had been heard throughout the town on the previous afternoon there had not been sufficient time for inquiry as to the truth of that blast if there were just ground for the things that had been said mr melmotte would no doubt soon be in gaol or would bewanted many had thought that he would escape as soon as the dinner was over and had been disappointed when they heard that he had been seen walking down towards his own committeeroom on the following morning others had been told that at the last moment his name would be withdrawnand a question arose as to whether he had the legal power to withdraw his name after a certain hour on the day before the ballot an effort was made to convince a portion of the electors that he had withdrawn or would have withdrawn or should have withdrawn when melmotte was at covent garden a large throng of men went to whitehall place with the view of ascertaining the truth he certainly had made no attempt at withdrawal they who propagated this report certainly damaged mr alfs cause a second reaction set in and there grew a feeling that mr melmotte was being illused those evil things had been said of himmany at least so declared not from any true motive but simply to secure mr alfs return tidings of the speech in covent garden were spread about at the various polling places and did good service to the socalled conservative cause mr alfs friends hearing all this instigated him also to make a speech something should be said if only that it might be reported in the newspapers to show that they had behaved with generosity instead of having injured their enemy by false attacks whatever mr alf might say he might at any rate be sure of a favourable reporter  about two oclock in the day mr alf did make a speechand a very good speech it was if correctly reported in the evening pulpit mr alf was a clever man ready at all points with all his powers immediately at command and no doubt he did make a good speech but in this speech in which we may presume that it would be his intention to convince the electors that they ought to return him to parliament because of the two candidates he was the fittest to represent their views he did not say a word as to his own political ideas not indeed a word that could be accepted as manifesting his own fitness for the place which it was his ambition to fill he contented himself with endeavouring to show that the other man was not fitand that he and his friends though solicitous of proving to the electors that mr melmotte was about the most unfit man in the world had been guilty of nothing shabby in their manner of doing so mr melmotte he said comes before you as a conservative and has told us by the mouths of his friendsfor he has not favoured us with many words of his own that he is supported by the whole conservative party that party is not my party but i respect it where however are these conservative supporters we have heard till we are sick of it of the banquet which mr melmotte gave yesterday i am told that very few of those whom he calls his conservative friends could be induced to attend that banquet it is equally notorious that the leading merchants of the city refused to grace the table of this great commercial prince i say that the leaders of the conservative party have at last found their candidate out have repudiated himand are seeking now to free themselves from the individual shame of having supported the candidature of such a man by remaining in their own houses instead of clustering round the polling booths go to mr melmottes committeeroom and inquire if those leading conservatives be there look about and see whether they are walking with him in the streets or standing with him in public places or taking the air with him in the parks i respect the leaders of the conservative party but they have made a mistake in this matter and they know it then he ended by alluding to the rumours of yesterday i scorn said he to say anything against the personal character of a political opponent which i am not in a position to prove i make no allusion and have made no allusion to reports which were circulated yesterday about him and which i believe were originated in the city they may be false or they may be true as i know nothing of the matter i prefer to regard them as false and i recommend you to do the same but i declared to you long before these reports were in mens mouths that mr melmotte was not entitled by his character to represent you in parliament and i repeat that assertion a great british merchant indeed how long do you think should a man be known in this city before that title be accorded to him who knew aught of this man two years sinceunless indeed it be some one who had burnt his wings in trafficking with him in some continental city ask the character of this great british merchant in hamburg and vienna ask it in parisask those whose business here has connected them with the assurance companies of foreign countries and you will be told whether this is a fit man to represent westminster in the british parliament there was much more yet but such was the tone of the speech which mr alf made with the object of inducing the electors to vote for himself  at two or three oclock in the day nobody knew how the matter was going it was supposed that the workingclasses were in favour of melmotte partly from their love of a man who spends a great deal of money partly from the belief that he was being illusedpartly no doubt from that occult sympathy which is felt for crime when the crime committed is injurious to the upper classes masses of men will almost feel that a certain amount of injustice ought to be inflicted on their betters so as to make things even and will persuade themselves that a criminal should be declared to be innocent because the crime committed has had a tendency to oppress the rich and pull down the mighty from their seats some few years since the basest calumnies that were ever published in this country uttered by one of the basest men that ever disgraced the country levelled for the most part at men of whose characters and services the country was proud were received with a certain amount of sympathy by men not themselves dishonest because they who were thus slandered had received so many good things from fortune that a few evil things were thought to be due to them there had not as yet been time for the formation of such a feeling generally in respect of mr melmotte but there was a commencement of it it had been asserted that melmotte was a public robber whom had he robbed not the poor there was not a man in london who caused the payment of a larger sum in weekly wages than mr melmotte  about three oclock the editor of the morning breakfasttable called on lady carbury what is it all about she asked as soon as her friend was seated there had been no time for him to explain anything at madame melmottes reception and lady carbury had as yet failed in learning any certain news of what was going on  i dont know what to make of it said mr broune there is a story abroad that mr melmotte has forged some document with reference to a purchase he madeand hanging on to that story are other stories as to moneys that he has raised i should say that it was simply an electioneering trick and a very unfair trick were it not that all his own side seem to believe it  do you believe it  ahi could answer almost any question sooner than that  then he cant be rich at all  even that would not follow he has such large concerns in hand that he might be very much pressed for funds and yet be possessed of immense wealth everybody says that he pays all his bills  will he be returned she asked  from what we hear we think not i shall know more about it in an hour or two at present i should not like to have to publish an opinion but were i forced to bet i would bet against him nobody is doing anything for him there can be no doubt that his own party are ashamed of him as things used to be this would have been fatal to him at the day of election but now with the ballot it wont matter so much if i were a candidate at present i think i would go to bed on the last day and beg all my committee to do the same as soon as they had put in their voting papers  i am glad felix did not go to liverpool said lady carbury  it would not have made much difference she would have been brought back all the same they say lord nidderdale still means to marry her  i saw him talking to her last night  there must be an immense amount of property somewhere no one doubts that he was rich when he came to england two years ago and they say everything has prospered that he has put his hand to since the mexican railway shares had fallen this morning but they were at £15 premium yesterday morning he must have made an enormous deal out of that but mr brounes eloquence on this occasion was chiefly displayed in regard to the presumption of mr alf i shouldnt think him such a fool if he had announced his resignation of the editorship when he came before the world as a candidate for parliament but a man must be mad who imagines that he can sit for westminster and edit a london daily paper at the same time  has it never been done  never i thinkthat is by the editor of such a paper as the pulpit how is a man who sits in parliament himself ever to pretend to discuss the doings of parliament with impartiality but alf believes that he can do more than anybody else ever did and hell come to the ground wheres felix now  do not ask me said the poor mother  is he doing anything  he lies in bed all day and is out all night  but that wants money she only shook her head you do not give him any  i have none to give  i should simply take the key of the house from himor bolt the door if he will not give it up  and be in bed and listen while he knocksknowing that he must wander in the streets if i refuse to let him in a mother cannot do that mr broune a child has such a hold upon his mother when her reason has bade her to condemn him her heart will not let her carry out the sentence mr broune never now thought of kissing lady carbury but when she spoke thus he got up and took her hand and she as she pressed his hand had no fear that she would be kissed the feeling between them was changed  melmotte dined at home that evening with no company but that of his wife and daughter latterly one of the grendalls had almost always joined their party when they did not dine out indeed it was an understood thing that miles grendall should dine there always unless he explained his absence by some engagementso that his presence there had come to be considered as a part of his duty not infrequently alfred and miles would both come as melmottes dinners and wines were good and occasionally the father would take the sons placebut on this day they were both absent madame melmotte had not as yet said a word to any one indicating her own apprehension of any evil but not a person had called today the day after the great partyand even she though she was naturally callous in such matters had begun to think that she was deserted she had too become so used to the presence of the grendalls that she now missed their company she thought that on this day of all days when the world was balloting for her husband at westminster they would both have been with him to discuss the work of the day is not mr grendall coming she asked as she took her seat at the table  no he is not said melmotte  nor lord alfred  nor lord alfred melmotte had returned home much comforted by the days proceedings no one had dared to say a harsh word to his face nothing further had reached his ears after leaving the bank he had gone back to his office and had written lettersjust as if nothing had happened and as far as he could judge his clerks had plucked up courage one of them about five oclock came into him with news from the west and with second editions of the evening papers the clerk expressed his opinion that the election was going well mr melmotte judging from the papers one of which was supposed to be on his side and the other of course against him thought that his affairs altogether were looking well the westminster election had not the foremost place in his thoughts but he took what was said on that subject as indicating the minds of men upon the other matter he read alfs speech and consoled himself with thinking that mr alf had not dared to make new accusations against him all that about hamburg and vienna and paris was as old as the hills and availed nothing his whole candidature had been carried in the face of that i think we shall do pretty well he said to the clerk his very presence in abchurch lane of course gave confidence and thus when he came home something of the old arrogance had come back upon him and he could swagger at any rate before his wife and servants nor lord alfred he said with scorn then he added more the father and son are two d curs this of course frightened madame melmotte and she joined this desertion of the grendalls to her own solitude all the day  is there anything wrong melmotte she said afterwards creeping up to him in the back parlour and speaking in french  what do you call wrong  i dont knowbut i seem to be afraid of something  i should have thought you were used to that kind of feeling by this time  then there is something  dont be a fool there is always something there is always much you dont suppose that this kind of thing can be carried on as smoothly as the life of an old maid with £400 a year paid quarterly in advance  shall we have to move again she asked  how am i to tell you havent much to do when we move and may get plenty to eat and drink wherever you go does that girl mean to marry lord nidderdale madame melmotte shook her head what a poor creature you must be when you cant talk her out of a fancy for such a reprobate as young carbury if she throws me over ill throw her over ill flog her within an inch of her life if she disobeys me you tell her that i say so  then he may flog me said marie when so much of the conversation was repeated to her that evening papa does not know me if he thinks that im to be made to marry a man by flogging no such attempt was at any rate made that night for the father and husband did not again see his wife or daughter  early the next day a report was current that mr alf had been returned the numbers had not as yet been counted or the books made upbut that was the opinion expressed all the morning newspapers including the breakfasttable repeated this reportbut each gave it as the general opinion on the matter the truth would not be known till seven or eight oclock in the evening the conservative papers did not scruple to say that the presumed election of mr alf was owing to a sudden declension in the confidence originally felt in mr melmotte the breakfasttable which had supported mr melmottes candidature gave no reason and expressed more doubt on the result than the other papers we know not how such an opinion forms itself the writer saidbut it seems to have been formed as nothing as yet is really known or can be known we express no opinion of our own upon the matter  mr melmotte again went into the city and found that things seemed to have returned very much into their usual grooves the mexican railway shares were low and mr cohenlupe was depressed in spirits and unhappybut nothing dreadful had occurred or seemed to be threatened if nothing dreadful did occur the railway shares would probably recover or nearly recover their position in the course of the day melmotte received a letter from messrs slow and bideawhile which of itself certainly contained no comfortbut there was comfort to be drawn even from that letter by reason of what it did not contain the letter was unfriendly in its tone and peremptory it had come evidently from a hostile party it had none of the feeling which had hitherto prevailed in the intercourse between these two wellknown conservative gentlemen mr adolphus longestaffe and mr augustus melmotte but there was no allusion in it to forgery no question of criminal proceedings no hint at aught beyond the not unnatural desire of mr longestaffe and mr longestaffes son to be paid for the property at pickering which mr melmotte had purchased  we have to remind you said the letter in continuation of paragraphs which had contained simply demands for the money that the titledeeds were delivered to you on receipt by us of authority to that effect from the messrs longestaffe father and son on the understanding that the purchasemoney was to be paid to us by you we are informed that the property has been since mortgaged by you we do not state this as a fact but the information whether true or untrue forces upon us the necessity of demanding that you should at once pay to us the purchasemoney£80000or else return to us the titledeeds of the estate  this letter which was signed slow and bideawhile declared positively that the titledeeds had been given up on authority received by them from both the longestaffesfather and son now the accusation brought against melmotte as far as he could as yet understand it was that he had forged the signature to the young mr longestaffes letter messrs slow and bideawhile were therefore on his side as to the simple debt he cared little comparatively about that many fine men were walking about london who owed large sums of money which they could not pay  as he was sitting at his solitary dinner this eveningfor both his wife and daughter had declined to join him saying that they had dined earlynews was brought to him that he had been elected for westminster he had beaten mr alf by something not much less than a thousand votes  it was very much to be member for westminster so much had at any rate been achieved by him who had begun the world without a shilling and without a friendalmost without education much as he loved money and much as he loved the spending of money and much as he had made and much as he had spent no triumph of his life had been so great to him as this brought into the world in a gutter without father or mother with no good thing ever done for him he was now a member of the british parliament and member for one of the first cities in the empire ignorant as he was he understood the magnitude of the achievement and dismayed as he was as to his present position still at this moment he enjoyed keenly a certain amount of elation of course he had committed forgeryof course he had committed robbery that indeed was nothing for he had been cheating and forging and stealing all his life of course he was in danger of almost immediate detection and punishment he hardly hoped that the evil day would be very much longer protracted and yet he enjoyed his triumph whatever they might do quick as they might be they could hardly prevent his taking his seat in the house of commons then if they sent him to penal servitude for life they would have to say that they had so treated the member for westminster  he drank a bottle of claret and then got some brandyandwater in such troubles as were coming upon him now he would hardly get sufficient support from wine he knew that he had better not drink that is he had better not drink supposing the world to be free to him for his own work and his own enjoyment but if the world were no longer free to him if he were really coming to penal servitude and annihilationthen why should he not drink while the time lasted an hour of triumphant joy might be an eternity to a man if the mans imagination were strong enough so make him so regard his hour he therefore took his brandyandwater freely and as he took it he was able to throw his fears behind him and to assure himself that after all he might even yet escape from his bondages nohe would drink no more this he said to himself as he filled another beaker he would work instead he would put his shoulder to the wheel and would yet conquer his enemies it would not be so easy to convict a member for westminsterespecially if money were spent freely was he not the man who at his own cost had entertained the emperor of china would not that be remembered in his favour would not men be unwilling to punish the man who had received at his own table all the princes of the land and the prime minister and all the ministers to convict him would be a national disgrace he fully realized all this as he lifted the glass to his mouth and puffed out the smoke in large volumes through his lips but money must be spent yesmoney must be had cohenlupe certainly had money though he squeezed it out of the cowards veins he would have it at any rate he would not despair there was a fight to be fought yet and he would fight it to the end then he took a deep drink and slowly with careful and almost solemn steps he made his way up to his bed     chapter lxv  miss longestaffe writes home   lady monogram when she left madame melmottes house after that entertainment of imperial majesty which had been to her of so very little avail was not in a good humour sir damask who had himself affected to laugh at the whole thing but who had been in truth as anxious as his wife to see the emperor in private society put her ladyship and miss longestaffe into the carriage without a word and rushed off to his club in disgust the affair from beginning to end including the final failure had been his wifes doing he had been made to work like a slave and had been taken against his will to melmottes house and had seen no emperor and shaken hands with no prince they may fight it out between them now like the kilkenny cats that was his idea as he closed the carriagedoor on the two ladiesthinking that if a larger remnant were left of one cat than of the other that larger remnant would belong to his wife  what a horrid affair said lady monogram did anybody ever see anything so vulgar this was at any rate unreasonable for whatever vulgarity there may have been lady monogram had seen none of it  i dont know why you were so late said georgiana  late why its not yet twelve i dont suppose it was eleven when we got into the square anywhere else it would have been early  you knew they did not mean to stay long it was particularly said so i really think it was your own fault  my own fault yesi dont doubt that i know it was my own fault my dear to have had anything to do with it and now i have got to pay for it  what do you mean by paying for it julia  you know what i mean very well is your friend going to do us the honour of coming to us tomorrow night she could not have declared in plainer language how very high she thought the price to be which she had consented to give for those ineffective tickets  if you mean mr brehgert he is coming you desired me to ask him and i did so  desired you the truth is georgiana when people get into different sets theyd better stay where they are its no good trying to mix things lady monogram was so angry that she could not control her tongue  miss longestaffe was ready to tear herself with indignation that she should have been brought to hear insolence such as this from julia triplexshe the daughter of adolphus longestaffe of caversham and lady pomona she who was considered to have lived in quite the first london circle but she could hardly get hold of fit words for a reply she was almost in tears and was yet anxious to fight rather than weep but she was in her friends carriage and was being taken to her friends house was to be entertained by her friend all the next day and was to see her lover among her friends guests i wonder what has made you so illnatured she said at last you didnt use to be like that  its no good abusing me said lady monogram here we are and i suppose we had better get outunless you want the carriage to take you anywhere else then lady monogram got out and marched into the house and taking a candle went direct to her own room miss longestaffe followed slowly to her own chamber and having half undressed herself dismissed her maid and prepared to write to her mother  the letter to her mother must be written mr brehgert had twice proposed that he should in the usual way go to mr longestaffe who had been backwards and forwards in london and was there at the present moment of course it was proper that mr brehgert should see her fatherbut as she had told him she preferred that he should postpone his visit for a day or two she was now agonized by many doubts those few words about various sets and the mixing of things had stabbed her to the very heartas had been intended mr brehgert was rich that was a certainty but she already repented of what she had done if it were necessary that she should really go down into another and a much lower world a world composed altogether of brehgerts melmottes and cohenlupes would it avail her much to be the mistress of a gorgeous house she had known and understood and had revelled in the exclusiveness of county position caversham had been dull and there had always been there a dearth of young men of the proper sort but it had been a place to talk of and to feel satisfied with as a home to be acknowledged before the world her mother was dull and her father pompous and often cross but they were in the right setmiles removed from the brehgerts and melmottes until her father himself had suggested to her that she should go to the house in grosvenor square she would write one letter tonight but there was a question in her mind whether the letter should be written to her mother telling her the horrid truthor to mr brehgert begging that the match should be broken off i think she would have decided on the latter had it not been that so many people had already heard of the match the monograms knew it and had of course talked far and wide the melmottes knew it and she was aware that lord nidderdale had heard it it was already so far known that it was sure to be public before the end of the season each morning lately she had feared that a letter from home would call upon her to explain the meaning of some frightful rumours reaching caversham or that her father would come to her and with horror on his face demand to know whether it was indeed true that she had given her sanction to so abominable a report  and there were other troubles she had just spoken to madame melmotte this evening having met her late hostess as she entered the drawingroom and had felt from the manner of her reception that she was not wanted back again she had told her father that she was going to transfer herself to the monograms for a time not mentioning the proposed duration of her visit and mr longestaffe in his ambiguous way had expressed himself glad that she was leaving the melmottes she did not think that she could go back to grosvenor square although mr brehgert desired it since the expression of mr brehgerts wishes she had perceived that illwill had grown up between her father and mr melmotte she must return to caversham they could not refuse to take her in though she had betrothed herself to a jew  if she decided that the story should be told to her mother it would be easier to tell it by letter than by spoken words face to face but then if she wrote the letter there would be no retreatand how should she face her family after such a declaration she had always given herself credit for courage and now she wondered at her own cowardice even lady monogram her old friend julia triplex had trampled upon her was it not the business of her life in these days to do the best she could for herself and would she allow paltry considerations as to the feelings of others to stand in her way and become bugbears to affright her who sent her to melmottes house was it not her own father then she sat herself square at the table and wrote to her motheras followsdating her letter for the following morning      hill street 9th july 187     my dear mamma     i am afraid you will be very much astonished by this letter and    perhaps disappointed i have engaged myself to mr brehgert a    member of a very wealthy firm in the city called todd    brehgert and goldsheiner i may as well tell you the worst at    once mr brehgert is a jew this last word she wrote very    rapidly but largely determined that there should be no lack of    courage apparent in the letter he is a very wealthy man and    his business is about banking and what he calls finance i    understand they are among the most leading people in the city    he lives at present at a very handsome house at fulham i dont    know that i ever saw a place more beautifully fitted up i have    said nothing to papa nor has he but he says he will be willing    to satisfy papa perfectly as to settlements he has offered to    have a house in london if i likeand also to keep the villa at    fulham or else to have a place somewhere in the country or i    may have the villa at fulham and a house in the country no man    can be more generous than he is he has been married before and    has a family and now i think i have told you all     i suppose you and papa will be very much dissatisfied i hope    papa wont refuse his consent it can do no good i am not going    to remain as i am now all my life and there is no use waiting    any longer it was papa who made me go to the melmottes who are    not nearly so well placed as mr brehgert everybody knows that    madame melmotte is a jewess and nobody knows what mr melmotte    is it is no good going on with the old thing when everything    seems to be upset and at sixes and sevens if papa has got to be    so poor that he is obliged to let the house in town one must of    course expect to be different from what we were     i hope you wont mind having me back the day after tomorrow    that is tomorrow wednesday there is a party here tonight    and mr brehgert is coming but i cant stay longer with julia    who doesnt make herself nice and i do not at all want to go    back to the melmottes i fancy that there is something wrong    between papa and mr melmotte     send the carriage to meet me by the 230 train from londonand    pray mamma dont scold when you see me or have hysterics or    anything of that sort of course it isnt all nice but things    have got so that they never will be nice again i shall tell mr    brehgert to go to papa on wednesday     your affectionate daughter     g   when the morning came she desired the servant to take the letter away and have it posted so that the temptation to stop it might no longer be in her way  about one oclock on that day mr longestaffe called at lady monograms the two ladies had breakfasted upstairs and had only just met in the drawingroom when he came in georgiana trembled at first but soon perceived that her father had as yet heard nothing of mr brehgert she immediately told him that she proposed returning home on the following day i am sick of the melmottes she said  and so am i said mr longestaffe with a serious countenance  we should have been delighted to have had georgiana to stay with us a little longer said lady monogram but we have but the one spare bedroom and another friend is coming georgiana who knew both these statements to be false declared that she wouldnt think of such a thing we have a few friends corning tonight mr longestaffe and i hope youll come in and see georgiana mr longestaffe hummed and hawed and muttered something as old gentlemen always do when they are asked to go out to parties after dinner mr brehgert will be here continued lady monogram with a peculiar smile  mr who the name was not at first familiar to mr longestaffe  mr brehgert lady monogram looked at her friend i hope im not revealing any secret  i dont understand anything about it said mr longestaffe georgiana who is mr brehgert he had understood very much he had been quite certain from lady monograms manner and words and also from his daughters face that mr brehgert was mentioned as an accepted lover lady monogram had meant that it should be so and any father would have understood her tone as she said afterwards to sir damask she was not going to have that jew there at her house as georgiana longestaffes accepted lover without mr longestaffes knowledge  my dear georgiana she said i supposed your father knew all about it  i know nothing georgiana i hate a mystery i insist upon knowing who is mr brehgert lady monogram  mr brehgert is avery wealthy gentleman that is all i know of him perhaps georgiana you will be glad to be alone with your father and lady monogram left the room  was there ever cruelty equal to this but now the poor girl was forced to speakthough she could not speak as boldly as she had written papa i wrote to mamma this morning and mr brehgert was to come to you tomorrow  do you mean that you are engaged to marry him  yes papa  what mr brehgert is he  he is a merchant  you cant mean the fat jew whom ive met with mr melmottea man old enough to be your father the poor girls condition now was certainly lamentable the fat jew old enough to be her father was the very man she did mean she thought that she would try to brazen it out with her father but at the present moment she had been so cowed by the manner in which the subject had been introduced that she did not know how to begin to be bold she only looked at him as though imploring him to spare her is the man a jew demanded mr longestaffe with as much thunder as he knew how to throw into his voice  yes papa she said  he is that fat man  yes papa  and nearly as old as i am  no papanot nearly as old as you are he is fifty  and a jew he again asked the horrid question and again threw in the thunder on this occasion she condescended to make no further reply if you do you shall do it as an alien from my house i certainly will never see him tell him not to come to me for i certainly will not speak to him you are degraded and disgraced but you shall not degrade and disgrace me and your mother and sister  it was you papa who told me to go to the melmottes  that is not true i wanted you to stay at caversham a jew an old fat jew heavens and earth that it should be possible that you should think of it youmy daughterthat used to take such pride in yourself have you written to your mother  i have  it will kill her it will simply kill her and you are going home tomorrow  i wrote to say so  and there you must remain i suppose i had better see the man and explain to him that it is utterly impossible heavens on eartha jew an old fat jew my daughter i will take you down home myself tomorrow what have i done that i should be punished by my children in this way the poor man had had rather a stormy interview with dolly that morning you had better leave this house today and come to my hotel in jermyn street  oh papa i cant do that  why cant you do it you can do it and you shall do it i will not have you see him again i will see him if you do not promise me to come i will send for lady monogram and tell her that i will not permit you to meet mr brehgert at her house i do wonder at her a jew an old fat jew mr longestaffe putting up both his hands walked about the room in despair  she did consent knowing that her father and lady monogram between them would be too strong for her she had her things packed up and in the course of the afternoon allowed herself to be carried away she said one word to lady monogram before she went tell him that i was called away suddenly  i will my dear i thought your papa would not like it the poor girl had not spirit sufficient to upbraid her friend nor did it suit her now to acerbate an enemy for the moment at least she must yield to everybody and everything she spent a lonely evening with her father in a dull sittingroom in the hotel hardly speaking or spoken to and the following day she was taken down to caversham she believed that her father had seen mr brehgert in the morning of that daybut he said no word to her nor did she ask him any question  that was on the day after lady monograms party early in the evening just as the gentlemen were coming up from the diningroom mr brehgert apparelled with much elegance made his appearance lady monogram received him with a sweet smile miss longestaffe she said has left me and gone to her father  oh indeed  yes said lady monogram bowing her head and then attending to other persons as they arrived nor did she condescend to speak another word to mr brehgert or to introduce him even to her husband he stood for about ten minutes inside the drawingroom leaning against the wall and then he departed no one had spoken a word to him but he was an eventempered goodhumoured man when miss longestaffe was his wife things would no doubt be differentor else she would probably change her acquaintance     chapter lxvi  so shall be my enmity   you shall be troubled no more with winifred hurtle so mrs hurtle had said speaking in perfect good faith to the man whom she had come to england with the view of marrying and then when he had said goodbye to her putting out his hand to take hers for the last time she declined that nay she had said this parting will bear no farewell  having left her after that fashion paul montague could not return home with very high spirits had she insisted on his taking that letter with the threat of the horsewhip as the letter which she intended to write to himthat letter which she had shown him owning it to be the ebullition of her uncontrolled passion and had then destroyed he might at any rate have consoled himself with thinking that however badly he might have behaved her conduct had been worse than his he could have made himself warm and comfortable with anger and could have assured himself that under any circumstances he must be right to escape from the clutches of a wildcat such as that but at the last moment she had shown that she was no wild cat to him she had melted and become soft and womanly in her softness she had been exquisitely beautiful and as he returned home he was sad and dissatisfied with himself he had destroyed her life for heror at least had created a miserable episode in it which could hardly be obliterated she had said that she was all alone and had given up everything to follow himand he had believed her was he to do nothing for her now she had allowed him to go and after her fashion had pardoned him the wrong he had done her but was that to be sufficient for himso that he might now feel inwardly satisfied at leaving her and make no further inquiry as to her fate could he pass on and let her be as the wine that has been drunkas the hour that has been enjoyed as the day that is past  but what could he do he had made good his own escape he had resolved that let her be woman or wild cat he would not marry her and in that he knew he had been right her antecedents as now declared by herself unfitted her for such a marriage were he to return to her he would be again thrusting his hand into the fire but his own selfish coldness was hateful to him when he thought that there was nothing to be done but to leave her desolate and lonely in mrs pipkins lodgings  during the next three or four days while the preparations for the dinner and the election were going on he was busy in respect to the american railway he again went down to liverpool and at mr ramsbottoms advice prepared a letter to the board of directors in which he resigned his seat and gave his reasons for resigning it adding that he should reserve to himself the liberty of publishing his letter should at any time the circumstances of the railway company seem to him to make such a course desirable he also wrote a letter to mr fisker begging that gentleman to come to england and expressing his own wish to retire altogether from the firm of fisker montague and montague upon receiving the balance of money due to hima payment which must he said be a matter of small moment to his two partners if as he had been informed they had enriched themselves by the success of the railway company in san francisco when he wrote these letters at liverpool the great rumour about melmotte had not yet sprung up he returned to london on the day of the festival and first heard of the report at the beargarden there he found that the old set had for the moment broken itself up sir felix carbury had not been heard of for the last four or five daysand then the whole story of miss melmottes journey of which he had read something in the newspapers was told to him we think that carbury has drowned himself said lord grasslough and i havent heard of anybody being heartbroken about it lord nidderdale had hardly been seen at the club hes taken up the running with the girl said lord grasslough what hell do now nobody knows if i was at it id have the money down in hard cash before i went into the church he was there at the party yesterday talking to the girl all the nighta sort of thing he never did before nidderdale is the best fellow going but he was always an ass nor had miles grendall been seen in the club for three days weve got into a way of play the poor fellow doesnt like said lord grasslough and then melmotte wont let him out of his sight he has taken to dine there every day this was said during the electionon the very day on which miles deserted his patron and on that evening he did dine at the club paul montague also dined there and would fain have heard something from grendall as to melmottes condition but the secretary if not faithful in all things was faithful at any rate in his silence though grasslough talked openly enough about melmotte in the smokingroom miles grendall said never a word  on the next day early in the afternoon almost without a fixed purpose montague strolled up to welbeck street and found hetta alone mamma has gone to her publishers she said she is writing so much now that she is always going there who has been elected mr montague paul knew nothing about the election and cared very little at that time however the election had not been decided i suppose it will make no difference to you whether your chairman be in parliament or not paul said that melmotte was no longer a chairman of his are you out of it altogether mr montague yesas far as it lay within his power to be out of it he was out of it he did not like mr melmotte nor believe in him then with considerable warmth he repudiated all connection with the melmotte party expressing deep regret that circumstances had driven him for a time into that alliance then you think that mr melmotte is  just a scoundrelthats all  you heard about felix  of course i heard that he was to marry the girl and that he tried to run off with her i dont know much about it they say that lord nidderdale is to marry her now  i think not mr montague  i hope not for his sake at any rate your brother is well out of it  do you know that she loves felix there is no pretence about that i do think she is good the other night at the party she spoke to me  you went to the party then  yesi could not refuse to go when mamma chose to take me and when i was there she spoke to me about felix i dont think she will marry lord nidderdale poor girli do pity her think what a downfall it will be if anything happens  but paul montague had certainly not come there with the intention of discussing melmottes affairs nor could he afford to lose the opportunity which chance had given him he was off with one love and now he thought that he might be on with the other hetta he said i am thinking more of myself than of heror even of felix  i suppose we all do think more of ourselves than of other people said hetta who knew from his voice at once what it was in his mind to do  yesbut i am not thinking of myself only i am thinking of myself and you in all my thoughts of myself i am thinking of you too  i do not know why you should do that  hetta you must know that i love you  do you she said of course she knew it and of course she thought that he was equally sure of her love had he chosen to read signs that ought to have been plain enough to him could he have doubted her love after the few words that had been spoken on that night when lady carbury had come in with roger and interrupted them she could not remember exactly what had been said but she did remember that he had spoken of leaving england for ever in a certain event and that she had not rebuked himand she remembered also how she had confessed her own love to her mother he of course had known nothing of that confession but he must have known that he had her heart  so at least she thought she had been working some morsel of lace as ladies do when ladies wish to be not quite doing nothing she had endeavoured to ply her needle very idly while he was speaking to her but now she allowed her hands to fall into her lap she would have continued to work at the lace had she been able but there are times when the eyes will not see clearly and when the hands will hardly act mechanically  yesi do hetta say a word to me can it be so look at me for one moment so as to let me know her eyes had turned downwards after her work if roger is dearer to you than i am i will go at once  roger is very dear to me  do you love him as i would have you love me  she paused for a time knowing that his eyes were fixed upon her and then she answered the question in a low voice but very clearly no she saidnot like that  can you love me like that he put out both his arms as though to take her to his breast should the answer be such as he longed to hear she raised her hand towards him as if to keep him back and left it with him when he seized it is it mine he said  if you want it  then he was at her feet in a moment kissing her hand and her dress looking up into her face with his eyes full of tears ecstatic with joy as though he had really never ventured to hope for such success want it he said hetta i have never wanted anything but that with real desire oh hetta my own since i first saw you this has been my only dream of happiness and now it is my own  she was very quiet but full of joy now that she had told him the truth she did not coy her love having once spoken the word she did not care how often she repeated it she did not think that she could ever have loved anybody but him evenif he had not been fond of her as to rogerdear roger dearest rogerno it was not the same thing he is as good as gold she saidever so much better than you are paul stroking his hair with her hand and looking into his eyes  better than anybody i have ever known said montague with all his energy  i think he isbut ah that is not everything i suppose we ought to love the best people best but i dont paul  i do said he  noyou dont you must love me best but i wont be called good i do not know why it has been so do you know paul i have sometimes thought i would do as he would have me out of sheer gratitude i did not know how to refuse such a trifling thing to one who ought to have everything that he wants  where should i have been  oh you somebody else would have made you happy but do you know paul i think he will never love any one else i ought not to say so because it seems to be making so much of myself but i feel it he is not so young a man and yet i think that he never was in love before he almost told me so once and what he says is true there is an unchanging way with him that is awful to think of he said that he never could be happy unless i would do as he would have meand he made me almost believe even that he speaks as though every word he says must come true in the end oh paul i love you so dearlybut i almost think that i ought to have obeyed him paul montague of course had very much to say in answer to this among the holy things which did exist to gild this everyday unholy world love was the holiest it should be soiled by no falsehood should know nothing of compromises should admit no excuses should make itself subject to no external circumstances if fortune had been so kind to him as to give him her heart poor as his claim might be she could have no right to refuse him the assurance of her love and though his rival were an angel he could have no shadow of a claim upon herseeing that he had failed to win her heart it was very well saidat least so hetta thoughtand she made no attempt at argument against him but what was to be done in reference to poor roger she had spoken the word now and whether for good or bad she had given herself to paul montague even though roger should have to walk disconsolate to the grave it could not now be helped but would it not be right that it should be told do you know i almost feel that he is like a father to me said hetta leaning on her lovers shoulder  paul thought it over for a few minutes and then said that he would himself write to roger hetta do you know i doubt whether he will ever speak to me again  i cannot believe that  there is a sternness about him which it is very hard to understand he has taught himself to think that as i met you in his house and as he then wished you to be his wife i should not have ventured to love you how could i have known  that would be unreasonable  he is unreasonableabout that it is not reason with him he always goes by his feelings had you been engaged to him  oh then you never could have spoken to me like this  but he will never look at it in that wayand he will tell me that i have been untrue to him and ungrateful  if you think paul  nay listen to me if it be so i must bear it it will be a great sorrow but it will be as nothing to that other sorrow had that come upon me i will write to him and his answer will be all scorn and wrath then you must write to him afterwards i think he will forgive you but he will never forgive me then they parted she having promised that she would tell her mother directly lady carbury came home and paul undertaking to write to roger that evening  and he did with infinite difficulty and much trembling of the spirit here is his letter      my dear roger     i think it right to tell you at once what has occurred today i    have proposed to miss carbury and she has accepted me you have    long known what my feelings were and i have also known yours i    have known too that miss carbury has more than once declined    to take your offer under these circumstances i cannot think    that i have been untrue to friendship in what i have done or    that i have proved myself ungrateful for the affectionate    kindness which you have always shown me i am authorised by    hetta to say that had i never spoken to her it must have been    the same to you this was hardly a fair representation of what    had been said but the writer looking back upon his interview    with the lady thought that it had been implied     i should not say so much by way of excusing myself but that you    once said that should such a thing occur there must be a    division between us ever after if i thought that you would    adhere to that threat i should be very unhappy and hetta would    be miserable surely if a man loves he is bound to tell his    love and to take the chance you would hardly have thought it    manly in me if i had abstained dear friend take a day or two    before you answer this and do not banish us from your heart if    you can help it     your affectionate friend     paul montague   roger carbury did not take a single dayor a single hour to answer the letter he received it at breakfast and after rushing out on the terrace and walking there for a few minutes he hurried to his desk and wrote his reply as he did so his whole face was red with wrath and his eyes were glowing with indignation      there is an old french saying that he who makes excuses is his    own accuser you would not have written as you have done had    you not felt yourself to be false and ungrateful you knew where    my heart was and there you went and undermined my treasure and    stole it away you have destroyed my life and i will never    forgive you     you tell me not to banish you both from my heart how dare you    join yourself with her in speaking of my feelings she will    never be banished from my heart she will be there morning    noon and night and as is and will be my love to her so shall    be my enmity to you     roger carbury   it was hardly a letter for a christian to write and yet in those parts roger carbury had the reputation of being a good christian  henrietta told her mother that morning immediately on her return mamma mr paul montague has been here  he always comes here when i am away said lady carbury  that has been an accident he could not have known that you were going to messrs leadham and loiters  im not so sure of that hetta  then mamma you must have told him yourself and i dont think you knew till just before you were going but mamma what does it matter he has been here and i have told him  you have not accepted him  yes mamma  without even asking me  mamma you knew i will not marry him without asking you how was i not to tell him when he asked me whether iloved him  marry him how is it possible you should marry him whatever he had got was in that affair of melmottes and that has gone to the dogs he is a ruined man and for aught i know may be compromised in all melmottes wickedness  oh mamma do not say that  but i do say it it is hard upon me i did think that you would try to comfort me after all this trouble with felix but you are as bad as he isor worse for you have not been thrown into temptation like that poor boy and you will break your cousins heart poor roger i feel for himhe that has been so true to us but you think nothing of that  i think very much of my cousin roger  and how do you show itor your love for me there would have been a home for us all now we must starve i suppose hetta you have been worse to me even than felix then lady carbury in her passion burst out of the room and took herself to her own chamber     chapter lxvii  sir felix protects his sister   up to this period of his life sir felix carbury had probably felt but little of the punishment due to his very numerous shortcomings he had spent all his fortune he had lost his commission in the army he had incurred the contempt of everybody that had known him he had forfeited the friendship of those who were his natural friends and had attached to him none others in their place he had pretty nearly ruined his mother and sister but to use his own language he had always contrived to carry on the game he had eaten and drunk had gambled hunted and diverted himself generally after the fashion considered to be appropriate to young men about town he had kept up till now but now there seemed to him to have come an end to all things when he was lying in bed in his mothers house he counted up all his wealth he had a few pounds in ready money he still had a little roll of mr miles grendalls notes of hand amounting perhaps to a couple of hundred poundsand mr melmotte owed him £600 but where was he to turn and what was he to do with himself gradually he learned the whole story of the journey to liverpoolhow marie had gone there and had been sent back by the police how maries money had been repaid to mr melmotte by mr broune and how his failure to make the journey to liverpool had become known he was ashamed to go to his club he could not go to melmottes house he was ashamed even to show himself in the streets by day  he was becoming almost afraid even of his mother now that the brilliant marriage had broken down and seemed to be altogether beyond hope now that he had to depend on her household for all his comforts he was no longer able to treat her with absolute scornnor was she willing to yield as she had yielded  one thing only was clear to him he must realize his possessions with this view he wrote both to miles grendall and to melmotte to the former he said he was going out of townprobably for some time and he must really ask for a cheque for the amount due he went on to remark that he could hardly suppose that a nephew of the duke of albury was unable to pay debts of honour to the amount of £200but that if such was the case he would have no alternative but to apply to the duke himself the reader need hardly be told that to this letter mr grendall vouchsafed no answer whatever in his letter to mr melmotte he confined himself to one matter of business in hand he made no allusion whatever to marie or to the great mans anger or to his seat at the board he simply reminded mr melmotte that there was a sum of £600 still due to him and requested that a cheque might be sent to him for that amount melmottes answer to this was not altogether unsatisfactory though it was not exactly what sir felix had wished a clerk from mr melmottes office called at the house in welbeck street and handed to felix railway scrip in the south central pacific and mexican railway to the amount of the sum claimedinsisting on a full receipt for the money before he parted with the scrip the clerk went on to explain on behalf of his employer that the money had been left in mr melmottes hands for the purpose of buying these shares sir felix who was glad to get anything signed the receipt and took the scrip this took place on the day after the balloting at westminster when the result was not yet knownand when the shares in the railway were very low indeed sir felix had asked as to the value of the shares at the time the clerk professed himself unable to quote the pricebut there were the shares if sir felix liked to take them of course he took themand hurrying off into the city found that they might perhaps be worth about half the money due to him the broker to whom he showed them could not quite answer for anything yesthe scrip had been very high but there was a panic they might recover or more probably they might go to nothing sir felix cursed the great financier aloud and left the scrip for sale that was the first time that he had been out of the house before dark since his little accident  but he was chiefly tormented in these days by the want of amusement he had so spent his life hitherto that he did not know how to get through a day in which no excitement was provided for him he never read thinking was altogether beyond him and he had never done a days work in his life he could lie in bed he could eat and drink he could smoke and sit idle he could play cards and could amuse himself with womenthe lower the culture of the women the better the amusement beyond these things the world had nothing for him therefore he again took himself to the pursuit of ruby ruggles  poor ruby had endured a very painful incarceration at her aunts house she had been wrathful and had stormed swearing that she would be free to come and go as she pleased free to go mrs pipkin told her that she wasbut not free to return if she went out otherwise than as she mrs pipkin chose am i to be a slave ruby asked and almost upset the perambulator which she had just dragged in at the hall door then mrs hurtle had taken upon herself to talk to her and poor ruby had been quelled by the superior strength of the american lady but she was very unhappy finding that it did not suit her to be nursemaid to her aunt after all john crumb couldnt have cared for her a bit or he would have come to look after her while she was in this condition sir felix came to mrs pipkins house and asked for her at the door it happened that mrs pipkin herself had opened the door and in her fright and dismay at the presence of so pernicious a young man in her own passage had denied that ruby was in the house but ruby had heard her lovers voice and had rushed up and thrown herself into his arms then there had been a great scene ruby had sworn that she didnt care for her aunt didnt care for her grandfather or for mrs hurtle or for john crumbor for any person or anything she cared only for her lover then mrs hurtle had asked the young man his intentions did he mean to marry ruby sir felix had said that he supposed he might as well some day there said ruby there shouting in triumph as though an offer had been made to her with the completest ceremony of which such an event admits mrs pipkin had been very weak instead of calling in the assistance of her strongminded lodger she had allowed the lovers to remain together for half an hour in the diningroom i do not know that sir felix in any way repeated his promise during that time but ruby was probably too blessed with the word that had been spoken to ask for such renewal there must be an end of this said mrs pipkin coming in when the halfhour was over then sir felix had gone promising to come again on the following evening you must not come here sir felix said mrs pipkin unless you puts it in writing to this of course sir felix made no answer as he went home he congratulated himself on the success of his adventure perhaps the best thing he could do when he had realized the money for the shares would be to take ruby for a tour abroad the money would last for three or four monthsand three or four months ahead was almost an eternity  that afternoon before dinner he found his sister alone in the drawingroom lady carbury had gone to her own room after hearing the distressing story of paul montagues love and had not seen hetta since hetta was melancholy thinking of her mothers hard words thinking perhaps of pauls poverty as declared by her mother and of the ages which might have to wear themselves out before she could become his wife but still tinting all her thoughts with a rosy hue because of the love which had been declared to her she could not but be happy if he really loved her and sheas she had told him that she loved himwould be true to him through everything in her present mood she could not speak of herself to her brother but she took the opportunity of making good the promise which marie melmotte had extracted from her she gave him some short account of the party and told him that she had talked with marie i promised to give you a message she said  its all of no use now said felix  but i must tell you what she said i think you know that she really loves you  but whats the good of it a man cant marry a girl when all the policemen in the country are dodging her  she wants you to let her know whatwhat you intend to do if you mean to give her up i think you should tell her  how can i tell her i dont suppose they would let her receive a letter  shall i write to heror shall i see her  just as you like i dont care  felix you are very heartless  i dont suppose im much worse than other menor for the matter of that worse than a great many women either you all of you here put me up to marry her  i never put you up to it  mother did and now because it did not go off all serene i am to hear nothing but reproaches of course i never cared so very much about her  oh felix that is so shocking  awfully shocking i dare say you think i am as black as the very mischief and that sugar wouldnt melt in other mens mouths other men are just as bad as i amand a good deal worse too you believe that there is nobody on earth like paul montague hetta blushed but said nothing she was not yet in a condition to boast of her lover before her brother but she did in very truth believe that but few young men were as truehearted as paul montague i suppose youd be surprised to hear that master paul is engaged to marry an american widow living at islington  mr montagueengagedto marryan american widow i dont believe it  youd better believe it if its any concern of yours for its true and its true too that he travelled about with her for ever so long in the united states and that he had her down with him at the hotel at lowestoft about a fortnight ago theres no mistake about it  i dont believe it repeated hetta feeling that to say even as much as that was some relief to her it could not be true it was impossible that the man should have come to her with such a lie in his mouth as that though the words astounded her though she felt faint almost as though she would fall in a swoon yet in her heart of hearts she did not believe it surely it was some horrid jokeor perhaps some trick to divide her from the man she loved felix how dare you say things so wicked as that to me  what is there wicked in it if you have been fool enough to become fond of the man it is only right you should be told he is engaged to marry mrs hurtle and she is lodging with one mrs pipkin in islington i know the house and could take you there tomorrow and show you the woman there said he thats where she isand he wrote mrs hurtles name down on a scrap of paper  it is not true said hetta rising from her seat and standing upright i am engaged to mr montague and i am sure he would not treat me in that way  then by heaven he shall answer it to me said felix jumping up if he has done that it is time that i should interfere as true as i stand here he is engaged to marry a woman called mrs hurtle whom he constantly visits at that place in islington  i do not believe it said hetta repeating the only defence for her lover which was applicable at the moment  by george this is beyond a joke will you believe it if roger carbury says its true i know youd believe anything fast enough against me if he told you  roger carbury will not say so  have you the courage to ask him i say he will say so he knows all about itand has seen the woman  how can you know has roger told you  i do know and thats enough i will make this square with master paul by heaven yes he shall answer to me but my mother must manage you she will not scruple to ask roger and she will believe what roger tells her  i do not believe a word of it said hetta leaving the room but when she was alone she was very wretched there must be some foundation for such a tale why should felix have referred to roger carbury and she did feel that there was something in her brothers manner which forbade her to reject the whole story as being altogether baseless so she sat upon her bed and cried and thought of all the tales she had heard of faithless lovers and yet why should the man have come to her not only with soft words of love but asking her hand in marriage if it really were true that he was in daily communication with another woman whom he had promised to make his wife  nothing on the subject was said at dinner hetta with difficulty to herself sat at the table and did not speak lady carbury and her son were nearly as silent soon after dinner felix slunk away to some music hall or theatre in quest probably of some other ruby ruggles then lady carbury who had now been told as much as her son knew again attacked her daughter very much of the story felix had learned from ruby ruby had of course learned that paul was engaged to mrs hurtle mrs hurtle had at once declared the fact to mrs pipkin and mrs pipkin had been proud of the position of her lodger ruby had herself seen paul montague at the house and had known that he had taken mrs hurtle to lowestoft and it had also become known to the two women the aunt and her niece that mrs hurtle had seen roger carbury on the sands at lowestoft thus the whole story with most of its detailsnot quite with allhad come round to lady carburys ears what he has told you my dear is true much as i disapprove of mr montague you do not suppose that i would deceive you  how can he know mamma  he does know i cannot explain to you how he has been at the same house  has he seen her  i do not know that he has but roger carbury has seen her if i write to him you will believe what he says  dont do that mamma dont write to him  but i shall why should i not write if he can tell me if this other man is a villain am i not bound to protect you of course felix is not steady if it came only from him you might not credit it and he has not seen her if your cousin roger tells you that it is truetells me that he knows the man is engaged to marry this woman then i suppose you will be contented  contented mamma  satisfied that what we tell you is true  i shall never be contented again if that is true i will never believe anything it cant be true i suppose there is something but it cant be that  the story was not altogether displeasing to lady carbury though it pained her to see the agony which her daughter suffered but she had no wish that paul montague should be her soninlaw and she still thought that if roger would persevere he might succeed on that very night before she went to bed she wrote to roger and told him the whole story if she said you know that there is such a person as mrs hurtle and if you know also that mr montague has promised to make her his wife of course you will tell me then she declared her own wishes thinking that by doing so she could induce roger carbury to give such real assistance in this matter that paul montague would certainly be driven away who could feel so much interest in doing this as roger or who be so closely acquainted with all the circumstances of montagues life you know she said what my wishes are about hetta and how utterly opposed i am to mr montagues interference if it is true as felix says that he is at the present moment entangled with another woman he is guilty of gross insolence and if you know all the circumstances you can surely protect usand also yourself     chapter lxviii  miss melmotte declares her purpose   poor hetta passed a very bad night the story she had heard seemed to be almost too awful to be trueeven about any one else the man had come to her and had asked her to be his wifeand yet at that very moment was living in habits of daily intercourse with another woman whom he had promised to marry and then too his courtship with her had been so graceful so soft so modest and yet so long continued though he had been slow in speech she had known since their first meeting how he regarded her the whole state of his mind had she had thought been visible to herhad been intelligible gentle and affectionate he had been aware of her friends feeling and had therefore hesitated he had kept himself from her because he had owed so much to friendship and yet his love had not been the less true and had not been less dear to poor hetta she had waited sure that it would comehaving absolute confidence in his honour and love and now she was told that this man had been playing a game so base and at the same time so foolish that she could find not only no excuse but no possible cause for it it was not like any story she had heard before of mans faithlessness though she was wretched and sore at heart she swore to herself that she would not believe it she knew that her mother would write to roger carburybut she knew also that nothing more would be said about the letter till the answer should come nor could she turn anywhere else for comfort she did not dare to appeal to paul himself as regarded him for the present she could only rely on the assurance which she continued to give herself that she would not believe a word of the story that had been told her  but there was other wretchedness besides her own she had undertaken to give marie melmottes message to her brother she had done so and she must now let marie have her brothers reply that might be told in a very few wordseverything is over but it had to be told  i want to call upon miss melmotte if youll let me she said to her mother at breakfast  why should you want to see miss melmotte i thought you hated the melmottes  i dont hate them mamma i certainly dont hate her i have a message to take to herfrom felix  a messagefrom felix  it is an answer from him she wanted to know if all that was over of course it is over whether he said so or not it would be so they could never be married now could they mamma  the marriage in lady carburys mind was no longer even desirable she too was beginning to disbelieve in the melmotte wealth and did quite disbelieve that that wealth would come to her son even should he succeed in marrying the daughter it was impossible that melmotte should forgive such offence as had now been committed it is out of the question she said that like everything else with us has been a wretched failure you can go if you please felix is under no obligation to them and has taken nothing from them i should much doubt whether the girl will get anybody to take her now you cant go alone you know lady carbury added but hetta said that she did not at all object to going alone as far as that it was only just over oxford street  so she went out and made her way into grosvenor square she had heard but at the time remembered nothing of the temporary migration of the melmottes to bruton street seeing as she approached the house that there was a confusion there of carts and workmen she hesitated but she went on and rang the bell at the door which was wide open within the hall the pilasters and trophies the wreaths and the banners which three or four days since had been built up with so much trouble were now being pulled down and hauled away and amidst the ruins melmotte himself was standing he was now a member of parliament and was to take his place that night in the house nothing at any rate should prevent that it might be but for a short timebut it should be written in the history of his life that he had sat in the british house of commons as member for westminster at the present moment he was careful to show himself everywhere it was now noon and he had already been into the city at this moment he was talking to the contractor for the workhaving just propitiated that man by a payment which would hardly have been made so soon but for the necessity which these wretched stories had entailed upon him of keeping up his credit for the possession of money hetta timidly asked one of the workmen whether miss melmotte was there do you want my daughter said melmotte coming forward and just touching his hat she is not living here at present  ohi remember now said hetta  may i be allowed to tell her who was asking after her at the present moment melmotte was not unreasonably suspicious about his daughter  i am miss carbury said hetta in a very low voice  oh indeedmiss carburythe sister of sir felix carbury there was something in the tone of the mans voice which grated painfully on hettas earsbut she answered the question ohsir felixs sister may i be permitted to ask whetheryou have any business with my daughter the story was a hard one to tell with all the workmen around her in the midst of the lumber with the coarse face of the suspicious man looking down upon her but she did tell it very simply she had come with a message from her brother there had been something between her brother and miss melmotte and her brother had felt that it would be best that he should acknowledge that it must be all over i wonder whether that is true said melmotte looking at her out of his great coarse eyes with his eyebrows knit with his hat on his head and his hands in his pockets hetta not knowing how at the moment to repudiate the suspicion expressed was silent because you know there has been a deal of falsehood and double dealing sir felix has behaved infamously yesby g infamously a day or two before my daughter started he gave me a written assurance that the whole thing was over and now he sends you here how am i to know what you are really after  i have come because i thought i could do some good she said trembling with anger and fear i was speaking to your daughter at your party  oh you were therewere you it may be as you say but how is one to tell when one has been deceived like that one is apt to be suspicious miss carbury here was one who had spent his life in lying to the world and who was in his very heart shocked at the atrocity of a man who had lied to him you are not plotting another journey to liverpoolare you to this hetta could make no answer the insult was too much but alone unsupported she did not know how to give him back scorn for scorn at last he proposed to take her across to bruton street himself and at his bidding she walked by his side may i hear what you say to her he asked  if you suspect me mr melmotte i had better not see her at all it is only that there may no longer be any doubt  you can say it all before me  noi could not do that but i have told you and you can say it for me if you please i think i will go home now  but melmotte knew that his daughter would not believe him on such a subject this girl she probably would believe and though melmotte himself found it difficult to trust anybody he thought that there was more possible good than evil to be expected from the proposed interview oh you shall see her he said i dont suppose shes such a fool as to try that kind of thing again then the door in bruton street was opened and hetta repenting her mission found herself almost pushed into the hall she was bidden to follow melmotte upstairs and was left alone in the drawingroom as she thought for a long time then the door was slowly opened and marie crept into the room miss carbury she said this is so good of youso good of you i do so love you for coming to me you said you would love me you will will you not and marie sitting down by the stranger took her hand and encircled her waist  mr melmotte has told you why i have come  yesthat is i dont know i never believe what papa says to me to poor hetta such an announcement as this was horrible we are at daggers drawn he thinks i ought to do just what he tells me as though my very soul were not my own i wont agree to thatwould you hetta had not come there to preach disobedience but could not fail to remember at the moment that she was not disposed to obey her mother in an affair of the same kind what does he say dear  hettas message was to be conveyed in three words and when those were told there was nothing more to be said it must all be over miss melmotte  is that his message miss carbury hetta nodded her head is that all  what more can i say the other night you told me to bid him send you word and i thought he ought to do so i gave him your message and i have brought back the answer my brother you know has no income of his ownnothing at all  but i have said marie with eagerness  but your father  it does not depend upon papa if papa treats me badly i can give it to my husband i know i can if i can venture cannot he  i think it is impossible  impossible nothing should be impossible all the people that one hears of that are really true to their loves never find anything impossible does he love me miss carbury it all depends on that thats what i want to know she paused but hetta could not answer the question you must know about your brother dont you know whether he does love me if you know i think you ought to tell me hetta was still silent have you nothing to say  miss melmotte began poor hetta very slowly  call me marie you said you would love me did you not i dont even know what your name is  my name is hetta  hettathats short for something but its very pretty i have no brother no sister and ill tell you though you must not tell anybody againi have no real mother madame melmotte is not my mamma though papa chooses that it should be thought so all this she whispered with rapid words almost into hettas ear and papa is so cruel to me he beats me sometimes the new friend round whom marie still had her arm shuddered as she heard this but i never will yield a bit for that when he boxes and thumps me i always turn and gnash my teeth at him can you wonder that i want to have a friend can you be surprised that i should be always thinking of my lover butif he doesnt love me what am i to do then  i dont know what i am to say ejaculated hetta amidst her sobs whether the girl was good or bad to be sought or to be avoided there was so much tragedy in her position that hettas heart was melted with sympathy  i wonder whether you love anybody and whether he loves you said marie hetta certainly had not come there to talk of her own affairs and made no reply to this i suppose you wont tell me about yourself  i wish i could tell you something for your own comfort  he will not try again you think  i am sure he will not  i wonder what he fears i should fear nothingnothing why should not we walk out of the house and be married any way nobody has a right to stop me papa could only turn me out of his house i will venture if he will  it seemed to hetta that even listening to such a proposition amounted to falsehoodto that guilt of which mr melmotte had dared to suppose that she could be capable i cannot listen to it indeed i cannot listen to it my brother is sure that he cannotcannot  cannot love me hetta say it out if it is true  it is true said hetta there came over the face of the other girl a stern hard look as though she had resolved at the moment to throw away from her all soft womanly things and she relaxed her hold on hettas waist oh my dear i do not mean to be cruel but you ask me for the truth  yes i did  men are not i think like girls  i suppose not said marie slowly what liars they are what bruteswhat wretches why should he tell me lies like that why should he break my heart that other man never said that he loved me did he never love meonce  hetta could hardly say that her brother was incapable of such love as marie expected but she knew that it was so it is better that you should think of him no more  are you like that if you had loved a man and told him of it and agreed to be his wife and done as i have could you bear to be told to think of him no morejust as though you had got rid of a servant or a horse i wont love him noill hate him but i must think of him ill marry that other man to spite him and then when he finds that we are rich hell be brokenhearted  you should try to forgive him marie  never do not tell him that i forgive him i command you not to tell him that tell himtell him that i hate him and that if i ever meet him i will look at him so that he shall never forget it i couldoh you do not know what i could do tell medid he tell you to say that he did not love me  i wish i had not come said hetta  i am glad you have come it was very kind i dont hate you of course i ought to know but did he say that i was to be told that he did not love me  nohe did not say that  then how do you know what did he say  that it was all over  because he is afraid of papa are you sure he does not love me  i am sure  then he is a brute tell him that i say that he is a falsehearted liar and that i trample him under my foot marie as she said this thrust her foot upon the ground as though that false one were in truth beneath itand spoke aloud as though regardless who might hear her i despise himdespise him they are all bad but he is the worst of all papa beats me but i can bear that mamma reviles me and i can bear that he might have beaten me and reviled me and i could have borne it but to think that he was a liar all the timethat i cant bear then she burst into tears hetta kissed her tried to comfort her and left her sobbing on the sofa  later in the day two or three hours after miss carbury had gone marie melmotte who had not shown herself at luncheon walked into madame melmottes room and thus declared her purpose you can tell papa that i will marry lord nidderdale whenever he pleases she spoke in french and very rapidly  on hearing this madame melmotte expressed herself to be delighted your papa said she will be very glad to hear that you have thought better of this at last lord nidderdale is i am sure a very good young man  yes continued marie boiling over with passion as she spoke ill marry lord nidderdale or that horrid mr grendall who is worse than all the others or his old fool of a fatheror the sweeper at the crossingor the black man that waits at table or anybody else that he chooses to pick up i dont care who it is the least in the world but ill lead him such a life afterwards ill make lord nidderdale repent the hour he saw me you may tell papa and then having thus entrusted her message to madame melmotte marie left the room     chapter lxix  melmotte in parliament   melmotte did not return home in time to hear the good news that day good news as he would regard it even though when told to him it should be accompanied by all the extraneous additions with which marie had communicated her purpose to madame melmotte it was nothing to him what the girl thought of the marriageif the marriage could now be brought about he too had cause for vexation if not for anger if marie had consented a fortnight since he might have so hurried affairs that lord nidderdale might by this time have been secured now there might bemust be doubt through the folly of his girl and the villainy of sir felix carbury were he once the fatherinlaw of the eldest son of a marquis he thought he might almost be safe even though something might be all but proved against himwhich might come to certain proof in less august circumstancesmatters would hardly be pressed against a member for westminster whose daughter was married to the heir of the marquis of auld reekie so many persons would then be concerned of course his vexation with marie had been great of course his wrath against sir felix was unbounded the seat for westminster was his he was to be seen to occupy it before all the world on this very day but he had not as yet heard that his daughter had yielded in reference to lord nidderdale  there was considerable uneasiness felt in some circles as to the manner in which melmotte should take his seat when he was put forward as the conservative candidate for the borough a good deal of fuss had been made with him by certain leading politicians it had been the manifest intention of the party that his return if he were returned should be hailed as a great conservative triumph and be made much of through the length and the breadth of the land he was returnedbut the trumpets had not as yet been sounded loudly on a sudden within the space of fortyeight hours the party had become ashamed of their man and now who was to introduce him to the house but with this feeling of shame on one side there was already springing up an idea among another class that melmotte might become as it were a conservative tribune of the peoplethat he might be the realization of that hitherto hazy mixture of radicalism and oldfogyism of which we have lately heard from a political master whose eloquence has been employed in teaching us that progress can only be expected from those whose declared purpose is to stand still the new farthing newspaper the mob was already putting melmotte forward as a political hero preaching with reference to his commercial transactions the grand doctrine that magnitude in affairs is a valid defence for certain irregularities a napoleon though he may exterminate tribes in carrying out his projects cannot be judged by the same law as a young lieutenant who may be punished for cruelty to a few negroes the mob thought that a good deal should be overlooked in a melmotte and that the philanthropy of his great designs should be allowed to cover a multitude of sins i do not know that the theory was ever so plainly put forward as it was done by the ingenious and courageous writer in the mob but in practice it has commanded the assent of many intelligent minds  mr melmotte therefore though he was not where he had been before that wretched squercum had set afloat the rumours as to the purchase of pickering was able to hold his head much higher than on the unfortunate night of the great banquet he had replied to the letter from messrs slow and bideawhile by a note written in the ordinary way in the office and only signed by himself in this he merely said that he would lose no time in settling matters as to the purchase of pickering slow and bideawhile were of course anxious that things should be settled they wanted no prosecution for forgery to make themselves clear in the matter and their clientand if possible to take some wind out of the sails of the odious squercumthis would suit them best they were prone to hope that for his own sake melmotte would raise the money if it were raised there would be no reason why that note purporting to have been signed by dolly longestaffe should ever leave their office they still protested their belief that it did bear dollys signature they had various excuses for themselves it would have been useless for them to summon dolly to their office as they knew from long experience that dolly would not come the very letter written by themselvesas a suggestionand given to dollys father had come back to them with dollys ordinary signature sent to themas they believedwith other papers by dollys father what justification could be clearer but still the money had not been paid that was the fault of longestaffe senior but if the money could be paid that would set everything right squercum evidently thought that the money would not be paid and was ceaseless in his intercourse with bideawhiles people he charged slow and bideawhile with having delivered up the titledeeds on the authority of a mere note and that a note with a forged signature he demanded that the note should be impounded on the receipt by mr bideawhile of melmottes rather curt reply mr squercum was informed that mr melmotte had promised to pay the money at once but that a day or two must be allowed mr squercum replied that on his clients behalf he should open the matter before the lord mayor  but in this way two or three days had passed without any renewal of the accusation before the public and melmotte had in a certain degree recovered his position the beauclerks and the luptons disliked and feared him as much as ever but they did not quite dare to be so loud and confident in condemnation as they had been it was pretty well known that mr longestaffe had not received his moneyand that was a condition of things tending greatly to shake the credit of a man living after melmottes fashion but there was no crime in that no forgery was implied by the publication of any statement to that effect the longestaffes father and son might probably have been very foolish whoever expected anything but folly from either and slow and bideawhile might have been very remiss in their duty it was astonishing some people said what things attorneys would do in these days but they who had expected to see melmotte behind the bars of a prison before this and had regulated their conduct accordingly now imagined that they had been deceived  had the westminster triumph been altogether a triumph it would have become the pleasant duty of some popular conservative to express to melmotte the pleasure he would have in introducing his new political ally to the house in such case melmotte himself would have been walked up the chamber with a pleasurable ovation and the thing would have been done without trouble to him but now this was not the position of affairs though the matter was debated at the carlton no such popular conservative offered his services i dont think we ought to throw him over mr beauclerk said sir orlando drought quite a leading conservative suggested that as lord nidderdale was very intimate with mr melmotte he might do it but nidderdale was not the man for such a performance he was a very good fellow and everybody liked him he belonged to the house because his father had territorial influence in a scotch countybut he never did anything there and his selection for such a duty would be a declaration to the world that nobody else would do it it wouldnt hurt you lupton said mr beauclerk not at all said lupton but i also like nidderdale am a young man and of no useand a great deal too bashful melmotte who knew but little about it went down to the house at four oclock somewhat cowed by want of companionship but carrying out his resolution that he would be stopped by no phantom fearsthat he would lose nothing by want of personal pluck he knew that he was a member and concluded that if he presented himself he would be able to make his way in and assume his right but here again fortune befriended him the very leader of the party the very founder of that new doctrine of which it was thought that melmotte might become an apostle and an expounderwho as the reader may remember had undertaken to be present at the banquet when his colleagues were dismayed and untrue to him and who kept his promise and sat there almost in solitudehe happened to be entering the house as his late host was claiming from the doorkeeper the fruition of his privilege you had better let me accompany you said the conservative leader with something of chivalry in his heart and so mr melmotte was introduced to the house by the head of his party when this was seen many men supposed that the rumours had been proved to be altogether false was not this a guarantee sufficient to guarantee any mans respectability  lord nidderdale saw his father in the lobby of the house of lords that afternoon and told him what had occurred the old man had been in a state of great doubt since the day of the dinner party he was aware of the ruin that would be incurred by a marriage with melmottes daughter if the things which had been said of melmotte should be proved to be true but he knew also that if his son should now recede there must be an end of the match altogetherand he did not believe the rumours he was fully determined that the money should be paid down before the marriage was celebrated but if his son were to secede now of course no money would be forthcoming he was prepared to recommend his son to go on with the affair still a little longer old cure tells me he doesnt believe a word of it said the father cure was the family lawyer of the marquises of auld reekie  theres some hitch about dolly longestaffes money sir said the son  whats that to us if he has our money ready i suppose it isnt always easy even for a man like that to get a couple of hundred thousand together i know ive never found it easy to get a thousand if he has borrowed a trifle from longestaffe to make up the girls money i shant complain you stand to your guns theres no harm done till the parson has said the word  you couldnt let me have a couple of hundredcould you sir suggested the son  no i couldnt replied the father with a very determined aspect  im awfully hard up  so am i then the old man toddled into his own chamber and after sitting there ten minutes went away home  lord nidderdale also got quickly through his legislative duties and went to the beargarden there he found grasslough and miles grendall dining together and seated himself at the next table they were full of news youve heard it i suppose said miles in an awful whisper  heard what  i believe he doesnt know said lord grasslough by jove nidderdale youre in a mess like some others  whats up now  only fancy that they shouldnt have known down at the house vossner has bolted  bolted exclaimed nidderdale dropping the spoon with which he was just going to eat his soup  bolted repeated grasslough lord nidderdale looked round the room and became aware of the awful expression of dismay which hung upon the features of all the dining members bolted by george he has sold all our acceptances to a fellow in great marlbro thats called flatfleece  i know him said nidderdale shaking his head  i should think so said miles ruefully  a bottle of champagne said nidderdale appealing to the waiter in almost a humble voice feeling that he wanted sustenance in this new trouble that had befallen him the waiter beaten almost to the ground by an awful sense of the condition of the club whispered to him the terrible announcement that there was not a bottle of champagne in the house good g exclaimed the unfortunate nobleman miles grendall shook his head grasslough shook his head  its true said another young lord from the table on the other side then the waiter still speaking with suppressed and melancholy voice suggested that there was some port left it was now the middle of july  brandy suggested nidderdale there had been a few bottles of brandy but they had been already consumed send out and get some brandy said nidderdale with rapid impetuosity but the club was so reduced in circumstances that he was obliged to take silver out of his pocket before he could get even such humble comfort as he now demanded  then lord grasslough told the whole story as far as it was known herr vossner had not been seen since nine oclock on the preceding evening the head waiter had known for some weeks that heavy bills were due it was supposed that three or four thousand pounds were owing to tradesmen who now professed that the credit had been given not to herr vossner but to the club and the numerous acceptances for large sums which the accommodating purveyor held from many of the members had all been sold to mr flatfleece mr flatfleece had spent a considerable portion of the day at the club and it was now suggested that he and herr vossner were in partnership at this moment dolly longestaffe came in dolly had been at the club before and had heard the storybut had gone at once to another club for his dinner when he found that there was not even a bottle of wine to be had heres a go said dolly one thing atop of another therell be nothing left for anybody soon is that brandy youre drinking nidderdale there was none here when i left  had to send round the corner for it to the public  we shall be sending round the corner for a good many things now does anybody know anything of that fellow melmotte  hes down in the house as big as life said nidderdale hes all right i think  i wish hed pay me my money then that fellow flatfleece was here and he showed me notes of mine for about £1500 i write such a beastly hand that i never know whether ive written it or not but by george a fellow cant eat and drink £1500 in less than six months  theres no knowing what you can do dolly said lord grasslough  hes paid some of your card money perhaps said nidderdale  i dont think he ever did carbury had a lot of my ious while that was going on but i got the money for that from old melmotte how is a fellow to know if any fellow writes d longestaffe am i obliged to pay it everybody is writing my name how is any fellow to stand that kind of thing do you think melmottes all right nidderdale said that he did think so i wish he wouldnt go and write my name then thats a sort of thing that a man should be left to do for himself i suppose vossner is a swindler but by jove i know a worse than vossner with that he turned on his heels and went into the smokingroom and after he was gone there was silence at the table for it was known that lord nidderdale was to marry melmottes daughter  in the meantime a scene of a different kind was going on in the house of commons melmotte had been seated on one of the back conservative benches and there he remained for a considerable time unnoticed and forgotten the little emotion that had attended his entrance had passed away and melmotte was now no more than any one else at first he had taken his hat off but as soon as he observed that the majority of members were covered he put it on again then he sat motionless for an hour looking round him and wondering he had never hitherto been even in the gallery of the house the place was very much smaller than he had thought and much less tremendous the speaker did not strike him with the awe which he had expected and it seemed to him that they who spoke were talking much like other people in other places for the first hour he hardly caught the meaning of a sentence that was said nor did he try to do so one man got up very quickly after another some of them barely rising on their legs to say the few words that they uttered it seemed to him to be a very commonplace affairnot half so awful as those festive occasions on which he had occasionally been called upon to propose a toast or to return thanks then suddenly the manner of the thing was changed and one gentleman made a long speech melmotte by this time weary of observing had begun to listen and words which were familiar to him reached his ears the gentleman was proposing some little addition to a commercial treaty and was expounding in very strong language the ruinous injustice to which england was exposed by being tempted to use gloves made in a country in which no income tax was levied melmotte listened to his eloquence caring nothing about gloves and very little about englands ruin but in the course of the debate which followed a question arose about the value of money of exchange and of the conversion of shillings into francs and dollars about this melmotte really did know something and he pricked up his ears it seemed to him that a gentleman whom he knew very well in the cityand who had maliciously stayed away from his dinnerone mr brown who sat just before him on the same side of the house and who was plodding wearily and slowly along with some pet fiscal theory of his own understood nothing at all of what he was saying here was an opportunity for himself here was at his hand the means of revenging himself for the injury done him and of showing to the world at the same time that he was not afraid of his city enemies it required some courage certainlythis attempt that suggested itself to him of getting upon his legs a couple of hours after his first introduction to parliamentary life but he was full of the lesson which he was now ever teaching himself nothing should cow him whatever was to be done by brazenfaced audacity he would do it seemed to be very easy and he saw no reason why he should not put that old fool right he knew nothing of the forms of the housewas more ignorant of them than an ordinary schoolboybut on that very account felt less trepidation than might another parliamentary novice mr brown was tedious and prolix and melmotte though he thought much of his project and had almost told himself that he would do the thing was still doubting when suddenly mr brown sat down there did not seem to be any particular end to the speech nor had melmotte followed any general thread of argument but a statement had been made and repeated containing as melmotte thought a fundamental error in finance and he longed to set the matter right at any rate he desired to show the house that mr brown did not know what he was talking aboutbecause mr brown had not come to his dinner when mr brown was seated nobody at once rose the subject was not popular and they who understood the business of the house were well aware that the occasion had simply been one on which two or three commercial gentlemen having crazes of their own should be allowed to ventilate them the subject would have droppedbut on a sudden the new member was on his legs  now it was probably not in the remembrance of any gentleman there that a member had got up to make a speech within two or three hours of his first entry into the house and this gentleman was one whose recent election had been of a very peculiar kind it had been considered by many of his supporters that his name should be withdrawn just before the ballot by others that he would be deterred by shame from showing himself even if he were elected and again by another party that his appearance in parliament would be prevented by his disappearance within the walls of newgate but here he was not only in his seat but on his legs the favourable grace the air of courteous attention which is always shown to a new member when he first speaks was extended also to melmotte there was an excitement in the thing which made gentlemen willing to listen and a consequent hum almost of approbation  as soon as melmotte was on his legs and looking round found that everybody was silent with the intent of listening to him a good deal of his courage oozed out of his fingers ends the house which to his thinking had by no means been august while mr brown had been toddling through his speech now became awful he caught the eyes of great men fixed upon himof men who had not seemed to him to be at all great as he had watched them a few minutes before yawning beneath their hats mr brown poor as his speech had been had no doubt prepared itand had perhaps made three or four such speeches every year for the last fifteen years melmotte had not dreamed of putting two words together he had thought as far as he had thought at all that he could rattle off what he had to say just as he might do it when seated in his chair at the mexican railway board but there was the speaker and those three clerks in their wigs and the maceand worse than all the eyes of that long row of statesmen opposite to him his position was felt by him to be dreadful he had forgotten even the very point on which he had intended to crush mr brown  but the courage of the man was too high to allow him to be altogether quelled at once the hum was prolonged and though he was red in the face perspiring and utterly confused he was determined to make a dash at the matter with the first words which would occur to him mr brown is all wrong he said he had not even taken off his hat as he rose mr brown turned slowly round and looked up at him some one whom he could not exactly hear touching him behind suggested that he should take off his hat there was a cry of order which of course he did not understand yes you are said melmotte nodding his head and frowning angrily at poor mr brown  the honourable member said the speaker with the most goodnatured voice which he could assume is not perhaps as yet aware that he should not call another member by his name he should speak of the gentleman to whom he alluded as the honourable member for whitechapel and in speaking he should address not another honourable member but the chair  you should take your hat off said the goodnatured gentleman behind  in such a position how should any man understand so many and such complicated instructions at once and at the same time remember the gist of the argument to be produced he did take off his hat and was of course made hotter and more confused by doing so what he said was all wrong continued melmotte and i should have thought a man out of the city like mr brown ought to have known better then there were repeated calls of order and a violent ebullition of laughter from both sides of the house the man stood for a while glaring around him summoning his own pluck for a renewal of his attack on mr brown determined that he would be appalled and put down neither by the ridicule of those around him nor by his want of familiarity with the place but still utterly unable to find words with which to carry on the combat i ought to know something about it said melmotte sitting down and hiding his indignation and his shame under his hat  we are sure that the honourable member for westminster does understand the subject said the leader of the house and we shall be very glad to hear his remarks the house i am sure will pardon ignorance of its rules in so young a member  but mr melmotte would not rise again he had made a great effort and had at any rate exhibited his courage though they might all say that he had not displayed much eloquence they would be driven to admit that he had not been ashamed to show himself he kept his seat till the regular stampede was made for dinner and then walked out with as stately a demeanour as he could assume  well that was plucky said cohenlupe taking his friends arm in the lobby  i dont see any pluck in it that old fool brown didnt know what he was talking about and i wanted to tell them so they wouldnt let me do it and theres an end of it it seems to me to be a stupid sort of a place  has longestaffes money been paid said cohenlupe opening his black eyes while he looked up into his friends face  dont you trouble your head about longestaffe or his money either said melmotte getting into his brougham do you leave mr longestaffe and his money to me i hope you are not such a fool as to be scared by what the other fools say when men play such a game as you and i are concerned in they ought to know better than to be afraid of every word that is spoken  oh dear yes said cohenlupe apologetically you dont suppose that i am afraid of anything but at that moment mr cohenlupe was meditating his own escape from the dangerous shores of england and was trying to remember what happy country still was left in which an order from the british police would have no power to interfere with the comfort of a retired gentleman such as himself  that evening madame melmotte told her husband that marie was now willing to marry lord nidderdalebut she did not say anything as to the crossingsweeper or the black footman nor did she allude to maries threat of the sort of life she would lead her husband     chapter lxx  sir felix meddles with many matters   there is no duty more certain or fixed in the world than that which calls upon a brother to defend his sister from illusage but at the same time in the way we live now no duty is more difficult and we may say generally more indistinct the illusage to which mens sisters are most generally exposed is one which hardly admits of either protection or vengeancealthough the duty of protecting and avenging is felt and acknowledged we are not allowed to fight duels and that banging about of another man with a stick is always disagreeable and seldom successful a john crumb can do it perhaps and come out of the affair exulting but not a sir felix carbury even if the sir felix of the occasion have the requisite courage there is a feeling too when a girl has been jiltedthrown over perhaps is the proper termafter the gentleman has had the fun of making love to her for an entire season and has perhaps even been allowed privileges as her promised husband that the less said the better the girl does not mean to break her heart for love of the false one and become the tragic heroine of a tale for three months it is her purpose again to          trick her beams and with newspangled ore         flame in the forehead of the morning sky  though this one has been false as were perhaps two or three before still the road to success is open uno avulso non deficit alter but if all the notoriety of cudgels and cutting whips be given to the late unfortunate affair the difficulty of finding a substitute will be greatly increased the brother recognizes his duty and prepares for vengeance the injured one probably desires that she may be left to fight her own little battles alone  then by heaven he shall answer it to me sir felix had said very grandly when his sister had told him that she was engaged to a man who was as he thought he knew engaged also to marry another woman here no doubt was gross illusage and opportunity at any rate for threats no money was required and no immediate actionand sir felix could act the fine gentleman and the dictatorial brother at very little present expense but hetta who ought perhaps to have known her brother more thoroughly was fool enough to believe him on the day but one following no answer had as yet come from roger carburynor could as yet have come but hettas mind was full of her trouble and she remembered her brothers threat felix had forgotten that he had made a threatand indeed had thought no more of the matter since his interview with his sister  felix she said you wont mention that to mr montague  mention what oh about that woman mrs hurtle indeed i shall a man who does that kind of thing ought to be crushedand by heavens if he does it to you he shall be crushed  i want to tell you felix if it is so i will see him no more  if it is so i tell you i know it  mamma has written to roger at least i feel sure she has  what has she written to him for what has roger carbury to do with our affairs  only you said he knew if he says so that is if you and he both say that he is to marry that womani will not see mr montague again pray do not go to him if such a misfortune does come it is better to bear it and to be silent what good can be done  leave that to me said sir felix walking out of the room with much fraternal bluster then he went forth and at once had himself driven to paul montagues lodgings had hetta not been foolish enough to remind him of his duty he would not now have undertaken the task he too no doubt remembered as he went that duels were things of the past and that even fists and sticks are considered to be out of fashion montague he said assuming all the dignity of demeanour that his late sorrows had left to him i believe i am right in saying that you are engaged to marry that american lady mrs hurtle  then let me tell you that you were never more wrong in your life what business have you with mrs hurtle  when a man proposes to my sister i think ive a great deal of business said sir felix  wellyes i admit that fully if i answered you roughly i beg your pardon now as to the facts i am not going to marry mrs hurtle i suppose i know how you have heard her namebut as you have heard it i have no hesitation in telling you so much as you know where she is to be found you can go and ask her if you please on the other hand it is the dearest wish of my heart to marry your sister i trust that will be enough for you  you were engaged to mrs hurtle  my dear carbury i dont think im bound to tell you all the details of my past life at any rate i dont feel inclined to do so in answer to hostile questions i dare say you have heard enough of mrs hurtle to justify you as your sisters brother in asking me whether i am in any way entangled by a connection with her i tell you that i am not if you still doubt i refer you to the lady herself beyond that i do not think i am called on to go and beyond that i wont goat any rate at present sir felix still blustered and made what capital he could out of his position as a brother but he took no steps towards positive revenge of course carbury said the other i wish to regard you as a brother and if i am rough to you it is only because you are rough to me  sir felix was now in that part of town which he had been accustomed to hauntfor the first time since his misadventureand plucking up his courage resolved that he would turn into the beargarden he would have a glass of sherry and face the one or two men who would as yet be there and in this way gradually creep back to his old habits but when he arrived there the club was shut up what the deuce is vossner about said he pulling out his watch it was nearly five oclock he rang the bell and knocked at the door feeling that this was an occasion for courage one of the servants in what we may call private clothes after some delay drew back the bolts and told him the astounding newsthe club was shut up do you mean to say i cant come in said sir felix the man certainly did mean to tell him so for he opened the door no more than a foot and stood in that narrow aperture mr vossner had gone away there had been a meeting of the committee and the club was shut up whatever further information rested in the waiters bosom he declined to communicate to sir felix carbury  by george the wrong that was done him filled the young baronets bosom with indignation he had intended he assured himself to dine at his club to spend the evening there sportively to be pleasant among his chosen companions and now the club was shut up and vossner had gone away what business had the club to be shut up what right had vossner to go away had he not paid his subscription in advance throughout the world the more wrong a man does the more indignant is he at wrong done to him sir felix almost thought that he could recover damages from the whole committee  he went direct to mrs pipkins house when he made that half promise of marriage in mrs pipkins hearing he had said that he would come again on the morrow this he had not done but of that he thought nothing such breaches of faith when committed by a young man in his position require not even an apology he was admitted by ruby herself who was of course delighted to see him who do you think is in town she said john crumb but though he came here ever so smart i wouldnt so much as speak to him except to tell him to go away sir felix when he heard the name felt an uncomfortable sensation creep over him i dont know im sure what he should come after me for and me telling him as plain as the nose on his face that i never want to see him again  hes not of much account said the baronet  he would marry me out and out immediately if id have him continued ruby who perhaps thought that her honest old lover should not be spoken of as being altogether of no account and he has everything comfortable in the way of furniture and all that and they do say hes ever so much money in the bank but i detest him said ruby shaking her pretty head and inclining herself towards her aristocratic lovers shoulder  this took place in the back parlour before mrs pipkin had ascended from the kitchen prepared to disturb so much romantic bliss with wretched references to the cold outer world well now sir felix she began if things is square of course youre welcome to see my niece  and what if theyre round mrs pipkin said the gallant careless sparkling lothario  well or round either so long as theyre honest  ruby and i are both honestaint we ruby i want to take her out to dinner mrs pipkin she shall be back before latebefore ten she shall indeed ruby inclined herself still more closely towards his shoulder come ruby get your hat and change your dress and well be off ive ever so many things to tell you  ever so many things to tell her they must be to fix a day for the marriage and to let her know where they were to live and to settle what dress she should wearand perhaps to give her the money to go and buy it ever so many things to tell her she looked up into mrs pipkins face with imploring eyes surely on such an occasion as this an aunt would not expect that her niece should be a prisoner and a slave have it been put in writing sir felix carbury demanded mrs pipkin with cruel gravity mrs hurtle had given it as her decided opinion that sir felix would not really mean to marry ruby ruggles unless he showed himself willing to do so with all the formality of a written contract  writing be bothered said sir felix  thats all very well sir felix writing do bother very often but when a gentleman has intentions a bit of writing shows it plainer nor words ruby dont go nowhere to dine unless you puts it into writing  aunt pipkin exclaimed the wretched ruby  what do you think im going to do with her asked sir felix  if you want to make her your wife put it in writing and if it be as you dont just say so and walk awayfree  i shall go said ruby im not going to be kept here a prisoner for any one i can go when i please you wait felix and ill be down in a minute the girl with a nimble spring ran upstairs and began to change her dress without giving herself a moment for thought  she dont come back no more here sir felix said mrs pipkin in her most solemn tones she aint nothing to me no more than she was my poor dear husbands sisters child there aint no blood between us and wont be no disgrace but id be loth to see her on the streets  then why wont you let me bring her back again  cause thatd be the way to send her there you dont mean to marry her to this sir felix said nothing youre not thinking of that its just a bit of sportand then there she is an old shoe to be chucked away just a rag to be swept into the dustbin ive seen scores of em and id sooner a child of mine should die in a workus or be starved to death but its all nothing to the likes o you  i havent done her any harm said sir felix almost frightened  then go away and dont do her any thats mrs hurtles door open you go and speak to her she can talk a deal better nor me  mrs hurtle hasnt been able to manage her own affairs very well  mrs hurtles a lady sir felix and a widow and one as has seen the world as she spoke mrs hurtle came downstairs and an introduction after some rude fashion was effected between her and sir felix mrs hurtle had heard often of sir felix carbury and was quite as certain as mrs pipkin that he did not mean to marry ruby ruggles in a few minutes felix found himself alone with mrs hurtle in her own room he had been anxious to see the woman since he had heard of her engagement with paul montague and doubly anxious since he had also heard of pauls engagement with his sister it was not an hour since paul himself had referred him to her for corroboration of his own statement  sir felix carbury she said i am afraid you are doing that poor girl no good and are intending to do her none it did occur to him very strongly that this could be no affair of mrs hurtles and that he as a man of position in society was being interfered with in an unjustifiable manner aunt pipkin wasnt even an aunt but who was mrs hurtle would it not be better that you should leave her to become the wife of a man who is really fond of her  he could already see something in mrs hurtles eye which prevented his at once bursting into wrathbut who was mrs hurtle that she should interfere with him upon my word maam he said im very much obliged to you but i dont quite know to what i owe the honour of youryour  interference you mean  i didnt say so but perhaps thats about it  id interfere to save any woman that god ever made said mrs hurtle with energy were all apt to wait a little too long because were ashamed to do any little good that chance puts in our way you must go and leave her sir felix  i suppose she may do as she pleases about that  do you mean to make her your wife asked mrs hurtle sternly  does mr paul montague mean to make you his wife rejoined sir felix with an impudent swagger he had struck the blow certainly hard enough and it had gone all the way home she had not surmised that he would have heard aught of her own concerns she only barely connected him with that roger carbury who she knew was pauls great friend and she had as yet never heard that hetta carbury was the girl whom paul loved had paul so talked about her that this young scamp should know all her story  she thought awhileshe had to think for a momentbefore she could answer him i do not see she said with a faint attempt at a smile that there is any parallel between the two cases i at any rate am old enough to take care of myself should he not marry me i am as i was before will it be so with that poor girl if she allows herself to be taken about the town by you at night she had desired in what she said to protect ruby rather than herself what could it matter whether this young man was left in a belief that she was or that she was not about to be married  if youll answer me ill answer you said sir felix does mr montague mean to make you his wife  it does not concern you to know said she flashing upon him the question is insolent  it does concern mea great deal more than anything about ruby can concern you and as you wont answer me i wont answer you  then sir that girls fate will be upon your head  i know all about that said the baronet  and the young man who has followed her up to town will probably know where to find you added mrs hurtle  to such a threat as this no answer could be made and sir felix left the room at any rate john crumb was not there at present and were there not policemen in london and what additional harm would be done to john crumb or what increase of danger engendered in that true lovers breast by one additional evenings amusement ruby had danced with him so often at the music hall that john crumb could hardly be made more bellicose by the fact of her dining with him on this evening when he descended he found ruby in the hall all arrayed you dont come in here again tonight said mrs pipkin thumping the little table which stood in the passage if you goes out of that there door with that there young man  then i shall said ruby linking herself on to her lovers arm  baggage slut said mrs pipkin after all ive done for you just as one as though you were my own flesh and blood  ive worked for it i supposehavent i rejoined ruby  you send for your things tomorrow for you dont come in here no more you aint nothing to me no more nor no other girl but id ve saved you if youd but a let me as for youand she looked at sir felixonly because ive lodgings to let and because of the lady upstairs id shake you that well youd never come here no more after poor girls i do not think that she need have feared any remonstrance from mrs hurtle even had she put her threat into execution  sir felix thinking that he had had enough of mrs pipkin and her lodger left the house with ruby on his arm for the moment ruby had been triumphant and was happy she did not stop to consider whether her aunt would or would not open her door when she should return tired and perhaps repentant she was on her lovers arm in her best clothes and going out to have a dinner given to her and her lover had told her that he had ever so many thingsever so many things to say to her but she would ask no impertinent questions in the first hour of her bliss it was so pleasant to walk with him up to pentonvilleso joyous to turn into a gay enclosure half publichouse and half teagarden so pleasant to hear him order the good things which in his company would be so nice who cannot understand that even an urban rosherville must be an elysium to those who have lately been eating their meals in all the gloom of a small london underground kitchen there we will leave ruby in her bliss  at about nine that evening john crumb called at mrs pipkins and was told that ruby had gone out with sir felix carbury he hit his leg a blow with his fist and glared out of his eyes hell have it hot some day said john crumb he was allowed to remain waiting for ruby till midnight and then with a sorrowful heart he took his departure     chapter lxxi  john crumb falls into trouble   it was on a friday evening an inauspicious friday that poor ruby ruggles had insisted on leaving the security of her aunt pipkins house with her aristocratic and vicious lover in spite of the positive assurance made to her by mrs pipkin that if she went forth in such company she should not be allowed to return of course you must let her in mrs hurtle had said soon after the girls departure whereupon mrs pipkin had cried she knew her own softness too well to suppose it to be possible that she could keep the girl out in the streets all night but yet it was hard upon her very hard that she should be so troubled we usent to have our ways like that when i was young she said sobbing what was to be the end of it was she to be forced by circumstances to keep the girl always there let the girls conduct be what it might nevertheless she acknowledged that ruby must be let in when she came back then about nine oclock john crumb came and the latter part of the evening was more melancholy even than the first it was impossible to conceal the truth from john crumb mrs hurtle saw the poor man and told the story in mrs pipkins presence  shes headstrong mr crumb said mrs hurtle  she is that maam and it was along wi the baronite she went  it was so mr crumb  baronite wellperhaps i shall catch him some of these dayswent to dinner wi him did she didnt she have no dinner here  then mrs pipkin spoke up with a keen sense of offence ruby ruggles had had as wholesome a dinner as any young woman in londona bullocks heart and potatoesjust as much as ever she had pleased to eat of it mrs pipkin could tell mr crumb that there was no starvation nor yet no stint in her house john crumb immediately produced a very thick and admirably useful blue cloth cloak which he had brought up with him to london from bungay as a present to the woman who had been good to his ruby he assured her that he did not doubt that her victuals were good and plentiful and went on to say that he had made bold to bring her a trifle out of respect it was some little time before mrs pipkin would allow herself to be appeasedbut at last she permitted the garment to be placed on her shoulders but it was done after a melancholy fashion there was no smiling consciousness of the bestowal of joy on the countenance of the donor as he gave it no exuberance of thanks from the recipient as she received it mrs hurtle standing by declared it to be perfectbut the occasion was one which admitted of no delight its very good of you mr crumb to think of an old woman like meparticularly when youve such a deal of trouble with a young un  its like the smut in the wheat mrs pipkin or the dsease in the tatoesit has to be put up with i suppose is she very partial maam to that young baronite this question was asked of mrs hurtle  just a fancy for the time mr crumb said the lady  they never thinks as how their fancies may wellnigh half kill a man then he was silent for a while sitting back in his chair not moving a limb with his eyes fastened on mrs pipkins ceiling mrs hurtle had some work in her hand and sat watching him the man was to her an extraordinary beingso constant so slow so unexpressive so unlike her own countrymenwilling to endure so much and at the same time so warm in his affections sir felix carbury he said ill sir felix him some of these days if it was only dinner wouldnt she be back afore this maam  i suppose theyve gone to some place of amusement said mrs hurtle  like enough said john crumb in a low voice  shes that mad after dancing as never was said mrs pipkin  and where is it as em dances asked crumb getting up from his chair and stretching himself it was evident to both the ladies that he was beginning to think that he would follow ruby to the music hall neither of them answered him however and then he sat down again does em dance all night at them places mrs pipkin  they do pretty nearly all that they oughtnt to do said mrs pipkin john crumb raised one of his fists brought it down heavily on the palm of his other hand and then sat silent for awhile  i never knowed as she was fond o dancing he said id a had dancing for her down at bungayjust as ready as anything dye think maam its the dancing shes after or the baronite this was another appeal to mrs hurtle  i suppose they go together said the lady  then there was another long pause at the end of which poor john crumb burst out with some violence domn him domn him what ad i ever dun to him nothing did i ever interfere wi him never but i wull i wull i wouldnt wonder but ill swing for this at bury  oh mr crumb dont talk like that said mrs pipkin  mr crumb is a little disturbed but hell get over it presently said mrs hurtle  shes a nasty slut to go and treat a young man as shes treating you said mrs pipkin  no maamshe aint nasty said the lover but shes croull horrid croull its no more use my going down about meal and pollard nor business and she up here with that baroniteno no more nor nothin when i handles it i dont know whether its middlings nor nothin else if i was to twist his neck maam would you take it on yourself to say as i was wrong  id sooner hear that you had taken the girl away from him said mrs hurtle  i could pretty well eat himthats what i could half past eleven is it she must come some time mustnt she mrs pipkin who did not want to burn candles all night long declared that she could give no assurance on that head if ruby did come she should on that night be admitted but mrs pipkin thought that it would be better to get up and let her in than to sit up for her poor mr crumb did not at once take the hint and remained there for another halfhour saying little but waiting with the hope that ruby might come but when the clock struck twelve he was told that he must go then he slowly collected his limbs and dragged them out of the house  that young man is a good fellow said mrs hurtle as soon as the door was closed  a deal too good for ruby ruggles said mrs pipkin and he can maintain a wife mr carbury says as hes as well to do as any tradesman down in them parts  mrs hurtle disliked the name of mr carbury and took this last statement as no evidence in john crumbs favour i dont know that i think better of the man for having mr carburys friendship she said  mr carbury aint any way like his cousin mrs hurtle  i dont think much of any of the carburys mrs pipkin it seems to me that everybody here is either too humble or too overbearing nobody seems content to stand firm on his own footing and interfere with nobody else this was all greek to poor mrs pipkin i suppose we may as well go to bed now when that girl comes and knocks of course we must let her in if i hear her ill go down and open the door for her  mrs pipkin made very many apologies to her lodger for the condition of her household she would remain up herself to answer the door at the first sound so that mrs hurtle should not be disturbed she would do her best to prevent any further annoyance she trusted mrs hurtle would see that she was endeavouring to do her duty by the naughty wicked girl and then she came round to the point of her discourse she hoped that mrs hurtle would not be induced to quit the rooms by these disagreeable occurrences i dont mind saying it now mrs hurtle but your being here is ever so much to me i aint nothing to depend ononly lodgers and them as is any good is so hard to get the poor woman hardly understood mrs hurtle who as a lodger was certainly peculiar she cared nothing for disturbances and rather liked than otherwise the task of endeavouring to assist in the salvation of ruby mrs hurtle begged that mrs pipkin would go to bed she would not be in the least annoyed by the knocking another halfhour had thus been passed by the two ladies in the parlour after crumbs departure then mrs hurtle took her candle and had ascended the stairs half way to her own sittingroom when a loud double knock was heard she immediately joined mrs pipkin in the passage the door was opened and there stood ruby ruggles john crumb and two policemen ruby rushed in and casting herself on to one of the stairs began to throw her hands about and to howl piteously laws a mercy what is it asked mrs pipkin  hes been and murdered him screamed ruby he has hes been and murdered him  this young woman is living hereis she asked one of the policemen  she is living here said mrs hurtle but now we must go back to the adventures of john crumb after he had left the house  he had taken a bedroom at a small inn close to the eastern counties railway station which he was accustomed to frequent when business brought him up to london and thither he proposed to himself to return at one time there had come upon him an idea that he would endeavour to seek ruby and his enemy among the dancing saloons of the metropolis and he had asked a question with that view but no answer had been given which seemed to aid him in his project and his purpose had been abandoned as being too complex and requiring more intelligence than he gave himself credit for possessing so he had turned down a street with which he was so far acquainted as to know that it would take him to the islington angelwhere various roads meet and whence he would know his way eastwards he had just passed the angel and the end of goswell road and was standing with his mouth open looking about trying to make certain of himself that he would not go wrong thinking that he would ask a policeman whom he saw and hesitating because he feared that the man would want to know his business then of a sudden he heard a woman scream and knew that it was rubys voice the sound was very near him but in the glimmer of the gaslight he could not quite see whence it came he stood still putting his hand up to scratch his head under his hat trying to think what in such an emergency it would be well that he should do then he heard the voice distinctly i wonti wont and after that a scream then there were further words its no good i wont at last he was able to make up his mind he rushed after the sound and turning down a passage to the right which led back into goswell road saw ruby struggling in a mans arms she had left the dancing establishment with her lover and when they had come to the turn of the passage there had arisen a question as to her further destiny for the night ruby though she well remembered mrs pipkins threats was minded to try her chance at her aunts door sir felix was of opinion that he could make a preferable arrangement for her and as ruby was not at once amenable to his arguments he had thought that a little gentle force might avail him he had therefore dragged ruby into the passage the unfortunate one that so ill a chance should have come upon him in the midst of his diversion he had swallowed several tumblers of brandy and water and was therefore brave with reference to that interference of the police the fear of which might otherwise have induced him to relinquish his hold of rubys arm when she first raised her voice but what amount of brandy and water would have enabled him to persevere could he have dreamed that john crumb was near him on a sudden he found a hand on his coat and he was swung violently away and brought with his back against the railings so forcibly as to have the breath almost knocked out of his body but he could hear rubys exclamation if it isnt john crumb then there came upon him a sense of coming destruction as though the world for him were all over and collapsing throughout his limbs he slunk down upon the ground  get up you wiper said john crumb but the baronet thought it better to cling to the ground you sholl get up said john taking him by the collar of his coat and lifting him now ruby hes agoing to have it said john whereupon ruby screamed at the top of her voice with a shriek very much louder than that which had at first attracted john crumbs notice  dont hit a man when hes down said the baronet pleading as though for his life  i wunt said johnbut ill hit a fellow when uns up sir felix was little more than a child in the mans arms john crumb raised him and catching him round the neck with his left armgetting his head into chancery as we used to say when we fought at schoolstruck the poor wretch some halfdozen times violently in the face not knowing or caring exactly where he hit him but at every blow obliterating a feature and he would have continued had not ruby flown at him and rescued sir felix from his arms hes about got enough of it said john crumb as he gave over his work then sir felix fell again to the ground moaning fearfully i knowd hed have to have it said john crumb  rubys screams of course brought the police one arriving from each end of the passage on the scene of action at the same time and now the cruellest thing of all was that ruby in the complaints which she made to the policemen said not a word against sir felix but was as bitter as she knew how to be in her denunciations of john crumb it was in vain that john endeavoured to make the man understand that the young woman had been crying out for protection when he had interfered ruby was very quick of speech and john crumb was very slow ruby swore that nothing so horrible so cruel so bloodthirsty had ever been done before sir felix himself when appealed to could say nothing he could only moan and make futile efforts to wipe away the stream of blood from his face when the men stood him up leaning against the railings and john though he endeavoured to make the policemen comprehend the extent of the wickedness of the young baronet would not say a word against ruby he was not even in the least angered by her denunciations of himself as he himself said sometimes afterwards he had dropped into the baronite just in time and having been successful in this felt no wrath against ruby for having made such an operation necessary  there was soon a third policeman on the spot and a dozen other persons cabdrivers haunters of the street by night and houseless wanderers casuals who at this season of the year preferred the pavements to the poorhouse wards they all took part against john crumb why had the big man interfered between the young woman and her young man two or three of them wiped sir felixs face and dabbed his eyes and proposed this and the other remedy some thought that he had better be taken straight to an hospital one lady remarked that he was so mashed and mauled that she was sure he would never come to again a precocious youth remarked that he was all one as a dead un a cabman observed that he had ad it awful eavy to all these criticisms on his condition sir felix himself made no direct reply but he intimated his desire to be carried away somewhere though he did not much care whither  at last the policemen among them decided upon a course of action they had learned by the united testimony of ruby and crumb that sir felix was sir felix he was to be carried in a cab by one constable to bartholomew hospital who would then take his address so that he might be produced and bound over to prosecute ruby should be even conducted to the address she gavenot half a mile from the spot on which they now stoodand be left there or not according to the account which might be given of her john crumb must be undoubtedly locked up in the stationhouse he was the offenderfor aught that any of them yet knew the murderer no one said a good word for him he hardly said a good word for himself and certainly made no objection to the treatment that had been proposed for him but no doubt he was buoyed up inwardly by the conviction that he had thoroughly thrashed his enemy  thus it came to pass that the two policemen with john crumb and ruby came together to mrs pipkins door ruby was still loud with complaints against the ruffian who had beaten her loverwho perhaps had killed her loved one she threatened the gallows and handcuffs and perpetual imprisonment and an action for damages amidst her lamentations but from mrs hurtle the policemen did manage to learn something of the truth oh yesthe girl lived there and was respectable this man whom they had arrested was respectable also and was the girls proper lover the other man who had been beaten was undoubtedly the owner of a title but he was not respectable and was only the girls improper lover and john crumbs name was given im john crumb of bungay said he and i aint afeared of nothin nor nobody and i aint a been a drinking no i aint mauled un in course ive mauled un and i meaned it that ere young woman is engaged to be my wife  no i aint shouted ruby  but she is persisted john crumb  well then i never will rejoined ruby  john crumb turned upon her a look of love and put his hand on his heart whereupon the senior policeman said that he saw at a glance how it all was but that mr crumb had better come along with him just for the present to this arrangement the unfortunate hero from bungay made not the slightest objection  miss ruggles said mrs hurtle if that young man doesnt conquer you at last you cant have a heart in your bosom  indeed and i have then and i dont mean to give it him if its ever so hes been and killed sir felix mrs hurtle in a whisper to mrs pipkin expressed a wicked wish that it might be so after that the three women all went to bed     chapter lxxii  ask himself   roger carbury when he received the letter from hettas mother desiring him to tell her all that he knew of paul montagues connection with mrs hurtle found himself quite unable to write a reply he endeavoured to ask himself what he would do in such a case if he himself were not personally concerned what advice in this emergency would he give to the mother and what to the daughter were he himself uninterested he was sure that as hettas cousin and asking as though he were hettas brother he would tell her that paul montagues entanglement with that american woman should have forbidden him at any rate for the present to offer his hand to any other lady he thought that he knew enough of all the circumstances to be sure that such would be his decision he had seen mrs hurtle with montague at lowestoft and had known that they were staying together as friends at the same hotel he knew that she had come to england with the express purpose of enforcing the fulfilment of an engagement which montague had often acknowledged he knew that montague made frequent visits to her in london he had indeed been told by montague himself that let the cost be what it might the engagement should be and in fact had been broken off he thoroughly believed the mans word but put no trust whatever in his firmness and hitherto he had no reason whatever for supposing that mrs hurtle had consented to be abandoned what father what elder brother would allow a daughter or a sister to become engaged to a man embarrassed by such difficulties he certainly had counselled montague to rid himself of the trammels by which he had surrounded himself but not on that account could he think that the man in his present condition was fit to engage himself to another woman  all this was clear to roger carbury but then it had been equally clear to him that he could not as a man of honour assist his own cause by telling a talewhich tale had become known to him as the friend of the man against whom it would have to be told he had resolved upon that as he left montague and mrs hurtle together upon the sands at lowestoft but what was he to do now the girl whom he loved had confessed her love for the other manthat man who in seeking the girls love had been as he thought so foul a traitor to himself that he would hold himself as divided from the man by a perpetual and undying hostility he had determined that his love for the woman would be equally perpetual he was quite sure already there were floating across his brain ideas of perpetuating his name in the person of some child of hettasbut with the distinct understanding that he and the childs father should never see each other no more than twentyfour hours had intervened between the receipt of pauls letter and that from lady carburybut during those fourandtwenty hours he had almost forgotten mrs hurtle the girl was gone from him and he thought only of his own loss and of pauls perfidy then came the direct question as to which he was called upon for a direct answer did he know anything of facts relating to the presence of a certain mrs hurtle in london which were of a nature to make it inexpedient that hetta should accept paul montague as her betrothed lover of course he did the facts were all familiar to him but how was he to tell the facts in what words was he to answer such a letter if he told the truth as he knew it how was he to secure himself against the suspicion of telling a story against his rival in order that he might assist himself or at any rate punish the rival  as he could not trust himself to write an answer to lady carburys letter he determined that he would go to london if he must tell the story he could tell it better face to face than by any written words so he made the journey arrived in town late in the evening and knocked at the door in welbeck street between ten and eleven on the morning after the unfortunate meeting which took place between sir felix and john crumb the page when he opened the door looked as a page should look when the family to which he is attached is suffering from some terrible calamity my lady had been summoned to the hospital to see sir felix who wasas the page reportedin a very bad way indeed the page did not exactly know what had happened but supposed that sir felix had lost most of his limbs by this time yes miss carbury was upstairs and would no doubt see her cousin though she too was in a very bad condition and dreadfully put about that poor hetta should be put about with her brother in the hospital and her lover in the toils of an abominable american woman was natural enough  whats this about felix asked roger the new trouble always has precedence over those which are of earlier date  oh roger i am so glad to see you felix did not come home last night and this morning there came a man from the hospital in the city to say that he is there  what has happened to him  somebodysomebody hasbeaten him said hetta whimpering then she told the story as far as she knew it the messenger from the hospital had declared that the young man was in no danger and that none of his bones were broken but that he was terribly bruised about the face that his eyes were in a frightful condition sundry of his teeth knocked out and his lips cut open but the messenger had gone on to say the house surgeon had seen no reason why the young gentleman should not be taken home and mamma has gone to fetch him said hetta  thats john crumb said roger hetta had never heard of john crumb and simply stared into her cousins face you have not been told about john crumb noyou would not hear of him  why should john crumb beat felix like that  they say hetta that women are the cause of most troubles that occur in the world the girl blushed up to her eyes as though the whole story of felixs sin and folly had been told to her if it be as i suppose continued roger john crumb has considered himself to be aggrieved and has thus avenged himself  did youknow of him before  yes indeedvery well he is a neighbour of mine and was in love with a girl with all his heart and he would have made her his wife and have been good to her he had a home to offer her and is an honest man with whom she would have been safe and respected and happy your brother saw her and though he knew the story though he had been told by myself that this honest fellow had placed his happiness on the girls love he thoughtwell i suppose he thought that such a pretty thing as this girl was too good for john crumb  but felix has been going to marry miss melmotte  youre oldfashioned hetta it used to be the wayto be off with your old love before you are on with the new but that seems to be all changed now such fine young fellows as there are now can be in love with two at once that i fear is what felix has thoughtand now he has been punished  you know all about it then  noi dont know but i think it has been so i do know that john crumb had threatened to do this thing and i felt sure that sooner or later he would be as good as his word if it has been so who is to blame him  hetta as she heard the story hardly knew whether her cousin in his manner of telling the story was speaking of that other man of that stranger of whom she had never heard or of himself he would have made her his wife and have been good to her he had a home to offer her he was an honest man with whom she would have been safe and respected and happy he had looked at her while speaking as though it were her own case of which he spoke and then when he talked of the oldfashioned way of being off with the old love before you are on with the new had he not alluded to paul montague and this story of the american woman but if so it was not for hetta to notice it by words he must speak more plainly than that before she could be supposed to know that he alluded to her own condition it is very shocking she said  shockingyes one is shocked at it all i pity your mother and i pity you  it seems to me that nothing ever will be happy for us said hetta she was longing to be told something of mrs hurtle but she did not as yet dare to ask the question  i do not know whether to wait for your mother or not said he after a short pause  pray wait for her if you are not very busy  i came up only to see her but perhaps she would not wish me to be here when she brings felix back to the house  indeed she will she would like you always to be here when there are troubles oh roger i wish you could tell me  tell you what  she has written to youhas she not  yes she has written to me  and about me  yesabout you hetta and hetta mr montague has written to me also  he told me that he would whispered hetta  did he tell you my answer  nohe has told me of no answer i have not seen him since  you do not think that it can have been very kind do you i also have something of the feeling of john crumb though i shall not attempt to show it after the same fashion  did you not say the girl had promised to love that man  i did not say sobut she had promised yes hetta there is a difference the girl then was fickle and went back from her word you never have done that i am not justified in thinking even a hard thought of you i have never harboured a hard thought of you it is not you that i reproach but hehe has been if possible more false than felix  oh roger how has he been false  still he was not wishful to tell her the story of mrs hurtle the treachery of which he was speaking was that which he had thought had been committed by his friend towards himself he should have left the place and never have come near you said roger when he found how it was likely to be with him he owed it to me not to take the cup of water from my lips  how was she to tell him that the cup of water never could have touched his lips and yet if this were the only falsehood of which he had to tell she was bound to let him know that it was so that horrid story of mrs hurtleshe would listen to that if she could hear it she would be all ears for that but she could not admit that her lover had sinned in loving her but roger she saidit would have been the same  you may say so you may feel it you may know it i at any rate will not contradict you when you say that it must have been so but he didnt feel it he didnt know it he was to me as a younger brother and he has robbed me of everything i understand hetta what you mean i should never have succeeded my happiness would have been impossible if paul had never come home from america i have told myself so a hundred times but i cannot therefore forgive him and i wont forgive him hetta whether you are his wife or another mans or whether you are hetta carbury on to the end my feeling to you will be the same while we both live you must be to me the dearest creature living my hatred to him  oh roger do not say hatred  my hostility to him can make no difference in my feeling to you i tell you that should you become his wife you will still be my love as to not covetinghow is a man to cease to covet that which he has always coveted but i shall be separated from you should i be dying then i should send for you you are the very essence of my life i have no dream of happiness otherwise than as connected with you he might have my whole property and i would work for my bread if i could only have a chance of winning you to share my toils with me  but still there was no word of mrs hurtle roger she said i have given it all away now it cannot be given twice  if he were unworthy would your heart never change  i thinknever roger is he unworthy  how can you trust me to answer such a question he is my enemy he has been ungrateful to me as one man hardly ever is to another he has turned all my sweetness to gall all my flowers to bitter weeds he has choked up all my paths and now you ask me whether he is unworthy i cannot tell you  if you thought him worthy you would tell me she said getting up and taking him by the arm  noi will tell you nothing go to some one else not to me and he tried with gentleness but tried ineffectually to disengage himself from her hold  roger if you knew him to be good you would tell me because you yourself are so good even though you hated him you would say so it would not be you to leave a false impression even against your enemies i ask you because however it may be with you i know i can trust you i can be nothing else to you roger but i love you as a sister loves and i come to you as a sister comes to a brother he has my heart tell meis there any reason why he should not also have my hand  ask himself hetta  and you will tell me nothing you will not try to save me though you know that i am in danger who ismrs hurtle  have you asked him  i had not heard her name when he parted from me i did not even know that such a woman lived is it true that he has promised to marry her felix told me of her and told me also that you knew but i cannot trust felix as i would trust you and mamma says that it is sobut mamma also bids me ask you there is such a woman  there is such a woman certainly  and she has beena friend of pauls  whatever be the story hetta you shall not hear it from me i will say neither evil nor good of the man except in regard to his conduct to myself send for him and ask him to tell you the story of mrs hurtle as it concerns himself i do not think he will lie but if he lies you will know that he is lying  and that is all  all that i can say hetta you ask me to be your brotherbut i cannot put myself in the place of your brother i tell you plainly that i am your lover and shall remain so your brother would welcome the man whom you would choose as your husband i can never welcome any husband of yours i think if twenty years were to pass over us and you were still hetta carbury i should still be your loverthough an old one what is now to be done about felix hetta  ah what can be done i think sometimes that it will break mammas heart  your mother makes me angry by her continual indulgence  but what can she do you would not have her turn him into the street  i do not know that i would not for a time it might serve him perhaps here is the cab here they are yes you had better go down and let your mother know that i am here they will perhaps take him up to bed so that i need not see him  hetta did as she was bid and met her mother and her brother in the hall felix having the full use of his arms and legs was able to descend from the cab and hurry across the pavement into the house and then without speaking a word to his sister hid himself in the diningroom his face was strapped up with plaister so that not a feature was visible and both his eyes were swollen and blue part of his beard had been cut away and his physiognomy had altogether been so treated that even the page would hardly have known him roger is upstairs mamma said hetta in the hall  has he heard about felixhas he come about that  he has heard only what i have told him he has come because of your letter he says that a man named crumb did it  then he does know who can have told him he always knows everything oh hetta what am i to do where shall i go with this wretched boy  is he hurt mamma  hurtof course he is hurt horribly hurt the brute tried to kill him they say that he will be dreadfully scarred for ever but oh hettawhat am i to do with him what am i to do with myself and you  on this occasion roger was saved from the annoyance of any personal intercourse with his cousin felix the unfortunate one was made as comfortable as circumstances would permit in the parlour and lady carbury then went up to her cousin in the drawingroom she had learned the truth with some fair approach to accuracy though sir felix himself had of course lied as to every detail there are some circumstances so distressing in themselves as to make lying almost a necessity when a young man has behaved badly about a woman when a young man has been beaten without returning a blow when a young mans pleasant vices are brought directly under a mothers eyes what can he do but lie how could sir felix tell the truth about that rash encounter but the policeman who had brought him to the hospital had told all that he knew the man who had thrashed the baronet had been crumb and the thrashing had been given on the score of a young woman called ruggles so much was known at the hospital and so much could not be hidden by any lies which sir felix might tell and when sir felix swore that a policeman was holding him while crumb was beating him no one believed him in such cases the liar does not expect to be believed he knows that his disgrace will be made public and only hopes to be saved from the ignominy of declaring it with his own words  what am i to do with him lady carbury said to her cousin it is no use telling me to leave him i cant do that i know he is bad i know that i have done much to make him what he is as she said this the tears were running down her poor worn cheeks but he is my child what am i to do with him now  this was a question which roger found it almost impossible to answer if he had spoken his thoughts he would have declared that sir felix had reached an age at which if a man will go headlong to destruction he must go headlong to destruction thinking as he did of his cousin he could see no possible salvation for him perhaps i should take him abroad he said  would he be better abroad than here  he would have less opportunity for vice and fewer means of running you into debt  lady carbury as she turned this counsel in her mind thought of all the hopes which she had indulgedher literary aspirations her tuesday evenings her desire for society her brounes her alfs and her bookers her pleasant drawingroom and the determination which she had made that now in the afternoon of her days she would become somebody in the world must she give it all up and retire to the dreariness of some french town because it was no longer possible that she should live in london with such a son as hers there seemed to be a cruelty in this beyond all cruelties that she had hitherto endured this was harder even than those lies which had been told of her when almost in fear of her life she had run from her husbands house but yet she must do even this if in no other way she and her son could be together yes she said i suppose it would be so i only wish that i might die so that were an end of it  he might go out to one of the colonies said roger  yesbe sent away that he might kill himself with drink in the bush and so be got rid of i have heard of that before wherever he goes i shall go  as the reader knows roger carbury had not latterly held this cousin of his in much esteem he knew her to be worldly and he thought her to be unprincipled but now at this moment her exceeding love for the son whom she could no longer pretend to defend wiped out all her sins he forgot the visit made to carbury under false pretences and the melmottes and all the little tricks which he had detected in his appreciation of an affection which was pure and beautiful if you like to let your house for a period he said mine is open to you  but felix  you shall take him there i am all alone in the world i can make a home for myself at the cottage it is empty now if you think that would save you you can try it for six months  and turn you out of your own house no roger i cannot do that and rogerwhat is to be done about hetta hetta herself had retreated leaving roger and her mother alone together feeling sure that there would be questions asked and answered in her absence respecting mrs hurtle which her presence would prevent she wished it could have been otherwisethat she might have been allowed to hear it all herself as she was sure that the story coming through her mother would not savour so completely of unalloyed truth as if told to her by her cousin roger  hetta can be trusted to judge for herself he said  how can you say that when she has just accepted this young man is it not true that he is even now living with an american woman whom he has promised to marry  nothat is not true  what is true then is he not engaged to the woman roger hesitated a moment i do not know that even that is true when last he spoke to me about it he declared that the engagement was at an end i have told hetta to ask himself let her tell him that she has heard of this woman from you and that it behoves her to know the truth i do not love him lady carbury he has no longer any place in my friendship but i think that if hetta asks him simply what is the nature of his connexion with mrs hurtle he will tell her the truth  roger did not again see hetta before he left the house nor did he see his cousin felix at all he had now done all that he could do by his journey up to london and he returned on that day back to carbury would it not be better for him in spite of the protestations which he had made to dismiss the whole family from his mind there could be no other love for him he must be desolate and alone but he might then save himself from a world of cares and might gradually teach himself to live as though there were no such woman as hetta carbury in the world but no he would not allow himself to believe that this could be right the very fact of his love made it a duty to himmade it almost the first of his dutiesto watch over the interests of her he loved and of those who belonged to her  but among those so belonging he did not recognise paul montague     chapter lxxiii  maries fortune   when marie melmotte assured sir felix carbury that her father had already endowed her with a large fortune which could not be taken from her without her own consent she spoke no more than the truth she knew of the matter almost as little as it was possible that she should know as far as reticence on the subject was compatible with the object he had in view melmotte had kept from her all knowledge of the details of the arrangement but it had been necessary when the thing was done to explain or to pretend to explain much and maries memory and also her intelligence had been strong beyond her fathers anticipation he was deriving a very considerable income from a large sum of money which he had invested in foreign funds in her name and had got her to execute a power of attorney enabling him to draw this income on her behalf this he had done fearing shipwreck in the course which he meant to run and resolved that let circumstances go as they might there should still be left enough to him of the money which he had realised to enable him to live in comfort and luxury should he be doomed to live in obscurity or even in infamy he had sworn to himself solemnly that under no circumstances would he allow this money to go back into the vortex of his speculations and hitherto he had been true to his oath though bankruptcy and apparent ruin might be imminent he would not bolster up his credit by the use of this money even though it might appear at the moment that the money would be sufficient for the purpose if such a day should come then with that certain income he would make himself happy if possible or at any rate luxurious in whatever city of the world might know least of his antecedents and give him the warmest welcome on behalf of his wealth such had been his scheme of life but he had failed to consider various circumstances his daughter might be untrue to him or in the event of her marriage might fail to release his propertyor it might be that the very money should be required to dower his daughter or there might come troubles on him so great that even the certainty of a future income would not enable him to bear them now at this present moment his mind was tortured by great anxiety were he to resume this property it would more than enable him to pay all that was due to the longestaffes it would do that and tide him for a time over some other difficulties now in regard to the longestaffes themselves he certainly had no desire to depart from the rule which he had made for himself on their behalf were it necessary that a crash should come they would be as good creditors as any other but then he was painfully alive to the fact that something beyond simple indebtedness was involved in that transaction he had with his own hand traced dolly longestaffes signature on the letter which he had found in old mr longestaffes drawer he had found it in an envelope addressed by the elder mr longestaffe to messrs slow and bideawhile and he had himself posted this letter in a pillarbox near to his house in the execution of this manoeuvre circumstances had greatly befriended him he had become the tenant of mr longestaffes house and at the same time had only been the joint tenant of mr longestaffes studyso that mr longestaffes papers were almost in his very hands to pick a lock was with him an accomplishment long since learned but his science in that line did not go so far as to enable him to replace the bolt in its receptacle he had picked a lock had found the letter prepared by mr bideawhile with its accompanying envelope and had then already learned enough of the domestic circumstances of the longestaffe family to feel assured that unless he could assist the expedition of this hitherto uncompleted letter by his own skill the letter would never reach its intended destination in all this fortune had in some degree befriended him the circumstances being as they were it was hardly possible that the forgery should be discovered even though the young man were to swear that the signature was not his even though the old man were to swear that he had left that drawer properly locked with the unsigned letter in it still there could be no evidence people might think people might speak people might feel sure and then a crash would come but there would still be that ample fortune on which to retire and eat and drink and make merry for the rest of his days  then there came annoying complications in his affairs what had been so easy in reference to that letter which dolly longestaffe never would have signed was less easy but still feasible in another matter under the joint pressure of immediate need growing ambition and increasing audacity it had been done then the rumours that were spread abroadwhich to melmotte were serious indeedthey named at any rate in reference to dolly longestaffe the very thing that had been done now if that or the like of that were brought actually home to him if twelve jurymen could be got to say that he had done that thing of what use then would be all that money when that fear arose then there arose also the question whether it might not be well to use the money to save him from such ruin if it might be so used no doubt all danger in that longestaffe affair might be bought off by payment of the price stipulated for the pickering property neither would dolly longestaffe nor squercum of whom mr melmotte had already heard concern himself in this matter if the money claimed were paid but then the money would be as good as wasted by such a payment if as he firmly believed no sufficient evidence could be produced to prove the thing which he had done  but the complications were so many perhaps in his admiration for the country of his adoption mr melmotte had allowed himself to attach higher privileges to the british aristocracy than do in truth belong to them he did in his heart believe that could he be known to all the world as the fatherinlaw of the eldest son of the marquis of auld reekie he would become not really free of the law but almost safe from its fangs in regard to such an affair as this he thought he could so use the family with which he would be connected as to force from it that protection which he would need and then again if he could tide over this bad time how glorious would it be to have a british marquis for his soninlaw like many others he had failed altogether to inquire when the pleasure to himself would come or what would be its nature but he did believe that such a marriage would add a charm to his life now he knew that lord nidderdale could not be got to marry his daughter without the positive assurance of absolute property but he did think that the income which might thus be transferred with marie though it fell short of that which had been promised might suffice for the time and he had already given proof to the marquiss lawyer that his daughter was possessed of the property in question  and indeed there was another complication which had arisen within the last few days and which had startled mr melmotte very much indeed on a certain morning he had sent for marie to the study and had told her that he should require her signature in reference to a deed she had asked him what deed he had replied that it would be a document regarding money and reminded her that she had signed such a deed once before telling her that it was all in the way of business it was not necessary that she should ask any more questions as she would be wanted only to sign the paper then marie astounded him not merely by showing him that she understood a great deal more of the transaction than he had thoughtbut also by a positive refusal to sign anything at all the reader may understand that there had been many words between them i know papa it is that you may have the money to do what you like with you have been so unkind to me about sir felix carbury that i wont do it if i ever marry the money will belong to my husband his breath almost failed him as he listened to these words he did not know whether to approach her with threats with entreaties or with blows before the interview was over he had tried all three he had told her that he could and would put her in prison for conduct so fraudulent he besought her not to ruin her parent by such monstrous perversity and at last he took her by both arms and shook her violently but marie was quite firm he might cut her to pieces but she would sign nothing i suppose you thought sir felix would have had the entire sum said the father with deriding scorn  and he wouldif he had the spirit to take it answered marie  this was another reason for sticking to the nidderdale plan he would no doubt lose the immediate income but in doing so he would secure the marquis he was therefore induced on weighing in his nicestbalanced scales the advantages and disadvantages to leave the longestaffes unpaid and to let nidderdale have the money not that he could make up his mind to such a course with any conviction that he was doing the best for himself the dangers on all sides were very great but at the present moment audacity recommended itself to him and this was the boldest stroke marie had now said that she would accept nidderdaleor the sweep at the crossing  on monday morningit was on the preceding thursday that he had made his famous speech in parliamentone of the bideawhiles had come to him in the city he had told mr bideawhile that all the world knew that just at the present moment money was very tight in the city we are not asking for payment of a commercial debt said mr bideawhile but for the price of a considerable property which you have purchased mr melmotte had suggested that the characteristics of the money were the same let the sum in question have become due how it might then he offered to make the payment in two bills at three and six months date with proper interest allowed but this offer mr bideawhile scouted with indignation demanding that the titledeeds might be restored to them  you have no right whatever to demand the titledeeds said melmotte you can only claim the sum due and i have already told you how i propose to pay it  mr bideawhile was nearly beside himself with dismay in the whole course of his business in all the records of the very respectable firm to which he belonged there had never been such a thing as this of course mr longestaffe had been the person to blameso at least all the bideawhiles declared among themselves he had been so anxious to have dealings with the man of money that he had insisted that the titledeeds should be given up but then the titledeeds had not been his to surrender the pickering estate had been the joint property of him and his son the house had been already pulled down and now the purchaser offered bills in lieu of the purchase money do you mean to tell me mr melmotte that you have not got the money to pay for what you have bought and that nevertheless the titledeeds have already gone out of your hands  i have property to ten times the value twenty times the value thirty times the value said melmotte proudly but you must know i should think by this time that a man engaged in large affairs cannot always realise such a sum as eighty thousand pounds at a days notice mr bideawhile without using language that was absolutely vituperative gave mr melmotte to understand that he thought that he and his client had been robbed and that he should at once take whatever severest steps the law put in his power as mr melmotte shrugged his shoulders and made no further reply mr bideawhile could only take his departure  the attorney although he was bound to be staunch to his own client and to his own house in opposition to mr squercum nevertheless was becoming doubtful in his own mind as to the genuineness of the letter which dolly was so persistent in declaring that he had not signed mr longestaffe himself who was at any rate an honest man had given it as his opinion that dolly had not signed the letter his son had certainly refused to sign it once and as far as he knew could have had no opportunity of signing it since he was all but sure that he had left the letter under lock and key in his own drawer in the room which had latterly become melmottes study as well as his own then on entering the room in melmottes presencetheir friendship at the time having already ceasedhe found that his drawer was open this same mr bideawhile was with him at the time do you mean to say that i have opened your drawer said mr melmotte mr longestaffe had become very red in the face and had replied by saying that he certainly made no such accusation but as certainly he had not left the drawer unlocked he knew his own habits and was sure that he had never left that drawer open in his life then you must have changed the habits of your life on this occasion said mr melmotte with spirit mr longestaffe would trust himself to no other word within the house but when they were out in the street together he assured the lawyer that certainly that drawer had been left locked and that to the best of his belief the letter unsigned had been left within the drawer mr bideawhile could only remark that it was the most unfortunate circumstance with which he had ever been concerned  the marriage with nidderdale would upon the whole be the best thing if it could only be accomplished the reader must understand that though mr melmotte had allowed himself considerable poetical licence in that statement as to property thirty times as great as the price which he ought to have paid for pickering still there was property the mans speculations had been so great and so wide that he did not really know what he owned or what he owed but he did know that at the present moment he was driven very hard for large sums his chief trust for immediate money was in cohenlupe in whose hands had really been the manipulation of the shares of the mexican railway he had trusted much to cohenlupemore than it had been customary with him to trust to any man cohenlupe assured him that nothing could be done with the railway shares at the present moment they had fallen under the panic almost to nothing now in the time of his trouble melmotte wanted money from the great railway but just because he wanted money the great railway was worth nothing cohenlupe told him that he must tide over the evil houror rather over an evil month it was at cohenlupes instigation that he had offered the two bills to mr bideawhile offer em again said cohenlupe he must take the bills sooner or later  on the monday afternoon melmotte met lord nidderdale in the lobby of the house have you seen marie lately he said nidderdale had been assured that morning by his fathers lawyer in his fathers presence that if he married miss melmotte at present he would undoubtedly become possessed of an income amounting to something over £5000 a year he had intended to get more than thatand was hardly prepared to accept marie at such a price but then there probably would be more no doubt there was a difficulty about pickering melmotte certainly had been raising money but this might probably be an affair of a few weeks melmotte had declared that pickering should be made over to the young people at the marriage his father had recommended him to get the girl to name a day the marriage could be broken off at the last day if the property were not forthcoming  im going up to your house almost immediately said nidderdale  youll find the women at tea to a certainty between five and six said melmotte     chapter lxxiv  melmotte makes a friend   have you been thinking any more about it lord nidderdale said to the girl as soon as madame melmotte had succeeded in leaving them alone together  i have thought ever so much more about it said marie  and whats the result  ohill have you  thats right said nidderdale throwing himself on the sofa close to her so that he might put his arm round her waist  wait a moment lord nidderdale she said  you might as well call me john  then wait a momentjohn you think you might as well marry me though you dont love me a bit  thats not true marie  yes it isits quite true and i think just the samethat i might as well marry you though i dont love you a bit  but you will  i dont know i dont feel like it just at present you had better know the exact truth you know i have told my father that i did not think youd ever come again but that if you did i would accept you but im not going to tell any stories about it you know who ive been in love with  but you cant be in love with him now  why not i cant marry him i know that and if he were to come to me i dont think that i would he has behaved bad  have i behaved bad  not like him you never did care and you never said you cared  oh yesi have  not at first you say it now because you think that i shall like it but it makes no difference now i dont mind about your arm being there if we are to be married only its just as well for both of us to look on it as business  how very hard you are marie  no i aint i wasnt hard to sir felix carbury and so i tell you i did love him  surely you have found him out now  yes i have said marie hes a poor creature  he has just been thrashed you know in the streetsmost horribly marie had not been told of this and started back from her lovers arms you hadnt heard it  who has thrashed him  i dont want to tell the story against him but they say he has been cut about in a terrible manner  why should anybody beat him did he do anything  there was a young lady in the question marie  a young lady what young lady i dont believe it but its nothing to me i dont care about anything lord nidderdalenot a bit i suppose youve made up all that out of your own head  indeed no i believe he was beaten and i believe it was about a young woman but it signifies nothing to me and i dont suppose it signifies much to you dont you think we might fix a day marie  i dont care the least said marie the longer its put off the better i shall like itthats all  because im so detestable  noyou aint detestable i think you are a very good fellow only you dont care for me but it is detestable not being able to do what one wants its detestable having to quarrel with everybody and never to be good friends with anybody and its horribly detestable having nothing on earth to give one any interest  you couldnt take any interest in me  not the least  suppose you try wouldnt you like to know anything about the place where we live  its a castle i know  yescastle reekie ever so many hundred years old  i hate old places i should like a new house and a new dress and a new horse every weekand a new lover your father lives at the castle i dont suppose we are to go and live there too  we shall be there sometimes when shall it be  the year after next  nonsense marie  tomorrow  you wouldnt be ready  you may manage it all just as you like with papa oh yeskiss me of course you may if im to belong to you what does it matter noi wont say that i love you but if ever i do say it you may be sure it will be true thats more than you can say of yourselfjohn  so the interview was over and nidderdale walked back to the house thinking of his lady love as far as he was able to bring his mind to any operation of thinking he was fully determined to go on with it as far as the girl herself was concerned she had in these latter days become much more attractive to him than when he had first known her she certainly was not a fool and though he could not tell himself that she was altogether like a lady still she had a manner of her own which made him think that she would be able to live with ladies and he did think that in spite of all she said to the contrary she was becoming fond of himas he certainly had become fond of her have you been up with the ladies melmotte asked him  oh yes  and what does marie say  that you must fix the day  well have it very soon thensome time next month youll want to get away in august and to tell the truth so shall i i never was worked so hard in my life as ive been this summer the election and that horrid dinner had something to do with it and i dont mind telling you that ive had a fearful weight on my mind in reference to money i never had to find so many large sums in so short a time and im not quite through it yet  i wonder why you gave the dinner then  my dear boyit was very pleasant to him to call the son of a marquis his dear boyas regards expenditure that was a fleabite nothing that i could spend myself would have the slightest effect upon my condition one way or the other  i wish it could be the same way with me said nidderdale  if you chose to go into business with me instead of taking maries money out it very soon would be so with you but the burden is very great i never know whence these panics arise or why they come or whither they go but when they do come they are like a storm at sea it is only the strong ships that can stand the fury of the winds and waves and then the buffeting which a man gets leaves him only half the man he was ive had it very hard this time  i suppose you are getting right now  yesi am getting right i am not in any fear if you mean that i dont mind telling you everything as it is settled now that you are to be maries husband i know that you are honest and that if you could hurt me by repeating what i say you wouldnt do it  certainly i would not  you see ive no partnernobody that is bound to know my affairs my wife is the best woman in the world but is utterly unable to understand anything about it of course i cant talk freely to marie cohenlupe whom you see so much with me is all very wellin his way but i never talk over my affairs with him he is concerned with me in one or two thingsour american railway for instance but he has no interest generally in my house it is all on my own shoulders and i can tell you the weight is a little heavy it will be the greatest comfort to me in the world if i can get you to have an interest in the matter  i dont suppose i could ever really be any good at business said the modest young lord  you wouldnt come and work i suppose i shouldnt expect that but i should be glad to think that i could tell you how things are going on of course you heard all that was said just before the election for fortyeight hours i had a very bad time of it then the fact was that alf and they who were supporting him thought that they could carry the election by running me down they were at it for a fortnightperfectly unscrupulous as to what they said or what harm they might do me and others i thought that very cruel they couldnt get their man in but they could and did have the effect of depreciating my property suddenly by nearly half a million of money think what that is  i dont understand how it could be done  because you dont understand how delicate a thing is credit they persuaded a lot of men to stay away from that infernal dinner and consequently it was spread about the town that i was ruined the effect upon shares which i held was instantaneous and tremendous the mexican railway were at 117 and they fell from that in two days to something quite nominalso that selling was out of the question cohenlupe and i between us had about 8000 of these shares think what that comes to nidderdale tried to calculate what it did come to but failed altogether thats what i call a blowa terrible blow when a man is concerned as i am with money interests and concerned largely with them all he is of course exchanging one property for another every day of his lifeaccording as the markets go i dont keep such a sum as that in one concern as an investment nobody does then when a panic comes dont you see how it hits  will they never go up again  oh yesperhaps higher than ever but it will take time and in the meantime i am driven to fall back upon property intended for other purposes thats the meaning of what you hear about that place down in sussex which i bought for marie i was so driven that i was obliged to raise forty or fifty thousand wherever i could but that will be all right in a week or two and as for maries moneythat you know is settled  he quite succeeded in making nidderdale believe every word that he spoke and he produced also a friendly feeling in the young mans bosom with something approaching to a desire that he might be of service to his future fatherinlaw hazily as through a thick fog lord nidderdale thought that he did see something of the troubles as he had long seen something of the glories of commerce on an extended scale and an idea occurred to him that it might be almost more exciting than whist or unlimited loo he resolved too that whatever the man might tell him should never be divulged he was on this occasion somewhat captivated by melmotte and went away from the interview with a conviction that the financier was a big manone with whom he could sympathise and to whom in a certain way he could become attached  and melmotte himself had derived positive pleasure even from a simulated confidence in his soninlaw it had been pleasant to him to talk as though he were talking to a young friend whom he trusted it was impossible that he could really admit any one to a participation in his secrets it was out of the question that he should ever allow himself to be betrayed into speaking the truth of his own affairs of course every word he had said to nidderdale had been a lie or intended to corroborate lies but it had not been only on behalf of the lies that he had talked after this fashion even though his friendship with the young man were but a mock friendship though it would too probably be turned into bitter enmity before three months had passed bystill there was a pleasure in it the grendalls had left him since the day of the dinnermiles having sent him a letter up from the country complaining of severe illness it was a comfort to him to have someone to whom he could speak and he much preferred nidderdale to miles grendall  this conversation took place in the smokingroom when it was over melmotte went into the house and nidderdale strolled away to the beargarden the beargarden had been opened again though with difficulty and with diminished luxury nor could even this be done without rigid laws as to the payment of ready money herr vossner had never more been heard of but the bills which vossner had left unpaid were held to be good against the club whereas every note of hand which he had taken from the members was left in the possession of mr flatfleece of course there was sorrow and trouble at the beargarden but still the institution had become so absolutely necessary to its members that it had been reopened under a new management no one had felt this need more strongly during every hour of the dayof the day as he counted his days rising as he did about an hour after noon and going to bed three or four hours after midnightthan did dolly longestaffe the beargarden had become so much to him that he had begun to doubt whether life would be even possible without such a resort for his hours but now the club was again open and dolly could have his dinner and his bottle of wine with the luxury to which he was accustomed  but at this time he was almost mad with the sense of injury circumstances had held out to him a prospect of almost unlimited ease and indulgence the arrangement made as to the pickering estate would pay all his debts would disembarrass his own property and would still leave him a comfortable sum in hand squercum had told him that if he would stick to his terms he would surely get them he had stuck to his terms and he had got them and now the property was sold and the titledeeds goneand he had not received a penny he did not know whom to be loudest in abusinghis father the bideawhiles or mr melmotte and then it was said that he had signed that letter he was very open in his manner of talking about his misfortune at the club his father was the most obstinate old fool that ever lived as for the bideawhileshe would bring an action against them squercum had explained all that to him but melmotte was the biggest rogue the world had ever produced by george the world he said must be coming to an end theres that infernal scoundrel sitting in parliament just as if he had not robbed me of my property and forged my name andandby george he ought to be hung if any man ever deserved to be hung that man deserves to be hung this he spoke openly in the coffeeroom of the club and was still speaking as nidderdale was taking his seat at one of the tables dolly had been dining and had turned round upon his chair so as to face some halfdozen men whom he was addressing  nidderdale leaving his chair walked up to him very gently dolly said he do not go on in that way about melmotte when i am in the room i have no doubt you are mistaken and so youll find out in a day or two you dont know melmotte  mistaken dolly still continued to exclaim with a loud voice am i mistaken in supposing that i havent been paid my money  i dont believe it has been owing very long  am i mistaken in supposing that my name has been forged to a letter  i am sure you are mistaken if you think that melmotte had anything to do with it  squercum says  never mind squercum we all know what are the suspicions of a fellow of that kind  id believe squercum a deuced sight sooner than melmotte  look here dolly i know more probably of melmottes affairs than you do or perhaps than anybody else if it will induce you to remain quiet for a few days and to hold your tongue hereill make myself responsible for the entire sum he owes you  the devil you will  i will indeed  nidderdale was endeavouring to speak so that only dolly should hear him and probably nobody else did hear him but dolly would not lower his voice thats out of the question you know he said how could i take your money the truth is nidderdale the man is a thief and so youll find out sooner or later he has broken open a drawer in my fathers room and forged my name to a letter everybody knows it even my governor knows it nowand bideawhile before many days are over youll find that he will be in gaol for forgery  this was very unpleasant as every one knew that nidderdale was either engaged or becoming engaged to melmottes daughter  since you will speak about it in this public way began nidderdale  i think it ought to be spoken about in a public way said dolly  i deny it as publicly i cant say anything about the letter except that i am sure mr melmotte did not put your name to it from what i understand there seems to have been some blunder between your father and his lawyer  thats true enough said dolly but it doesnt excuse melmotte  as to the money there can be no more doubt that it will be paid than that i stand here what is ittwentyfive thousand isnt it  eighty thousand the whole  welleighty thousand its impossible to suppose that such a man as melmotte shouldnt be able to raise eighty thousand pounds  why dont he do it then asked dolly  all this was very unpleasant and made the club less social than it used to be in old days there was an attempt that night to get up a game of cards but nidderdale would not play because he was offended with dolly longestaffe and miles grendall was away in the countrya fugitive from the face of melmotte and carbury was in hiding at home with his countenance from top to bottom supported by plasters and montague in these days never went to the club at the present moment he was again in liverpool having been summoned thither by mr ramsbottom by george said dolly as he filled another pipe and ordered more brandy and water i think everything is going to come to an end i do indeed i never heard of such a thing before as a man being done in this way and then vossner has gone off and it seems everybody is to pay just what he says they owed him and now one cant even get up a game of cards i feel as though there were no good in hoping that things would ever come right again  the opinion of the club was a good deal divided as to the matter in dispute between lord nidderdale and dolly longestaffe it was admitted by some to be very fishy if melmotte were so great a man why didnt he pay the money and why should he have mortgaged the property before it was really his own but the majority of the men thought that dolly was wrong as to the signature of the letter dolly was a man who would naturally be quite unable to say what he had and what he had not signed and then even into the beargarden there had filtered through the outer world a feeling that people were not now bound to be so punctilious in the paying of money as they were a few years since no doubt it suited melmotte to make use of the money and thereforeas he had succeeded in getting the property into his handshe did make use of it but it would be forthcoming sooner or later in this way of looking at the matter the beargarden followed the world at large the world at large in spite of the terrible fallingoff at the emperor of chinas dinner in spite of all the rumours in spite of the ruinous depreciation of the mexican railway stock and of the undoubted fact that dolly longestaffe had not received his money was inclined to think that melmotte would pull through     chapter lxxv  in bruton street   mr squercum all this time was in a perfect fever of hard work and anxiety it may be said of him that he had been quite sharp enough to perceive the whole truth he did really know it allif he could prove that which he knew he had extended his inquiries in the city till he had convinced himself that whatever wealth melmotte might have had twelve months ago there was not enough of it left at present to cover the liabilities squercum was quite sure that melmotte was not a falling but a fallen starperhaps not giving sufficient credence to the recuperative powers of modern commerce squercum told a certain stockbroker in the city who was his specially confidential friend that melmotte was a gone coon the stockbroker made also some few inquiries and on that evening agreed with squercum that melmotte was a gone coon if such were the case it would positively be the making of squercum if it could be so managed that he should appear as the destroying angel of this offensive dragon so squercum raged among the bideawhiles who were unable altogether to shut their doors against him they could not dare to bid defiance to squercumfeeling that they had themselves blundered and feeling also that they must be careful not to seem to screen a fault by a falsehood i suppose you give it up about the letter having been signed by my client said squercum to the elder of the two younger bideawhiles  i give up nothing and i assert nothing said the superior attorney whether the letter be genuine or not we had no reason to believe it to be otherwise the young gentlemans signature is never very plain and this one is about as like any other as that other would be like the last  would you let me look at it again mr bideawhile then the letter which had been very often inspected during the last ten days was handed to mr squercum its a stiff resemblancesuch as he never could have written had he tried it ever so  perhaps not mr squercum we are not generally on the look out for forgeries in letters from our clients or our clients sons  just so mr bideawhile but then mr longestaffe had already told you that his son would not sign the letter  how is one to know when and how and why a young man like that will change his purpose  just so mr bideawhile but you see after such a declaration as that on the part of my clients father the letterwhich is in itself a little irregular perhaps  i dont know that its irregular at all  wellit didnt reach you in a very confirmatory manner well just say that what mr longestaffe can have been at to wish to give up his titledeeds without getting anything for them  excuse me mr squercum but thats between mr longestaffe and us  just sobut as mr longestaffe and you have jeopardised my clients property it is natural that i should make a few remarks i think youd have made a few remarks yourself mr bideawhile if the case had been reversed i shall bring the matter before the lord mayor you know to this mr bideawhile said not a word and i think i understand you now that you do not intend to insist on the signature as being genuine  i say nothing about it mr squercum i think youll find it very hard to prove that its not genuine  my clients oath mr bideawhile  im afraid your client is not always very clear as to what he does  i dont know what you mean by that mr bideawhile i fancy that if i were to speak in that way of your client you would be very angry with me besides what does it all amount to will the old gentleman say that he gave the letter into his sons hands so that even if such a freak should have come into my clients head he could have signed it and sent it off if i understand mr longestaffe says that he locked the letter up in a drawer in the very room which melmotte occupied and that he afterwards found the drawer open it wont i suppose be alleged that my client knew so little what he was about that he broke open the drawer in order that he might get at the letter look at it whichever way you will he did not sign it mr bideawhile  i have never said he did all i say is that we had fair ground for supposing that it was his letter i really dont know that i can say anything more  only that we are to a certain degree in the same boat together in this matter  i wont admit even that mr squercum  the difference being that your client by his fault has jeopardised his own interests and those of my client while my client has not been in fault at all i shall bring the matter forward before the lord mayor tomorrow and as at present advised shall ask for an investigation with reference to a charge of fraud i presume you will be served with a subpoena to bring the letter into court  if so you may be sure that we shall produce it then mr squercum took his leave and went straight away to mr bumby a barrister well known in the city the game was too powerful to be hunted down by mr squercums unassisted hands he had already seen mr bumby on the matter more than once mr bumby was inclined to doubt whether it might not be better to get the money or some guarantee for the money mr bumby thought that if a bill at three months could be had for dollys share of the property it might be expedient to take it mr squercum suggested that the property itself might be recovered no genuine sale having been made mr bumby shook his head titledeeds give possession mr squercum you dont suppose that the company which has lent money to melmotte on the titledeeds would have to lose it take the bill and if it is dishonoured run your chance of what youll get out of the property there must be assets  every rap will have been made over said mr squercum  this took place on the monday the day on which melmotte had offered his full confidence to his proposed soninlaw on the following wednesday three gentlemen met together in the study in the house in bruton street from which it was supposed that the letter had been abstracted there were mr longestaffe the father dolly longestaffe and mr bideawhile the house was still in melmottes possession and melmotte and mr longestaffe were no longer on friendly terms direct application for permission to have this meeting in this place had been formally made to mr melmotte and he had complied the meeting took place at eleven oclocka terribly early hour dolly had at first hesitated as to placing himself as he thought between the fire of two enemies and mr squercum had told him that as the matter would probably soon be made public he could not judiciously refuse to meet his father and the old family lawyer therefore dolly had attended at great personal inconvenience to himself by george its hardly worth having if one is to take all this trouble about it dolly had said to lord grasslough with whom he had fraternised since the quarrel with nidderdale dolly entered the room last and at that time neither mr longestaffe nor mr bideawhile had touched the drawer or even the table in which the letter had been deposited  now mr longestaffe said mr bideawhile perhaps you will show us where you think you put the letter  i dont think at all said he since the matter has been discussed the whole thing has come back upon my memory  i never signed it said dolly standing with his hands in his pockets and interrupting his father  nobody says you did sir rejoined the father with an angry voice if you will condescend to listen we may perhaps arrive at the truth  but somebody has said that i did ive been told that mr bideawhile says so  no mr longestaffe no we have never said so we have only said that we had no reason for supposing the letter to be other than genuine we have never gone beyond that  nothing on earth would have made me sign it said dolly why should i have given my property up before i got my money i never heard such a thing in my life  the father looked up at the lawyer and shook his head testifying as to the hopelessness of his sons obstinacy now mr longestaffe continued the lawyer let us see where you put the letter  then the father very slowly and with much dignity of deportment opened the drawerthe second drawer from the top and took from it a bundle of papers very carefully folded and docketed there said he the letter was not placed in the envelope but on the top of it and the two were the two first documents in the bundle he went on to say that as far as he knew no other paper had been taken away he was quite certain that he had left the drawer locked he was very particular in regard to that particular drawer and he remembered that about this time mr melmotte had been in the room with him when he had opened it andas he was certainhad locked it again at that special time there had been he said considerable intimacy between him and melmotte it was then that mr melmotte had offered him a seat at the board of the mexican railway  of course he picked the lock and stole the letter said dolly its as plain as a pikestaff its clear enough to hang any man  i am afraid that it falls short of evidence however strong and just may be the suspicion induced said the lawyer your father for a time was not quite certain about the letter  he thought that i had signed it said dolly  i am quite certain now rejoined the father angrily a man has to collect his memory before he can be sure of anything  i am thinking you know how it would go to a jury  what i want to know is how are we to get the money said dolly i should like to see him hung ofcourse but id sooner have the money squercum says  adolphus we dont want to know here what mr squercum says  i dont know why what mr squercum says shouldnt be as good as what mr bideawhile says of course squercum doesnt sound very aristocratic  quite as much so as bideawhile no doubt said the lawyer laughing  no squercum isnt aristocratic and fetter lane is a good deal lower than lincolns inn nevertheless squercum may know what hes about it was squercum who was first down upon melmotte in this matter and if it wasnt for squercum we shouldnt know as much about it as we do at present squercums name was odious to the elder longestaffe he believed probably without much reason that all his family troubles came to him from squercum thinking that if his son would have left his affairs in the hands of the old slows and the old bideawhiles money would never have been scarce with him and that he would not have made this terrible blunder about the pickering property and the sound of squercum as his son knew was horrid to his ears he hummed and hawed and fumed and fretted about the room shaking his head and frowning his son looked at him as though quite astonished at his displeasure theres nothing more to be done here sir i suppose said dolly putting on his hat  nothing more said mr bideawhile it may be that i shall have to instruct counsel and i thought it well that i should see in the presence of both of you exactly how the thing stood you speak so positively mr longestaffe that there can be no doubt  there is no doubt  and now perhaps you had better lock the drawer in our presence stop a momenti might as well see whether there is any sign of violence having been used so saying mr bideawhile knelt down in front of the table and began to examine the lock this he did very carefully and satisfied himself that there was no sign of violence whoever has done it did it very well said bideawhile  of course melmotte did it said dolly longestaffe standing immediately over bideawhiles shoulder  at that moment there was a knock at the doora very distinct and we may say a formal knock there are those who knock and immediately enter without waiting for the sanction asked had he who knocked done so on this occasion mr bideawhile would have been found still on his knees with his nose down to the level of the keyhole but the intruder did not intrude rapidly and the lawyer jumped on to his feet almost upsetting dolly with the effort there was a pause during which mr bideawhile moved away from the tableas he might have done had he been picking a lockand then mr longestaffe bade the stranger come in with a sepulchral voice the door was opened and mr melmotte appeared  now mr melmottes presence certainly had not been expected it was known that it was his habit to be in the city at this hour it was known also that he was well aware that this meeting was to be held in this room at this special hourand he might well have surmised with what view there was now declared hostility between both the longestaffes and mr melmotte and it certainly was supposed by all the gentlemen concerned that he would not have put himself out of the way to meet them on this occasion gentlemen he said perhaps you think that i am intruding at the present moment no one said that he did not think so the elder longestaffe simply bowed very coldly mr bideawhile stood upright and thrust his thumbs into his waistcoat pockets dolly who at first forgot to take his hat off whistled a bar and then turned a pirouette on his heel that was his mode of expressing his thorough surprise at the appearance of his debtor i fear that you do think i am intruding said melmotte but i trust that what i have to say will be held to excuse me i see sir he said turning to mr longestaffe and glancing at the still open drawer that you have been examining your desk i hope that you will be more careful in locking it than you were when you left it before  the drawer was locked when i left it said mr longestaffe i make no deductions and draw no conclusions but the drawer was locked  then i should say it must have been locked when you returned to it  no sir i found it open i make no deductions and draw no conclusionsbut i left it locked and i found it open  i should make a deduction and draw a conclusion said dolly and that would be that somebody else had opened it  this can answer no purpose at all said bideawhile  it was but a chance remark said melmotte i did not come here out of the city at very great personal inconvenience to myself to squabble about the lock of the drawer as i was informed that you three gentlemen would be here together i thought the opportunity a suitable one for meeting you and making you an offer about this unfortunate business he paused a moment but neither of the three spoke it did occur to dolly to ask them to wait while he should fetch squercum but on second thoughts he reflected that a great deal of trouble would have to be taken and probably for no good mr bideawhile i believe suggested melmotte and the lawyer bowed his head if i remember rightly i wrote to you offering to pay the money due to your clients  squercum is my lawyer said dolly  that will make no difference  it makes a deal of difference said dolly  i wrote continued melmotte offering my bills at three and six months date  they couldnt be accepted mr melmotte  i would have allowed interest i never have had my bills refused before  you must be aware mr melmotte said the lawyer that the sale of a property is not like an ordinary mercantile transaction in which bills are customarily given and taken the understanding was that money should be paid in the usual way and when we learned as we did learn that the property had been at once mortgaged by you of course we becamewell i think i may be justified in saying more than suspicious it was a mostmostunusual proceeding you say you have another offer to make mr melmotte  of course i have been short of money i have had enemies whose business it has been for some time past to run down my credit and with my credit has fallen the value of stocks in which it has been known that i have been largely interested i tell you the truth openly when i purchased pickering i had no idea that the payment of such a sum of money could inconvenience me in the least when the time came at which i should pay it stocks were so depreciated that it was impossible to sell very hostile proceedings are threatened against me now accusations are made false as hellmr melmotte as he spoke raised his voice and looked round the room but which at the present crisis may do me most cruel damage i have come to say that if you will undertake to stop proceedings which have been commenced in the city i will have fifty thousand poundswhich is the amount due to these two gentlemenready for payment on friday at noon  i have taken no proceedings as yet said bideawhile  its squercum says dolly  well sir continued melmotte addressing dolly let me assure you that if these proceedings are stayed the money will be forthcoming but if not i cannot produce the money i little thought two months ago that i should ever have to make such a statement in reference to such a sum as fifty thousand pounds but so it is to raise that money by friday i shall have to cripple my resources frightfully it will be done at a terrible cost but what mr bideawhile says is true i have no right to suppose that the purchase of this property should be looked upon as an ordinary commercial transaction the money should have been paidand if you will now take my word the money shall be paid but this cannot be done if i am made to appear before the lord mayor tomorrow the accusations brought against me are damnably false i do not know with whom they have originated whoever did originate them they are damnably false but unfortunately false as they are in the present crisis they may be ruinous to me now gentlemen perhaps you will give me an answer  both the father and the lawyer looked at dolly dolly was in truth the accuser through the mouthpiece of his attorney squercum it was at dollys instance that these proceedings were being taken i on behalf of my client said mr bideawhile will consent to wait till friday at noon  i presume adolphus that you will say as much said the elder longestaffe  dolly longestaffe was certainly not an impressionable person but melmottes eloquence had moved even him it was not that he was sorry for the man but that at the present moment he believed him though he had been absolutely sure that melmotte had forged his name or caused it to be forgedand did not now go so far into the matter as to abandon that convictionhe had been talked into crediting the reasons given for melmottes temporary distress and also into a belief that the money would be paid on friday something of the effect which melmottes false confessions had had upon lord nidderdale they now also had on dolly longestaffe ill ask squercum you know he said  of course mr squercum will act as you instruct him said bideawhile  ill ask squercum ill go to him at once i cant do any more than that and upon my word mr melmotte youve given me a great deal of trouble  melmotte with a smile apologized then it was settled that they three should meet in that very room on friday at noon and that the payment should then be madedolly stipulating that as his father would be attended by bideawhile so would he be attended by squercum to this mr longestaffe senior yielded with a very bad grace     chapter lxxvi  hetta and her lover   lady carbury was at this time so miserable in regard to her son that she found herself unable to be active as she would otherwise have been in her endeavours to separate paul montague and her daughter roger had come up to town and given his opinion very freely at any rate with regard to sir felix but roger had immediately returned to suffolk and the poor mother in want of assistance and consolation turned naturally to mr broune who came to see her for a few minutes almost every evening it had now become almost a part of mr brounes life to see lady carbury once in the day she told him of the two propositions which roger had made first that she should fix her residence in some secondrate french or german town and that sir felix should be made to go with her and secondly that she should take possession of carbury manor for six months and where would mr carbury go asked mr broune  hes so good that he doesnt care what he does with himself theres a cottage on the place he says that he would move to mr broune shook his head mr broune did not think that an offer so quixotically generous as this should be accepted as to the german or french town mr broune said that the plan was no doubt feasible but he doubted whether the thing to be achieved was worth the terrible sacrifice demanded he was inclined to think that sir felix should go to the colonies that he might drink himself to death said lady carbury who now had no secrets from mr broune sir felix in the meantime was still in the doctors hands upstairs he had no doubt been very severely thrashed but there was not in truth very much ailing him beyond the cuts on his face he was however at the present moment better satisfied to be an invalid than to have to come out of his room and to meet the world as to melmotte said mr broune they say now that he is in some terrible mess which will ruin him and all who have trusted him  and the girl  it is impossible to understand it at all melmotte was to have been summoned before the lord mayor today on some charge of fraudbut it was postponed and i was told this morning that nidderdale still means to marry the girl i dont think anybody knows the truth about it we shall hold our tongue about him till we really do know something the we of whom mr broune spoke was of course the morning breakfast table  but in all this there was nothing about hetta hetta however thought very much of her own condition and found herself driven to take some special step by the receipt of two letters from her lover written to her from liverpool they had never met since she had confessed her love to him the first letter she did not at once answer as she was at that moment waiting to hear what roger carbury would say about mrs hurtle roger carbury had spoken leaving a conviction on her mind that mrs hurtle was by no means a fictionbut indeed a fact very injurious to her happiness then pauls second loveletter had come full of joy and love and contentmentwith not a word in it which seemed to have been in the slightest degree influenced by the existence of a mrs hurtle had there been no mrs hurtle the letter would have been all that hetta could have desired and she could have answered it unless forbidden by her mother with all a girls usual enthusiastic affection for her chosen lord but it was impossible that she should now answer it in that strainand it was equally impossible that she should leave such letters unanswered roger had told her to ask himself and she now found herself constrained to bid him either come to her and answer the question or if he thought it better to give her some written account of mrs hurtle so that she might know who the lady was and whether the ladys condition did in any way interfere with her own happiness so she wrote to paul as follows  welbeck street 16 july 18  my dear paul she found that after that which had passed between them she could not call him my dear sir or my dear mr montague and that it must either be sir or my dear paul he was dear to her very dear and she thought that he had not been as yet convicted of any conduct bad enough to force her to treat him as an outcast had there been no mrs hurtle he would have been her dearest paulbut she made her choice and so commenced      my dear paul     a strange report has come round to me about a lady called mrs    hurtle i have been told that she is an american lady living in    london and that she is engaged to be your wife i cannot    believe this it is too horrid to be true but i feari fear    there is something true that will be very very sad for me to    hear it was from my brother i first heard itwho was of    course bound to tell me anything he knew i have talked to mamma    about it and to my cousin roger i am sure roger knows it    allbut he will not tell me he saidask himself and so i    ask you of course i can write about nothing else till i have    heard about this i am sure i need not tell you that it has made    me very unhappy if you cannot come and see me at once you had    better write i have told mamma about this letter   then came the difficulty of the signature with the declaration which must naturally be attached to it after some hesitation she subscribed herself      your affectionate friend     henrietta carbury   most affectionately your own hetta would have been the form in which she would have wished to finish the first letter she had ever written to him  paul received it at liverpool on the wednesday morning and on the wednesday evening he was in welbeck street he had been quite aware that it had been incumbent on him to tell her the whole history of mrs hurtle he had meant to keep backalmost nothing but it had been impossible for him to do so on that one occasion on which he had pleaded his love to her successfully let any reader who is intelligent in such matters say whether it would have been possible for him then to have commenced the story of mrs hurtle and to have told it to the bitter end such a story must be postponed for a second or third interview or it may indeed be communicated by letter when paul was called away to liverpool he did consider whether he should write the story but there are many reasons strong against such written communications a man may desire that the woman he loves should hear the record of his follyso that in after days there may be nothing to detect so that should the mrs hurtle of his life at any time intrude upon his happiness he may with a clear brow and undaunted heart say to his beloved oneah this is the trouble of which i spoke to you and then he and his beloved one will be in one cause together but he hardly wishes to supply his beloved one with a written record of his folly and then who does not know how much tenderness a man may show to his own faults by the tone of his voice by halfspoken sentences and by an admixture of words of love for the lady who has filled up the vacant space once occupied by the mrs hurtle of his romance but the written record must go through from beginning to end selfaccusing thoroughly perspicuous with no sweet soft falsehoods hidden under the halfexpressed truth the soft falsehoods which would be sweet as the scent of violets in a personal interview would stand in danger of being denounced as deceit added to deceit if sent in a letter i think therefore that paul montague did quite right in hurrying up to london  he asked for miss carbury and when told that miss henrietta was with her mother he sent his name up and said that he would wait in the diningroom he had thoroughly made up his mind to this course they should know that he had come at once but he would not if it could be helped make his statement in the presence of lady carbury then upstairs there was a little discussion hetta pleaded her right to see him alone she had done what roger had advised and had done it with her mothers consent her mother might be sure that she would not again accept her lover till this story of mrs hurtle had been sifted to the very bottom but she must herself hear what her lover had to say for himself felix was at the time in the drawingroom and suggested that he should go down and see paul montague on his sisters behalfbut his mother looked at him with scorn and his sister quietly said that she would rather see mr montague herself felix had been so cowed by circumstances that he did not say another word and hetta left the room alone  when she entered the parlour paul stept forward to take her in his arms that was a matter of course she knew it would be so and she had prepared herself for it paul she said let me hear about all thisfirst she sat down at some distance from himand he found himself compelled to seat himself at some distance from her  and so you have heard of mrs hurtle he said with a faint attempt at a smile  yesfelix told me and roger evidently had heard about her  oh yes roger carbury has heard about her from the beginningknows the whole history almost as well as i know it myself i dont think your brother is as well informed  perhaps not butisnt it a story thatconcerns me  certainly it so far concerns you hetta that you ought to know it and i trust you will believe that it was my intention to tell it you  i will believe anything that you will tell me  if so i dont think that you will quarrel with me when you know all i was engaged to marry mrs hurtle  is she a widowhe did not answer this at once i suppose she must be a widow if you were going to marry her  yesshe is a widow she was divorced  oh paul and she is an american  yes  and you loved her  montague was desirous of telling his own story and did not wish to be interrogated if you will allow me i will tell it you all from beginning to end  oh certainly but i suppose you loved her if you meant to marry her you must have loved her there was a frown upon hettas brow and a tone of anger in her voice which made paul uneasy  yesi loved her once but i will tell you all then he did tell his story with a repetition of which the reader need not be detained hetta listened with fair attentionnot interrupting very often though when she did interrupt the little words which she spoke were bitter enough but she heard the story of the long journey across the american continent of the ocean journey before the end of which paul had promised to make this woman his wife had she been divorced then asked hettabecause i believe they get themselves divorced just when they like simple as the question was he could not answer it i could only know what she told me he said as he went on with his story then mrs hurtle had gone on to paris and he as soon as he reached carbury had revealed everything to roger did you give her up then demanded hetta with stern severity nonot then he had gone back to san francisco andhe had not intended to say that the engagement had been renewed but he was forced to acknowledge that it had not been broken off then he had written to her on his second return to englandand then she had appeared in london at mrs pipkins lodgings in islington i can hardly tell you how terrible that was to me he said for i had by that time become quite aware that my happiness must depend upon you he tried the gentle soft falsehoods that should have been as sweet as violets perhaps they were sweet it is odd how stern a girl can be while her heart is almost breaking with love hetta was very stern  but felix says you took her to lowestoftquite the other day  montague had intended to tell allalmost all there was a something about the journey to lowestoft which it would be impossible to make hetta understand and he thought that that might be omitted it was on account of her health  ohon account of her health and did you go to the play with her  i did  was that for her health  oh hetta do not speak to me like that cannot you understand that when she came here following me i could not desert her  i cannot understand why you deserted her at all said hetta you say you loved her and you promised to marry her it seems horrid to me to marry a divorced womana woman who just says that she was divorced but that is because i dont understand american ways and i am sure you must have loved her when you took her to the theatre and down to lowestoftfor her health that was only a week ago  it was nearly three weeks said paul in despair  ohnearly three weeks that is not such a very long time for a gentleman to change his mind on such a matter you were engaged to her not three weeks ago  no hetta i was not engaged to her then  i suppose she thought you were when she went to lowestoft with you  she wanted then to force me tototo oh hetta it is so hard to explain but i am sure that you understand i do know that you do not cannot think that i have even for one moment been false to you  but why should you be false to her why should i step in and crush all her hopes i can understand that roger should think badly of her because she wasdivorced of course he would but an engagement is an engagement you had better go back to mrs hurtle and tell her that you are quite ready to keep your promise  she knows now that it is all over  i dare say you will be able to persuade her to reconsider it when she came all the way here from san francisco after you and when she asked you to take her to the theatre and to lowestoftbecause of her health she must be very much attached to you and she is waiting hereno doubt on purpose for you she is a very old friendvery oldand you ought not to treat her unkindly good bye mr montague i think you had better lose no time in goingback to mrs hurtle all this she said with sundry little impedimentary gurgles in her throat but without a tear and without any sign of tenderness  you dont mean to tell me hetta that you are going to quarrel with me  i dont know about quarrelling i dont wish to quarrel with any one but of course we cant be friends when you have married mrs hurtle  nothing on earth would induce me to marry her  of course i cannot say anything about that when they told me this story i did not believe them no i hardly believed roger whenhe would not tell it for he was too kindbut when he would not contradict it it seemed to be almost impossible that you should have come to me just at the very same moment for after all mr montague nearly three weeks is a very short time that trip to lowestoft couldnt have been much above a week before you came to me  what does it matter  oh no of course notnothing to you i think i will go away now mr montague it was very good of you to come and tell me all it makes it so much easier  do you mean to say thatyou are going tothrow me over  i dont want you to throw mrs hurtle over good bye  hetta  no i will not have you lay your hand upon me good night mr montague and so she left him  paul montague was beside himself with dismay as he left the house he had never allowed himself for a moment to believe that this affair of mrs hurtle would really separate him from hetta carbury if she could only really know it all there could be no such result he had been true to her from the first moment in which he had seen her never swerving from his love it was to be supposed that he had loved some woman before but as the world goes that would not could not affect her but her anger was founded on the presence of mrs hurtle in londonwhich he would have given half his possessions to have prevented but when she did come was he to have refused to see her would hetta have wished him to be cold and cruel like that no doubt he had behaved badly to mrs hurtlebut that trouble he had overcome and now hetta was quarrelling with him though he certainly had never behaved badly to her  he was almost angry with hetta as he walked home everything that he could do he had done for her for her sake he had quarrelled with roger carbury for her sakein order that he might be effectually free from mrs hurtlehe had determined to endure the spring of the wild cat for her sakeso he told himselfhe had been content to abide by that odious railway company in order that he might if possible preserve an income on which to support her and now she told him that they must partand that only because he had not been cruelly indifferent to the unfortunate woman who had followed him from america there was no logic in it no reasonand as he thought very little heart i dont want you to throw mrs hurtle over she had said why should mrs hurtle be anything to her surely she might have left mrs hurtle to fight her own battles but they were all against him roger carbury lady carbury and sir felix and the end of it would be that she would be forced into marriage with a man almost old enough to be her father she could not ever really have loved him that was the truth she must be incapable of such love as was his own for her true love always forgives and here there was really so very little to forgive such were his thoughts as he went to bed that night but he probably omitted to ask himself whether he would have forgiven her very readily had he found that she had been living nearly three weeks ago in close intercourse with another lover of whom he had hitherto never even heard the name but thenas all the world knowsthere is a wide difference between young men and young women  hetta as soon as she had dismissed her lover went up at once to her own room thither she was soon followed by her mother whose anxious ear had heard the closing of the front door well what has he said asked lady carbury hetta was in tearsor very nigh to tears struggling to repress them and struggling almost successfully you have found that what we told you about that woman was all true  enough of it was true said hetta who angry as she was with her lover was not on that account less angry with her mother for disturbing her bliss  what do you mean by that hetta had you not better speak to me openly  i say mamma that enough was true i do not know how to speak more openly i need not go into all the miserable story of the woman he is like other men i suppose he has entangled himself with some abominable creature and then when he is tired of her thinks that he has nothing to do but to say soand to begin with somebody else  roger carbury is very different  oh mamma you will make me ill if you go on like that it seems to me that you do not understand in the least  i say he is not like that  not in the least of course i know that he is not in the least like that  i say that he can be trusted  of course he can be trusted who doubts it  and that if you would give yourself to him there would be no cause for any alarm  mamma said hetta jumping up how can you talk to me in that way as soon as one man doesnt suit i am to give myself to another oh mamma how can you propose it nothing on earth will ever induce me to be more to roger carbury than i am now  you have told mr montague that he is not to come here again  i dont know what i told him but he knows very well what i mean  that it is all over hetta made no reply hetta i have a right to ask that and i have a right to expect a reply i do not say that you have hitherto behaved badly about mr montague  i have not behaved badly i have told you everything i have done nothing that i am ashamed of  but we have now found out that he has behaved very badly he has come here to youwith unexampled treachery to your cousin roger  i deny that exclaimed hetta  and at the very time was almost living with this woman who says that she is divorced from her husband in america have you told him that you will see him no more  he understood that  if you have not told him so plainly i must tell him  mamma you need not trouble yourself i have told him very plainly then lady carbury expressed herself satisfied for the moment and left her daughter to her solitude     chapter lxxvii  another scene in bruton street   when mr melmotte made his promise to mr longestaffe and to dolly in the presence of mr bideawhile that he would on the next day but one pay to them a sum of fifty thousand pounds thereby completing satisfactorily as far as they were concerned the purchase of the pickering property he intended to be as good as his word the reader knows that he had resolved to face the longestaffe difficultythat he had resolved that at any rate he would not get out of it by sacrificing the property to which he had looked forward as a safe haven when storms should come but day by day every resolution that he made was forced to undergo some change latterly he had been intent on purchasing a noble soninlaw with this moneystill trusting to the chapter of chances for his future escape from the longestaffe and other difficulties but squercum had been very hard upon him and in connexion with this accusation as to the pickering property there was another which he would be forced to face also respecting certain property in the east of london with which the reader need not much trouble himself specially but in reference to which it was stated that he had induced a foolish old gentleman to consent to accept railway shares in lieu of money the old gentleman had died during the transaction and it was asserted that the old gentlemans letter was hardly genuine melmotte had certainly raised between twenty and thirty thousand pounds on the property and had made payment for it in stock which was now worthalmost nothing at all melmotte thought that he might face this matter successfully if the matter came upon him singlehandedbut in regard to the longestaffes he considered that now at this last moment he had better pay for pickering  the property from which he intended to raise the necessary funds was really his own there could be no doubt about that it had never been his intention to make it over to his daughter when he had placed it in her name he had done so simply for securityfeeling that his control over his only daughter would be perfect and free from danger no girl apparently less likely to take it into her head to defraud her father could have crept quietly about a fathers house nor did he now think that she would disobey him when the matter was explained to her heavens and earth that he should be robbed by his own childrobbed openly shamefully with brazen audacity it was impossible but still he had felt the necessity of going about this business with some little care it might be that she would disobey him if he simply sent for her and bade her to affix her signature here and there he thought much about it and considered that it would be wise that his wife should be present on the occasion and that a full explanation should be given to marie by which she might be made to understand that the money had in no sense become her own so he gave instructions to his wife when he started into the city that morning and when he returned for the sake of making his offer to the longestaffes he brought with him the deeds which it would be necessary that marie should sign and he brought also mr croll his clerk that mr croll might witness the signature  when he left the longestaffes and mr bideawhile he went at once to his wifes room is she here he asked  i will send for her i have told her  you havent frightened her  why should i frighten her it is not very easy to frighten her melmotte she is changed since these young men have been so much about her  i shall frighten her if she does not do as i bid her bid her come now this was said in french then madame melmotte left the room and melmotte arranged a lot of papers in order upon a table having done so he called to croll who was standing on the landingplace and told him to seat himself in the back drawingroom till he should be called melmotte then stood with his back to the fireplace in his wifes sittingroom with his hands in his pockets contemplating what might be the incidents of the coming interview he would be very graciousaffectionate if it were possibleand above all things explanatory but by heavens if there were continued opposition to his demandto his just demandif this girl should dare to insist upon exercising her power to rob him he would not then be affectionate nor gracious there was some little delay in the coming of the two women and he was already beginning to lose his temper when marie followed madame melmotte into the room he at once swallowed his rising anger with an effort he would put a constraint upon himself the affection and the graciousness should be all thereas long as they might secure the purpose in hand  marie he began i spoke to you the other day about some property which for certain purposes was placed in your name just as we were leaving paris  yes papa  you were such a child theni mean when we left paristhat i could hardly explain to you the purpose of what i did  i understood it papa  you had better listen to me my dear i dont think you did quite understand it it would have been very odd if you had as i never explained it to you  you wanted to keep it from going away if you got into trouble  this was so true that melmotte did not know how at the moment to contradict the assertion and yet he had not intended to talk of the possibility of trouble i wanted to lay aside a large sum of money which should not be liable to the ordinary fluctuations of commercial enterprise  so that nobody could get at it  you are a little too quick my dear  marie why cant you let your papa speak said madame melmotte  but of course my dear continued melmotte i had no idea of putting the money beyond my own reach such a transaction is very common and in such cases a man naturally uses the name of some one who is very near and dear to him and in whom he is sure that he can put full confidence and it is customary to choose a young person as there will then be less danger of the accident of death it was for these reasons which i am sure that you will understand that i chose you of course the property remained exclusively my own  but it is really mine said marie  no miss it was never yours said melmotte almost bursting out into anger but restraining himself how could it become yours marie did i ever make you a gift of it  but i know that it did become minelegally  by a quibble of lawyes but not so as to give you any right to it i always draw the income  but i could stop that papaand if i were married of course it would be stopped  then quick as a flash of lightning another idea occurred to melmotte who feared that he already began to see that this child of his might be stiffnecked as we are thinking of your marriage he said it is necessary that a change should be made settlements must be drawn for the satisfaction of lord nidderdale and his father the old marquis is rather hard upon me but the marriage is so splendid that i have consented you must now sign these papers in four or five places mr croll is here in the next room to witness your signature and i will call him  wait a moment papa  why should we wait  i dont think i will sign them  why not sign them you cant really suppose that the property is your own you could not even get it if you did think so  i dont know how that may be but i had rather not sign them if i am to be married i ought not to sign anything except what he tells me  he has no authority over you yet i have authority over you marie do not give more trouble i am very much pressed for time let me call in mr croll  no papa she said  then came across his brow that look which had probably first induced marie to declare that she would endure to be cut to pieces rather than to yield in this or that direction the lower jaw squared itself and the teeth became set and the nostrils of his nose became extendedand marie began to prepare herself to be cut to pieces but he reminded himself that there was another game which he had proposed to play before he resorted to anger and violence he would tell her how much depended on her compliance therefore he relaxed the frownas well as he knew how and softened his face towards her and turned again to his work i am sure marie that you will not refuse to do this when i explain to you its importance to me i must have that property for use in the city tomorrow ori shall be ruined the statement was very short but the manner in which he made it was not without effect  oh shrieked his wife  it is true these harpies have so beset me about the election that they have lowered the price of every stock in which i am concerned and have brought the mexican railway so low that they cannot be sold at all i dont like bringing my troubles home from the city but on this occasion i cannot help it the sum locked up here is very large and i am compelled to use it in point of fact it is necessary to save us from destruction this he said very slowly and with the utmost solemnity  but you told me just now you wanted it because i was going to be married rejoined marie  a liar has many points to his favourbut he has this against him that unless he devote more time to the management of his lies than life will generally allow he cannot make them tally melmotte was thrown back for a moment and almost felt that the time for violence had come he longed to be at her that he might shake the wickedness and the folly and the ingratitude out of her but he once more condescended to argue and to explain i think you misunderstood me marie i meant you to understand that settlements must be made and that of course i must get my own property back into my own hands before anything of that kind can be done i tell you once more my dear that if you do not do as i bid you so that i may use that property the first thing tomorrow we are all ruined everything will be gone  this cant be gone said marie nodding her head at the papers  mariedo you wish to see me disgraced and ruined i have done a great deal for you  you turned away the only person i ever cared for said marie  marie how can you be so wicked do as your papa bids you said madame melmotte  no said melmotte she does not care who is ruined because we saved her from that reprobate  she will sign them now said madame melmotte  noi will not sign them said marie if i am to be married to lord nidderdale as you all say i am sure i ought to sign nothing without telling him and if the property was once made to be mine i dont think i ought to give it up again because papa says that he is going to be ruined i think thats a reason for not giving it up again  it isnt yours to give its mine said melmotte gnashing his teeth  then you can do what you like with it without my signing said marie  he paused a moment and then laying his hand gently upon her shoulder he asked her yet once again his voice was changed and was very hoarse but he still tried to be gentle with her marie he said will you do this to save your father from destruction  but she did not believe a word that he said to her how could she believe him he had taught her to regard him as her natural enemy making her aware that it was his purpose to use her as a chattel for his own advantage and never allowing her for a moment to suppose that aught that he did was to be done for her happiness and now almost in a breath he had told her that this money was wanted that it might be settled on her and the man to whom she was to be married and then that it might be used to save him from instant ruin she believed neither one story nor the other that she should have done as she was desired in this matter can hardly be disputed the father had used her name because he thought that he could trust her she was his daughter and should not have betrayed his trust but she had steeled herself to obstinacy against him in all things even yet after all that had passed although she had consented to marry lord nidderdale though she had been forced by what she had learned to despise sir felix carbury there was present to her an idea that she might escape with the man she really loved but any such hope could depend only on the possession of the money which she now claimed as her own melmotte had endeavoured to throw a certain supplicatory pathos into the question he had asked her but though he was in some degree successful with his voice his eyes and his mouth and his forehead still threatened her he was always threatening her all her thoughts respecting him reverted to that inward assertion that he might cut her to pieces if he liked he repeated his question in the pathetic strain will you do this nowto save us all from ruin but his eyes still threatened her  no she said looking up into his face as though watching for the personal attack which would be made upon her no i wont  marie exclaimed madame melmotte  she glanced round for a moment at her pseudomother with contempt no she said i dont think i oughtand i wont  you wont shouted melmotte she merely shook her head do you mean that you my own child will attempt to rob your father just at the moment you can destroy him by your wickedness she shook her head but said no other word       nec pueros coram populo medea trucidet       let not medea with unnatural rage       slaughter her mangled infants on the stage  nor will i attempt to harrow my readers by a close description of the scene which followed poor marie that cutting her up into pieces was commenced after a most savage fashion marie crouching down hardly uttered a sound but madame melmotte frightened beyond endurance screamed at the top of her voiceah melmotte tu la tueras and then she tried to drag him from his prey will you sign them now said melmotte panting at that moment croll frightened by the screams burst into the room it was perhaps not the first time that he had interfered to save melmotte from the effects of his own wrath  oh mr melmotte vat is de matter asked the clerk melmotte was out of breath and could hardly tell his story marie gradually recovered herself and crouched cowering in the corner of a sofa by no means vanquished in spirit but with a feeling that the very life had been crushed out of her body madame melmotte was standing weeping copiously with her handkerchief up to her eyes will you sign the papers melmotte demanded marie lying as she was all in a heap merely shook her head pig said melmottewicked ungrateful pig  ah maammoiselle said croll you should oblige your fader  wretched wicked girl said melmotte collecting the papers together then he left the room and followed by croll descended to the study whence the longestaffes and mr bideawhile had long since taken their departure  madame melmotte came and stood over the girl but for some minutes spoke never a word marie lay on the sofa all in a heap with her hair dishevelled and her dress disordered breathing hard but uttering no sobs and shedding no tears the stepmotherif she might so be calleddid not think of attempting to persuade where her husband had failed she feared melmotte so thoroughly and was so timid in regard to her own person that she could not understand the girls courage melmotte was to her an awful being powerful as satanwhom she never openly disobeyed though she daily deceived him and was constantly detected in her deceptions marie seemed to her to have all her fathers stubborn wicked courage and very much of his power at the present moment she did not dare to tell the girl that she had been wrong but she had believed her husband when he had said that destruction was coming and had partly believed him when he declared that the destruction might be averted by maries obedience her life had been passed in almost daily fear of destruction to marie the last two years of splendour had been so long that they had produced a feeling of security but to the elder woman the two years had not sufficed to eradicate the remembrance of former reverses and never for a moment had she felt herself to be secure at last she asked the girl what she would like to have done for her i wish he had killed me marie said slowly dragging herself up from the sofa and retreating without another word to her own room  in the meantime another scene was being acted in the room below melmotte after he reached the roomhardly made a reference to his daughter merely saying that nothing would overcome her wicked obstinacy he made no allusion to his own violence nor had croll the courage to expostulate with him now that the immediate danger was over the great financier again arranged the papers just as they had been laid out beforeas though he thought that the girl might be brought down to sign them there and then he went on to explain to croll what he had wanted to have donehow necessary it was that the thing should be done and how terribly cruel it was to him that in such a crisis of his life he should be hampered impededhe did not venture to his clerk to say ruinedby the illconditioned obstinacy of a girl he explained very fully how absolutely the property was his own how totally the girl was without any right to withhold it from him how monstrous in its injustice was the present position of things in all this croll fully agreed then melmotte went on to declare that he would not feel the slightest scruple in writing maries signature to the papers himself he was the girls father and was justified in acting for her the property was his own property and he was justified in doing with it as he pleased of course he would have no scruple in writing his daughters name then he looked up at the clerk the clerk again assentedafter a fashion not by any means with the comfortable certainty with which he had signified his accordance with his employers first propositions but he did not at any rate hint any disapprobation of the step which melmotte proposed to take then melmotte went a step farther and explained that the only difficulty in reference to such a transaction would be that the signature of his daughter would be required to be corroborated by that of a witness before he could use it then he again looked up at crollbut on this occasion croll did not move a muscle of his face there certainly was no assent melmotte continued to look at him but then came upon the old clerks countenance a stern look which amounted to very strong dissent and yet croll had been conversant with some irregular doings in his time and melmotte knew well the extent of crolls experience then melmotte made a little remark to himself he knows that the game is pretty well over you had better return to the city now he said aloud i shall follow you in half an hour it is quite possible that i may bring my daughter with me if i can make her understand this thing i shall do so in that case i shall want you to be ready croll again smiled and again assented and went his way  but melmotte made no further attempt upon his daughter as soon as croll was gone he searched among various papers in his desk and drawers and having found two signatures those of his daughter and of this german clerk set to work tracing them with some thin tissue paper he commenced his present operation by bolting his door and pulling down the blinds he practised the two signatures for the best part of an hour then he forged them on the various documentsand having completed the operation refolded them placed them in a locked bag of which he had always kept the key in his purse and then with the bag in his hand was taken in his brougham into the city     chapter lxxviii  miss longestaffe again at caversham   all this time mr longestaffe was necessarily detained in london while the three ladies of his family were living forlornly at caversham he had taken his younger daughter home on the day after his visit to lady monogram and in all his intercourse with her had spoken of her suggested marriage with mr brehgert as a thing utterly out of the question georgiana had made one little fight for her independence at the jermyn street hotel indeed papa i think its very hard she said  whats hard i think a great many things are hard but i have to bear them  you can do nothing for me  do nothing for you havent you got a home to live in and clothes to wear and a carriage to go about inand books to read if you choose to read them what do you expect  you know papa thats nonsense  how do you dare to tell me that what i say is nonsense  of course theres a house to live in and clothes to wear but whats to be the end of it sophia i suppose is going to be married  i am happy to say she isto a most respectable young man and a thorough gentleman  and dolly has his own way of going on  you have nothing to do with adolphus  nor will he have anything to do with me if i dont marry whats to become of me it isnt that mr brehgert is the sort of man i should choose  do not mention his name to me  but what am i to do you give up the house in town and how am i to see people it was you sent me to mr melmotte  i didnt send you to mr melmotte  it was at your suggestion i went there papa and of course i could only see the people he had there i like nice people as well as anybody  theres no use talking any more about it  i dont see that i must talk about it and think about it too if i can put up with mr brehgert i dont see why you and mamma should complain  a jew  people dont think about that as they used to papa he has a very fine income and i should always have a house in  then mr longestaffe became so furious and loud that he stopped her for that time look here he said if you mean to tell me that you will marry that man without my consent i cant prevent it but you shall not marry him as my daughter you shall be turned out of my house and i will never have your name pronounced in my presence again it is disgusting degradingdisgraceful and then he left her  on the next morning before he started for caversham he did see mr brehgert but he told georgiana nothing of the interview nor had she the courage to ask him the objectionable name was not mentioned again in her fathers hearing but there was a sad scene between herself lady pomona and her sister when mr longestaffe and his younger daughter arrived the poor mother did not go down into the hall to meet her childfrom whom she had that morning received the dreadful tidings about the jew as to these tidings she had as yet heard no direct condemnation from her husband the effect upon lady pomona had been more grievous even than that made upon the father mr longestaffe had been able to declare immediately that the proposed marriage was out of the question that nothing of the kind should be allowed and could take upon himself to see the jew with the object of breaking off the engagement but poor lady pomona was helpless in her sorrow if georgiana chose to marry a jew tradesman she could not help it but such an occurrence in the family would she felt be to her as though the end of all things had come she could never again hold up her head never go into society never take pleasure in her powdered footmen when her daughter should have married a jew she didnt think that she could pluck up the courage to look even her neighbours mrs yeld and mrs hepworth in the face georgiana found no one in the hall to meet her and dreaded to go to her mother she first went with her maid to her own room and waited there till sophia came to her as she sat pretending to watch the process of unpacking she strove to regain her courage why need she be afraid of anybody why at any rate should she be afraid of other females had she not always been dominant over her mother and sister oh georgey said sophia this is wonderful news  i suppose it seems wonderful that anybody should be going to be married except yourself  nobut such a very odd match  look here sophia if you dont like it you need not talk about it we shall always have a house in town and you will not if you dont like to come to us you neednt thats about all  george wouldnt let me go there at all said sophia  thengeorgehad better keep you at home at toodlam wheres mamma i should have thought somebody might have come and met me to say a word to me instead of allowing me to creep into the house like this  mamma isnt at all well but shes up in her own room you mustnt be surprised georgey if you find mamma veryvery much cut up about this then georgiana understood that she must be content to stand all alone in the world unless she made up her mind to give up mr brehgert  so ive come back said georgiana stooping down and kissing her mother  oh georgiana oh georgiana said lady pomona slowly raising herself and covering her face with one of her hands this is dreadful it will kill me it will indeed i didnt expect it from you  what is the good of all that mamma  it seems to me that it cant be possible its unnatural its worse than your wifes sister im sure theres something in the bible against it you never would read your bible or you wouldnt be going to do this  lady julia start has done just the same thingand she goes everywhere  what does your papa say im sure your papa wont allow it if hes fixed about anything its about the jews an accursed racethink of that georgianaexpelled from paradise  mamma thats nonsense  scattered about all over the world so that nobody knows who anybody is and its only since those nasty radicals came up that they have been able to sit in parliament  one of the greatest judges in the land is a jew said georgiana who had already learned to fortify her own case  nothing that the radicals can do can make them anything else but what they are im sure that mr whitstable who is to be your brotherinlaw will never condescend to speak to him  now if there was anybody whom georgiana longestaffe had despised from her youth upwards it was george whitstable he had been a laughingstock to her when they were children had been regarded as a lout when he left school and had been her common example of rural dullness since he had become a man he certainly was neither beautiful nor brightbut he was a conservative squire born of tory parents nor was he richhaving but a moderate income sufficient to maintain a moderate country house and no more when first there came indications that sophia intended to put up with george whitstable the more ambitious sister did not spare the shafts of her scorn and now she was told that george whitstable would not speak to her future husband she was not to marry mr brehgert lest she should bring disgrace among others upon george whitstable this was not to be endured  then mr whitstable may keep himself at home at toodlam and not trouble his head at all about me or my husband im sure i shant trouble myself as to what a poor creature like that may think about me george whitstable knows as much about london as i do about the moon  he has always been in county society said sophia and was staying only the other day at lord cantabs  then there were two fools together said georgiana who at this moment was very unhappy  mr whitstable is an excellent young man and i am sure he will make your sister happy but as for mr brehgerti cant bear to have his name mentioned in my hearing  then mamma it had better not be mentioned at any rate it shant be mentioned again by me having so spoken georgiana bounced out of the room and did not meet her mother and sister again till she came down into the drawingroom before dinner  her position was one very trying both to her nerves and to her feelings she presumed that her father had seen mr brehgert but did not in the least know what had passed between them it might be that her father had been so decided in his objection as to induce mr brehgert to abandon his intentionand if this were so there could be no reason why she should endure the misery of having the jew thrown in her face among them all they had made her think that she would never become mrs brehgert she certainly was not prepared to nail her colours upon the mast and to live and die for brehgert she was almost sick of the thing herself but she could not back out of it so as to obliterate all traces of the disgrace even if she should not ultimately marry the jew it would be known that she had been engaged to a jewand then it would certainly be said afterwards that the jew had jilted her she was thus vacillating in her mind not knowing whether to go on with brehgert or to abandon him that evening lady pomona retired immediately after dinner being far from well it was of course known to them all that mr brehgert was her ailment she was accompanied by her elder daughter and georgiana was left with her father not a word was spoken between them he sat behind his newspaper till he went to sleep and she found herself alone and deserted in that big room it seemed to her that even the servants treated her with disdain her own maid had already given her notice it was manifestly the intention of her family to ostracise her altogether of what service would it be to her that lady julia goldsheiner should be received everywhere if she herself were to be left without a single christian friend would a life passed exclusively among the jews content even her lessened ambition at ten oclock she kissed her fathers head and went to bed her father grunted less audibly than usual under the operation she had always given herself credit for high spirits but she began to fear that her courage would not suffice to carry her through sufferings such as these  on the next day her father returned to town and the three ladies were left alone great preparations were going on for the whitstable wedding dresses were being made and linen marked and consultations heldfrom all which things georgiana was kept quite apart the accepted lover came over to lunch and was made as much of as though the whitstables had always kept a town house sophy loomed so large in her triumph and happiness that it was not to be borne all caversham treated her with a new respect and yet if toodlam was a couple of thousand a year it was all it wasand there were two unmarried sisters lady pomona went half into hysterics every time she saw her younger daughter and became in her way a most oppressive parent oh heavenswas mr brehgert with his two houses worth all this a feeling of intense regret for the things she was losing came over her even caversham the caversham of old days which she had hated but in which she had made herself respected and partly feared by everybody about the placehad charms for her which seemed to her delightful now that they were lost for ever then she had always considered herself to be the first personage in the housesuperior even to her fatherbut now she was decidedly the last  her second evening was worse even than the first when mr longestaffe was not at home the family sat in a small dingy room between the library and the diningroom and on this occasion the family consisted only of georgiana in the course of the evening she went upstairs and calling her sister out into the passage demanded to be told why she was thus deserted poor mamma is very ill said sophy  i wont stand it if im to be treated like this said georgiana ill go away somewhere  how can i help it georgey its your own doing of course you must have known that you were going to separate yourself from us  on the next morning there came a dispatch from mr longestaffeof what nature georgey did not know as it was addressed to lady pomona but one enclosure she was allowed to see mamma said sophy thinks you ought to know how dolly feels about it and then a letter from dolly to his father was put into georgeys hands the letter was as follows      my dear father     can it be true that georgey is thinking of marrying that horrid    vulgar jew old brehgert the fellows say so but i cant    believe it im sure you wouldnt let her you ought to lock her    up     yours affectionately     a longestaffe   dollys letters made his father very angry as short as they were they always contained advice or instruction such as should come from a father to a son rather than from a son to a father this letter had not been received with a welcome nevertheless the head of the family had thought it worth his while to make use of it and had sent it to caversham in order that it might be shown to his rebellious daughter  and so dolly had said that she ought to be locked up shed like to see somebody do it as soon as she had read her brothers epistle she tore it into fragments and threw it away in her sisters presence how can mamma be such a hypocrite as to pretend to care what dolly says who doesnt know that hes an idiot and papa has thought it worth his while to send that down here for me to see well after that i must say that i dont much care what papa does  i dont see why dolly shouldnt have an opinion as well as anybody else said sophy  as well as george whitstable as far as stupidness goes they are about the same but dolly has a little more knowledge of the world  of course we all know georgiana rejoined the elder sister that for cuteness and that kind of thing one must look among the commercial classes and especially among a certain sort  ive done with you all said georgey rushing out of the room ill have nothing more to do with any one of you  but it is very difficult for a young lady to have done with her family a young man may go anywhere and may be lost at sea or come and claim his property after twenty years a young man may demand an allowance and has almost a right to live alone the young male bird is supposed to fly away from the paternal nest but the daughter of a house is compelled to adhere to her father till she shall get a husband the only way in which georgey could have done with them all at caversham would be by trusting herself to mr brehgert and at the present moment she did not know whether mr brehgert did or did not consider himself as engaged to her  that day also passed away with ineffable tedium at one time she was so beaten down by ennui that she almost offered her assistance to her sister in reference to the wedding garments in spite of the very bitter words which had been spoken in the morning she would have done so had sophy afforded her the slightest opportunity but sophy was heartlessly cruel in her indifference in her younger days she had had her bad things and nowwith george whitstable by her sideshe meant to have good things the goodness of which was infinitely enhanced by the badness of her sisters things she had been so greatly despised that the charm of despising again was irresistible and she was able to reconcile her cruelty to her conscience by telling herself that duty required her to show implacable resistance to such a marriage as this which her sister contemplated therefore georgiana dragged out another day not in the least knowing what was to be her fate     chapter lxxix  the brehgert correspondence   mr longestaffe had brought his daughter down to caversham on a wednesday during the thursday and friday she had passed a very sad time not knowing whether she was or was not engaged to marry mr brehgert her father had declared to her that he would break off the match and she believed that he had seen mr brehgert with that purpose she had certainly given no consent and had never hinted to any one of the family an idea that she was disposed to yield but she felt that at any rate with her father she had not adhered to her purpose with tenacity and that she had allowed him to return to london with a feeling that she might still be controlled she was beginning to be angry with mr brehgert thinking that he had taken his dismissal from her father without consulting her it was necessary that something should be settled something known life such as she was leading now would drive her mad she had all the disadvantages of the brehgert connection and none of the advantages she could not comfort herself with thinking of the brehgert wealth and the brehgert houses and yet she was living under the general ban of caversham on account of her brehgert associations she was beginning to think that she herself must write to mr brehgertonly she did not know what to say to him  but on the saturday morning she got a letter from mr brehgert it was handed to her as she was sitting at breakfast with her sisterwho at that moment was triumphant with a present of gooseberries which had been sent over from toodlam the toodlam gooseberries were noted throughout suffolk and when the letters were being brought in sophia was taking her lovers offering from the basket with her own fair hands well georgey had exclaimed to send a pottle of gooseberries to his lady love across the country who but george whitstable would do that  i dare say you get nothing but gems and gold sophy retorted i dont suppose that mr brehgert knows what a gooseberry is at that moment the letter was brought in and georgiana knew the writing i suppose thats from mr brehgert said sophy  i dont think it matters much to you who its from she tried to be composed and stately but the letter was too important to allow of composure and she retired to read it in privacy  the letter was as follows      my dear georgiana     your father came to me the day after i was to have met you at    lady monograms party i told him then that i would not write to    you till i had taken a day or two to consider what he said to    meand also that i thought it better that you should have a    day or two to consider what he might say to you he has now    repeated what he said at our first interview almost with more    violence for i must say that i think he has allowed himself to    be violent when it was surely unnecessary     the long and short of it is this he altogether disapproves of    your promise to marry me he has given three reasonsfirst    that i am in trade secondly that i am much older than you and    have a family and thirdly that i am a jew in regard to the    first i can hardly think that he is earnest i have explained to    him that my business is that of a banker and i can hardly    conceive it to be possible that any gentleman in england should    object to his daughter marrying a banker simply because the man    is a banker there would be a blindness of arrogance in such a    proposition of which i think your father to be incapable this    has merely been added in to strengthen his other objections     as to my age it is just fiftyone i do not at all think myself    too old to be married again whether i am too old for you is for    you to judgeas is also that question of my children who of    course should you become my wife will be to some extent a care    upon your shoulders as this is all very serious you will not i    hope think me wanting in gallantry if i say that i should    hardly have ventured to address you if you had been quite a    young girl no doubt there are many years between usand so i    think there should be a man of my age hardly looks to marry a    woman of the same standing as himself but the question is one    for the lady to decide and you must decide it now     as to my religion i acknowledge the force of what your father    saysthough i think that a gentleman brought up with fewer    prejudices would have expressed himself in language less likely    to give offence however i am a man not easily offended and on    this occasion i am ready to take what he has said in good part    i can easily conceive that there should be those who think that    the husband and wife should agree in religion i am indifferent    to it myself i shall not interfere with you if you make me    happy by becoming my wife nor i suppose will you with me    should you have a daughter or daughters i am quite willing that    they should be brought up subject to your influence   there was a plainspeaking in this which made georgiana look round the room as though to see whether any one was watching her as she read it      but no doubt your father objects to me specially because i am a    jew if i were an atheist he might perhaps say nothing on the    subject of religion on this matter as well as on others it    seems to me that your father has hardly kept pace with the    movements of the age fifty years ago whatever claim a jew    might have to be as well considered as a christian he certainly    was not so considered society was closed against him except    under special circumstances and so were all the privileges of    high position but that has been altered your father does not    admit the change but i think he is blind to it because he does    not wish to see     i say all this more as defending myself than as combating his    views with you it must be for you and for you alone to decide    how far his views shall govern you he has told me after a    rather peremptory fashion that i have behaved badly to him and    to his family because i did not go to him in the first instance    when i thought of obtaining the honour of an alliance with his    daughter i have been obliged to tell him that in this matter i    disagree with him entirely though in so telling him i    endeavoured to restrain myself from any appearance of warmth i    had not the pleasure of meeting you in his house nor had i any    acquaintance with him and again at the risk of being thought    uncourteous i must say that you are to a certain degree    emancipated by age from that positive subordination to which a    few years ago you probably submitted without a question if a    gentleman meets a lady in society as i met you in the home of    our friend mr melmotte i do not think that the gentleman is to    be debarred from expressing his feelings because the lady may    possibly have a parent your father no doubt with propriety    had left you to be the guardian of yourself and i cannot submit    to be accused of improper conduct because finding you in that    condition i availed myself of it     and now having said so much i must leave the question to be    decided entirely by yourself i beg you to understand that i do    not at all wish to hold you to a promise merely because the    promise has been given i readily acknowledge that the opinion    of your family should be considered by you though i will not    admit that i was bound to consult that opinion before i spoke to    you it may well be that your regard for me or your appreciation    of the comforts with which i may be able to surround you will    not suffice to reconcile you to such a breach from your own    family as your father with much repetition has assured me will    be inevitable take a day or two to think of this and turn it    well over in your mind when i last had the happiness of    speaking to you you seemed to think that your parents might    raise objections but that those objections would give way    before an expression of your own wishes i was flattered by your    so thinking but if i may form any judgment from your fathers    manner i must suppose that you were mistaken you will    understand that i do not say this as any reproach to you quite    the contrary i think your father is irrational and you may    well have failed to anticipate that he should be so     as to my own feelings they remain exactly as they were when i    endeavoured to explain them to you though i do not find myself    to be too old to marry i do think myself too old to write love    letters i have no doubt you believe me when i say that i    entertain a most sincere affection for you and i beseech you to    believe me in saying further that should you become my wife it    shall be the study of my life to make you happy     it is essentially necessary that i should allude to one other    matter as to which i have already told your father what i will    now tell you i think it probable that within this week i shall    find myself a loser of a very large sum of money through the    failure of a gentleman whose bad treatment of me i will the more    readily forgive because he was the means of making me known to    you this you must understand is private between you and me    though i have thought it proper to inform your father such    loss if it fall upon me will not interfere in the least with    the income which i have proposed to settle upon you for your use    after my death and as your father declares that in the event    of your marrying me he will neither give to you nor bequeath to    you a shilling he might have abstained from telling me to my    face that i was a bankrupt merchant when i myself told him of my    loss i am not a bankrupt merchant nor at all likely to become    so nor will this loss at all interfere with my present mode of    living but i have thought it right to inform you of it    because if it occuras i think it willi shall not deem it    right to keep a second establishment probably for the next two    or three years but my house at fulham and my stables there will    be kept up just as they are at present     i have now told you everything which i think it is necessary you    should know in order that you may determine either to adhere to    or to recede from your engagement when you have resolved you    will let me know but a day or two may probably be necessary for    your decision i hope i need not say that a decision in my    favour will make me a happy man     i am in the meantime your affectionate friend     ezekiel brehgert   this very long letter puzzled georgey a good deal and left her at the time of reading it very much in doubt as to what she would do she could understand that it was a plainspoken and truthtelling letter not that she to herself gave it praise for those virtues but that it imbued her unconsciously with a thorough belief she was apt to suspect deceit in other peoplebut it did not occur to her that mr brehgert had written a single word with an attempt to deceive her but the singleminded genuine honesty of the letter was altogether thrown away upon her she never said to herself as she read it that she might safely trust herself to this man though he were a jew though greasy and like a butcher though over fifty and with a family because he was an honest man she did not see that the letter was particularly sensiblebut she did allow herself to be pained by the total absence of romance she was annoyed at the first allusion to her age and angry at the second and yet she had never supposed that brehgert had taken her to be younger than she was she was well aware that the world in general attributes more years to unmarried women than they have lived as a sort of equalising counterweight against the pretences which young women make on the other side or the lies which are told on their behalf nor had she wished to appear peculiarly young in his eyes but nevertheless she regarded the reference to be uncivilperhaps almost butcherlikeand it had its effect upon her and then the allusion to the daughter or daughters troubled her she told herself that it was vulgarjust what a butcher might have said and although she was quite prepared to call her father the most irrational the most prejudiced and most illnatured of men yet she was displeased that mr brehgert should take such a liberty with him but the passage in mr brehgerts letter which was most distasteful to her was that which told her of the loss which he might probably incur through his connection with melmotte what right had he to incur a loss which would incapacitate him from keeping his engagements with her the townhouse had been the great persuasion and now he absolutely had the face to tell her that there was to be no townhouse for three years when she read this she felt that she ought to be indignant and for a few moments was minded to sit down without further consideration and tell the man with considerable scorn that she would have nothing more to say to him  but on that side too there would be terrible bitterness how would she have fallen from her greatness when barely forgiven by her father and mother for the vile sin which she had contemplated she should consent to fill a common bridesmaid place at the nuptials of george whitstable and what would then be left to her in life this episode of the jew would make it quite impossible for her again to contest the question of the london house with her father lady pomona and mrs george whitstable would be united with him against her there would be no season for her and she would be nobody at caversham as for london she would hardly wish to go there everybody would know the story of the jew she thought that she could have plucked up courage to face the world as the jews wife but not as the young woman who had wanted to marry the jew and had failed how would her future life go with her should she now make up her mind to retire from the proposed alliance if she could get her father to take her abroad at once she would do it but she was not now in a condition to make any terms with her father as all this gradually passed through her mind she determined that she would so far take mr brehgerts advice as to postpone her answer till she had well considered the matter  she slept upon it and the next day she asked her mother a few questions mamma have you any idea what papa means to do  in what way my dear lady pomonas voice was not gracious as she was free from that fear of her daughters ascendancy which had formerly affected her  welli suppose he must have some plan  you must explain yourself i dont know why he should have any particular plan  will he go to london next year  that depends upon money i suppose what makes you ask  of course i have been very cruelly circumstanced everybody must see that im sure you do mamma the long and short of it is thisif i give up my engagement will he take us abroad for a year  why should he  you cant suppose that i should be very comfortable in england if we are to remain here at caversham how am i to hope ever to get settled  sophy is doing very well  oh mamma there are not two george whitstablesthank god she had meant to be humble and supplicating but she could not restrain herself from the use of that one shaft i dont mean but what sophy may be very happy and i am sure that i hope she will but that wont do me any good i should be very unhappy here  i dont see how you are to find any one to marry you by going abroad said lady pomona and i dont see why your papa is to be taken away from his own home he likes caversham  then i am to be sacrificed on every side said georgey stalking out of the room but still she could not make up her mind what letter she would write to mr brehgert and she slept upon it another night  on the next day after breakfast she did write her letter though when she sat down to her task she had not clearly made up her mind what she would say but she did get it written and here it is      caversham monday     my dear mr brehgert     as you told me not to hurry i have taken a little time to think    about your letter of course it would be very disagreeable to    quarrel with papa and mamma and everybody and if i do do so    im sure somebody ought to be very grateful but papa has been    very unfair in what he has said as to not asking him it could    have been of no good for of course he would be against it he    thinks a great deal of the longestaffe family and so i    suppose ought i but the world does change so quick that one    doesnt think of anything now as one used to do anyway i dont    feel that im bound to do what papa tells me just because he    says it though im not quite so old as you seem to think im    old enough to judge for myselfand i mean to do so you say    very little about affection but i suppose i am to take all that    for granted     i dont wonder at papa being annoyed about the loss of the    money it must be a very great sum when it will prevent your    having a house in londonas you agreed it does make a great    difference because of course as you have no regular place in    the country one could only see ones friends in london fulham    is all very well now and then but i dont think i should like    to live at fulham all the year through you talk of three years    which would be dreadful if as you say it will not have any    lasting effect could you not manage to have a house in town if    you can do it in three years i should think you could do it    now i should like to have an answer to this question i do    think so much about being the season in town     as for the other parts of your letter i knew very well    beforehand that papa would be unhappy about it but i dont know    why im to let that stand in my way when so very little is done    to make me happy of course you will write to me again and i    hope you will say something satisfactory about the house in    london     yours always sincerely     georgiana longestaffe   it probably never occurred to georgey that mr brehgert would under any circumstances be anxious to go back from his engagement she so fully recognised her own value as a christian lady of high birth and position giving herself to a commercial jew that she thought that under any circumstances mr brehgert would be only too anxious to stick to his bargain nor had she any idea that there was anything in her letter which could probably offend him she thought that she might at any rate make good her claim to the house in london and that as there were other difficulties on his side he would yield to her on this point but as yet she hardly knew mr brehgert he did not lose a day in sending to her a second letter he took her letter with him to his office in the city and there he answered it without a moments delay      no 7 st cuthberts court london    tuesday july 16 18     my dear miss longestaffe     you say it would be very disagreeable to you to quarrel with    your papa and mamma and as i agree with you i will take your    letter as concluding our intimacy i should not however be    dealing quite fairly with you or with myself if i gave you to    understand that i felt myself to be coerced to this conclusion    simply by your qualified assent to your parents views it is    evident to me from your letter that you would not wish to be my    wife unless i can supply you with a house in town as well as    with one in the country but this for the present is out of my    power i would not have allowed my losses to interfere with your    settlement because i had stated a certain income and must    therefore to a certain extent have compromised my children but    i should not have been altogether happy till i had replaced them    in their former position and must therefore have abstained from    increased expenditure till i had done so but of course i have    no right to ask you to share with me the discomfort of a single    home i may perhaps add that i had hoped that you would have    looked to your happiness to another source and that i will bear    my disappointment as best i may     as you may perhaps under these circumstances be unwilling that i    should wear the ring you gave me i return it by post i trust    you will be good enough to keep the trifle you were pleased to    accept from me in remembrance of one who will always wish you    well     yours sincerely     ezekiel brehgert   and so it was all over georgey when she read this letter was very indignant at her lovers conduct she did not believe that her own letter had at all been of a nature to warrant it she had regarded herself as being quite sure of him and only so far doubting herself as to be able to make her own terms because of such doubts and now the jew had rejected her she read this last letter over and over again and the more she read it the more she felt that in her heart of hearts she had intended to marry him there would have been inconveniences no doubt but they would have been less than the sorrow on the other side now she saw nothing before her but a long vista of caversham dullness in which she would be trampled upon by her father and mother and scorned by mr and mrs george whitstable  she got up and walked about the room thinking of vengeance but what vengeance was possible to her everybody belonging to her would take the part of the jew in that which he had now done she could not ask dolly to beat him nor could she ask her father to visit him with a stern frown of paternal indignation there could be no revenge for a timeonly a few secondsshe thought that she would write to mr brehgert and tell him that she had not intended to bring about this termination of their engagement this no doubt would have been an appeal to the jew for mercyand she could not quite descend to that but she would keep the watch and chain he had given her and which somebody had told her had not cost less than a hundred and fifty guineas she could not wear them as people would know whence they had come but she might exchange them for jewels which she could wear  at lunch she said nothing to her sister but in the course of the afternoon she thought it best to inform her mother mamma she said as you and papa take it so much to heart i have broken off everything with mr brehgert  of course it must be broken off said lady pomona this was very ungraciousso much so that georgey almost flounced out of the room have you heard from the man asked her ladyship  i have written to him and he has answered me and it is all settled i thought that you would have said something kind to me and the unfortunate young woman burst out into tears  it was so dreadful said lady pomonaso very dreadful i never heard of anything so bad when young whatshisname married the tallowchandlers daughter i thought it would have killed me if it had been dolly but this was worse than that her father was a methodist  they had neither of them a shilling of money said georgey through her tears  and your papa says this man was next door to a bankrupt but its all over  yes mamma  and now we must all remain here at caversham till people forget it it has been very hard upon george whitstable because of course everybody has known it through the county i once thought he would have been off and i really dont know that we could have said anything at that moment sophy entered the room its all over between georgiana and theman said lady pomona who hardly saved herself from stigmatising him by a further reference to his religion  i knew it would be said sophia  of course it could never have really taken place said their mother  and now i beg that nothing more may be said about it said georgiana i suppose mamma you will write to papa  you must send him back his watch and chain georgey said sophia  what business is that of yours  of course she must her papa would not let her keep it  to such a miserable depth of humility had the younger miss longestaffe been brought by her illconsidered intimacy with the melmottes georgiana when she looked back on this miserable episode in her life always attributed her grief to the scandalous breach of compact of which her father had been guilty     chapter lxxx  ruby prepares for service   our poor old honest friend john crumb was taken away to durance vile after his performance in the street with sir felix and was locked up for the remainder of the night this indignity did not sit so heavily on his spirits as it might have done on those of a quicker nature he was aware that he had not killed the baronet and that he had therefore enjoyed his revenge without the necessity of swinging for it at bury that in itself was a comfort to him then it was a great satisfaction to think that he had served the young man out in the actual presence of his ruby he was not prone to give himself undue credit for his capability and willingness to knock his enemies about but he did think that ruby must have observed on this occasion that he was the better man of the two and to john a night in the stationhouse was no great personal inconvenience though he was very proud of his fourpost bed at home he did not care very much for such luxuries as far as he himself was concerned nor did he feel any disgrace from being locked up for the night he was very goodhumoured with the policeman who seemed perfectly to understand his nature and was as meek as a child when the lock was turned upon him as he lay down on the hard bench he comforted himself with thinking that ruby would surely never care any more for the baronite since she had seen him go down like a cur without striking a blow he thought a good deal about ruby but never attributed any blame to her for her share in the evils that had befallen him  the next morning he was taken before the magistrates but was told at an early hour of the day that he was again free sir felix was not much the worse for what had happened to him and had refused to make any complaint against the man who had beaten him john crumb shook hands cordially with the policeman who had had him in charge and suggested beer the constable with regrets was forced to decline and bade adieu to his late prisoner with the expression of a hope that they might meet again before long you come down to bungay said john and ill show you how we live there  from the policeoffice he went direct to mrs pipkins house and at once asked for ruby he was told that ruby was out with the children and was advised both by mrs pipkin and mrs hurtle not to present himself before ruby quite yet you see said mrs pipkin shes a thinking how heavy you were upon that young gentleman  but i wasntnot particular lord love you he aint a hair the wuss  you let her alone for a time said mrs hurtle a little neglect will do her good  maybe said johnonly i wouldnt like her to have it bad youll let her have her wittles regular mrs pipkin  it was then explained to him that the neglect proposed should not extend to any deprivation of food and he took his leave receiving an assurance from mrs hurtle that he should be summoned to town as soon as it was thought that his presence there would serve his purposes and with loud promises repeated to each of the friendly women that as soon as ever a line should be dropped he would appear again upon the scene he took mrs pipkin aside and suggested that if there were any hextras he was ready to pay for them then he took his leave without seeing ruby and went back to bungay  when ruby returned with the children she was told that john crumb had called i thought as he was in prison said ruby  what should they keep him in prison for said mrs pipkin he hasnt done nothing as he oughtnt to have done that young man was dragging you about as far as i can make out and mr crumb just did as anybody ought to have done to prevent it of course they werent going to keep him in prison for that prison indeed it isnt him as ought to be in prison  and where is he now aunt  gone down to bungay to mind his business and wont be coming here any more of a fools errand he must have seen now pretty well whats worth having and what aint beauty is but skin deep ruby  john crumbd be after me again tomorrow if id give him encouragement said ruby if id hold up my finger hed come  then john crumbs a fool for his pains thats all and now do you go about your work ruby didnt like to be told to go about her work and tossed her head and slammed the kitchen door and scolded the servant girl and then sat down to cry what was she to do with herself now she had an idea that felix would not come back to her after the treatment he had receivedand a further idea that if he did come he was not as she phrased it to herself of much account she certainly did not like him the better for having been beaten though at the time she had been disposed to take his part she did not believe that she would ever dance with him again that had been the charm of her life in london and that was now all over and as for marrying hershe began to feel certain that he did not intend it john crumb was a big awkward dull uncouth lump of a man with whom ruby thought it impossible that a girl should be in love love and john crumb were poles asunder but ruby did not like wheeling the perambulator about islington and being told by her aunt pipkin to go about her work what ruby did like was being in love and dancing but if all that must come to an end then there would be a question whether she could not do better for herself than by staying with her aunt and wheeling the perambulator about islington  mrs hurtle was still living in solitude in the lodgings and having but little to do on her own behalf had devoted herself to the interest of john crumb a man more unlike one of her own countrymen she had never seen i wonder whether he has any ideas at all in his head she had said to mrs pipkin mrs pipkin had replied that mr crumb had certainly a very strong idea of marrying ruby ruggles mrs hurtle had smiled thinking that mrs pipkin was also very unlike her own countrywomen but she was very kind to mrs pipkin ordering ricepuddings on purpose that the children might eat them and she was quite determined to give john crumb all the aid in her power  in order that she might give effectual aid she took mrs pipkin into confidence and prepared a plan of action in reference to ruby mrs pipkin was to appear as chief actor on the scene but the plan was altogether mrs hurtles plan on the day following johns return to bungay mrs pipkin summoned ruby into the back parlour and thus addressed her ruby you know this must come to an end now  what must come to an end  you cant stay here always you know  im sure i work hard aunt pipkin and i dont get no wages  i cant do with more than one girland theres the keep if there isnt wages besides theres other reasons your grandfather wont have you back there thats certain  i wouldnt go back to grandfather if it was ever so  but you must go somewheres you didnt come to stay here alwaysnor i couldnt have you you must go into service  i dont know anybody asd have me said ruby  you must put a vertisement into the paper youd better say as nursemaid as you seems to take kindly to children and i must give you a characteronly i shall say just the truth you mustnt ask much wages just at first ruby looked very sorrowful and the tears were near her eyes the change from the glories of the music hall was so startling and so oppressive it has got to be done sooner or later so you may as well put the vertisement in this afternoon  your going to turn me out aunt pipkin  wellif thats turning out i am you see you never would be said by me as though i was your mistress you would go out with that rapscallion when i bid you not now when youre in a regular place like you must mind when youre spoke to and it will be best for you youve had your swing and now you see youve got to pay for it you must earn your bread ruby as youve quarrelled both with your lover and your grandfather  there was no possible answer to this and therefore the necessary notice was put into the papermrs hurtle paying for its insertion because you know said mrs hurtle she must stay here really till mr crumb comes and takes her away mrs pipkin expressed her opinion that ruby was a baggage and john crumb a soft mrs pipkin was perhaps a little jealous at the interest which her lodger took in her niece thinking perhaps that all mrs hurtles sympathies were due to herself  ruby went hither and thither for a day or two calling upon the mothers of children who wanted nursemaids the answers which she had received had not come from the highest members of the aristocracy and the houses which she visited did not appal her by their splendour many objections were made to her a character from an aunt was objectionable her ringlets were objectionable she was a deal too flightylooking she spoke up much too free at last one happy mother of five children offered to take her on approval for a month at £12 a year ruby to find her own tea and wash for herself this was slaveryabject slavery and she too who had been the beloved of a baronet and who might even now be the mistress of a better house than that into which she was to go as a servantif she would only hold up her finger but the place was accepted and with brokenhearted sobbings ruby prepared herself for her departure from aunt pipkins roof  i hope you like your place ruby mrs hurtle said on the afternoon of her last day  indeed then i dont like it at all theyre the ugliest children you ever see mrs hurtle  ugly children must be minded as well as pretty ones  and the mother of em is as cross as cross  its your own fault ruby isnt it  i dont know as ive done anything out of the way  dont you think its anything out of the way to be engaged to a young man and then to throw him over all this has come because you wouldnt keep your word to mr crumb only for that your grandfather wouldnt have turned you out of his house  he didnt turn me out i ran away and it wasnt along of john crumb but because grandfather hauled me about by the hair of my head  but he was angry with you about mr crumb when a young woman becomes engaged to a young man she ought not to go back from her word no doubt mrs hurtle when preaching this doctrine thought that the same law might be laid down with propriety for the conduct of young men of course you have brought trouble on yourself i am sorry you dont like the place im afraid you must go to it now  i am agoingi suppose said ruby probably feeling that if she could but bring herself to condescend so far there might yet be open for her a way of escape  i shall write and tell mr crumb where you are placed  oh mrs hurtle dont what should you write to him for it aint nothing to him  i told him id let him know if any steps were taken  you can forget that mrs hurtle pray dont write i dont want him to know as im in service  i must keep my promise why shouldnt he know i dont suppose you care much now what he hears about you  yes i do i wasnt never in service before and i dont want him to know  what harm can it do you  well i dont want him to know its such a come down mrs hurtle  there is nothing to be ashamed of in that what you have to be ashamed of is jilting him it was a bad thing to dowasnt it ruby  i didnt mean nothing bad mrs hurtle only why couldnt he say what he had to say himself instead of bringing another to say it for him what would you feel mrs hurtle if a man was to come and say it all out of another mans mouth  i dont think i should much care if the thing was well said at last you know he meant it  yesi did know that  and you know he means it now  im not so sure about that hes gone back to bungay and he isnt no good at writing letters no more than at speaking ohhell go and get somebody else now  of course he will if he hears nothing about you i think id better tell him i know what would happen  what would happen mrs hurtle  hed be up in town again in half a jiffey to see what sort of a place youd got now ruby ill tell you what ill do if youll say the word ill have him up here at once and you shant go to mrs buggins ruby dropped her hands and stood still staring at mrs hurtle i will but if he comes you mustnt behave this time as you did before  but im to go to mrs buggins tomorrow  well send to mrs buggins and tell her to get somebody else youre breaking your heart about going thereare you not  i dont like it mrs hurtle  and this man will make you mistress of his house you say he isnt good at speaking but i tell you i never came across an honester man in the whole course of my life or one who i think would treat a woman better whats the use of a glib tongue if there isnt a heart with it whats the use of a lot of tinsel and lacker if the real metal isnt there sir felix carbury could talk i dare say but you dont think now he was a very fine fellow  he was so beautiful mrs hurtle  but he hadnt the spirit of a mouse in his bosom well ruby you have one more choice left you shall it be john crumb or mrs buggins  he wouldnt come mrs hurtle  leave that to me ruby may i bring him if i can then ruby in a very low whisper told mrs hurtle that if she thought proper she might bring john crumb back again and there shall be no more nonsense  no whispered ruby  on that same night a letter was sent to mrs buggins which mrs hurtle also composed informing that lady that unforeseen circumstances prevented ruby ruggles from keeping the engagement she had made to which a verbal answer was returned that ruby ruggles was an impudent hussey and then mrs hurtle in her own name wrote a short note to mr john crumb      dear mr crumb     if you will come back to london i think you will find miss ruby    ruggles all that you desire     yours faithfully     winifred hurtle   shes had a deal more done for her than i ever knew to be done for young women in my time said mrs pipkin and im not at all so sure that she has deserved it  john crumb will think she has  john crumbs a fooland as to ruby well i havent got no patience with girls like them yes it is for the best and as for you mrs hurtle theres no words to say how good youve been i hope mrs hurtle you aint thinking of going away because this is all done     chapter lxxxi  mr cohenlupe leaves london   dolly longestaffe had found himself compelled to go to fetter lane immediately after that meeting in bruton street at which he had consented to wait two days longer for the payment of his money this was on a wednesday the day appointed for the payment being friday he had undertaken that on his part squercum should be made to desist from further immediate proceedings and he could only carry out his word by visiting squercum the trouble to him was very great but he began to feel that he almost liked it the excitement was nearly as good as that of loo of course it was a horrid borethis having to go about in cabs under the sweltering sun of a london july day of course it was a horrid borethis doubt about his money and it went altogether against the grain with him that he should be engaged in any matter respecting the family property in agreement with his father and mr bideawhile but there was an importance in it that sustained him amidst his troubles it is said that if you were to take a man of moderate parts and make him prime minister out of hand he might probably do as well as other prime ministers the greatness of the work elevating the man to its own level in that way dolly was elevated to the level of a man of business and felt and enjoyed his own capacity by george it depended chiefly upon him whether such a man as melmotte should or should not be charged before the lord mayor perhaps i oughtnt to have promised he said to squercum sitting in the lawyers office on a highlegged stool with a cigar in his mouth he preferred squercum to any other lawyer he had met because squercums room was untidy and homely because there was nothing awful about it and because he could sit in what position he pleased and smoke all the time  well i dont think you ought if you ask me said squercum  you werent there to be asked old fellow  bideawhile shouldnt have asked you to agree to anything in my absence said squercum indignantly it was a very unprofessional thing on his part and so i shall take an opportunity of telling him  it was you told me to go  wellyes i wanted you to see what they were at in that room but i told you to look on and say nothing  i didnt speak halfadozen words  you shouldnt have spoken those words your father then is quite clear that you did not sign the letter  oh yesthe governor is pigheaded you know but hes honest  thats a matter of course said the lawyer all men are honest but they are generally specially honest to their own side bideawhiles honest but youve got to fight him deuced close to prevent his getting the better of you melmotte has promised to pay the money on friday has he  hes to bring it with him to bruton street  i dont believe a word of itand im sure bideawhile doesnt in what shape will he bring it hell give you a cheque dated on monday and thatll give him two days more and then on monday therell be a note to say the money cant be lodged till wednesday there should be no compromising with such a man you only get from one mess into another i told you neither to do anything or to say anything  i suppose we cant help ourselves now youre to be there on friday i particularly bargained for that it youre there there wont be any more compromising  squercum made one or two further remarks to his client not at all flattering to dollys vanitywhich might have caused offence had not there been such perfectly good feeling between the attorney and the young man as it was dolly replied to everything that was said with increased flattery if i was a sharp fellow like you you know said dolly of course i should get along better but i aint you know it was then settled that they should meet each other and also meet mr longestaffe senior bideawhile and melmotte at twelve oclock on friday morning in bruton street  squercum was by no means satisfied he had busied himself in this matter and had ferreted things out till he had pretty nearly got to the bottom of that affair about the houses in the east and had managed to induce the heirs of the old man who had died to employ him as to the pickering property he had not a doubt on the subject old longestaffe had been induced by promises of wonderful aid and by the bribe of a seat at the board of the south central pacific and mexican railway to give up the titledeeds of the propertyas far as it was in his power to give them up and had endeavoured to induce dolly to do so also as he had failed melmotte had supplemented his work by ingenuity with which the reader is acquainted all this was perfectly clear to squercum who thought that he saw before him a most attractive course of proceeding against the great financier it was pure ambition rather than any hope of lucre that urged him on he regarded melmotte as a grand swindlerperhaps the grandest that the world had ever knownand he could conceive no greater honour than the detection successful prosecution and ultimate destroying of so great a man to have hunted down melmotte would make squercum as great almost as melmotte himself but he felt himself to have been unfairly hampered by his own client he did not believe that the money would be paid but delay might rob him of his melmotte he had heard a good many things in the city and believed it to be quite out of the question that melmotte should raise the moneybut there were various ways in which a man might escape  it may be remembered that croll the german clerk preceded melmotte into the city on wednesday after maries refusal to sign the deeds he too had his eyes open and had perceived that things were not looking as well as they used to look croll had for many years been true to his patron having been upon the whole very well paid for such truth there had been times when things had gone badly with him but he had believed in melmotte and when melmotte rose had been rewarded for his faith mr croll at the present time had little investments of his own not made under his employers auspices which would leave him not absolutely without bread for his family should the melmotte affairs at any time take an awkward turn melmotte had never required from him service that was actually fraudulenthad at any rate never required it by spoken words mr croll had not been overscrupulous and had occasionally been very useful to mr melmotte but there must be a limit to all things and why should any man sacrifice himself beneath the ruins of a falling housewhen convinced that nothing he can do can prevent the fall mr croll would have been of course happy to witness miss melmottes signature but as for that other kind of witnessingthis clearly to his thinking was not the time for such goodnature on his part  you know whats up nowdont you said one of the junior clerks to mr croll when he entered the office in abchurch lane  a good deal will be up soon said the german  cohenlupe has gone  and to vere has mr cohenlupe gone  he hasnt been civil enough to leave his address i fancy he dont want his friends to have to trouble themselves by writing to him nobody seems to know whats become of him  new york suggested mr croll  they seem to think not theyre too hospitable in new york for mr cohenlupe just at present hes travelling private hes on the continent somewherehalf across france by this time but nobody knows what route he has taken thatll be a poke in the ribs for the old boyeh croll croll merely shook his head i wonder what has become of miles grendall continued the clerk  ven de rats is going avay it is bad for de house i like de rats to stay  there seems to have been a regular manufactory of mexican railway scrip  our governor knew noding about dat said croll  he has a hat full of them at any rate if they could have been kept up another fortnight they say cohenlupe would have been worth nearly a million of money and the governor would have been as good as the bank is it true they are going to have him before the lord mayor about the pickering titledeeds croll declared that he knew nothing about the matter and settled himself down to his work  in little more than two hours he was followed by melmotte who thus reached the city late in the afternoon it was he knew too late to raise the money on that day but he hoped that he might pave the way for getting it on the next day which would be thursday of course the first news which he heard was of the defection of mr cohenlupe it was croll who told him he turned back and his jaw fell but at first he said nothing  its a bad thing said mr croll  yesit is bad he had a vast amount of my property in his hands where has he gone croll shook his head it never rains but it pours said melmotte well ill weather it all yet ive been worse than i am now croll as you know and have had a hundred thousand pounds at my bankersloose cashbefore the month was out  yes indeed said croll  but the worst of it is that every one around me is so damnably jealous it isnt what ive lost that will crush me but what men will say that ive lost ever since i began to stand for westminster there has been a dead set against me in the city the whole of that affair of the dinner was plannedplanned by g that it might ruin me it was all laid out just as you would lay the foundation of a building it is hard for one man to stand against all that when he has dealings so large as mine  very hard mr melmotte  but theyll find theyre mistaken yet theres too much of the real stuff croll for them to crush me propertys a kind of thing that comes out right at last its cut and come again you know if the stuff is really there but i mustnt stop talking here i suppose i shall find brehgert in cuthberts court  i should say so mr melmotte mr brehgert never leaves much before six  then mr melmotte took his hat and gloves and the stick that he usually carried and went out with his face carefully dressed in its usually jaunty air but croll as he went heard him mutter the name of cohenlupe between his teeth the part which he had to act is one very difficult to any actor the carrying an external look of indifference when the heart is sinking withinor has sunk almost to the very groundis more than difficult it is an agonizing task in all mental suffering the sufferer longs for solitudefor permission to cast himself loose along the ground so that every limb and every feature of his person may faint in sympathy with his heart a grandly urbane deportment over a crushed spirit and ruined hopes is beyond the physical strength of most menbut there have been men so strong melmotte very nearly accomplished it it was only to the eyes of such a one as herr croll that the failure was perceptible  melmotte did find mr brehgert at this time mr brehgert had completed his correspondence with miss longestaffe in which he had mentioned the probability of great losses from the anticipated commercial failure in mr melmottes affairs he had now heard that mr cohenlupe had gone upon his travels and was therefore nearly sure that his anticipation would be correct nevertheless he received his old friend with a smile when large sums of money are concerned there is seldom much of personal indignation between man and man the loss of fifty pounds or of a few hundreds may create personal wrathbut fifty thousand require equanimity so cohenlupe hasnt been seen in the city today said brehgert  he has gone said melmotte hoarsely  i think i once told you that cohenlupe was not the man for large dealings  yes you did said melmotte  wellit cant be helped can it and what is it now then melmotte explained to mr brehgert what it was that he wanted then taking the various documents out of the bag which throughout the afternoon he had carried in his hand mr brehgert understood enough of his friends affairs and enough of affairs in general to understand readily all that was required he examined the documents declaring as he did so that he did not know how the thing could be arranged by friday melmotte replied that £50000 was not a very large sum of money that the security offered was worth twice as much as that you will leave them with me this evening said brehgert melmotte paused for a moment and said that he would of course do so he would have given much very much to have been sufficiently master of himself to have assented without hesitationbut then the weight within was so very heavy  having left the papers and the bag with mr brehgert he walked westwards to the house of commons he was accustomed to remain in the city later than this often not leaving it till seventhough during the last week or ten days he had occasionally gone down to the house in the afternoon it was now wednesday and there was no evening sittingbut his mind was too full of other things to allow him to remember this as he walked along the embankment his thoughts were very heavy how would things go with himwhat would be the end of it ruinyes but there were worse things than ruin and a short time since he had been so fortunatehad made himself so safe as he looked back at it he could hardly say how it had come to pass that he had been driven out of the track that he had laid down for himself he had known that ruin would come and had made himself so comfortably safe so brilliantly safe in spite of ruin but insane ambition had driven him away from his anchorage he told himself over and over again that the fault had been not in circumstancesnot in that which men call fortunebut in his own incapacity to bear his position he saw it now he felt it now if he could only begin again how different would his conduct be  but of what avail were such regrets as these he must take things as they were now and see that in dealing with them he allowed himself to be carried away neither by pride nor cowardice and if the worst should come to the worst then let him face it like a man there was a certain manliness about him which showed itself perhaps as strongly in his own selfcondemnation as in any other part of his conduct at this time judging of himself as though he were standing outside himself and looking on to another mans work he pointed out to himself his own shortcomings if it were all to be done again he thought that he could avoid this bump against the rocks on one side and that terribly shattering blow on the other there was much that he was ashamed of many a little act which recurred to him vividly in this solitary hour as a thing to be repented of with inner sackcloth and ashes but never once not for a moment did it occur to him that he should repent of the fraud in which his whole life had been passed no idea ever crossed his mind of what might have been the result had he lived the life of an honest man though he was inquiring into himself as closely as he could he never even told himself that he had been dishonest fraud and dishonesty had been the very principle of his life and had so become a part of his blood and bones that even in this extremity of his misery he made no question within himself as to his right judgment in regard to them not to cheat not to be a scoundrel not to live more luxuriously than others by cheating more brilliantly was a condition of things to which his mind had never turned itself in that respect he accused himself of no want of judgment but why had he so unrighteous himself not made friends to himself of the mammon of unrighteousness why had he not conciliated lord mayors why had he trod upon all the corns of all his neighbours why had he been insolent at the india office why had he trusted any man as he had trusted cohenlupe why had he not stuck to abchurch lane instead of going into parliament why had he called down unnecessary notice on his head by entertaining the emperor of china it was too late now and he must bear it but these were the things that had ruined him  he walked into palace yard and across it to the door of westminster abbey before he found out that parliament was not sitting oh wednesday of course it is he said turning round and directing his steps towards grosvenor square then he remembered that in the morning he had declared his purpose of dining at home and now he did not know what better use to make of the present evening his house could hardly be very comfortable to him marie no doubt would keep out of his way and he did not habitually receive much pleasure from his wifes company but in his own house he could at least be alone then as he walked slowly across the park thinking so intently on matters as hardly to observe whether he himself were observed or no he asked himself whether it still might not be best for him to keep the money which was settled on his daughter to tell the longestaffes that he could make no payment and to face the worst that mr squercum could do to himfor he knew already how busy mr squercum was in the matter though they should put him on his trial for forgery what of that he had heard of trials in which the accused criminals had been heroes to the multitude while their cases were in progresswho had been fêted from the beginning to the end though no one had doubted their guilt and who had come out unscathed at the last what evidence had they against him it might be that the longestaffes and bideawhiles and squercums should know that he was a forger but their knowledge would not produce a verdict he as member for westminster as the man who had entertained the emperor as the owner of one of the most gorgeous houses in london as the great melmotte could certainly command the best half of the bar he already felt what popular support might do for him surely there need be no despondency while so good a hope remained to him he did tremble as he remembered dolly longestaffes letter and the letter of the old man who was dead and he knew that it was possible that other things might be adduced but would it not be better to face it all than surrender his money and become a pauper seeing as he did very clearly that even by such surrender he could not cleanse his character  but he had given those forged documents into the hands of mr brehgert again he had acted in a hurrywithout giving sufficient thought to the matter in hand he was angry with himself for that also but how is a man to give sufficient thought to his affairs when no step that he takes can be other than ruinous yeshe had certainly put into brehgerts hands means of proving him to have been absolutely guilty of forgery he did not think that marie would disclaim the signatures even though she had refused to sign the deeds when she should understand that her father had written her name nor did he think that his clerk would be urgent against him as the forgery of crolls name could not injure croll but brehgert should he discover what had been done would certainly not permit him to escape and now he had put these forgeries without any guard into brehgerts hands  he would tell brehgert in the morning that he had changed his mind he would see brehgert before any action could have been taken on the documents and brehgert would no doubt restore them to him then he would instruct his daughter to hold the money fast to sign no paper that should be put before her and to draw the income herself having done that he would let his foes do their worst they might drag him to gaol they probably would do so he had an idea that he could not be admitted to bail if accused of forgery but he would bear all that if convicted he would bear the punishment still hoping that an end might come but how great was the chance that they might fail to convict him as to the dead mans letter and as to dolly longestaffes letter he did not think that any sufficient evidence could be found the evidence as to the deeds by which marie was to have released the property was indeed conclusive but he believed that he might still recover those documents for the present it must be his duty to do nothingwhen he should have recovered and destroyed those documentsand to live before the eyes of men as though he feared nothing  he dined at home alone in the study and after dinner carefully went through various bundles of papers preparing them for the eyes of those ministers of the law who would probably before long have the privilege of searching them at dinner and while he was thus employed he drank a bottle of champagnefeeling himself greatly comforted by the process if he could only hold up his head and look men in the face he thought that he might still live through it all how much had he done by his own unassisted powers he had once been imprisoned for fraud at hamburg and had come out of gaol a pauper friendless with all his wretched antecedents against him now he was a member of the british house of parliament the undoubted owner of perhaps the most gorgeously furnished house in london a man with an established character for high financea commercial giant whose name was a familiar word on all the exchanges of the two hemispheres even though he should be condemned to penal servitude for life he would not all die he rang the bell and desired that madame melmotte might be sent to him and bade the servant bring him brandy  in ten minutes his poor wife came crawling into the room every one connected with melmotte regarded the man with a certain amount of aweevery one except marie to whom alone he had at times been himself almost gentle the servants all feared him and his wife obeyed him implicitly when she could not keep away from him she came in now and stood opposite him while he spoke to her she never sat in his presence in that room he asked her where she and marie kept their jewelryfor during the last twelve months rich trinkets had been supplied to both of them of course she answered by another question is anything going to happen melmotte  a good deal is going to happen are they here in this house or in grosvenor square  they are here  then have them all packed upas small as you can never mind about wool and cases and all that have them close to your hand so that if you have to move you can take them with you do you understand  yes i understand  why dont you speak then  what is going to happen melmotte  how can i tell you ought to know by this time that when a mans work is such as mine things will happen youll be safe enough nothing can hurt you  can they hurt you melmotte  hurt me i dont know what you call hurting whatever there is to be borne i suppose it is i must bear it i have not had it very soft all my life hitherto and i dont think its going to be very soft now  shall we have to move  very likely move whats the harm of moving you talk of moving as though that were the worst thing that could happen how would you like to be in some place where they wouldnt let you move  are they going to send you to prison  hold your tongue  tell me melmotteare they going to then the poor woman did sit down overcome by her feelings  i didnt ask you to come here for a scene said melmotte do as i bid you about your own jewels and maries the thing is to have them in small compass and that you should not have it to do at the last moment when you will be flurried and incapable now you neednt stay any longer and its no good asking any questions because i shant answer them so dismissed the poor woman crept out again and immediately after her own slow fashion went to work with her ornaments  melmotte sat up during the greater part of the night sometimes sipping brandy and water and sometimes smoking but he did no work and hardly touched a paper after his wife left him     chapter lxxxii  maries perseverance   very early the next morning very early that is for london life melmotte was told by a servant that mr croll had called and wanted to see him then it immediately became a question with him whether he wanted to see croll is it anything special he asked the man thought that it was something special as croll had declared his purpose of waiting when told that mr melmotte was not as yet dressed this happened at about nine oclock in the morning melmotte longed to know every detail of crolls mannerto know even the servants opinion of the clerks mannerbut he did not dare to ask a question melmotte thought that it might be well to be gracious ask him if he has breakfasted and if not give him something in the study but mr croll had breakfasted and declined any further refreshment  nevertheless melmotte had not as yet made up his mind that he would meet his clerk his clerk was his clerk it might perhaps be well that he should first go into the city and send word to croll bidding him wait for his return over and over again against his will the question of flying would present itself to him but though he discussed it within his own bosom in every form he knew that he could not fly and if he stood his groundas most assuredly he would do then must he not be afraid to meet any man let the man come with what thunderbolts in his hand he might of course sooner or later some man must come with a thunderboltand why not croll as well as another he stood against a press in his chamber with a razor in his hand and steadied himself how easily might he put an end to it all then he rang his bell and desired that croll might be shown up into his room  the three or four minutes which intervened seemed to him to be very long he had absolutely forgotten in his anxiety that the lather was still upon his face but he could not smother his anxiety he was fighting with it at every turn but he could not conquer it when the knock came at his door he grasped at his own breast as though to support himself with a hoarse voice he told the man to come in and croll himself appeared opening the door gently and very slowly melmotte had left the bag which contained the papers in possession of mr brehgert and he now saw at a glance that croll had got the bag in his hand and could see also by the shape of the bag that the bag contained the papers the man therefore had in his own hands in his own keeping the very documents to which his own name had been forged there was no longer a hope no longer a chance that croll should be ignorant of what had been done well croll he said with an attempt at a smile what brings you here so early he was pale as death and let him struggle as he would could not restrain himself from trembling  herr brehgert vas vid me last night said croll  eh  and he thought i had better bring these back to you thats all croll spoke in a very low voice with his eyes fixed on his masters face but with nothing of a threat in his attitude or manner  eh repeated melmotte even though he might have saved himself from all coming evils by a bold demeanour at that moment he could not assume it but it all flashed upon him at a moment brehgert had seen croll after he melmotte had left the city had then discovered the forgery and had taken this way of sending back all the forged documents he had known brehgert to be of all men who ever lived the most goodnatured but he could hardly believe in pure goodnature such as this it seemed that the thunderbolt was not yet to fall  mr brehgert came to me continued croll because one signature was wanting it was very late so i took them home with me i said id bring them to you in the morning  they both knew that he had forged the documents brehgert and croll but how would that concern him melmotte if these two friends had resolved together that they would not expose him he had desired to get the documents back into his own hands and here they were melmottes immediate trouble arose from the difficulty of speaking in a proper manner to his own servant who had just detected him in forgery he couldnt speak there were no words appropriate to such an occasion it vas a strong order mr melmotte said croll melmotte tried to smile but only grinned i vill not be back in the lane mr melmotte  not back at the office croll  i tink notno de leetle money coming to me you will send it adieu and so mr croll took his final leave of his old master after an intercourse which had lasted twenty years we may imagine that herr croll found his spirits to be oppressed and his capacity for business to be obliterated by his patrons misfortunes rather than by his patrons guilt but he had not behaved unkindly he had merely remarked that the forgery of his own name halfadozen times over was a strong order  melmotte opened the bag and examined the documents one by one it had been necessary that marie should sign her name some halfdozen times and maries father had made all the necessary forgeries it had been of course necessary that each name should be witnessedbut here the forger had scamped his work crolls name he had written five times but one forged signature he had left unattested again he had himself been at fault again he had aided his own ruin by his own carelessness one seems inclined to think sometimes that any fool might do an honest business but fraud requires a man to be alive and wide awake at every turn  melmotte had desired to have the documents back in his own hands and now he had them did it matter much that brehgert and croll both knew the crime which he had committed had they meant to take legal steps against him they would not have returned the forgeries to his own hands brehgert he thought would never tell the taleunless there should arise some most improbable emergency in which he might make money by telling it but he was by no means so sure of croll croll had signified his intention of leaving melmottes service and would therefore probably enter some rival service and thus become an enemy to his late master there could be no reason why croll should keep the secret even if he got no direct profit by telling it he would curry favour by making it known of course croll would tell it  but what harm could the telling of such a secret do him the girl was his own daughter the money had been his own money the man had been his own servant there had been no fraud no robbery no purpose of peculation melmotte as he thought of this became almost proud of what he had done thinking that if the evidence were suppressed the knowledge of the facts could do him no harm but the evidence must be suppressed and with the view of suppressing it he took the little bag and all the papers down with him to the study then he ate his breakfastand suppressed the evidence by the aid of his gas lamp  when this was accomplished he hesitated as to the manner in which he would pass his day he had now given up all idea of raising the money for longestaffe he had even considered the language in which he would explain to the assembled gentlemen on the morrow the fact that a little difficulty still presented itself and that as he could not exactly name a day he must leave the matter in their hands for he had resolved that he would not evade the meeting cohenlupe had gone since he had made his promise and he would throw all the blame on cohenlupe everybody knows that when panics arise the breaking of one merchant causes the downfall of another cohenlupe should bear the burden but as that must be so he could do no good by going into the city his pecuniary downfall had now become too much a matter of certainty to be staved off by his presence and his personal security could hardly be assisted by it there would be nothing for him to do cohenlupe had gone miles grendall had gone croll had gone he could hardly go to cuthberts court and face mr brehgert he would stay at home till it was time for him to go down to the house and then he would face the world there he would dine down at the house and stand about in the smokingroom with his hat on and be visible in the lobbies and take his seat among his brother legislatorsand if it were possible rise on his legs and make a speech to them he was about to have a crushing fallbut the world should say that he had fallen like a man  about eleven his daughter came to him as he sat in the study it can hardly be said that he had ever been kind to marie but perhaps she was the only person who in the whole course of his career had received indulgence at his hands he had often beaten her but he had also often made her presents and smiled on her and in the periods of his opulence had allowed her pocketmoney almost without limit now she had not only disobeyed him but by most perverse obstinacy on her part had driven him to acts of forgery which had already been detected he had cause to be angry now with marie if he had ever had cause for anger but he had almost forgotten the transaction he had at any rate forgotten the violence of his own feelings at the time of its occurrence he was no longer anxious that the release should be made and therefore no longer angry with her for her refusal  papa she said coming very gently into the room i think that perhaps i was wrong yesterday  of course you were wrongbut it doesnt matter now  if you wish it ill sign those papers i dont suppose lord nidderdale means to come any moreand im sure i dont care whether he does or not  what makes you think that marie  i was out last night at lady julia goldsheiners and he was there im sure he doesnt mean to come here any more  was he uncivil to you  oh dear no hes never uncivil but im sure of it never mind how i never told him that i cared for him and i never did care for him papa is there something going to happen  what do you mean  some misfortune oh papa why didnt you let me marry that other man  he is a penniless adventurer  but he would have had this money that i call my money and then there would have been enough for us all papa he would marry me still if you would let him  have you seen him since you went to liverpool  never papa  or heard from him  not a line  then what makes you think he would marry you  he would if i got hold of him and told him and he is a baronet and there would be plenty of money for us all and we could go and live in germany  we could do that just as well without your marrying  but i suppose papa i am to be considered as somebody i dont want after all to run away from london just as if everybody had turned up their noses at me i like him and i dont like anybody else  he wouldnt take the trouble to go to liverpool with you  he got tipsy i know all about that i dont mean to say that hes anything particularly grand i dont know that anybody is very grand hes as good as anybody else  it cant be done marie  why cant it be done  there are a dozen reasons why should my money be given up to him and it is too late there are other things to be thought of now than marriage  you dont want me to sign the papers  noi havent got the papers but i want you to remember that the money is mine and not yours it may be that much may depend on you and that i shall have to trust to you for nearly everything do not let me find myself deceived by my daughter  i wontif youll let me see sir felix carbury once more  then the fathers pride again reasserted itself and he became angry i tell you you little fool that it is out of the question why cannot you believe me has your mother spoken to you about your jewels get them packed up so that you can carry them away in your hand if we have to leave this suddenly you are an idiot to think of that young man as you say i dont know that any of them are very good but among them all he is about the worst go away and do as i bid you  that afternoon the page in welbeck street came up to lady carbury and told her that there was a young lady downstairs who wanted to see sir felix at this time the dominion of sir felix in his mothers house had been much curtailed his latchkey had been surreptitiously taken away from him and all messages brought for him reached his hands through those of his mother the plasters were not removed from his face so that he was still subject to that loss of selfassertion with which we are told that hitherto dominant cocks become afflicted when they have been daubed with mud lady carbury asked sundry questions about the lady suspecting that ruby ruggles of whom she had heard had come to seek her lover the page could give no special description merely saying that the young lady wore a black veil lady carbury directed that the young lady should be shown into her own presenceand marie melmotte was ushered into the room i dare say you dont remember me lady carbury marie said i am marie melmotte  at first lady carbury had not recognized her visitorbut she did so before she replied yes miss melmotte i remember you  yesi am mr melmottes daughter how is your son i hope he is better they told me he had been horribly used by a dreadful man in the street  sit down miss melmotte he is getting better now lady carbury had heard within the last two days from mr broune that it was all over with melmotte broune had declared his very strong belief his thorough conviction that melmotte had committed various forgeries that his speculations had gone so much against him as to leave him a ruined man and in short that the great melmotte bubble was on the very point of bursting everybody says that hell be in gaol before a week is over that was the information which had reached lady carbury about the melmottes only on the previous evening  i want to see him said marie lady carbury hardly knowing what answer to make was silent for a while i suppose he told you everythingdidnt he you know that we were to have been married i loved him very much and so i do still i am not ashamed of coming and telling you  i thought it was all off said lady carbury  i never said so does he say so your daughter came to me and was very good to me i do so love her she said that it was all over but perhaps she was wrong it shant be all over if he will be true  lady carbury was taken greatly by surprise it seemed to her at the moment that this young lady knowing that her own father was ruined was looking out for another home and was doing so with a considerable amount of audacity she gave marie little credit either for affection or for generosity but yet she was unwilling to answer her roughly i am afraid she said that it would not be suitable  why should it not be suitable they cant take my money away there is enough for all of us even if papa wanted to live with usbut it is mine it is ever so muchi dont know how much but a great deal we should be quite rich enough i aint a bit ashamed to come and tell you because we were engaged i know he isnt rich and i should have thought it would be suitable  it then occurred to lady carbury that if this were true the marriage after all might be suitable but how was she to find out whether it was true i understand that your papa is opposed to it she said  yes he isbut papa cant prevent me and papa cant make me give up the money its ever so many thousands a year i know if i can dare to do it why cant he  lady carbury was so beside herself with doubts that she found it impossible to form any decision it would be necessary that she should see mr broune what to do with her son how to bestow him in what way to get rid of him so that in ridding herself of him she might not aid in destroying himthis was the great trouble of her life the burden that was breaking her back now this girl was not only willing but persistently anxious to take her black sheep and to endow himas she declaredwith ever so many thousands a year if the thousands were thereor even an income of a single thousand a yearthen what a blessing would such a marriage be sir felix had already fallen so low that his mother on his behalf would not be justified in declining a connection with the melmottes because the melmottes had fallen to get any niche in the world for him in which he might live with comparative safety would now be to her a heavensent comfort my son is upstairs she said i will go up and speak to him  tell him i am here and that i have said that i will forgive him everything and that i love him still and that if he will be true to me i will be true to him  i couldnt go down to her said sir felix with my face all in this way  i dont think she would mind that  i couldnt do it besides i dont believe about her money i never did believe it that was the real reason why i didnt go to liverpool  i think i would see her if i were you felix we could find out to a certainty about her fortune it is evident at any rate that she is very fond of you  whats the use of that if he is ruined he would not go down to see the girlbecause he could not endure to expose his face and was ashamed of the wounds which he had received in the street as regarded the money he halfbelieved and halfdisbelieved maries story but the fruition of the money if it were within his reach would be far off and to be attained with much trouble whereas the nuisance of a scene with marie would be immediate how could he kiss his future bride with his nose bound up with a bandage  what shall i say to her asked his mother  she oughtnt to have come i should tell her just that you might send the maid to her to tell her that you couldnt see her again  but lady carbury could not treat the girl after that fashion she returned to the drawingroom descending the stairs very slowly and thinking what answer she would make miss melmotte she said my son feels that everything has been so changed since he and you last met that nothing can be gained by a renewal of your acquaintance  that is his messageis it lady carbury remained silent then he is indeed all that they have told me and i am ashamed that i should have loved him i am ashamednot of coming here although you will think that i have run after him i dont see why a girl should not run after a man if they have been engaged together but im ashamed of thinking so much of so mean a person goodbye lady carbury  goodbye miss melmotte i dont think you should be angry with me  nono i am not angry with you you can forget me now as soon as you please and i will try to forget him  then with a rapid step she walked back to bruton street going round by grosvenor square and in front of her old house on the way what should she now do with herself what sort of life should she endeavour to prepare for herself the life that she had led for the last year had been thoroughly wretched the poverty and hardship which she remembered in her early days had been more endurable the servitude to which she had been subjected before she had learned by intercourse with the world to assert herself had been preferable in these days of her grandeur in which she had danced with princes and seen an emperor in her fathers house and been affianced to lords she had encountered degradation which had been abominable to her she had really lovedbut had found out that her golden idol was made of the basest clay she had then declared to herself that bad as the clay was she would still love itbut even the clay had turned away from her and had refused her love  she was well aware that some catastrophe was about to happen to her father catastrophes had happened before and she had been conscious of their coming but now the blow would be a very heavy blow they would again be driven to pack up and move and seek some other city probably in some very distant part but go where she might she would now be her own mistress that was the one resolution she succeeded in forming before she reentered the house in bruton street     chapter lxxxiii  melmotte again at the house   on that thursday afternoon it was known everywhere that there was to be a general ruin of all the melmotte affairs as soon as cohenlupe had gone no man doubted the city men who had not gone to the dinner prided themselves on their foresight as did also the politicians who had declined to meet the emperor of china at the table of the suspected financier they who had got up the dinner and had been instrumental in taking the emperor to the house in grosvenor square and they also who had brought him forward at westminster and had fought his battle for him were aware that they would have to defend themselves against heavy attacks no one now had a word to say in his favour or a doubt as to his guilt the grendalls had retired altogether out of town and were no longer even heard of lord alfred had not been seen since the day of the dinner the duchess of albury too went into the country some weeks earlier than usual quelled as the world said by the general melmotte failure but this departure had not as yet taken place at the time at which we have now arrived  when the speaker took his seat in the house soon after four oclock there were a great many members present and a general feeling prevailed that the world was more than ordinarily alive because of melmotte and his failures it had been confidently asserted throughout the morning that he would be put upon his trial for forgery in reference to the purchase of the pickering property from mr longestaffe and it was known that he had not as yet shown himself anywhere on this day people had gone to look at the house in grosvenor squarenot knowing that he was still living in mr longestaffes house in bruton street and had come away with the impression that the desolation of ruin and crime was already plainly to be seen upon it i wonder where he is said mr lupton to mr beauchamp beauclerk in one of the lobbies of the house  they say he hasnt been in the city all day i suppose hes in longestaffes house that poor fellow has got it heavy all round the man has got his place in the country and his house in town theres nidderdale i wonder what he thinks about it all  this is awfulaint it said nidderdale  it might have been worse i should say as far as you are concerned replied mr lupton  well yes but ill tell you what lupton i dont quite understand it all yet our lawyer said three days ago that the money was certainly there  and cohenlupe was certainly here three days ago said luptonbut he isnt here now it seems to me that it has just happened in time for you lord nidderdale shook his head and tried to look very grave  theres brown said sir orlando drought hurrying up to the commercial gentleman whose mistakes about finance mr melmotte on a previous occasion had been anxious to correct hell be able to tell us where he is it was rumoured you know an hour ago that he was off to the continent after cohenlupe but mr brown shook his head mr brown didnt know anything but mr brown was very strongly of opinion that the police would know all that there was to be known about mr melmotte before this time on the following day mr brown had been very bitter against melmotte since that memorable attack made upon him in the house  even ministers as they sat to be badgered by the ordinary questionmongers of the day were more intent upon melmotte than upon their own defence do you know anything about it asked the chancellor of the exchequer of the secretary of state for the home department  i understand that no order has been given for his arrest there is a general opinion that he has committed forgery but i doubt whether theyve got their evidence together  hes a ruined man i suppose said the chancellor i doubt whether he ever was a rich man but ill tell you whathe has been about the grandest rogue weve seen yet he must have spent over a hundred thousand pounds during the last twelve months on his personal expenses i wonder how the emperor will like it when he learns the truth another minister sitting close to the secretary of state was of opinion that the emperor of china would not care half so much about it as our own first lord of the treasury  at this moment there came a silence over the house which was almost audible they who know the sensation which arises from the continued hum of many suppressed voices will know also how plain to the ear is the feeling caused by the discontinuance of the sound everybody looked up but everybody looked up in perfect silence an undersecretary of state had just got upon his legs to answer a most indignant question as to an alteration of the colour of the facings of a certain regiment his prepared answer to which however was so happy as to allow him to anticipate quite a little triumph it is not often that such a godsend comes in the way of an undersecretary and he was intent upon his performance but even he was startled into momentary oblivion of his wellarranged point augustus melmotte the member for westminster was walking up the centre of the house  he had succeeded by this time in learning so much of the forms of the house as to know what to do with his hatwhen to wear it and when to take it offand how to sit down as he entered by the door facing the speaker he wore his hat on the side of his head as was his custom much of the arrogance of his appearance had come from this habit which had been adopted probably from a conviction that it added something to his powers of selfassertion at this moment he was more determined than ever that no one should trace in his outer gait or in any feature of his face any sign of that ruin which as he well knew all men were anticipating therefore perhaps his hat was a little more cocked than usual and the lapels of his coat were thrown back a little wider displaying the large jewelled studs which he wore in his shirt and the arrogance conveyed by his mouth and chin was specially conspicuous he had come down in his brougham and as he had walked up westminster hall and entered the house by the private door of the members and then made his way in across the great lobby and between the doorkeepersno one had spoken a word to him he had of course seen many whom he had known he had indeed known nearly all whom he had seenbut he had been aware from the beginning of this enterprise of the day that men would shun him and that he must bear their cold looks and colder silence without seeming to notice them he had schooled himself to the task and he was now performing it it was not only that he would have to move among men without being noticed but that he must endure to pass the whole evening in the same plight but he was resolved and he was now doing it he bowed to the speaker with more than usual courtesy raising his hat with more than usual care and seated himself as usual on the third oppositionbench but with more than his usual fling he was a big man who always endeavoured to make an effect by deportment and was therefore customarily conspicuous in his movements he was desirous now of being as he was always neither more nor less demonstrativebut as a matter of course he exceeded and it seemed to those who looked at him that there was a special impudence in the manner in which he walked up the house and took his seat the undersecretary of state who was on his legs was struck almost dumb and his morsel of wit about the facings was lost to parliament for ever  that unfortunate young man lord nidderdale occupied the seat next to that on which melmotte had placed himself it had so happened three or four times since melmotte had been in the house as the young lord fully intending to marry the financiers daughter had resolved that he would not be ashamed of his fatherinlaw he understood that countenance of the sort which he as a young aristocrat could give to the man of millions who had risen no one knew whence was part of the bargain in reference to the marriage and he was gifted with a mingled honesty and courage which together made him willing and able to carry out his idea he had given melmotte little lessons as to ordinary forms of the house and had done what in him lay to earn the money which was to be forthcoming but it had become manifest both to him and to his father during the last two daysvery painfully manifest to his fatherthat the thing must be abandoned and if sothen why should he be any longer gracious to melmotte and moreover though he had been ready to be courteous to a very vulgar and a very disagreeable man he was not anxious to extend his civilities to one who as he was now assured had been certainly guilty of forgery but to get up at once and leave his seat because melmotte had placed himself by his side did not suit the turn of his mind he looked round to his neighbour on the right with a halfcomic look of misery and then prepared himself to bear his punishment whatever it might be  have you been up with marie today said melmotte  noive not replied the lord  why dont you go shes always asking about you now i hope we shall be in our own house again next week and then we shall be able to make you comfortable  could it be possible that the man did not know that all the world was united in accusing him of forgery ill tell you what it is said nidderdale i think you had better see my governor again mr melmotte  theres nothing wrong i hope  welli dont know youd better see him im going now i only just came down to enter an appearance he had to cross melmotte on his way out and as he did so melmotte grasped him by the hand good night my boy said melmotte quite aloudin a voice much louder than that which members generally allow themselves for conversation nidderdale was confused and unhappy but there was probably not a man in the house who did not understand the whole thing he rushed down through the gangway and out through the doors with a hurried step and as he escaped into the lobby he met lionel lupton who since his little conversation with mr beauclerk had heard further news  you know what has happened nidderdale  about melmotte you mean  yes about melmotte continued lupton he has been arrested in his own house within the last halfhour on a charge of forgery  i wish he had said nidderdale with all my heart if you go in youll find him sitting there as large as life he has been talking to me as though everything were all right  compton was here not a moment ago and said that he had been taken under a warrant from the lord mayor  the lord mayor is a member and had better come and fetch his prisoner himself at any rate hes there i shouldnt wonder if he wasnt on his legs before long  melmotte kept his seat steadily till seven at which hour the house adjourned till nine he was one of the last to leave and then with a slow stepwith almost majestic stepshe descended to the diningroom and ordered his dinner there were many men there and some little difficulty about a seat no one was very willing to make room for him but at last he secured a place almost jostling some unfortunate who was there before him it was impossible to expel himalmost as impossible to sit next him even the waiters were unwilling to serve himbut with patience and endurance he did at last get his dinner he was there in his right as a member of the house of commons and there was no ground on which such service as he required could be refused to him it was not long before he had the table all to himself but of this he took no apparent notice he spoke loudly to the waiters and drank his bottle of champagne with much apparent enjoyment since his friendly intercourse with nidderdale no one had spoken to him nor had he spoken to any man they who watched him declared among themselves that he was happy in his own audacitybut in truth he was probably at that moment the most utterly wretched man in london he would have better studied his personal comfort had he gone to his bed and spent his evening in groans and wailings but even he with all the world now gone from him with nothing before him but the extremest misery which the indignation of offended laws could inflict was able to spend the last moments of his freedom in making a reputation at any rate for audacity it was thus that augustus melmotte wrapped his toga around him before his death  he went from the diningroom to the smokingroom and there taking from his pocket a huge case which he always carried proceeded to light a cigar about eight inches long mr brown from the city was in the room and melmotte with a smile and a bow offered mr brown one of the same mr brown was a short fat round little man over sixty who was always endeavouring to give to a somewhat commonplace set of features an air of importance by the contraction of his lips and the knitting of his brows it was as good as a play to see mr brown jumping back from any contact with the wicked one and putting on a double frown as he looked at the impudent sinner you neednt think so much you know of what i said the other night i didnt mean any offence so spoke melmotte and then laughed with a loud hoarse laugh looking round upon the assembled crowd as though he were enjoying his triumph  he sat after that and smoked in silence once again he burst out into a laugh as though peculiarly amused with his own thoughtsas though he were declaring to himself with much inward humour that all these men around him were fools for believing the stories which they had heard but he made no further attempt to speak to any one soon after nine he went back again into the house and again took his old place at this time he had swallowed three glasses of brandy and water as well as the champagne and was brave enough almost for anything there was some debate going on in reference to the game lawsa subject on which melmotte was as ignorant as one of his housemaidsbut as some speaker sat down he jumped up to his legs another gentleman had also risen and when the house called to that other gentleman melmotte gave way the other gentleman had not much to say and in a few minutes melmotte was again on his legs who shall dare to describe the thoughts which would cross the august mind of a speaker of the house of commons at such a moment of melmottes villainy he had no official knowledge and even could he have had such knowledge it was not for him to act upon it the man was a member of the house and as much entitled to speak as another but it seemed on that occasion that the speaker was anxious to save the house from disgracefor twice and thrice he refused to have his eye caught by the member for westminster as long as any other member would rise he would not have his eye caught but melmotte was persistent and determined not to be put down at last no one else would speak and the house was about to negative the motion without a divisionwhen melmotte was again on his legs still persisting the speaker scowled at him and leaned back in his chair melmotte standing erect turning his head round from one side of the house to another as though determined that all should see his audacity propping himself with his knees against the seat before him remained for half a minute perfectly silent he was drunkbut better able than most drunken men to steady himself and showing in his face none of those outward signs of intoxication by which drunkenness is generally made apparent but he had forgotten in his audacity that words are needed for the making of a speech and now he had not a word at his command he stumbled forward recovered himself then looked once more round the house with a glance of anger and after that toppled headlong over the shoulders of mr beauchamp beauclerk who was sitting in front of him  he might have wrapped his toga around him better perhaps had he remained at home but if to have himself talked about was his only object he could hardly have taken a surer course the scene as it occurred was one very likely to be remembered when the performer should have been carried away into enforced obscurity there was much commotion in the house mr beauclerk a man of natural good nature though at the moment put to considerable personal inconvenience hastened when he recovered his own equilibrium to assist the drunken man but melmotte had by no means lost the power of helping himself he quickly recovered his legs and then reseating himself put his hat on and endeavoured to look as though nothing special had occurred the house resumed its business taking no further notice of melmotte and having no special rule of its own as to the treatment to be adopted with drunken members but the member for westminster caused no further inconvenience he remained in his seat for perhaps ten minutes and then not with a very steady step but still with capacity sufficient for his own guidance he made his way down to the doors his exit was watched in silence and the moment was an anxious one for the speaker the clerks and all who were near him had he fallen some oneor rather some two or threemust have picked him up and carried him out but he did not fall either there or in the lobbies or on his way down to palace yard many were looking at him but none touched him when he had got through the gates leaning against the wall he hallooed for his brougham and the servant who was waiting for him soon took him home to bruton street that was the last which the british parliament saw of its new member for westminster  melmotte as soon as he reached home got into his own sittingroom without difficulty and called for more brandy and water between eleven and twelve he was left there by his servant with a bottle of brandy three or four bottles of sodawater and his cigarcase neither of the ladies of the family came to him nor did he speak of them nor was he so drunk then as to give rise to any suspicion in the mind of the servant he was habitually left there at night and the servant as usual went to his bed but at nine oclock on the following morning the maidservant found him dead upon the floor drunk as he had beenmore drunk as he probably became during the nightstill he was able to deliver himself from the indignities and penalties to which the law might have subjected him by a dose of prussic acid     chapter lxxxiv  paul montagues vindication   it is hoped that the reader need hardly be informed that hetta carbury was a very miserable young woman as soon as she decided that duty compelled her to divide herself altogether from paul montague i think that she was irrational but to her it seemed that the offence against herselfthe offence against her own dignity as a womanwas too great to be forgiven there can be no doubt that it would all have been forgiven with the greatest ease had paul told the story before it had reached her ears from any other source had he said to herwhen her heart was softest towards himi once loved another woman and that woman is here now in london a trouble to me persecuting me and her history is so and so and the history of my love for her was after this fashion and the history of my declining love is after that fashion and of this at any rate you may be sure that this woman has never been near my heart from the first moment in which i saw youhad he told it to her thus there would not have been an opening for anger and he doubtless would have so told it had not hettas brother interfered too quickly he was then forced to exculpate himself to confess rather than to tell his own storyand to admit facts which wore the air of having been concealed and which had already been conceived to be altogether damning if true it was that journey to lowestoft not yet a month old which did the mischiefa journey as to which hetta was not slow in understanding all that roger carbury had thought about it though roger would say nothing of it to herself paul had been staying at the seaside with this woman in amicable intimacythis horrid womanin intimacy worse than amicable and had been visiting her daily at islington hetta felt quite sure that he had never passed a day without going there since the arrival of the woman and everybody would know what that meant and during this very hour he had beenwell perhaps not exactly making love to herself but looking at her and talking to her and behaving to her in a manner such as could not but make her understand that he intended to make love to her of course they had really understood it since they had met at madame melmottes first ball when she had made a plea that she could not allow herself to dance with him more thansay halfadozen times of course she had not intended him then to know that she would receive his love with favour but equally of course she had known that he must so feel it she had not only told herself but had told her mother that her heart was given away to this man and yet the man during this very time was spending his hours with awoman with a strange american woman to whom he acknowledged that he had been once engaged how could she not quarrel with him how could she refrain from telling him that everything must be over between them everybody was against himher mother her brother and her cousin and she felt that she had not a word to say in his defence a horrid woman a wretched bad bold american intriguing woman it was terrible to her that a friend of hers should ever have attached himself to such a creaturebut that he should have come to her with a second tale of love long long before he had cleared himself from the firstperhaps with no intention of clearing himself from the first of course she could not forgive him noshe would never forgive him she would break her heart for him that was a matter of course but she would never forgive him she knew well what it was that her mother wanted her mother thought that by forcing her into a quarrel with montague she would force her also into a marriage with roger carbury but her mother would find out that in that she was mistaken she would never marry her cousin though she would be always ready to acknowledge his worth she was sure now that she would never marry any man as she made this resolve she had a wicked satisfaction in feeling that it would be a trouble to her motherfor though she was altogether in accord with lady carbury as to the iniquities of paul montague she was not the less angry with her mother for being so ready to expose those iniquities  oh with what slow cautious fingers with what heartbroken tenderness did she take out from its guardian case the brooch which paul had given her it had as yet been an only present and in thanking him for it which she had done with full freespoken words of love she had begged him to send her no other so that that might ever be to herto her dying daythe one precious thing that had been given to her by her lover while she was yet a girl now it must be sent backand no doubt it would go to that abominable woman but her fingers lingered over it as she touched it and she would fain have kissed it had she not told herself that she would have been disgraced even in her solitude by such a demonstration of affection she had given her answer to paul montague and as she would have no further personal correspondence with him she took the brooch to her mother with a request that it might be returned  of course my dear i will send it back to him is there nothing else  no mammanothing else i have no letters and no other present you always knew everything that took place if you will just send that back to himwithout a word you wont say anything will you mamma  there is nothing for me to say if you have really made him understand you  i think he understood me mamma you need not doubt about that  he has behaved very very badlyfrom the beginning said lady carbury  but hetta did not really think that the young man had behaved very badly from the beginning and certainly did not wish to be told of his misbehaviour no doubt she thought that the young man had behaved very well in falling in love with her directly he saw heronly that he had behaved so badly in taking mrs hurtle to lowestoft afterwards its no good talking about that mamma i hope you will never talk of him any more  he is quite unworthy said lady carbury  i cant bear tohave himabused said hetta sobbing  my dear hetta i have no doubt this has made you for the time unhappy such little accidents do make people unhappyfor the time but it will be much for the best that you should endeavour not to be so sensitive about it the world is too rough and too hard for people to allow their feelings full play you have to look out for the future and you can best do so by resolving that paul montague shall be forgotten at once  oh mamma dont how is a person to resolve oh mamma dont say any more  but my dear there is more that i must say your future life is before you and i must think of it and you must think of it of course you must be married  there is no of course at all  of course you must be married continued lady carbury and of course it is your duty to think of the way in which this may be best done my income is becoming less and less every day i already owe money to your cousin and i owe money to mr broune  money to mr broune  yesto mr broune i had to pay a sum for felix which mr broune told me ought to be paid and i owe money to tradesmen i fear that i shall not be able to keep on this house and they tell meyour cousin and mr brounethat it is my duty to take felix out of london probably abroad  of course i shall go with you  it may be so at first but perhaps even that may not be necessary why should you what pleasure could you have in it think what my life must be with felix in some french or german town  mamma why dont you let me be a comfort to you why do you speak of me always as though i were a burden  everybody is a burden to other people it is the way of life but youif you will only yield in ever so littleyou may go where you will be no burden where you will be accepted simply as a blessing you have the opportunity of securing comfort for your whole life and of making a friend not only for yourself but for me and your brother of one whose friendship we cannot fail to want  mamma you cannot really mean to talk about that now  why should i not mean it what is the use of indulging in highflown nonsense make up your mind to be the wife of your cousin roger  this is horrid said hetta bursting out in her agony cannot you understand that i am brokenhearted about paul that i love him from my very soul that parting from him is like tearing my heart in pieces i know that i must because he has behaved so very badlyand because of that wicked woman and so i have but i did not think that in the very next hour you would bid me give myself to somebody else i will never marry roger carbury you may be quitequite sure that i shall never marry any one if you wont take me with you when you go away with felix i must stay behind and try and earn my bread i suppose i could go out as a nurse then without waiting for a reply she left the room and betook herself to her own apartment  lady carbury did not even understand her daughter she could not conceive that she had in any way acted unkindly in taking the opportunity of montagues rejection for pressing the suit of the other lover she was simply anxious to get a husband for her daughteras she had been anxious to get a wife for her sonin order that her child might live comfortably but she felt that whenever she spoke common sense to hetta her daughter took it as an offence and flew into tantrums being altogether unable to accommodate herself to the hard truths of the world deep as was the sorrow which her son brought upon her and great as was the disgrace she could feel more sympathy for him than for the girl if there was anything that she could not forgive in life it was romance and yet she at any rate believed that she delighted in romantic poetry at the present moment she was very wretched and was certainly unselfish in her wish to see her daughter comfortably settled before she commenced those miserable roamings with her son which seemed to be her coming destiny  in these days she thought a good deal of mr brounes offer and of her own refusal it was odd that since that refusal she had seen more of him and had certainly known much more of him than she had ever seen or known before previous to that little episode their intimacy had been very fictitious as are many intimacies they had played at being friends knowing but very little of each other but now during the last five or six weekssince she had refused his offer they had really learned to know each other in the exquisite misery of her troubles she had told him the truth about herself and her son and he had responded not by compliments but by real aid and true counsel his whole tone was altered to her as was hers to him there was no longer any egregious flattery between themand he in speaking to her would be almost rough to her once he had told her that she would be a fool if she did not do so and so the consequence was that she almost regretted that she had allowed him to escape but she certainly made no effort to recover the lost prize for she told him all her troubles it was on that afternoon after her disagreement with her daughter that marie melmotte came to her and on the same evening closeted with mr broune in her back room she told him of both occurrences if the girl has got the money she began regretting her sons obstinacy  i dont believe a bit of it said broune from all that i can hear i dont think that there is any money and if there is you may be sure that melmotte would not let it slip through his fingers in that way i would not have anything to do with it  you think it is all over with the melmottes  a rumour reached me just now that he had been already arrested it was now between nine and ten in the evening but as i came away from my room i heard that he was down at the house that he will have to stand a trial for forgery i think there cannot be a doubt and i imagine that it will be found that not a shilling will be saved out of the property  what a wonderful career it has been  yesthe strangest thing that has come up in our days i am inclined to think that the utter ruin at this moment has been brought about by his reckless personal expenditure  why did he spend such a lot of money  because he thought he could conquer the world by it and obtain universal credit he very nearly succeeded too only he had forgotten to calculate the force of the envy of his competitors  you think he has committed forgery  certainly i think so of course we know nothing as yet  then i suppose it is better that felix should not have married her  certainly better no redemption was to have been had on that side and i dont think you should regret the loss of such money as his lady carbury shook her head meaning probably to imply that even melmottes money would have had no bad odour to one so dreadfully in want of assistance as her son at any rate do not think of it any more then she told him her grief about hetta ah there said he i feel myself less able to express an authoritative opinion  he doesnt owe a shilling said lady carbury and he is really a fine gentleman  but if she doesnt like him  oh but she does she thinks him to be the finest person in the world she would obey him a great deal sooner than she would me but she has her mind stuffed with nonsense about love  a great many people lady carbury have their minds stuffed with that nonsense  yesand ruin themselves with it as she will do love is like any other luxury you have no right to it unless you can afford it and those who will have it when they cant afford it will come to the ground like this mr melmotte how odd it seems it isnt a fortnight since we all thought him the greatest man in london mr broune only smiled not thinking it worth his while to declare that he had never held that opinion about the late idol of abchurch lane  on the following morning very early while melmotte was still lying as yet undiscovered on the floor of mr longestaffes room a letter was brought up to hetta by the maidservant who told her that mr montague had delivered it with his own hands she took it greedily and then repressing herself put it with an assumed gesture of indifference beneath her pillow but as soon as the girl had left the room she at once seized her treasure it never occurred to her as yet to think whether she would or would not receive a letter from her dismissed lover she had told him that he must go and go for ever and had taken it for granted that he would do soprobably willingly no doubt he would be delighted to return to the american woman but now that she had the letter she allowed no doubt to come between her and the reading of it as soon as she was alone she opened it and she ran through its contents without allowing herself a moment for thinking as she went on whether the excuses made by her lover were or were not such as she ought to accept      dearest hetta     i think you have been most unjust to me and if you have ever    loved me i cannot understand your injustice i have never    deceived you in anything not by a word or for a moment unless    you mean to throw me over because i did once love another woman    i do not know what cause of anger you have i could not tell you    about mrs hurtle till you had accepted me and as you yourself    must know i had had no opportunity to tell you anything    afterwards till the story had reached your ears i hardly know    what i said the other day i was so miserable at your    accusation but i suppose i said then and i again declare now    that i had made up my mind that circumstances would not admit of    her becoming my wife before i had ever seen you and that i have    certainly never wavered in my determination since i saw you i    can with safety refer to roger as to this because i was with    him when i so determined and made up my mind very much at his    instance this was before i had ever even met you     if i understand it all right you are angry because i have    associated with mrs hurtle since i so determined i am not going    back to my first acquaintance with her now you may blame me for    that if you pleasethough it cannot have been a fault against    you but after what had occurred was i to refuse to see her    when she came to england to see me i think that would have been    cowardly of course i went to her and when she was all alone    here without a single other friend and telling me that she was    unwell and asking me to take her down to the seaside was i to    refuse i think that that would have been unkind it was a    dreadful trouble to me but of course i did it     she asked me to renew my engagement i am bound to tell you    that but i know in telling you that it will go no farther i    declined telling her that it was my purpose to ask another    woman to be my wife of course there has been anger and    sorrowanger on her part and sorrow on mine but there has    been no doubt and at last she yielded as far as she was    concerned my trouble was over except in so far that her    unhappiness has been a great trouble to mewhen on a sudden    i found that the story had reached you in such a form as to make    you determined to quarrel with me     of course you do not know it all for i cannot tell you all    without telling her history but you know everything that in the    least concerns yourself and i do say that you have no cause    whatever for anger i am writing at night this evening your    brooch was brought to me with three or four cutting words from    your mother but i cannot understand that if you really love me    you should wish to separate yourself from meor that if you    ever loved me you should cease to love me now because of mrs    hurtle     i am so absolutely confused by the blow that i hardly know what    i am writing and take first one outrageous idea into my head    and then another my love for you is so thorough and so intense    that i cannot bring myself to look forward to living without    you now that you have once owned that you have loved me i    cannot think it possible that love such as i suppose yours must    have been could be made to cease all at a moment mine cant i    dont think it is natural that we should be parted     if you want corroboration of my story go yourself to mrs hurtle    anything is better than that we both should be brokenhearted     yours most affectionately     paul montague     chapter lxxxv  breakfast in berkeley square   lord nidderdale was greatly disgusted with his own part of the performance when he left the house of commons and was we may say disgusted with his own position generally when he considered all its circumstances that had been at the commencement of the evening and melmotte had not then been tipsy but he had behaved with unsurpassable arrogance and vulgarity and had made the young lord drink the cup of his own disgrace to the very dregs everybody now knew it as a positive fact that the charges made against the man were to become matter of investigation before the chief magistrate for the city everybody knew that he had committed forgery upon forgery everybody knew that he could not pay for the property which he had pretended to buy and that actually he was a ruined manand yet he had seized nidderdale by the hand and called the young lord his dear boy before the whole house  and then he had made himself conspicuous as this mans advocate if he had not himself spoken openly of his coming marriage with the girl he had allowed other men to speak to him about it he had quarrelled with one man for saying that melmotte was a rogue and had confidentially told his most intimate friends that in spite of a little vulgarity of manner melmotte at bottom was a very good fellow how was he now to back out of his intimacy with the melmottes generally he was engaged to marry the girl and there was nothing of which he could accuse her he acknowledged to himself that she deserved well at his hands though at this moment he hated the father most bitterly as those odious words and the tone in which they had been pronounced rang in his ears nevertheless he had some kindly feeling for the girl of course he could not marry her now that was manifestly out of the question she herself as well as all others had known that she was to be married for her money and now that bubble had been burst but he felt that he owed it to her as to a comrade who had on the whole been loyal to him to have some personal explanation with herself he arranged in his own mind the sort of speech that he would make to her of course you know it cant be it was all arranged because you were to have a lot of money and now it turns out that you havent got any and i havent got any and we should have nothing to live upon its out of the question but upon my word im very sorry for i like you very much and i really think we should have got on uncommon well together that was the kind of speech that he suggested to himself but he did not know how to find for himself the opportunity of making it he thought that he must put it all into a letter but then that would be tantamount to a written confession that he had made her an offer of marriage and he feared that melmotteor madame melmotte on his behalf if the great man himself were absent in prisonmight make an ungenerous use of such an admission  between seven and eight he went into the beargarden and there he saw dolly longestaffe and others everybody was talking about melmotte the prevailing belief being that he was at this moment in custody dolly was full of his own griefs but consoled amidst them by a sense of his own importance i wonder whether its true he was saying to lord grasslough he has an appointment to meet me and my governor at twelve oclock tomorrow and to pay us what he owes us he swore yesterday that he would have the money tomorrow but he cant keep his appointment you know if hes in prison  you wont see the money dolly you may swear to that said grasslough  i dont suppose i shall by george what an ass my governor has been he had no more right than you have to give up the property heres nidderdale he could tell us where he is but im afraid to speak to him since he cut up so rough the other night  in a moment the conversation was stopped but when lord grasslough asked nidderdale in a whisper whether he knew anything about melmotte the latter answered out loud yes i left him in the house half an hour ago  people are saying that he has been arrested  i heard that also but he certainly had not been arrested when i left the house then he went up and put his hand on dolly longestaffes shoulder and spoke to him i suppose you were about right the other night and i was about wrong but you could understand what it was that i meant im afraid this is a bad look out for both of us  yesi understand its deuced bad for me said dolly i think youre very well out of it but im glad theres not to be a quarrel suppose we have a rubber of whist  later on in the night news was brought to the club that melmotte had tried to make a speech in the house that he had been very drunk and that he had tumbled over upsetting beauchamp beauclerk in his fall by george i should like to have seen that said dolly  i am very glad i was not there said nidderdale it was three oclock before they left the card table at which time melmotte was lying dead upon the floor in mr longestaffes house  on the following morning at ten oclock lord nidderdale sat at breakfast with his father in the old lords house in berkeley square from thence the house which melmotte had hired was not above a few hundred yards distant at this time the young lord was living with his father and the two had now met by appointment in order that something might be settled between them as to the proposed marriage the marquis was not a very pleasant companion when the affairs in which he was interested did not go exactly as he would have them he could be very cross and say most disagreeable wordsso that the ladies of the family and others connected with him for the most part found it impossible to live with him but his eldest son had endured him partly perhaps because being the eldest he had been treated with a nearer approach to courtesy but chiefly by means of his own extreme good humour what did a few hard words matter if his father was ungracious to him of course he knew what all that meant as long as his father would make fair allowance for his own peccadilloeshe also would make allowances for his fathers roughness all this was based on his grand theory of live and let live he expected his father to be a little cross on this occasion and he acknowledged to himself that there was cause for it  he was a little late himself and he found his father already buttering his toast i dont believe youd get out of bed a moment sooner than you liked if you could save the whole property by it  you show me how i can make a guinea by it sir and see if i dont earn the money then he sat down and poured himself out a cup of tea and looked at the kidneys and looked at the fish  i suppose you were drinking last night said the old lord  not particular the old man turned round and gnashed his teeth at him the fact is sir i dont drink everybody knows that  i know when youre in the country you cant live without champagne wellwhat have you got to say about all this  what have you got to say  youve made a pretty kettle of fish of it  ive been guided by you in everything come now you ought to own that i suppose the whole thing is over  i dont see why it should be over im told she has got her own money then nidderdale described to his father melmottes behaviour in the house on the preceding evening what the devil does that matter said the old man youre not going to marry the man himself  i shouldnt wonder if hes in gaol now  and what does that matter shes not in gaol and if the money is hers she cant lose it because he goes to prison beggars mustnt be choosers how do you mean to live if you dont marry this girl  i shall scrape on i suppose i must look for somebody else the marquis showed very plainly by his demeanour that he did not give his son much credit either for diligence or for ingenuity in making such a search at any rate sir i cant marry the daughter of a man who is to be put upon his trial for forgery  i cant see what that has to do with you  i couldnt do it sir id do anything else to oblige you but i couldnt do that and moreover i dont believe in the money  then you may just go to the devil said the old marquis turning himself round in his chair and lighting a cigar as he took up the newspaper nidderdale went on with his breakfast with perfect equanimity and when he had finished lighted his cigar they tell me said the old man that one of those goldsheiner girls will have a lot of money  a jewess suggested nidderdale  what difference does that make  oh nonot in the least if the moneys really there have you heard any sum named sir  the old man only grunted there are two sisters and two brothers i dont suppose the girls would have a hundred thousand each  they say the widow of that brewer who died the other day has about twenty thousand a year  its only for her life sir  she could insure her life d me sir we must do something if you turn up your nose at one woman after another how do you mean to live  i dont think that a woman of forty with only a life interest would be a good speculation of course ill think of it if you press it the old man growled again you see sir ive been so much in earnest about this girl that i havent thought of inquiring about any one else there always is some one up with a lot of money its a pity there shouldnt be a regular statement published with the amount of money and what is expected in return itd save a deal of trouble  if you cant talk more seriously than that youd better go away said the old marquis  at that moment a footman came into the room and told lord nidderdale that a man particularly wished to see him in the hall he was not always anxious to see those who called on him and he asked the servant whether he knew who the man was i believe my lord hes one of the domestics from mr melmottes in bruton street said the footman who was no doubt fully acquainted with all the circumstances of lord nidderdales engagement the son who was still smoking looked at his father as though in doubt youd better go and see said the marquis but nidderdale before he went asked a question as to what he had better do if melmotte had sent for him go and see melmotte why should you be afraid to see him tell him you are ready to marry the girl if you can see the money down but that you wont stir a step till it has been actually paid over  he knows that already said nidderdale as he left the room  in the hall he found a man whom he recognized as melmottes butler a ponderous elderly heavy man who now had a letter in his hand but the lord could tell by the mans face and manner that he himself had some story to tell is there anything the matter  yes my lordyes oh dearoh dear i think youll be sorry to hear it there was none who came there he seemed to take to so much as your lordship  theyve taken him to prison exclaimed nidderdale but the man shook his head what is it then he cant be dead then the man nodded his head and putting his hand up to his face burst into tears mr melmotte dead he was in the house of commons last night i saw him myself how did he die but the fat ponderous man was so affected by the tragedy he had witnessed that he could not as yet give any account of the scene of his masters death but simply handed the note which he had in his hand to lord nidderdale it was from marie and had been written within half an hour of the time at which news had been brought to her of what had occurred the note was as follows      dear lord nidderdale     the man will tell you what has happened i feel as though i was    mad i do not know who to send to will you come to me only for    a few minutes     marie   he read it standing up in the hall and then again asked the man as to the manner of his masters death and now the marquis gathering from a word or two that he heard and from his sons delay that something special had occurred hobbled out into the hall mr melmotte is dead said his son the old man dropped his stick and fell back against the wall this man says that he is dead and here is a letter from marie asking me to go there how was it that hedied  it waspoison said the butler solemnly there has been a doctor already and there isnt no doubt of that he took it all by himself last night he came home perhaps a little fresh and he had in brandy and soda and cigarsand sat himself down all to himself then in the morning when the young woman went inthere he waspoisoned i see him lay on the ground and i helped to lift him up and there was that smell of prussic acid that i knew what he had been and done just the same as when the doctor came and told us  before the man could be allowed to go back there was a consultation between the father and son as to a compliance with the request which marie had made in her first misery the marquis thought that his son had better not go to bruton street whats the use what good can you do shell only be falling into your arms and thats what youve got to avoidat any rate till you know how things are  but nidderdales better feelings would not allow him to submit to this advice he had been engaged to marry the girl and she in her abject misery had turned to him as the friend she knew best at any rate for the time the heartlessness of his usual life deserted him and he felt willing to devote himself to the girl not for what he could getbut because she had so nearly been so near to him i couldnt refuse her he said over and over again i couldnt bring myself to do it oh noi shall certainly go  youll get into a mess if you do  then i must get into a mess i shall certainly go i will go at once it is very disagreeable but i cannot possibly refuse it would be abominable then going back to the hall he sent a message by the butler to marie saying that he would be with her in less than half an hour  dont you go and make a fool of yourself his father said to him when he was alone this is just one of those times when a man may ruin himself by being softhearted nidderdale simply shook his head as he took his hat and gloves to go across to bruton street     chapter lxxxvi  the meeting in bruton street   when the news of her husbands death was in some very rough way conveyed to madame melmotte it crushed her for the time altogether marie first heard that she no longer had a living parent as she stood by the poor womans bedside and she was enabled as much perhaps by the necessity incumbent upon her of attending to the wretched woman as by her own superior strength of character to save herself from that prostration and collapse of power which a great and sudden blow is apt to produce she stared at the woman who first conveyed to her tidings of the tragedy and then for a moment seated herself at the bedside but the violent sobbings and hysterical screams of madame melmotte soon brought her again to her feet and from that moment she was not only active but efficacious noshe would not go down to the room she could do no good by going thither but they must send for a doctor they should send for a doctor immediately she was then told that a doctor and an inspector of police were already in the rooms below the necessity of throwing whatever responsibility there might be on to other shoulders had been at once apparent to the servants and they had sent out right and left so that the house might be filled with persons fit to give directions in such an emergency the officers from the police station were already there when the woman who now filled didons place in the house communicated to madame melmotte the fact that she was a widow  it was afterwards said by some of those who had seen her at the time that marie melmotte had shown a hard heart on the occasion but the condemnation was wrong her feeling for her father was certainly not that which we are accustomed to see among our daughters and sisters he had never been to her the petted divinity of the household whose slightest wish had been law whose little comforts had become matters of serious care whose frowns were horrid clouds whose smiles were glorious sunshine whose kisses were daily looked for and if missed would be missed with mourning how should it have been so with her in all the intercourses of her family since the first rough usage which she remembered there had never been anything sweet or gracious though she had recognized a certain duty as due from herself to her father she had found herself bound to measure it so that more should not be exacted from her than duty required she had long known that her father would fain make her a slave for his own purposes and that if she put no limits to her own obedience he certainly would put none she had drawn no comparison between him and other fathers or between herself and other daughters because she had never become conversant with the ways of other families after a fashion she had loved him because nature creates love in a daughters heart but she had never respected him and had spent the best energies of her character on a resolve that she would never fear him he may cut me into pieces but he shall not make me do for his advantage that which i do not think he has a right to exact from me that had been the state of her mind towards her father and now that he had taken himself away with terrible suddenness leaving her to face the difficulties of the world with no protector and no assistance the feeling which dominated her was no doubt one of awe rather than of brokenhearted sorrow those who depart must have earned such sorrow before it can be really felt they who are left may be overwhelmed by the deatheven of their most cruel tormentors madame melmotte was altogether overwhelmed but it could not probably be said of her with truth that she was crushed by pure grief there was fear of all things fear of solitude fear of sudden change fear of terrible revelations fear of some necessary movement she knew not whither fear that she might be discovered to be a poor wretched impostor who never could have been justified in standing in the same presence with emperors and princes with duchesses and cabinet ministers this and the fact that the dead body of the man who had so lately been her tyrant was lying near her so that she might hardly dare to leave her room lest she should encounter him dead and thus more dreadful even than when alive utterly conquered her feelings of the same kind the same fears and the same awe were powerful also with mariebut they did not conquer her she was strong and conquered them and she did not care to affect a weakness to which she was in truth superior in such a household the death of such a father after such a fashion will hardly produce that tender sorrow which comes from real love  she soon knew it all her father had destroyed himself and had doubtless done so because his troubles in regard to money had been greater than he could bear when he had told her that she was to sign those deeds because ruin was impending he must indeed have told her the truth he had so often lied to her that she had had no means of knowing whether he was lying then or telling her a true story but she had offered to sign the deeds since that and he had told her that it would be of no availand at that time had not been angry with her as he would have been had her refusal been the cause of his ruin she took some comfort in thinking of that  but what was she to do what was to be done generally by that overcumbered household she and her pseudomother had been instructed to pack up their jewellery and they had both obeyed the order but she herself at this moment cared but little for any property how ought she to behave herself where should she go on whose arm could she lean for some support at this terrible time as for love and engagements and marriagethat was all over in her difficulty she never for a moment thought of sir felix carbury though she had been silly enough to love the man because he was pleasant to look at she had never been so far gone in silliness as to suppose that he was a staff upon which any one might lean had that marriage taken place she would have been the staff but it might be possible that lord nidderdale would help her he was goodnatured and manly and would be efficaciousif only he would come to her he was near and she thought that at any rate she would try so she had written her note and sent it by the butlerthinking as she did so of the words she would use to make the young man understand that all the nonsense they had talked as to marrying each other was of course to mean nothing now  it was past eleven when he reached the house and he was shown upstairs into one of the sittingrooms on the firstfloor as he passed the door of the study which was at the moment partly open he saw the dress of a policeman within and knew that the body of the dead man was still lying there but he went by rapidly without a glance within remembering the look of the man as he had last seen his burly figure and that grasp of his hand and those odious words and now the man was deadhaving destroyed his own life surely the man must have known when he uttered those words what it was that he intended to do when he had made that last appeal about marie conscious as he was that every one was deserting him he must even then have looked his fate in the face and have told himself that it was better that he should die his misfortunes whatever might be their nature must have been heavy on him then with all their weight and he himself and all the world had known that he was ruined and yet he had pretended to be anxious about the girls marriage and had spoken of it as though he still believed that it would be accomplished  nidderdale had hardly put his hat down on the table before marie was with him he walked up to her took her by both hands and looked into her face there was no trace of a tear but her whole countenance seemed to him to be altered she was the first to speak  i thought you would come when i sent for you  of course i came  i knew you would be a friend and i knew no one else who would you wont be afraid lord nidderdale that i shall ever think any more of all those things which he was planning she paused a moment but he was not ready enough to have a word to say in answer to this you know what has happened  your servant told us  what are we to do oh lord nidderdale it is so dreadful poor papa poor papa when i think of all that he must have suffered i wish that i could be dead too  has your mother been told  oh yes she knows no one tried to conceal anything for a moment it was better that it should be sobetter at last but we have no friends who would be considerate enough to try to save us from sorrow but i think it was better mamma is very bad she is always nervous and timid of course this has nearly killed her what ought we to do it is mr longestaffes house and we were to have left it tomorrow  he will not mind that now  where must we go we cant go back to that big place in grosvenor square who will manage for us who will see the doctor and the policemen  i will do that  but there will be things that i cannot ask you to do why should i ask you to do anything  because we are friends  no she said no you cannot really regard me as a friend i have been an impostor i know that i had no business to know a person like you at all oh if the next six months could be over poor papapoor papa and then for the first time she burst into tears  i wish i knew what might comfort you he said  how can there be any comfort there never can be comfort again as for comfort when were we ever comfortable it has been one trouble after anotherone fear after another and now we are friendless and homeless i suppose they will take everything that we have  your papa had a lawyer i suppose  i think he had ever so manybut i do not know who they were his own clerk who had lived with him for over twenty years left him yesterday i suppose they will know something in abchurch lane but now that herr croll has gone i am not acquainted even with the name of one of them mr miles grendall used to be with him  i do not think that he could be of much service  nor lord alfred lord alfred was always with him till very lately nidderdale shook his head i suppose not they only came because papa had a big house the young lord could not but feel that he was included in the same rebuke oh what a life it has been and now now its over as she said this it seemed that for the moment her strength failed her for she fell backwards on the corner of the sofa he tried to raise her but she shook him away burying her face in her hands he was standing close to her still holding her arm when he heard a knock at the front door which was immediately opened as the servants were hanging about in the hall who are they said marie whose sharp ears caught the sound of various steps lord nidderdale went out on to the head of the stairs and immediately heard the voice of dolly longestaffe  dolly longestaffe had on that morning put himself early into the care of mr squercum and it had happened that he with his lawyer had met his father with mr bideawhile at the corner of the square they were all coming according to appointment to receive the money which mr melmotte had promised to pay them at this very hour of course they had none of them as yet heard of the way in which the financier had made his last grand payment and as they walked together to the door had been intent only in reference to their own money squercum who had heard a good deal on the previous day was very certain that the money would not be forthcoming whereas bideawhile was sanguine of success dont we wish we may get it dolly had said and by saying so had very much offended his father who had resented the want of reverence implied in the use of that word we they had all been admitted together and dolly had at once loudly claimed an old acquaintance with some of the articles around him i knew id got a coat just like that said dolly and i never could make out what my fellow had done with it this was the speech which nidderdale had heard standing on the top of the stairs  the two lawyers had at once seen from the face of the man who had opened the door and from the presence of three or four servants in the hall that things were not going on in their usual course before dolly had completed his buffoonery the butler had whispered to mr bideawhile that mr melmottewas no more  dead exclaimed mr bideawhile squercum put his hands into his trousers pockets and opened his mouth wide dead muttered mr longestaffe senior dead said dolly whos dead the butler shook his head then squercum whispered a word into the butlers ear and the butler thereupon nodded his head its about what i expected said squercum then the butler whispered the word to mr longestaffe and whispered it also to mr bideawhile and they all knew that the millionaire had swallowed poison during the night  it was known to the servants that mr longestaffe was the owner of the house and he was therefore as having authority there shown into the room where the body of melmotte was lying on a sofa the two lawyers and dolly of course followed as did also lord nidderdale who had now joined them from the lobby above there was a policeman in the room who seemed to be simply watching the body and who rose from his seat when the gentlemen entered two or three of the servants followed them so that there was almost a crowd round the dead mans bier there was no further tale to be told that melmotte had been in the house on the previous night and had there disgraced himself by intoxication they had known already that he had been found dead that morning had been already announced they could only stand round and gaze on the square sullen livid features of the bigframed man and each lament that he had ever heard the name of melmotte  are you in the house here said dolly to lord nidderdale in a whisper  she sent for me we live quite close you know she wanted somebody to tell her something i must go up to her again now  had you seen him before  no indeed i only came down when i heard your voices i fear it will be rather bad for youwont it  he was regularly smashed i suppose asked dolly  i know nothing myself he talked to me about his affairs once but he was such a liar that not a word that he said was worth anything i believed him then how it will go i cant say  that other thing is all over of course suggested dolly nidderdale intimated by a gesture of his head that the other thing was all over and then returned to marie there was nothing further that the four gentlemen could do and they soon departed from the housenot however till mr bideawhile had given certain short injunctions to the butler concerning the property contained in mr longestaffes town residence  they had come to see him said lord nidderdale in a whisper there was some appointment he had told them to be all here at this hour  they didnt know then asked marie  nothingtill the man told them  and did you go in  yes we all went into the room marie shuddered and again hid her face i think the best thing i can do said nidderdale is to go to abchurch lane and find out from smith who is the lawyer whom he chiefly trusted i know smith had to do with his own affairs because he has told me so at the board and if necessary i will find out croll no doubt i can trace him then we had better employ the lawyer to arrange everything for you  and where had we better go to  where would madame melmotte wish to go  anywhere so that we could hide ourselves perhaps frankfort would be the best but shouldnt we stay till something has been done here and couldnt we have lodgings so as to get away from mr longestaffes house nidderdale promised that he himself would look for lodgings as soon as he had seen the lawyer and now my lord i suppose that i never shall see you again said marie  i dont know why you should say that  because it will be best why should you all this will be trouble enough to you when people begin to say what we are but i dont think it has been my fault  nothing has ever been your fault  goodbye my lord i shall always think of you as one of the kindest people i ever knew i thought it best to send to you for different reasons but i do not want you to come back  goodbye marie i shall always remember you and so they parted  after that he did go into the city and succeeded in finding both mr smith and herr croll when he reached abchurch lane the news of melmottes death had already been spread abroad and more was known or said to be known of his circumstances than nidderdale had as yet heard the crushing blow to him so said herr croll had been the desertion of cohenlupethat and the sudden fall in the value of the south central pacific and mexican railway shares consequent on the rumours spread about the city respecting the pickering property it was asserted in abchurch lane that had he not at that moment touched the pickering property or entertained the emperor or stood for westminster he must by the end of the autumn have been able to do any or all of those things without danger simply as the result of the money which would then have been realized by the railway but he had allowed himself to become hampered by the want of comparatively small sums of ready money and in seeking relief had rushed from one danger to another till at last the waters around him had become too deep even for him and had overwhelmed him as to his immediate death herr croll expressed not the slightest astonishment it was just the thing herr croll said that he had been sure that melmotte would do should his difficulties ever become too great for him and dere vas a leetle ting he lay himself open by de oder day said croll dat vas nasty very nasty nidderdale shook his head but asked no questions croll had alluded to the use of his own name but did not on this occasion make any further revelation then croll made a further statement to lord nidderdale which i think he must have done in pure goodnature mylor he said whispering very gravely de money of de yong lady is all her own then he nodded his head three times nobody can toch it not if he vas in debt millions again he nodded his head  i am very glad to hear it for her sake said lord nidderdale as he took his leave     chapter lxxxvii  down at carbury   when roger carbury returned to suffolk after seeing his cousins in welbeck street he was by no means contented with himself that he should be discontented generally with the circumstances of his life was a matter of course he knew that he was farther removed than ever from the object on which his whole mind was set had hetta carbury learned all the circumstances of pauls engagement with mrs hurtle before she had confessed her love to paulso that her heart might have been turned against the man before she had made her confession then he thought she might at last have listened to him even though she had loved the other man she might have at last done so as her love would have been buried in her own bosom but the tale had been told after the fashion which was most antagonistic to his own interests hetta had never heard mrs hurtles name till she had given herself away and had declared to all her friends that she had given herself away to this man who was so unworthy of her the more roger thought of this the more angry he was with paul montague and the more convinced that that man had done him an injury which he could never forgive  but his grief extended even beyond that though he was never tired of swearing to himself that he would not forgive paul montague yet there was present to him a feeling that an injury was being done to the man and that he was in some sort responsible for that injury he had declined to tell hetta any part of the story about mrs hurtleactuated by a feeling that he ought not to betray the trust put in him by a man who was at the time his friend and he had told nothing but no one knew so well as he did the fact that all the attention latterly given by paul to the american woman had by no means been the effect of love but had come from a feeling on pauls part that he could not desert the woman he had once loved when she asked him for his kindness if hetta could know everything exactlyif she could look back and read the state of pauls mind as he roger could read itthen she would probably forgive the man or perhaps tell herself that there was nothing for her to forgive roger was anxious that hettas anger should burn hotbecause of the injury done to himself he thought that there were ample reasons why paul montague should be punishedwhy paul should be utterly expelled from among them and allowed to go his own course but it was not right that the man should be punished on false grounds it seemed to roger now that he was doing an injustice to his enemy by refraining from telling all that he knew  as to the girls misery in losing her lover much as he loved her true as it was that he was willing to devote himself and all that he had to her happiness i do not think that at the present moment he was disturbed in that direction it is hardly natural perhaps that a man should love a woman with such devotion as to wish to make her happy by giving her to another man roger told himself that paul would be an unsafe husband a fickle husbandone who might be carried hither and thither both in his circumstances and his feelingsand that it would be better for hetta that she should not marry him but at the same time he was unhappy as he reflected that he himself was a party to a certain amount of deceit  and yet he had said not a word he had referred hetta to the man himself he thought that he knew and he did indeed accurately know the state of hettas mind she was wretched because she thought that while her lover was winning her love while she herself was willingly allowing him to win her love he was dallying with another woman and making to that other woman promises the same as those he made to her this was not true roger knew that it was not true but when he tried to quiet his conscience by saying that they must fight it out among themselves he felt himself to be uneasy under that assurance  his life at carbury at this time was very desolate he had become tired of the priest who in spite of various repulses had never for a moment relaxed his efforts to convert his friend roger had told him once that he must beg that religion might not be made the subject of further conversation between them in answer to this father barham had declared that he would never consent to remain as an intimate associate with any man on those terms roger had persisted in his stipulation and the priest had then suggested that it was his hosts intention to banish him from carbury hall roger had made no reply and the priest had of course been banished but even this added to his misery father barham was a gentleman was a good man and in great penury to illtreat such a one to expel such a one from his house seemed to roger to be an abominable cruelty he was unhappy with himself about the priest and yet he could not bid the man come back to him it was already being said of him among his neighbours at eardly at caversham and at the bishops palace that he either had become or was becoming a roman catholic under the priests influence mrs yeld had even taken upon herself to write to him a most affectionate letter in which she said very little as to any evidence that had reached her as to rogers defection but dilated at very great length on the abominations of a certain lady who is supposed to indulge in gorgeous colours  he was troubled too about old daniel ruggles the farmer at sheeps acre who had been so angry because his niece would not marry john crumb old ruggles when abandoned by ruby and accused by his neighbours of personal cruelty to the girl had taken freely to that source of consolation which he found to be most easily within his reach since ruby had gone he had been drunk every day and was making himself generally a scandal and a nuisance his landlord had interfered with his usual kindness and the old man had always declared that his niece and john crumb were the cause of it all for now in his maudlin misery he attributed as much blame to the lover as he did to the girl john crumb wasnt in earnest if he had been in earnest he would have gone after her to london at once nohe wouldnt invite ruby to come back if ruby would come back repentant full of sorrowand hadnt been and made a fool of herself in the meantime then hed think of taking her back in the meantime with circumstances in their present condition he evidently thought that he could best face the difficulties of the world by an unfaltering adhesion to gin early in the day and all day long this too was a grievance to roger carbury  but he did not neglect his work the chief of which at the present moment was the care of the farm which he kept in his own hands he was making hay at this time in certain meadows down by the river side and was standing by while the men were loading a cart when he saw john crumb approaching across the field he had not seen john since the eventful journey to london nor had he seen him in london but he knew well all that had occurredhow the dealer in pollard had thrashed his cousin sir felix how he had been locked up by the police and then liberatedand how he was now regarded in bungay as a hero as far as arms were concerned but as being very soft in the matter of love the reader need hardly be told that roger was not at all disposed to quarrel with mr crumb because the victim of crumbs heroism had been his own cousin crumb had acted well and had never said a word about sir felix since his return to the country no doubt he had now come to talk about his loveand in order that his confessions might not be made before all the assembled haymakers roger carbury hurried to meet him there was soon evident on crumbs broad face a whole sunshine of delight as roger approached him he began to laugh aloud and to wave a bit of paper that he had in his hands shes a coomin shes a coomin were the first words he uttered roger knew very well that in his friends mind there was but one she in the world and that the name of that she was ruby ruggles  i am delighted to hear it said roger she has made it up with her grandfather  dont know nowt about grandfeyther she have made it up wi me knowd she would when id polishd tother un off a bitknowd she would  has she written to you then  well squoireshe aint not just herself i do suppose that isnt the way they does it but its all as one and then mr crumb thrust mrs hurtles note into roger carburys hand  roger certainly was not predisposed to think well or kindly of mrs hurtle since he had first known mrs hurtles name when paul montague had told the story of his engagement on his return from america roger had regarded her as a wicked intriguing bad woman it may perhaps be confessed that he was prejudiced against all americans looking upon washington much as he did upon jack cade or wat tyler and he pictured to himself all american women as being loud masculine and atheistical but it certainly did seem that in this instance mrs hurtle was endeavouring to do a good turn from pure charity she is a lady crumb began to explain who do be living with mrs pipkin and she is a lady as is a lady  roger could not fully admit the truth of this assertion but he explained that he too knew something of mrs hurtle and that he thought it probable that what she said of ruby might be true true squoire said crumb laughing with his whole face i ha nae a doubt its true whats again its being true when i had dropped into tother fellow of course she made her choice it was me as was to blame because i didnt do it before i ought to ha dropped into him when i first heard as he was arter her its that as girls like so squoire im just going again to lonon right away  roger suggested that old ruggles would of course receive his niece but as to this john expressed his supreme indifference the old man was nothing to him of course he would like to have the old mans money but the old man couldnt live for ever and he supposed that things would come right in time but this he knewthat he wasnt going to cringe to the old man about his money when roger observed that it would be better that ruby should have some home to which she might at once return john adverted with a renewed grin to all the substantial comforts of his own house it seemed to be his idea that on arriving in london he would at once take ruby away to church and be married to her out of hand he had thrashed his rival and what cause could there now be for delay  but before he left the field he made one other speech to the squire you aint ataken it amiss squoire cause he was coosin to yourself  not in the least mr crumb  thats koind now i aint a done the yong man a haporth o harm and i dont feel no grudge again him and when me and rubys once spliced im darned if i dont give un a bottle of wine the first day as hell come to bungay  roger did not feel himself justified in accepting this invitation on the part of sir felix but he renewed his assurance that he on his own part thought that crumb had behaved well in that matter of the street encounter and he expressed a strong wish for the immediate and continued happiness of mr and mrs john crumb  oh ay well be appy squoire said crumb as he went exulting out of the field  on the day after this roger carbury received a letter which disturbed him very much and to which he hardly knew whether to return any answer or what answer it was from paul montague and was written by him but a few hours after he had left his letter for hetta with his own hands at the door of her mothers house pauls letter to roger was as follows      my dear roger     though i know that you have cast me off from you i cannot write    to you in any other way as any other way would be untrue you    can answer me of course as you please but i do think that you    will owe me an answer as i appeal to you in the name of    justice     you know what has taken place between hetta and myself she had    accepted me and therefore i am justified in feeling sure that    she must have loved me but she has now quarrelled with me    altogether and has told me that i am never to see her again of    course i dont mean to put up with this who would you will say    that it is no business of yours but i think that you would not    wish that she should be left under a false impression if you    could put her right     somebody has told her the story of mrs hurtle i suppose it was    felix and that he had learned it from those people at    islington but she has been told that which is untrue nobody    knows and nobody can know the truth as you do she supposes that    i have willingly been passing my time with mrs hurtle during the    last two months although during that very time i have asked for    and received the assurance of her love now whether or no i    have been to blame about mrs hurtleas to which nothing at    present need be saidit is certainly the truth that her coming    to england was not only not desired by me but was felt by me to    be the greatest possible misfortune but after all that had    passed i certainly owed it to her not to neglect herand this    duty was the more incumbent on me as she was a foreigner and    unknown to any one i went down to lowestoft with her at her    request having named the place to her as one known to myself    and because i could not refuse her so small a favour you know    that it was so and you know also as no one else does that    whatever courtesy i have shown to mrs hurtle in england i have    been constrained to show her     i appeal to you to let hetta know that this is true she had    made me understand that not only her mother and brother but you    also are well acquainted with the story of my acquaintance with    mrs hurtle neither lady carbury nor sir felix has ever known    anything about it you and you only have known the truth and    now though at the present you are angry with me i call upon    you to tell hetta the truth as you know it you will understand    me when i say that i feel that i am being destroyed by a false    representation i think that you who abhor a falsehood will    see the justice of setting me right at any rate as far as the    truth can do so i do not want you to say a word for me beyond    that     yours always     paul montague   what business is all that of mine this of course was the first feeling produced in rogers mind by montagues letter if hetta had received any false impression it had not come from him he had told no stories against his rival whether true or false he had been so scrupulous that he had refused to say a word at all and if any false impression had been made on hettas mind either by circumstances or by untrue words had not montague deserved any evil that might fall upon him though every word in montagues letter might be true nevertheless in the end no more than justice would be done him even should he be robbed at last of his mistress under erroneous impressions the fact that he had once disgraced himself by offering to make mrs hurtle his wife rendered him unworthy of hetta carbury such at least was roger carburys verdict as he thought over all the circumstances at any rate it was no business of his to correct these wrong impressions  and yet he was ill at ease as he thought of it all he did believe that every word in montagues letter was true though he had been very indignant when he met roger and mrs hurtle together on the sands at lowestoft he was perfectly convinced that the cause of their coming there had been precisely that which montague had stated it took him two days to think over all this two days of great discomfort and unhappiness after all why should he be a dog in the manger the girl did not care for himlooked upon him as an old man to be regarded in a fashion altogether different from that in which she regarded paul montague he had let his time for lovemaking go by and now it behoved him as a man to take the world as he found it and not to lose himself in regrets for a kind of happiness which he could never attain in such an emergency as this he should do what was fair and honest without reference to his own feelings and yet the passion which dominated john crumb altogether which made the mealman so intent on the attainment of his object as to render all other things indifferent to him for the time was equally strong with roger carbury unfortunately for roger strong as his passion was it was embarrassed by other feelings it never occurred to crumb to think whether he was a fit husband for ruby or whether ruby having a decided preference for another man could be a fit wife for him but with roger there were a thousand surrounding difficulties to hamper him john crumb never doubted for a moment what he should do he had to get the girl if possible and he meant to get her whatever she might cost him he was always confident though sometimes perplexed but roger had no confidence he knew that he should never win the game in his sadder moments he felt that he ought not to win it the people around him from old fashion still called him the young squire whyhe felt himself at times to be eighty years oldso old that he was unfitted for intercourse with such juvenile spirits as those of his neighbour the bishop and of his friend hepworth could he by any training bring himself to take her happiness in hand altogether sacrificing his own  in such a mood as this he did at last answer his enemys letterand he answered it as follows      i do not know that i am concerned to meddle in your affairs at    all i have told no tale against you and i do not know that i    have any that i wish to tell in your favour or that i could so    tell if i did wish i think that you have behaved badly to me    cruelly to mrs hurtle and disrespectfully to my cousin    nevertheless as you appeal to me on a certain point for    evidence which i can give and which you say no one else can    give i do acknowledge that in my opinion mrs hurtles    presence in england has not been in accordance with your wishes    and that you accompanied her to lowestoft not as her lover but    as an old friend whom you could not neglect     roger carbury     paul montague esq     you are at liberty to show this letter to miss carbury if you    please but if she reads part she should read the whole   there was more perhaps of hostility in this letter than of that spirit of selfsacrifice to which roger intended to train himself and so he himself felt after the letter had been dispatched     chapter lxxxviii  the inquest   melmotte had been found dead on friday morning and late on the evening of the same day madame melmotte and marie were removed to lodgings far away from the scene of the tragedy up at hampstead herr croll had known of the place and at lord nidderdales instance had busied himself in the matter and had seen that the rooms were made instantly ready for the widow of his late employer nidderdale himself had assisted them in their departure and the german with the poor womans maid with the jewels also which had been packed according to melmottes last orders to his wife followed the carriage which took the mother and the daughter they did not start till nine oclock in the evening and madame melmotte at the moment would fain have been allowed to rest one other night in bruton street but lord nidderdale with one hardly uttered word made marie understand that the inquest would be held early on the following morning and marie was imperious with her mother and carried her point so the poor woman was taken away from mr longestaffes residence and never again saw the grandeur of her own house in grosvenor square which she had not visited since the night on which she had helped to entertain the emperor of china  on saturday morning the inquest was held there was not the slightest doubt as to any one of the incidents of the catastrophe the servants the doctor and the inspector of police between them learned that he had come home alone that nobody had been near him during the night that he had been found dead and that he had undoubtedly been poisoned by prussic acid it was also proved that he had been drunk in the house of commons a fact to which one of the clerks of the house very much against his will was called upon to testify that he had destroyed himself there was no doubtnor was there any doubt as to the cause  in such cases as this it is for the jury to say whether the unfortunate one who has found his life too hard for endurance and has rushed away to see whether he could not find an improved condition of things elsewhere has or has not been mad at the moment surviving friends are of course anxious for a verdict of insanity as in that case no further punishment is exacted the body can be buried like any other body and it can always be said afterwards that the poor man was mad perhaps it would be well that all suicides should be said to have been mad for certainly the jurymen are not generally guided in their verdicts by any accurately ascertained facts if the poor wretch has up to his last days been apparently living a decent life if he be not hated or has not in his last moments made himself specially obnoxious to the world at large then he is declared to have been mad who would be heavy on a poor clergyman who has been at last driven by horrid doubts to rid himself of a difficulty from which he saw no escape in any other way who would not give the benefit of the doubt to the poor woman whose lover and lord had deserted her who would remit to unhallowed earth the body of the once beneficent philosopher who has simply thought that he might as well go now finding himself powerless to do further good upon earth such and such like have of course been temporarily insane though no touch even of strangeness may have marked their conduct up to their last known dealings with their fellowmortals but let a melmotte be found dead with a bottle of prussic acid by his sidea man who has become horrid to the world because of his late iniquities a man who has so well pretended to be rich that he has been able to buy and to sell properties without paying for them a wretch who has made himself odious by his ruin to friends who had taken him up as a pillar of strength in regard to wealth a brute who had got into the house of commons by false pretences and had disgraced the house by being drunk thereand of course he will not be saved by a verdict of insanity from the cross roads or whatever scornful grave may be allowed to those who have killed themselves with their wits about them just at this moment there was a very strong feeling against melmotte owing perhaps as much to his having tumbled over poor mr beauchamp in the house of commons as to the stories of the forgeries he had committed and the virtue of the day vindicated itself by declaring him to have been responsible for his actions when he took the poison he was felo de se and therefore carried away to the cross roadsor elsewhere but it may be imagined i think that during that night he may have become as mad as any other wretch have been driven as far beyond his powers of endurance as any other poor creature who ever at any time felt himself constrained to go he had not been so drunk but that he knew all that happened and could foresee pretty well what would happen the summons to attend upon the lord mayor had been served upon him there were some among them croll and mr brehgert who absolutely knew that he had committed forgery he had no money for the longestaffes and he was well aware what squercum would do at once he had assured himself long agohe had assured himself indeed not very long agothat he would brave it all like a man but we none of us know what load we can bear and what would break our backs melmottes back had been so utterly crushed that i almost think that he was mad enough to have justified a verdict of temporary insanity  but he was carried away no one knew whither and for a week his name was hateful but after that a certain amount of whitewashing took place and in some degree a restitution of fame was made to the manes of the departed in westminster he was always odious westminster which had adopted him never forgave him but in other districts it came to be said of him that he had been more sinned against than sinning and that but for the jealousy of the old stagers in the mercantile world he would have done very wonderful things marylebone which is always merciful took him up quite with affection and would have returned his ghost to parliament could his ghost have paid for committee rooms finsbury delighted for a while to talk of the great financier and even chelsea thought that he had been done to death by ungenerous tongues it was however marylebone alone that spoke of a monument  mr longestaffe came back to his house taking formal possession of it a few days after the verdict of course he was alone there had been no further question of bringing the ladies of the family up to town and dolly altogether declined to share with his father the honour of encountering the dead mans spirit but there was very much for mr longestaffe to do and very much also for his son it was becoming a question with both of them how far they had been ruined by their connection with the horrible man it was clear that they could not get back the titledeeds of the pickering property without paying the amount which had been advanced upon them and it was equally clear that they could not pay that sum unless they were enabled to do so by funds coming out of the melmotte estate dolly as he sat smoking upon the stool in mr squercums office where he now passed a considerable portion of his time looked upon himself as a miracle of illusage  by george you know i shall have to go to law with the governor theres nothing else for it is there squercum  squercum suggested that they had better wait till they found what pickings there might be out of the melmotte estate he had made inquiries too about that and had been assured that there must be property but property so involved and tied up as to make it impossible to lay hands upon it suddenly they say that the things in the square and the plate and the carriages and horses and all that ought to fetch between twenty and thirty thousand there were a lot of jewels but the women have taken them said squercum  by george they ought to be made to give up everything did you ever hear of such a thingthe very house pulled downmy house and all done without a word from me in the matter i dont suppose such a thing was ever known before since properties were properties then he uttered sundry threats against the bideawhiles in reference to whom he declared his intention of making it very hot for them  it was an annoyance added to the elder mr longestaffe that the management of melmottes affairs fell at last almost exclusively into the hands of mr brehgert now brehgert in spite of his many dealings with melmotte was an honest man and which was perhaps of as much immediate consequence both an energetic and a patient man but then he was the man who had wanted to marry georgiana longestaffe and he was the man to whom mr longestaffe had been particularly uncivil then there arose necessities for the presence of mr brehgert in the house in which melmotte had lately lived and had died the dead mans papers were still theredeeds documents and such letters as he had not chosen to destroyand these could not be moved quite at once mr brehgert must of course have access to my private room as long as it is necessaryabsolutely necessary said mr longestaffe in answer to a message which was brought to him but he will of course see the expediency of relieving me from such intrusion as soon as possible but he soon found it preferable to come to terms with the rejected suitor especially as the man was singularly goodnatured and forbearing after the injuries he had received  all minor debts were to be paid at once an arrangement to which mr longestaffe cordially agreed as it included a sum of £300 due to him for the rent of his house in bruton street then by degrees it became known that there would certainly be a dividend of not less than fifty per cent payable on debts which could be proved to have been owing by melmotte and perhaps of morean arrangement which was very comfortable to dolly as it had been already agreed between all the parties interested that the debt due to him should be satisfied before the father took anything mr longestaffe resolved during these weeks that he remained in town that as regarded himself and his own family the house in london should not only not be kept up but that it should be absolutely sold with all its belongings and that the servants at caversham should be reduced in number and should cease to wear powder all this was communicated to lady pomona in a very long letter which she was instructed to read to her daughters i have suffered great wrongs said mr longestaffe but i must submit to them and as i submit so must my wife and children if our son were different from what he is the sacrifice might probably be made lighter his nature i cannot alter but from my daughters i expect cheerful obedience from what incidents of his past life he was led to expect cheerfulness at caversham it might be difficult to say but the obedience was there georgey was for the time broken down sophia was satisfied with her nuptial prospects and lady pomona had certainly no spirits left for a combat i think the loss of the hairpowder afflicted her most but she said not a word even about that  but in all this the details necessary for the telling of our story are anticipated mr longestaffe had remained in london actually over the 1st of september which in suffolk is the one great festival of the year before the letter was written to which allusion has been made in the meantime he saw much of mr brehgert and absolutely formed a kind of friendship for that gentleman in spite of the abomination of his religionso that on one occasion he even condescended to ask mr brehgert to dine alone with him in bruton street this too was in the early days of the arrangement of the melmotte affairs when mr longestaffes heart had been softened by that arrangement with reference to the rent mr brehgert came and there arose a somewhat singular conversation between the two gentlemen as they sat together over a bottle of mr longestaffes old port wine hitherto not a word had passed between them respecting the connection which had once been proposed since the day on which the young ladys father had said so many bitter things to the expectant bridegroom but in this evening mr brehgert who was by no means a coward in such matters and whose feelings were not perhaps painfully fine spoke his mind in a way that at first startled mr longestaffe the subject was introduced by a reference which brehgert had made to his own affairs his loss would be at any rate double that which mr longestaffe would have to bear but he spoke of it in an easy way as though it did not sit very near his heart of course theres a difference between me and you he said mr longestaffe bowed his head graciously as much as to say that there was of course a very wide difference in our affairs continued brehgert we expect gains and of course look for occasional losses when a gentleman in your position sells a property he expects to get the purchasemoney  of course he does mr brehgert thats what made it so hard  i cant even yet quite understand how it was with him or why he took upon himself to spend such an enormous deal of money here in london his business was quite irregular but there was very much of it and some of it immensely profitable he took us in completely  i suppose so  it was old mr todd that first took to himbut i was deceived as much as todd and then i ventured on a speculation with him outside of our house the long and short of it is that i shall lose something about sixty thousand pounds  thats a large sum of money  very largeso large as to affect my daily mode of life in my correspondence with your daughter i considered it to be my duty to point out to her that it would be so i do not know whether she told you  this reference to his daughter for the moment altogether upset mr longestaffe the reference was certainly most indelicate most deserving of censure but mr longestaffe did not know how to pronounce his censure on the spur of the moment and was moreover at the present time so very anxious for brehgerts assistance in the arrangement of his affairs that so to say he could not afford to quarrel with the man but he assumed something more than his normal dignity as he asserted that his daughter had never mentioned the fact  it was so said brehgert  no doubtand mr longestaffe assumed a great deal of dignity  yes it was so i had promised your daughter when she was good enough to listen to the proposition which i made to her that i would maintain a second house when we should be married  it was impossible said mr longestaffemeaning to assert that such hymeneals were altogether unnatural and out of the question  it would have been quite possible as things were when that proposition was made but looking forward to the loss which i afterwards anticipated from the affairs of our deceased friend i found it to be prudent to relinquish my intention for the present and i thought myself bound to inform miss longestaffe  there were other reasons muttered mr longestaffe in a suppressed voice almost in a whisperin a whisper which was intended to convey a sense of present horror and a desire for future reticence  there may have been but in the last letter which miss longestaffe did me the honour to write to mea letter with which i have not the slightest right to find any faultshe seemed to me to confine herself almost exclusively to that reason  why mention this now mr brehgert why mention this now the subject is painful  just because it is not painful to me mr longestaffe and because i wish that all they who have heard of the matter should know that it is not painful i think that throughout i behaved like a gentleman mr longestaffe in an agony first shook his head twice and then bowed it three times leaving the jew to take what answer he could from so dubious an oracle i am sure continued brehgert that i behaved like an honest man and i didnt quite like that the matter should be passed over as if i was in any way ashamed of myself  perhaps on so delicate a subject the less said the soonest mended  ive nothing more to say and ive nothing at all to mend finishing the conversation with this little speech brehgert arose to take his leave making some promise at the time that he would use all the expedition in his power to complete the arrangement of the melmotte affairs  as soon as he was gone mr longestaffe opened the door and walked about the room and blew out long puffs of breath as though to cleanse himself from the impurities of his late contact he told himself that he could not touch pitch and not be defiled how vulgar had the man been how indelicate how regardless of all feeling how little grateful for the honour which mr longestaffe had conferred upon him by asking him to dinner yesyes a horrid jew were not all jews necessarily an abomination yet mr longestaffe was aware that in the present crisis of his fortunes he could not afford to quarrel with mr brehgert     chapter lxxxix  the wheel of fortune   it was a long time now since lady carburys great historical work on the criminal queens of the world had been completed and given to the world any reader careful as to dates will remember that it was as far back as in february that she had solicited the assistance of certain of her literary friends who were connected with the daily and weekly press these gentlemen had responded to her call with more or less zealous aid so that the criminal queens had been regarded in the trade as one of the successful books of the season messrs leadham and loiter had published a second and then very quickly a fourth and fifth edition and had been able in their advertisements to give testimony from various criticisms showing that lady carburys book was about the greatest historical work which had emanated from the press in the present century with this object a passage was extracted even from the columns of the evening pulpitwhich showed very great ingenuity on the part of some young man connected with the establishment of messrs leadham and loiter lady carbury had suffered something in the struggle what efforts can mortals make as to which there will not be some disappointment paper and print cannot be had for nothing and advertisements are very costly an edition may be sold with startling rapidity but it may have been but a scanty edition when lady carbury received from messrs leadham and loiter their second very moderate cheque with the expression of a fear on their part that there would not probably be a thirdunless some unforeseen demand should ariseshe repeated to herself those wellknown lines from the satirist      oh amos cottle for a moment think      what meagre profits spread from pen and ink  but not on that account did she for a moment hesitate as to further attempts indeed she had hardly completed the last chapter of her criminal queens before she was busy on another work and although the last six months had been to her a period of incessant trouble and sometimes of torture though the conduct of her son had more than once forced her to declare to herself that her mind would fail her still she had persevered from day to day with all her cares heavy upon her she had sat at her work with a firm resolve that so many lines should be always forthcoming let the difficulty of making them be what it might messrs leadham and loiter had thought that they might be justified in offering her certain terms for a novelterms not very high indeed and those contingent on the approval of the manuscript by their reader the smallness of the sum offered and the want of certainty and the pain of the work in her present circumstances had all been felt by her to be very hard but she had persevered and the novel was now complete  it cannot with truth be said of her that she had had any special tale to tell she had taken to the writing of a novel because mr loiter had told her that upon the whole novels did better than anything else she would have written a volume of sermons on the same encouragement and have gone about the work exactly after the same fashion the length of her novel had been her first question it must be in three volumes and each volume must have three hundred pages but what fewest number of words might be supposed sufficient to fill a page the money offered was too trifling to allow of very liberal measure on her part she had to live and if possible to write another noveland as she hoped upon better termswhen this should be finished then what should be the name of her novel what the name of her hero and above all what the name of her heroine it must be a love story of course but she thought that she would leave the complications of the plot to come by chanceand they did come dont let it end unhappily lady carbury mr loiter had said because though people like it in a play they hate it in a book and whatever you do lady carbury dont be historical your historical novel lady carbury isnt worth a mr loiter stopping himself suddenly and remembering that he was addressing himself to a lady satisfied his energy at last by the use of the word straw lady carbury had followed these instructions with accuracy  the name for the story had been the great thing it did not occur to the authoress that as the plot was to be allowed to develop itself and was at this moment when she was perplexed as to the title altogether uncreated she might as well wait to see what appellation might best suit her work when its purpose should have declared itself a novel she knew well was most unlike a rose which by any other name will smell as sweet the faultless father the mysterious mother the lame loversuch names as that she was aware would be useless now mary jane walker if she could be very simple would do or blanche de veau if she were able to maintain throughout a somewhat highstilted style of feminine rapture but as she considered that she could best deal with rapid action and strange coincidences she thought that something more startling and descriptive would better suit her purpose after an hours thought a name did occur to her and she wrote it down and with considerable energy of purpose framed her work in accordance with her chosen title the wheel of fortune she had no particular fortune in her mind when she chose it and no particular wheelbut the very idea conveyed by the words gave her the plot which she wanted a young lady was blessed with great wealth and lost it all by an uncle and got it all back by an honest lawyer and gave it all up to a distressed lover and found it all again in a third volume and the ladys name was cordinga selected by lady carbury as never having been heard before either in the world of fact or in that of fiction  and now with all her troubles thick about herwhile her son was still hanging about the house in a condition that would break any mothers heart while her daughter was so wretched and sore that she regarded all those around her as her enemies lady carbury finished her work and having just written the last words in which the final glow of enduring happiness was given to the young married heroine whose wheel had now come full round sat with the sheets piled at her right hand she had allowed herself a certain number of weeks for the task and had completed it exactly in the time fixed as she sat with her hand near the pile she did give herself credit for her diligence whether the work might have been better done she never asked herself i do not think that she prided herself much on the literary merit of the tale but if she could bring the papers to praise it if she could induce mudie to circulate it if she could manage that the air for a month should be so loaded with the wheel of fortune as to make it necessary for the reading world to have read or to have said that it had read the bookthen she would pride herself very much upon her work  as she was so sitting on a sunday afternoon in her own room mr alf was announced according to her habit she expressed warm delight at seeing him nothing could be kinder than such a visit just at such a timewhen there was so very much to occupy such a one as mr alf mr alf in his usual mildly satirical way declared that he was not peculiarly occupied just at present the emperor has left europe at last he said poor melmotte poisoned himself on friday and the inquest sat yesterday i dont know that there is anything of interest today of course lady carbury was intent upon her book rather even than on the exciting death of a man whom she had herself known oh if she could only get mr alf she had tried it before and had failed lamentably she was well aware of that and she had a deepseated conviction that it would be almost impossible to get mr alf but then she had another deepseated conviction that that which is almost impossible may possibly be done how great would be the glory how infinite the service and did it not seem as though providence had blessed her with this special opportunity sending mr alf to her just at the one moment at which she might introduce the subject of her novel without seeming premeditation  i am so tired she said affecting to throw herself back as though stretching her arms out for ease  i hope i am not adding to your fatigue said mr alf oh dear no it is not the fatigue of the moment but of the last six months just as you knocked at the door i had finished the novel at which i have been working oh with such diligence  oha novel when is it to appear lady carbury  you must ask leadham and loiter that question i have done my part of the work i suppose you never wrote a novel mr alf  i oh dear no i never write anything  i have sometimes wondered whether i have hated or loved it the most one becomes so absorbed in ones plot and ones characters one loves the loveable so intensely and hates with such fixed aversion those who are intended to be hated when the mind is attuned to it one is tempted to think that it is all so good one cries at ones own pathos laughs at ones own humour and is lost in admiration at ones own sagacity and knowledge  how very nice  but then there comes the reversed picture the other side of the coin on a sudden everything becomes flat tedious and unnatural the heroine who was yesterday alive with the celestial spark is found today to be a lump of motionless clay the dialogue that was so cheery on the first perusal is utterly uninteresting at a second reading yesterday i was sure that there was my monument and she put her hand upon the manuscript today i feel it to be only too heavy for a gravestone  ones judgement about ones self always does vacillate said mr alf in a tone as phlegmatic as were the words  and yet it is so important that one should be able to judge correctly of ones own work i can at any rate trust myself to be honest which is more perhaps than can be said of all the critics  dishonesty is not the general fault of the critics lady carburyat least not as far as i have observed the business it is incapacity in what little i have done in the matter that is the sin which i have striven to conquer when we want shoes we go to a professed shoemaker but for criticism we have certainly not gone to professed critics i think that when i gave up the evening pulpit i left upon it a staff of writers who are entitled to be regarded as knowing their business  you given up the pulpit asked lady carbury with astonishment readjusting her mind at once so that she might perceive whether any and if so what advantage might be taken of mr alfs new position he was no longer editor and therefore his heavy sense of responsibility would no longer existbut he must still have influence might he not be persuaded to do one act of real friendship might she not succeed if she would come down from her high seat sink on the ground before him tell him the plain truth and beg for a favour as a poor struggling woman  yes lady carbury i have given it up it was a matter of course that i should do so when i stood for parliament now that the new member has so suddenly vacated his seat i shall probably stand again  and you are no longer an editor  i have given it up and i suppose i have now satisfied the scruples of those gentlemen who seemed to think that i was committing a crime against the constitution in attempting to get into parliament while i was managing a newspaper i never heard such nonsense of course i know where it came from  where did it come from  where should it come from but the breakfast table broune and i have been very good friends but i do think that of all the men i know he is the most jealous  that is so little said lady carbury she was really very fond of mr broune but at the present moment she was obliged to humour mr alf  it seems to me that no man can be better qualified to sit in parliament than an editor of a newspaperthat is if he is capable as an editor  no one i think has ever doubted that of you  the only question is whether he be strong enough for the double work i have doubted about myself and have therefore given up the paper i almost regret it  i dare say you do said lady carbury feeling intensely anxious to talk about her own affairs instead of his i suppose you still retain an interest in the paper  some pecuniary interestnothing more  oh mr alfyou could do me such a favour  can i if i can you may be sure i will falsehearted falsetongued man of course he knew at the moment what was the favour lady carbury intended to ask and of course he had made up his mind that he would not do as he was asked  will you and lady carbury clasped her hands together as she poured forth the words of her prayer i never asked you to do anything for me as long as you were editing the paper did i i did not think it right and i would not do it i took my chance like others and i am sure you must own that i bore what was said of me with a good grace i never complained did i  certainly not  but now that you have left it yourselfif you would have the wheel of fortune done for mereally well done  the wheel of fortune  that is the name of my novel said lady carbury putting her hand softly upon the manuscript just at this moment it would be the making of a fortune for me and oh mr alf if you could but know how i want such assistance  i have nothing further to do with the editorial management lady carbury  of course you could get it done a word from you would make it certain a novel is different from an historical work you know i have taken so much pains with it  then no doubt it will be praised on its own merits  dont say that mr alf the evening pulpit is likeoh it is likelikelike the throne of heaven who can be justified before it dont talk about its own merits but say that you will have it done it couldnt do any man any harm and it would sell five hundred copies at oncethat is if it were done really con amore mr alf looked at her almost piteously and shook his head the paper stands so high it cant hurt it to do that kind of thing once a woman is asking you mr alf it is for my children that i am struggling the thing is done every day of the week with much less noble motives  i do not think that it has ever been done by the evening pulpit  i have seen books praised  of course you have  i think i saw a novel spoken highly of  mr alf laughed why not you do not suppose that it is the object of the pulpit to cry down novels  i thought it was but i thought you might make an exception here i would be so thankfulso grateful  my dear lady carbury pray believe me when i say that i have nothing to do with it i need not preach to you sermons about literary virtue  oh no she said not quite understanding what he meant  the sceptre has passed from my hands and i need not vindicate the justice of my successor  i shall never know your successor  but i must assure you that on no account should i think of meddling with the literary arrangement of the paper i would not do it for my sister lady carbury looked greatly pained send the book out and let it take its chance how much prouder you will be to have it praised because it deserves praise than to know that it has been eulogized as a mark of friendship  no i shant said lady carbury i dont believe that anything like real selling praise is ever given to anybody except to friends i dont know how they manage it but they do mr alf shook his head oh yes that is all very well from you of course you have been a dragon of virtue but they tell me that the authoress of the new cleopatra is a very handsome woman lady carbury must have been worried much beyond her wont when she allowed herself so far to lose her temper as to bring against mr alf the double charge of being too fond of the authoress in question and of having sacrificed the justice of his columns to that improper affection  at this moment i do not remember the name of the lady to whom you allude said mr alf getting up to take his leave and i am quite sure that the gentleman who reviewed the bookif there be any such lady and any such bookhad never seen her and so mr alf departed  lady carbury was very angry with herself and very angry also with mr alf she had not only meant to be piteous but had made the attempt and then had allowed herself to be carried away into anger she had degraded herself to humility and had then wasted any possible good result by a foolish fit of chagrin the world in which she had to live was almost too hard for her when left alone she sat weeping over her sorrows but when from time to time she thought of mr alf and his conduct she could hardly repress her scorn what lies he had told her of course he could have done it had he chosen but the assumed honesty of the man was infinitely worse to her than his lies no doubt the pulpit had two objects in its criticisms other papers probably had but one the object common to all papers that of helping friends and destroying enemies of course prevailed with the pulpit there was the second purpose of enticing readers by crushing authorsas crowds used to be enticed to see men hanged when executions were done in public but neither the one object nor the other was compatible with that aristidean justice which mr alf arrogated to himself and to his paper she hoped with all her heart that mr alf would spend a great deal of money at westminster and then lose his seat  on the following morning she herself took the manuscript to messrs leadham and loiter and was hurt again by the small amount of respect which seemed to be paid to the collected sheets there was the work of six months her very blood and brainsthe concentrated essence of her mindas she would say herself when talking with energy of her own performances and mr leadham pitched it across to a clerk apparently perhaps sixteen years of age and the lad chucked the parcel unceremoniously under the counter an author feels that his work should be taken from him with fastclutching but reverential hands and held thoughtfully out of harms way till it be deposited within the very sanctum of an absolutely fireproof safe oh heavens if it should be lostor burnedor stolen those scraps of paper so easily destroyed apparently so little respected may hereafter be acknowledged to have had a value greater so far greater than their weight in gold if robinson crusoe had been lost if tom jones had been consumed by flames and who knows but that this may be another robinson crusoea better than tom jones will it be safe there asked lady carbury  quite safequite safe said mr leadham who was rather busy and perhaps saw lady carbury more frequently than the nature and amount of her authorship seemed to him to require  it seemed to beput down thereunder the counter  thats quite right lady carbury theyre left there till theyre packed  packed  there are two or three dozen going to our reader this week hes down in skye and we keep them till theres enough to fill the sack  do they go by post mr leadham  not by post lady carbury there are not many of them would pay the expense we send them by long sea to glasgow because just at this time of the year there is not much hurry we cant publish before the winter oh heavens if that ship should be lost on its journey by long sea to glasgow  that evening as was now almost his daily habit mr browne came to her there was something in the absolute friendship which now existed between lady carbury and the editor of the morning breakfast table which almost made her scrupulous as to asking from him any further literary favour she fully recognizedno woman perhaps more fully the necessity of making use of all aid and furtherance which might come within reach with such a son with such need for struggling before her would she not be wicked not to catch even at every straw but this man had now become so true to her that she hardly knew how to beg him to do that which she with all her mistaken feelings did in truth know that he ought not to do he had asked her to marry him for whichthough she had refused himshe felt infinitely grateful and though she had refused him he had lent her money and had supported her in her misery by his continued counsel if he would offer to do this thing for her she would accept his kindness on her kneesbut even she could not bring herself to ask to have this added to his other favours her first word to him was about mr alf so he has given up the paper  well yesnominally  is that all  i dont suppose hell really let it go out of his own hands nobody likes to lose power hell share the work and keep the authority as for westminster i dont believe he has a chance if that poor wretch melmotte could beat him when everybody was already talking about the forgeries how is it likely that he should stand against such a candidate as theyll get now  he was here yesterday  and full of triumph i suppose  he never talks to me much of himself we were speaking of my new bookmy novel he assured me most positively that he had nothing further to do with the paper  he did not care to make you a promise i dare say  that was just it of course i did not believe him  neither will i make a promise but well see what we can do if we cant be goodnatured at any rate we will say nothing illnatured let me seewhat is the name  the wheel of fortune lady carbury as she told the title of her new book to her old friend seemed to be almost ashamed of it  let them send it earlya day or two before its out if they can i cant answer of course for the opinion of the gentleman it will go to but nothing shall go in that you would dislike goodbye god bless you and as he took her hand he looked at her almost as though the old susceptibility were returning to him  as she sat alone after he had gone thinking over it allthinking of her own circumstances and of his kindnessit did not occur to her to call him an old goose again she felt now that she had mistaken her man when she had so regarded him that first and only kiss which he had given her which she had treated with so much derision for which she had rebuked him so mildly and yet so haughtily had now a somewhat sacred spot in her memory through it all the man must have really loved her was it not marvellous that such a thing should be and how had it come to pass that she in all her tenderness had rejected him when he had given her the chance of becoming his wife     chapter xc  hettas sorrow   when hetta carbury received that letter from her lover which was given to the reader some chapters back it certainly did not tend in any way to alleviate her misery even when she had read it over halfadozen times she could not bring herself to think it possible that she could be reconciled to the man it was not only that he had sinned against her by giving his society to another woman to whom he had at any rate been engaged not long since at the very time at which he was becoming engaged to herbut also that he had done this in such a manner as to make his offence known to all her friends perhaps she had been too quickbut there was the fact that with her own consent she had acceded to her mothers demand that the man should be rejected the man had been rejected and even roger carbury knew that it was so after this it was she thought impossible that she should recall him but they should all know that her heart was unchanged roger carbury should certainly know that if he ever asked her further question on the matter she would never deny it and though she knew that the man had behaved badlyhaving entangled himself with a nasty american woman yet she would be true to him as far as her own heart was concerned  and now he told her that she had been most unjust to him he said that he could not understand her injustice he did not fill his letter with entreaties but with reproaches and certainly his reproaches moved her more than any prayer would have done it was too late now to remedy the evil but she was not quite sure within her own bosom that she had not been unjust to him the more she thought of it the more puzzled her mind became had she quarrelled with him because he had once been in love with mrs hurtle or because she had grounds for regarding mrs hurtle as her present rival she hated mrs hurtle and she was very angry with him in that he had ever been on affectionate terms with a woman she hatedbut that had not been the reason put forward by her for quarrelling with him perhaps it was true that he too had of late loved mrs hurtle hardly better than she did herself it might be that he had been indeed constrained by hard circumstances to go with the woman to lowestoft having so gone with her it was no doubt right that he should be rejectedfor how can it be that a man who is engaged shall be allowed to travel about the country with another woman to whom also he was engaged a few months back but still there might be hardship in it to her to hetta herself the circumstances were very hard she loved the man with all her heart she could look forward to no happiness in life without him but yet it must be so  at the end of his letter he had told her to go to mrs hurtle herself if she wanted corroboration of the story as told by him of course he had known when he wrote it that she could not and would not go to mrs hurtle but when the letter had been in her possession three or four daysunanswered for as a matter of course no answer to it from herself was possibleand had been read and reread till she knew every word of it by heart she began to think that if she could hear the story as it might be told by mrs hurtle a good deal that was now dark might become light to her as she continued to read the letter and to brood over it all by degrees her anger was turned from her lover to her mother her brother and to her cousin roger paul had of course behaved badly very badlybut had it not been for them she might have had an opportunity of forgiving him they had driven her on to the declaration of a purpose from which she could now see no escape there had been a plot against her and she was a victim in the first dismay and agony occasioned by that awful story of the american womanwhich had at the moment struck her with a horror which was now becoming less and less every hourshe had fallen head foremost into the trap laid for her she acknowledged to herself that it was too late to recover her ground she was at any rate almost sure that it must be too late but yet she was disposed to do battle with her mother and her cousin in the matterif only with the object of showing that she would not submit her own feelings to their control she was savage to the point of rebellion against all authority roger carbury would of course think that any communication between herself and mrs hurtle must be improperaltogether indelicate two or three days ago she thought so herself but the world was going so hard with her that she was beginning to feel herself capable of throwing propriety and delicacy to the winds this man whom she had once accepted whom she altogether loved and who in spite of all his faults certainly still loved herof that she was beginning to have no further doubtaccused her of dishonesty and referred her to her rival for a corroboration of his story she would appeal to mrs hurtle the woman was odious abominable a nasty intriguing american female but her lover desired that she should hear the womans story and she would hear the story if the woman would tell it  so resolving she wrote as follows to mrs hurtle finding great difficulty in the composition of a letter which should tell neither too little nor too much and determined that she would be restrained by no mock modesty by no girlish fear of declaring the truth about herself the letter at last was stiff and hard but it sufficed for its purpose      madam     mr paul montague has referred me to you as to certain    circumstances which have taken place between him and you it is    right that i should tell you that i was a short time since    engaged to marry him but that i have found myself obliged to    break off that engagement in consequence of what i have been    told as to his acquaintance with you i make this proposition to    you not thinking that anything you will say to me can change my    mind but because he has asked me to do so and has at the same    time accused me of injustice towards him i do not wish to rest    under an accusation of injustice from one to whom i was once    warmly attached if you will receive me i will make it my    business to call any afternoon you may name     yours truly     henrietta carbury   when the letter was written she was not only ashamed of it but very much afraid of it also what if the american woman should put it in a newspaper she had heard that everything was put into newspapers in america what if this mrs hurtle should send back to her some horribly insolent answeror should send such answer to her mother instead of herself and then again if the american woman consented to receive her would not the american woman as a matter of course trample upon her with rough words once or twice she put the letter aside and almost determined that it should not be sentbut at last with desperate fortitude she took it out with her and posted it herself she told no word of it to any one her mother she thought had been cruel to her had disregarded her feelings and made her wretched for ever she could not ask her mother for sympathy in her present distress there was no friend who would sympathize with her she must do everything alone  mrs hurtle it will be remembered had at last determined that she would retire from the contest and own herself to have been worsted it is i fear impossible to describe adequately the various half resolutions which she formed and the changing phases of her mind before she brought herself to this conclusion and soon after she had assured herself that this should be the conclusionafter she had told paul montague that it should be sothere came back upon her at times other half resolutions to a contrary effect she had written a letter to the man threatening desperate revenge and had then abstained from sending it and had then shown it to the mannot intending to give it to him as a letter upon which he would have to act but only that she might ask him whether had he received it he would have said that he had not deserved it then she had parted with him refusing either to hear or to say a word of farewell and had told mrs pipkin that she was no longer engaged to be married at that moment everything was done that could be done the game had been played and the stakes lost and she had schooled herself into such restraint as to have abandoned all idea of vengeance but from time to time there arose in her heart a feeling that such softness was unworthy of her who had ever been soft to her who had spared her had she not long since found out that she must fight with her very nails and teeth for every inch of ground if she did not mean to be trodden into the dust had she not held her own among rough people after a very rough fashion and should she now simply retire that she might weep in a corner like a lovesick schoolgirl and she had been so stoutly determined that she would at any rate avenge her own wrongs if she could not turn those wrongs into triumph there were moments in which she thought that she could still seize the man by the throat where all the world might see her and dare him to deny that he was false perjured and mean  then she received a long passionate letter from paul montague written at the same time as those other letters to roger carbury and hetta in which he told her all the circumstances of his engagement to hetta carbury and implored her to substantiate the truth of his own story it was certainly marvellous to her that the man who had so long been her own lover and who had parted with her after such a fashion should write such a letter to her but it had no tendency to increase either her anger or her sorrow of course she had known that it was so and at certain times she had told herself that it was only naturalhad almost told herself that it was right she and this young englishman were not fit to be mated he was to her thinking a tame sleek household animal whereas she knew herself to be wildfitter for the woods than for polished cities it had been one of the faults of her life that she had allowed herself to be bound by tenderness of feeling to this soft overcivilised man the result had been disastrous as might have been expected she was angry with himalmost to the extent of tearing him to piecesbut she did not become more angry because he wrote to her of her rival  her only present friend was mrs pipkin who treated her with the greatest deference but who was never tired of asking questions about the lost lover that letter was from mr montague said mrs pipkin on the morning after it had been received  how can you know that  im sure it was one does get to know handwritings when letters come frequent  it was from him and why not  oh dear nowhy not certainly i wish hed write every day of his life so that things would come round again nothing ever troubles me so much as broken love why dont he come again himself mrs hurtle  it is not at all likely that he should come again it is all over and there is no good in talking of it i shall return to new york on saturday week  oh mrs hurtle  i cant remain here you know all my life doing nothing i came over here for a certain purpose and that hasgone by now i may just go back again  i know he has illtreated you i know he has  i am not disposed to talk about it mrs pipkin  i should have thought it would have done you good to speak your mind out free i knew it would me if id been served in that way  if i had anything to say at all after that fashion it would be to the gentleman and not to any other else as it is i shall never speak of it again to any one you have been very kind to me mrs pipkin and i shall be sorry to leave you  oh mrs hurtle you cant understand what it is to me it isnt only my feelings the likes of me cant stand by their feelings only as their betters do ive never been above telling you what a godsend youve been to me this summerhave i ive paid everything butcher baker rates and all just like clockwork and now youre going away then mrs pipkin began to sob  i suppose i shall see mr crumb before i go said mrs hurtle  she dont deserve it do she and even now she never says a word about him that i call respectful she looks on him as just being better than mrs bugginss children thats all  shell be all right when he has once got her home  and i shall be all alone by myself said mrs pipkin with her apron up to her eyes  it was after this that mrs hurtle received hettas letter she had as yet returned no answer to paul montaguenor had she intended to send any written answer were she to comply with his request she could do so best by writing to the girl who was concerned rather than to him and though she wrote no such letter she thought of itof the words she would use were she to write it and of the tale which she would have to tell she sat for hours thinking of it trying to resolve whether she would tell the taleif she told it at allin a manner to suit pauls purpose or so as to bring that purpose utterly to shipwreck she did not doubt that she could cause the shipwreck were she so minded she could certainly have her revenge after that fashion but it was a womans fashion and as such did not recommend itself to mrs hurdles feelings a pistol or a horsewhip a violent seizing by the neck with sharp taunts and bitterringing words would have made the fitting revenge if she abandoned that she could do herself no good by telling a story of her wrongs to another woman  then came hettas note so stiff so cold so trueso like the letter of an englishwoman as mrs hurtle said to herself mrs hurtle smiled as she read the letter i make this proposition not thinking that anything you can say to me can change my mind of course the girls mind would be changed the girls mind indeed required no change mrs hurtle could see well enough that the girls heart was set upon the man nevertheless she did not doubt but that she could tell the story after such a fashion as to make it impossible that the girl should marry himif she chose to do so  at first she thought that she would not answer the letter at all what was it to her let them fight their own lovers battles out after their own childish fashion if the man meant at last to be honest there could be no doubt mrs hurtle thought that the girl would go to him it would require no interference of hers but after a while she thought that she might as well see this english chit who had superseded herself in the affections of the englishman she had condescended to love and if it were the case that all revenge was to be abandoned that no punishment was to be exacted in return for all the injury that had been done why should she not say a kind word so as to smooth away the existing difficulties wild cat as she was kindness was more congenial to her nature than cruelty so she wrote to hetta making an appointment      dear miss carbury     if you could make it convenient to yourself to call here either    thursday or friday at any hour between two and four i shall be very    happy to see you     yours sincerely     winifred hurtle     chapter xci  the rivals   during these days the intercourse between lady carbury and her daughter was constrained and far from pleasant hetta thinking that she was illused kept herself aloof and would not speak to her mother of herself or of her troubles lady carbury watching her but not daring to say much was at last almost frightened at her girls silence she had assured herself when she found that hetta was disposed to quarrel with her lover and to send him back his brooch that things would come round that paul would be forgotten quickly or laid aside as though he were forgottenand that hetta would soon perceive it to be her interest to marry her cousin with such a prospect before her lady carbury thought it to be her duty as a mother to show no tendency to sympathize with her girls sorrow such heartbreakings were occurring daily in the world around them who were the happy people that were driven neither by ambition nor poverty nor greed nor the cross purposes of unhappy love to stifle and trample upon their feelings she had known no one so blessed she had never been happy after that fashion she herself had within the last few weeks refused to join her lot with that of a man she really liked because her wicked son was so grievous a burden on her shoulders a woman she thought if she were unfortunate enough to be a lady without wealth of her own must give up everything her body her hearther very soul if she were that way troubledto the procuring of a fitting maintenance for herself why should hetta hope to be more fortunate than others and then the position which chance now offered to her was fortunate this cousin of hers who was so devoted to her was in all respects good he would not torture her by harsh restraint and cruel temper he would not drink he would not spend his money foolishly he would allow her all the belongings of a fair free life lady carbury reiterated to herself the assertion that she was manifestly doing a mothers duty by her endeavours to constrain her girl to marry such a man with a settled purpose she was severe and hard but when she found how harsh her daughter could be in response to thishow gloomy how silent and how severe in retaliationshe was almost frightened at what she herself was doing she had not known how stern and how enduring her daughter could be hetta she said why dont you speak to me on this very day it was hettas purpose to visit mrs hurtle at islington she had said no word of her intention to any one she had chosen the friday because on that day she knew her mother would go in the afternoon to her publisher there should be no deceit immediately on her return she would tell her mother what she had done but she considered herself to be emancipated from control among them they had robbed her of her lover she had submitted to the robbery but she would submit to nothing else hetta why dont you speak to me said lady carbury  because mamma there is nothing we can talk about without making each other unhappy  what a dreadful thing to say is there no subject in the world to interest you except that wretched young man  none other at all said hetta obstinately  what folly it isi will not say only to speak like that but to allow yourself to entertain such thoughts  how am i to control my thoughts do you think mamma that after i had owned to you that i loved a manafter i had owned it to him and worst of all to myselfi could have myself separated from him and then not think about it it is a cloud upon everything it is as though i had lost my eyesight and my speech it is as it would be to you if felix were to die it crushes me  there was an accusation in this allusion to her brother which the mother feltas she was intended to feel itbut to which she could make no reply it accused her of being too much concerned for her son to feel any real affection for her daughter you are ignorant of the world hetta she said  i am having a lesson in it now at any rate  do you think it is worse than others have suffered before you in what little you see around you do you think that girls are generally able to marry the men upon whom they set their hearts she paused but hetta made no answer to this marie melmotte was as warmly attached to your brother as you can be to mr montague  marie melmotte  she thinks as much of her feelings as you do of yours the truth is you are indulging a dream you must wake from it and shake yourself and find out that you like others have got to do the best you can for yourself in order that you may live the world at large has to eat dry bread and cannot get cakes and sweetmeats a girl when she thinks of giving herself to a husband has to remember this if she has a fortune of her own she can pick and choose but if she have none she must allow herself to be chosen  then a girl is to marry without stopping even to think whether she likes the man or not  she should teach herself to like the man if the marriage be suitable i would not have you take a vicious man because he was rich or one known to be cruel and imperious your cousin roger you know  mamma said hetta getting up from her seat you may as well believe me no earthly inducement shall ever make me marry my cousin roger it is to me horrible that you should propose it to me when you know that i love that other man with my whole heart  how can you speak so of one who has treated you with the utmost contumely  i know nothing of any contumely what reasons have i to be offended because he has liked a woman whom he knew before he ever saw me it has been unfortunate wretched miserable but i do not know that i have any right whatever to be angry with mr paul montague having so spoken she walked out of the room without waiting for a further reply  it was all very sad to lady carbury she perceived now that she had driven her daughter to pronounce an absolution of paul montagues sins and that in this way she had lessened and loosened the barrier which she had striven to construct between them but that which pained her most was the unrealistic romantic view of life which pervaded all hettas thoughts how was any girl to live in this world who could not be taught the folly of such idle dreams  that afternoon hetta trusted herself all alone to the mysteries of the marylebone underground railway and emerged with accuracy at kings cross she had studied her geography and she walked from thence to islington she knew well the name of the street and the number at which mrs hurtle lived but when she reached the door she did not at first dare to stand and raise the knocker she passed on to the end of the silent vacant street endeavouring to collect her thoughts striving to find and to arrange the words with which she would commence her strange petition and she endeavoured to dictate to herself some defined conduct should the woman be insolent to her personally she was not a coward but she doubted her power of replying to a rough speech she could at any rate escape should the worst come to the worst the woman would hardly venture to impede her departure having gone to the end of the street she returned with a very quick step and knocked at the door it was opened almost immediately by ruby ruggles to whom she gave her name  oh lawsmiss carbury said ruby looking up into the strangers face yessure enough she must be felixs sister but ruby did not dare to ask any question she had admitted to all around her that sir felix should not be her lover any more and that john crumb should be allowed to return but nevertheless her heart twittered as she showed miss carbury up to the lodgers sittingroom  though it was midsummer hetta entered the room with her veil down she adjusted it as she followed ruby up the stairs moved by a sudden fear of her rivals scrutiny mrs hurtle rose from her chair and came forward to greet her visitor putting out both her hands to do so she was dressed with the most scrupulous caresimply and in black without an ornament of any kind without a ribbon or a chain or a flower but with some womans purpose at her heart she had so attired herself as to look her very best was it that she thought that she would vindicate to her rival their joint lovers first choice or that she was minded to teach the english girl that an american woman might have graces of her own as she came forward she was gentle and soft in her movements and a pleasant smile played round her mouth hetta at the first moment was almost dumbfounded by her beautyby that and by her ease and exquisite selfpossession miss carbury she said with that low rich voice which in old days had charmed paul almost as much as her loveliness i need not tell you how interested i am in seeing you may i not ask you to lay aside your veil so that we may look at each other fairly hetta dumbfounded not knowing how to speak a word stood gazing at the woman when she had removed her veil she had had no personal description of mrs hurtle but had expected something very different from this she had thought that the woman would be coarse and big with fine eyes and a bright colour as it was they were both of the same complexion both dark with hair nearly black with eyes of the same colour hetta thought of all that at the momentbut acknowledged to herself that she had no pretension to beauty such as that which this woman owned and so you have come to see me said mrs hurtle sit down so that i may look at you i am glad that you have come to see me miss carbury  i am glad at any rate that you are not angry  why should i be angry had the idea been distasteful to me i should have declined i know not why but it is a sort of pleasure to me to see you it is a poor time we women haveis it notin becoming playthings to men so this lothario that was once mine is behaving badly to you also is it so he is no longer mine and you may ask me freely for aid if there be any that i can give you if he were an american i should say that he had behaved badly to mebut as he is an englishman perhaps it is different now tell mewhat can i do or what can i say  he told me that you could tell me the truth  what truth i will certainly tell you nothing that is not true you have quarrelled with him too it is not so  certainly i have quarrelled with him  i am not curiousbut perhaps you had better tell me of that i know him so well that i can guess that he should give offence he can be full of youthful ardour one day and cautious as old age itself the next but i do not suppose that there has been need for such caution with you what is it miss carbury  hetta found the telling of her story to be very difficult  mrs hurtle she said i had never heard your name when he first asked me to be his wife  i dare say not why should he have told you anything of me  becauseoh because surely he ought if it is true that he had once promised to marry you  that is certainly true  and you were here and i knew nothing of it of course i should have been very different to him had i known thatthatthat  that there was such a woman as winifred hurtle interfering with him then you heard it by chance and you were offended was it not so  and now he tells me that i have been unjust to him and he bids me ask you i have not been unjust  i am not so sure of that shall i tell you what i think i think that he has been unjust to me and that therefore your injustice to him is no more than his due i cannot plead for him miss carbury to me he has been the last and worst of a long series of i think undeserved misfortune but whether you will avenge my wrongs must be for you to decide  why did he go with you to lowestoft  because i asked himand because like many men he cannot be illnatured although he can be cruel he would have given a hand not to have gone but he could not say me nay as you have come here miss carbury you may as well know the truth he did love me but he had been talked out of his love by my enemies and his own friends long before he had ever seen you i am almost ashamed to tell you my own part of the story and yet i know not why i should be ashamed i followed him here to englandbecause i loved him i came after him as perhaps a woman should not do because i was true of heart he had told me that he did not want mebut i wanted to be wanted and i hoped that i might lure him back to his troth i have utterly failed and i must return to my own countryi will not say a brokenhearted woman for i will not admit of such a conditionbut a creature with a broken spirit he has misused me foully and i have simply forgiven him not because i am a christian but because i am not strong enough to punish one that i still love i could not put a dagger into himor i would or a bulletor i would he has reduced me to a nothing by his falseness and yet i cannot injure him i who have sworn to myself that no man should ever lay a finger on me in scorn without feeling my wrath in return i cannot punish him but if you choose to do so it is not for me to set you against such an act of justice then she paused and looked up to hetta as though expecting a reply  but hetta had no reply to make all had been said that she had come to hear every word that the woman had spoken had in truth been a comfort to her she had told herself that her visit was to be made in order that she might be justified in her condemnation of her lover she had believed that it was her intention to arm herself with proof that she had done right in rejecting him now she was told that however false her lover might have been to this other woman he had been absolutely true to her the woman had not spoken kindly of paulhad seemed to intend to speak of him with the utmost severity but she had so spoken as to acquit him of all sin against hetta what was it to hetta that her lover had been false to this american stranger it did not seem to her to be at all necessary that she should be angry with her lover on that head mrs hurtle had told her that she herself must decide whether she would take upon herself to avenge her rivals wrongs in saying that mrs hurtle had taught her to feel that there were no other wrongs which she need avenge it was all done now if she could only thank the woman for the pleasantness of her demeanour and then go she could when alone make up her mind as to what she would do next she had not yet told herself she would submit herself again to paul montague she had only told herself that within her own breast she was bound to forgive him you have been very kind she said at lastspeaking only because it was necessary that she should say something  it is well that there should be some kindness where there has been so much that is unkind forgive me miss carbury if i speak plainly to you of course you will go back to him of course you will be his wife you have told me that you love him dearly as plainly as i have told you the same story of myself your coming here would of itself have declared it even if i did not see your satisfaction at my account of his treachery to me  oh mrs hurtle do not say that of me  but it is true and i do not in the least quarrel with you on that account he has preferred you to me and as far as i am concerned there is an end of it you are a girl whereas i am a womanand he likes your youth i have undergone the cruel roughness of the world which has not as yet touched you and therefore you are softer to the touch i do not know that you are very superior in other attractions but that has sufficed and you are the victor i am strong enough to acknowledge that i have nothing to forgive in youand am weak enough to forgive all his treachery hetta was now holding the woman by the hand and was weeping she knew not why i am so glad to have seen you continued mrs hurtle so that i may know what his wife was like in a few days i shall return to the states and then neither of you will ever be troubled further by winifred hurtle tell him that if he will come and see me once before i go i will not be more unkind to him than i can help  when hetta did not decline to be the bearer of this message she must have at any rate resolved that she would see paul montague againand to see him would be to tell him that she was again his own she now got herself quickly out of the room absolutely kissing the woman whom she had both dreaded and despised as soon as she was alone in the street she tried to think of it all how full of beauty was the face of that american femalehow rich and glorious her voice in spite of a slight taint of the wellknown nasal twangand above all how powerful and at the same time how easy and how gracious was her manner that she would be an unfit wife for paul montague was certain to hetta but that he or any man should have loved her and have been loved by her and then have been willing to part from her was wonderful and yet paul montague had preferred herself hetta carbury to this woman paul had certainly done well for his own cause when he had referred the younger lady to the elder  of her own quarrel of course there must be an end she had been unjust to the man and injustice must of course be remedied by repentance and confession as she walked quickly back to the railway station she brought herself to love her lover more fondly than she had ever done he had been true to her from the first hour of their acquaintance what truth higher than that has any woman a right to desire no doubt she gave to him a virgin heart no other man had ever touched her lips or been allowed to press her hand or to look into her eyes with unrebuked admiration it was her pride to give herself to the man she loved after this fashion pure and white as snow on which no foot has trodden but in taking him all that she wanted was that he should be true to her now and henceforward the future must be her own work as to the now she felt that mrs hurtle had given her sufficient assurance  she must at once let her mother know this change in her mind when she reentered the house she was no longer sullen no longer anxious to be silent very willing to be gracious if she might be received with favourbut quite determined that nothing should shake her purpose she went at once into her mothers room having heard from the boy at the door that lady carbury had returned  hetta wherever have you been asked lady carbury  mamma she said i mean to write to mr montague and tell him that i have been unjust to him  hetta you must do nothing of the kind said lady carbury rising from her seat  yes mamma i have been unjust and i must do so  it will be asking him to come back to you  yes mammathat is what i mean i shall tell him that if he will come i will receive him i know he will come oh mamma let us be friends and i will tell you everything why should you grudge me my love  you have sent him back his brooch said lady carbury hoarsely  he shall give it me again hear what i have done i have seen that american lady  mrs hurtle  yesi have been to her she is a wonderful woman  and she has told you wonderful lies  why should she lie to me she has told me no lies she said nothing in his favour  i can well believe that what can any one say in his favour  but she told me that which has assured me that mr montague has never behaved badly to me i shall write to him at once if you like i will show you the letter  any letter to him i will tear said lady carbury full of anger  mamma i have told you everything but in this i must judge for myself then hetta seeing that her mother would not relent left the room without further speech and immediately opened her desk that the letter might be written     chapter xcii  hamilton k fisker again   ten days had passed since the meeting narrated in the last chapter ten days during which hettas letter had been sent to her lover but in which she had received no replywhen two gentlemen met each other in a certain room in liverpool who were seen together in the same room in the early part of this chronicle these were our young friend paul montague and our not much older friend hamilton k fisker melmotte had died on the 18th of july and tidings of the event had been at once sent by telegraph to san francisco some weeks before this montague had written to his partner giving his account of the south central pacific and mexican railway companydescribing its condition in england as he then believed it to beand urging fisker to come over to london on receipt of a message from his american correspondent he had gone down to liverpool and had there awaited fiskers arrival taking counsel with his friend mr ramsbottom in the meantime hettas letter was lying at the beargarden paul having written from his club and having omitted to desire that the answer should be sent to his lodgings just at this moment things at the beargarden were not well managed they were indeed so ill managed that paul never received that letterwhich would have had for him charms greater than those of any letter ever before written  this is a terrible business said fisker immediately on entering the room in which montague was waiting him he was the last man id have thought would be cut up in that way  he was utterly ruined  he wouldnt have been ruinedand couldnt have thought so if hed known all he ought to have known the south central would have pulled him through almost anything if hed have understood how to play it  we dont think much of the south central here now said paul  ahthats because youve never above half spirit enough for a big thing you nibble at it instead of swallowing it wholeand then of course folks see that youre only nibbling i thought that melmotte would have had spirit  there is i fear no doubt that he had committed forgery it was the dread of detection as to that which drove him to destroy himself  i call it dam clumsy from beginning to enddam clumsy i took him to be a different man and i feel more than half ashamed of myself because i trusted such a fellow that chap cohenlupe has got off with a lot of swag only think of melmotte allowing cohenlupe to get the better of him  i suppose the thing will be broken up now at san francisco suggested paul  bust up at frisco not if i know it why should it be bust up dyou think were all going to smash there because a fool like melmotte blows his brains out in london  he took poison  or pison either thats not just our way ill tell you what im going to do and why im over here so uncommon sharp these shares are at amost nothing now in london ill buy every share in the market i wired for as many as i dard so as not to spoil our own game and ill make a clean sweep of every one of them bust up im sorry for him because i thought him a biggish manbut what hes donell just be the making of us over there will you get out of it or will you come back to frisco with me  in answer to this paul asserted most strenuously that he would not return to san francisco and perhaps too ingenuously gave his partner to understand that he was altogether sick of the great railway and would under no circumstances have anything more to do with it fisker shrugged his shoulders and was not displeased at the proposed rupture he was prepared to deal fairlynay generouslyby his partner having recognized the wisdom of that great commercial rule which teaches us that honour should prevail among associates of a certain class but he had fully convinced himself that paul montague was not a fit partner for hamilton k fisker fisker was not only unscrupulous himself but he had a thorough contempt for scruples in others according to his theory of life nine hundred and ninetynine men were obscure because of their scruples whilst the thousandth man predominated and cropped up into the splendour of commercial wealth because he was free from such bondage he had his own theories too as to commercial honesty that which he had promised to do he would do if it was within his power he was anxious that his bond should be good and his word equally so but the work of robbing mankind in gross by magnificently false representations was not only the duty but also the delight and the ambition of his life how could a man so great endure a partnership with one so small as paul montague and now what about winifred hurtle asked fisker  what makes you ask shes in london  oh yes i know shes in london and hurdles at frisco swearing that hell come after her he would only he hasnt got the dollars  hes not dead then muttered paul  deadno nor likely to die shell have a bad time of it with him yet  but she divorced him  she got a kansas lawyer to say so and hes got a frisco lawyer to say that theres nothing of the kind she hasnt played her game badly neither for shes had the handling of her own money and has put it so that he cant get hold of a dollar even if it suited other ways you know i wouldnt marry her myself till i saw my way clearer out of the wood  im not thinking of marrying herif you mean that  there was a talk about it in friscothats all and i have heard hurtle say when he was a little farther gone than usual that she was here with you and that he meant to drop in on you some of these days to this paul made no answer thinking that he had now both heard enough and said enough about mrs hurtle  on the following day the two men who were still partners went together to london and fisker immediately became immersed in the arrangement of melmottes affairs he put himself into communication with mr brehgert went in and out of the offices in abchurch lane and the rooms which had belonged to the railway company crossexamined croll mastered the books of the company as far as they were to be mastered and actually summoned both the grendalls father and son up to london lord alfred and miles with him had left london a day or two before melmottes deathhaving probably perceived that there was no further occasion for their services to fiskers appeal lord alfred was proudly indifferent who was this american that he should call upon a director of the london company to appear does not every one know that a director of a company need not direct unless he pleases lord alfred therefore did not even condescend to answer fiskers letterbut he advised his son to run up to town i should just go because id taken a salary from the d company said the careful father but when there i wouldnt say a word so miles grendall obeying his parent reappeared upon the scene  but fiskers attention was perhaps most usefully and most sedulously paid to madame melmotte and her daughter till fisker arrived no one had visited them in their solitude at hampstead except croll the clerk mr brehgert had abstained thinking that a widow who had become a widow under such terrible circumstances would prefer to be alone lord nidderdale had made his adieux and felt that he could do no more it need hardly be said that lord alfred had too much good taste to interfere at such a time although for some months he had been domestically intimate with the poor woman or that sir felix would not be prompted by the fathers death to renew his suit to the daughter but fisker had not been two days in london before he went out to hampstead and was admitted to madame melmottes presenceand he had not been there four days before he was aware that in spite of all misfortunes marie melmotte was still the undoubted possessor of a large fortune  in regard to melmottes effects generally the crown had been induced to abstain from interferinggiving up the right to all the mans plate and chairs and tables which it had acquired by the finding of the coroners verdictnot from tenderness to madame melmotte for whom no great commiseration was felt but on behalf of such creditors as poor mr longestaffe and his son but maries money was quite distinct from this she had been right in her own belief as to this property and had been right too in refusing to sign those papersunless it may be that that refusal led to her fathers act she herself was sure that it was not so because she had withdrawn her refusal and had offered to sign the papers before her fathers death what might have been the ultimate result had she done so when he first made the request no one could now say that the money would have gone there could be no doubt the money was now hersa fact which fisker soon learned with that peculiar cleverness which belonged to him  poor madame melmotte felt the visits of the american to be a relief to her in her misery the world makes great mistakes as to that which is and is not beneficial to those whom death has bereaved of a companion it may be no doubt sometimes it is the case that grief shall be so heavy so absolutely crushing as to make any interference with it an additional trouble and this is felt also in acute bodily pain and in periods of terrible mental suffering it may also be and no doubt often is the case that the bereaved one chooses to affect such overbearing sorrow and that friends abstain because even such affectation has its own rights and privileges but madame melmotte was neither crushed by grief nor did she affect to be so crushed she had been numbed by the suddenness and by the awe of the catastrophe the man who had been her merciless tyrant for years who had seemed to her to be a very incarnation of cruel power had succumbed and shown himself to be powerless against his own misfortunes she was a woman of very few words and had spoken almost none on this occasion even to her own daughter but when fisker came to her and told her more than she had ever known before of her husbands affairs and spoke to her of her future life and mixed for her a small glass of brandyandwater warm and told her that frisco would be the fittest place for her future residence she certainly did not find him to be intrusive  and even marie liked fisker though she had been wooed and almost won both by a lord and a baronet and had understood if not much at least more than her mother of the life to which she had been introduced there was something of real sorrow in her heart for her father she was prone to lovethough perhaps not prone to deep affection melmotte had certainly been often cruel to her but he had also been very indulgent and as she had never been specially grateful for the one so neither had she ever specially resented the other tenderness care real solicitude for her wellbeing she had never known and had come to regard the unevenness of her life vacillating between knocks and knickknacks with a blow one day and a jewel the next as the condition of things which was natural to her when her father was dead she remembered for a while the jewels and the knickknacks and forgot the knocks and blows but she was not beyond consolation and she also found consolation in mr fiskers visits  i used to sign a paper every quarter she said to fisker as they were walking together one evening in the lanes round hampstead  youll have to do the same now only instead of giving the paper to any one youll have to leave it in a bankers hands to draw the money for yourself  and can that be done over in california  just the same as here your bankers will manage it all for you without the slightest trouble for the matter of that ill do it if youll trust me theres only one thing against it all miss melmotte  and whats that  after the sort of society youve been used to here i dont know how youll get on among us americans were a pretty rough lot i guess though perhaps what you lose in the look of the fruit youll make up in the flavour this fisker said in a somewhat plaintive tone as though fearing that the manifest substantial advantages of frisco would not suffice to atone for the loss of that fashion to which miss melmotte had been used  i hate swells said marie flashing round upon him  do you now  like poison whats the use of em they never mean a word that they sayand they dont say so many words either theyre never more than half awake and dont care the least about anybody i hate london  do you now  oh dont i  i wonder whether youd hate frisco  i rather think it would be a jolly sort of place  very jolly i find it and i wonder whether youd hateme  mr fisker thats nonsense why should i hate anybody  but you do ive found out one or two that you dont love if you do come to frisco i hope you wont just hate me you know then he took her gently by the armbut she whisking herself away rapidly bade him behave himself then they returned to their lodgings and mr fisker before he went back to london mixed a little warm brandyandwater for madame melmotte i think that upon the whole madame melmotte was more comfortable at hampstead than she had been either in grosvenor square or bruton street although she was certainly not a thing beautiful to look at in her widows weeds  i dont think much of you as a bookkeeper you know fisker said to miles grendall in the now almost deserted boardroom of the south central pacific and mexican railway miles remembering his fathers advice answered not a word but merely looked with assumed amazement at the impertinent stranger who dared thus to censure his performances fisker had made three or four remarks previous to this and had appealed both to paul montague and to croll who were present he had invited also the attendance of sir felix carbury lord nidderdale and mr longestaffe who were all directorsbut none of them had come sir felix had paid no attention to fiskers letter lord nidderdale had written a short but characteristic reply dear mr fiskeri really dont know anything about it yours nidderdale mr longestaffe with laborious zeal had closely covered four pages with his reasons for nonattendance with which the reader shall not be troubled and which it may be doubted whether even fisker perused to the end upon my word continued fisker its astonishing to me that melmotte should have put up with this kind of thing i suppose you understand something of business mr croll  it vas not my department mr fisker said the german  nor anybody elses either said the domineering american of course its on the cards mr grendall that we shall have to put you into a witnessbox because there are certain things we must get at miles was silent as the grave but at once made up his mind that he would pass his autumn at some pleasant but economical german retreat and that his autumnal retirement should be commenced within a very few daysor perhaps hours might suffice  but fisker was not in earnest in his threat in truth the greater the confusion in the london office the better he thought were the prospects of the company at san francisco miles underwent purgatory on this occasion for three or four hours and when dismissed had certainly revealed none of melmottes secrets he did however go to germany finding that a temporary absence from england would be comfortable to him in more respects than oneand need not be heard of again in these pages  when melmottes affairs were ultimately wound up there was found to be nearly enough of property to satisfy all his proved liabilities very many men started up with huge claims asserting that they had been robbed and in the confusion it was hard to ascertain who had been robbed or who had simply been unsuccessful in their attempts to rob others some no doubt as was the case with poor mr brehgert had speculated in dependence on melmottes sagacity and had lost heavily without dishonesty but of those who like the longestaffes were able to prove direct debts the condition at last was not very sad our excellent friend dolly got his money early in the day and was able under mr squercums guidance to start himself on a new career having paid his debts and with still a large balance at his bankers he assured his friend nidderdale that he meant to turn over an entirely new leaf i shall just make squercum allow me so much a month and i shall have all the bills and that kind of thing sent to him and he will do everything and pull me up if im getting wrong i like squercum  wont he rob you old fellow suggested nidderdale  of course he willbut he wont let any one else do it one has to be plucked but its everything to have it done on a system if hell only let me have ten shillings out of every sovereign i think i can get along let us hope that mr squercum was merciful and that dolly was enabled to live in accordance with his virtuous resolutions  but these things did not arrange themselves till late in the winter long after mr fiskers departure for california that however was protracted till a day much later than he anticipated before he had become intimate with madame melmotte and marie madame melmottes affairs occupied him for a while almost exclusively the furniture and plate were of course sold for the creditors but madame melmotte was allowed to take whatever she declared to be specially her own propertyand though much was said about the jewels no attempt was made to recover them marie advised madame melmotte to give them up assuring the old woman that she should have whatever she wanted for her maintenance but it was not likely that melmottes widow would willingly abandon any property and she did not abandon her jewels it was agreed between her and fisker that they were to be taken to new york youll get as much there as in london if you like to part with them and nobodyll say anything about it there you couldnt sell a locket or chain here without all the world talking about it  in all these things madame melmotte put herself into fiskers hands with the most absolute confidenceand indeed with a confidence that was justified by its results it was not by robbing an old woman that fisker intended to make himself great to madame melmottes thinking fisker was the finest gentleman she had ever metso infinitely pleasanter in his manner than lord alfred even when lord alfred had been most gracious with so much more to say for himself than miles grendall understanding her so much better than any man had ever doneespecially when he supplied her with those small warm beakers of sweet brandyandwater i shall do whatever he tells me she said to marie im sure ive nothing to keep me here in this country  im willing to go said marie i dont want to stay in london  i suppose youll take him if he asks you  i dont know anything about that said marie a man may be very well without ones wanting to marry him i dont think ill marry anybody whats the use its only money nobody cares for anything else fiskers all very well but he only wants the money do you think fiskerd ask me to marry him if i hadnt got anything not he he aint slow enough for that  i think hes a very nice young man said madame melmotte     chapter xciii  a true lover   hetta carbury out of the fullness of her heart having made up her mind that she had been unjust to her lover wrote to him a letter full of penitence full of love telling him at great length all the details of her meeting with mrs hurtle and bidding him come back to her and bring the brooch with him but this letter she had unfortunately addressed to the beargarden as he had written to her from that club and partly through his own fault and partly through the demoralization of that once perfect establishment the letter never reached his hands when therefore he returned to london he was justified in supposing that she had refused even to notice his appeal he was however determined that he would still make further struggles he had he felt to contend with many difficulties mrs hurtle roger carbury and hettas mother were he thought all inimical to him mrs hurtle though she had declared that she would not rage as a lioness could hardly be his friend in the matter roger had repeatedly declared his determination to regard him as a traitor and lady carbury as he well knew had always been and always would be opposed to the match but hetta had owned that she loved him had submitted to his caresses and had been proud of his admiration and paul though he did not probably analyse very carefully the character of his beloved still felt instinctively that having so far prevailed with such a girl his prospects could not be altogether hopeless and yet how should he continue the struggle with what weapons should he carry on the fight the writing of letters is but a onesided troublesome proceeding when the person to whom they are written will not answer them and the calling at a door at which the servant has been instructed to refuse a visitor admission becomes disagreeable if not degradingafter a time  but hetta had written a second epistlenot to her lover but to one who received his letters with more regularity when she rashly and with precipitate wrath quarrelled with paul montague she at once communicated the fact to her mother and through her mother to her cousin roger though she would not recognize roger as a lover she did acknowledge him to be the head of her family and her own special friend and entitled in some special way to know all that she herself did and all that was done in regard to her she therefore wrote to her cousin telling him that she had made a mistake about paul that she was convinced that paul had always behaved to her with absolute sincerity and in short that paul was the best and dearest and most illused of human beings in her enthusiasm she went on to declare that there could be no other chance of happiness for her in this world than that of becoming pauls wife and to beseech her dearest friend and cousin roger not to turn against her but to lend her an aiding hand there are those whom strong words in letters never affect at allwho perhaps hardly read them and take what they do read as meaning no more than half what is said but roger carbury was certainly not one of these as he sat on the garden wall at carbury with his cousins letter in his hand her words had their full weight with him he did not try to convince himself that all this was the verbiage of an enthusiastic girl who might soon be turned and trained to another mode of thinking by fitting admonitions to him now as he read and reread hettas letter sitting on the wall there was not at any rate further hope for himself though he was altogether unchanged himself though he was altogether incapable of change though he could not rally himself sufficiently to look forward to even a passive enjoyment of life without the girl whom he had lovedyet he told himself what he believed to be the truth at last he owned directly and plainly that whether happy or unhappy he must do without her he had let time slip by with him too fast and too far before he had ventured to love he must now stomach his disappointment and make the best he could of such a broken illconditioned life as was left to him but if he acknowledged thisand he did acknowledge itin what fashion should he in future treat the man and woman who had reduced him so low  at this moment his mind was tuned to high thoughts if it were possible he would be unselfish he could not indeed bring himself to think with kindness of paul montague he could not say to himself that the man had not been treacherous to him nor could he forgive the mans supposed treason but he did tell himself very plainly that in comparison with hetta the man was nothing to him it could hardly be worth his while to maintain a quarrel with the man if he were once able to assure hetta that she as the wife of another man should still be dear to him as a friend might be dear he was well aware that such assurance such forgiveness must contain very much if it were to be so hettas child must take the name of carbury and must be to him as his heiras near as possible his own child in her favour he must throw aside that law of primogeniture which to him was so sacred that he had been hitherto minded to make sir felix his heir in spite of the absolute unfitness of the wretched young man all this must be changed should he be able to persuade himself to give his consent to the marriage in such case carbury must be the home of the married couple as far as he could induce them to make it so there must be born the future infant to whose existence he was already looking forward with some idea that in his old age he might there find comfort in such case though he should never again be able to love paul montague in his heart of hearts he must live with him for her sake on affectionate terms he must forgive hetta altogetheras though there had been no fault and he must strive to forgive the mans fault as best he might struggling as he was to be generous passionately fond as he was of justice yet he did not know how to be just himself he could not see that he in truth had been to no extent illused and ever and again as he thought of the great prayer as to the forgiveness of trespasses he could not refrain from asking himself whether it could really be intended that he should forgive such trespass as that committed against him by paul montague nevertheless when he rose from the wall he had resolved that hetta should be pardoned entirely and that paul montague should be treated as though he were pardoned as for himselfthe chances of the world had been unkind to him and he would submit to them  nevertheless he wrote no answer to hettas letter perhaps he felt with some undefined but still existing hope that the writing of such a letter would deprive him of his last chance hettas letter to himself hardly required an immediate answerdid not indeed demand any answer she had simply told him that whereas she had for certain reasons quarrelled with the man she had loved she had now come to the conclusion that she would quarrel with him no longer she had asked for her cousins assent to her own views but that as roger felt was to be given rather by the discontinuance of opposition than by any positive action rogers influence with her mother was the assistance which hetta really wanted from him and that influence could hardly be given by the writing of any letter thinking of all this roger determined that he would again go up to london he would have the vacant hours of the journey in which to think of it all again and tell himself whether it was possible for him to bring his heart to agree to the marriageand then he would see the people and perhaps learn something further from their manner and their words before he finally committed himself to the abandonment of his own hopes and the completion of theirs  he went up to town and i do not know that those vacant hours served him much to a man not accustomed to thinking there is nothing in the world so difficult as to think after some loose fashion we turn over things in our mind and ultimately reach some decision guided probably by our feelings at the last moment rather than by any process of ratiocinationand then we think that we have thought but to follow out one argument to an end and then to found on the base so reached the commencement of another is not common to us such a process was hardly within the compass of rogers mindwho when he was made wretched by the dust and by a female who had a basket of objectionable provisions opposite to him almost forswore his charitable resolutions of the day before but who again as he walked lonely at night round the square which was near to his hotel looking up at the bright moon with a full appreciation of the beauty of the heavens asked himself what was he that he should wish to interfere with the happiness of two human beings much younger than himself and much fitter to enjoy the world but he had had a bath and had got rid of the dust and had eaten his dinner  the next morning he was in welbeck street at an early hour when he knocked he had not made up his mind whether he would ask for lady carbury or her daughter and did at last inquire whether the ladies were at home the ladies were reported as being at home and he was at once shown into the drawingroom where hetta was sitting she hurried up to him and he at once took her in his arms and kissed her he had never done such a thing before he had never even kissed her hand though they were cousins and dear friends he had never treated her after that fashion her instinct told her immediately that such a greeting from him was a sign of affectionate compliance with her wishes that this man should kiss her as her best and dearest relation as her most trusted friend as almost her brother was certainly to her no offence she could cling to him in fondest love if he would only consent not to be her lover oh roger i am so glad to see you she said escaping gently from his arms  i could not write an answer and so i came  you always do the kindest thing that can be done  i dont know i dont know that i can do anything nowkind or unkind it is all done without any aid from me hetta you have been all the world to me  do not reproach me she said  nono why should i reproach you you have committed no fault i should not have come had i intended to reproach any one  i love you so much for saying that  let it be as you wish itif it must i have made up my mind to bear it and there shall be an end of it as he said this he took her by the hand and she put her head upon his shoulder and began to weep and still you will be all the world to me he continued with his arm round her waist as you will not be my wife you shall be my daughter  i will be your sister roger  my daughter rather you shall be all that i have in the world i will hurry to grow old that i may feel for you as the old feel for the young and if you have a child hetta he must be my child as he thus spoke her tears were renewed i have planned it all out in my mind dear there if there be anything that i can do to add to your happiness i will do it you must believe this of methat to make you happy shall be the only enjoyment of my life  it had been hardly possible for her to tell him as yet that the man to whom he was thus consenting to surrender her had not even condescended to answer the letter in which she had told him to come back to her and now sobbing as she was overcome by the tenderness of her cousins affection anxious to express her intense gratitude she did not know how first to mention the name of paul montague have you seen him she said in a whisper  seen whom  mr montague  nowhy should i have seen him it is not for his sake that i am here  but you will be his friend  your husband shall certainly be my friendor if not the fault shall not be mine it shall all be forgotten hettaas nearly as such things may be forgotten but i had nothing to say to him till i had seen you at that moment the door was opened and lady carbury entered the room and after her greeting with her cousin looked first at her daughter and then at roger i have come up said he to signify my adhesion to this marriage lady carburys face fell very low i need not speak again of what were my own wishes i have learned at last that it could not have been so  why should you say so exclaimed lady carbury  pray pray mamma hetta began but was unable to find words with which to go on with her prayer  i do not know that it need be so at all continued lady carbury i think it is very much in your own hands of course it is not for me to press such an arrangement if it be not in accord with your own wishes  i look upon her as engaged to marry paul montague said roger  not at all said lady carbury  yes mammayes cried hetta boldly it is so i am engaged to him  i beg to let your cousin know that it is not so with my consentnor as far as i can understand at present with the consent of mr montague himself  mamma  paul montague ejaculated roger carbury the consent of paul montague i think i may take upon myself to say that there can be no doubt as to that  there has been a quarrel said lady carbury  surely he has not quarrelled with you hetta  i wrote to himand he has not answered me said hetta piteously  then lady carbury gave a full and somewhat coloured account of what had taken place while roger listened with admirable patience the marriage is on every account objectionable she said at last his means are precarious his conduct with regard to that woman has been very bad he has been sadly mixed up with that wretched man who destroyed himself and now when henrietta has written to him without my sanctionin opposition to my express commandshe takes no notice of her she very properly sent him back a present that he made her and no doubt he has resented her doing so i trust that his resentment may be continued  hetta was now seated on a sofa hiding her face and weeping roger stood perfectly still listening with respectful silence till lady carbury had spoken her last word and even then he was slow to answer considering what he might best say i think i had better see him he replied if as i imagine he has not received my cousins letter that matter will be set at rest we must not take advantage of such an accident as that as to his incomethat i think may be managed his connection with mr melmotte was unfortunate but was due to no fault of his at this moment he could not but remember lady carburys great anxiety to be closely connected with melmotte but he was too generous to say a word on that head i will see him lady carbury and then i will come to you again  lady carbury did not dare to tell him that she did not wish him to see paul montague she knew that if he really threw himself into the scale against her her opposition would weigh nothing he was too powerful in his honesty and greatness of characterand had been too often admitted by herself to be the guardian angel of the familyfor her to stand against him but she still thought that had he persevered hetta would have become his wife  it was late that evening before roger found paul montague who had only then returned from liverpool with fiskerwhose subsequent doings have been recorded somewhat out of their turn  i dont know what letter you mean said paul  you wrote to her  certainly i wrote to her i wrote to her twice my last letter was one which i think she ought to have answered she had accepted me and had given me a right to tell my own story when she unfortunately heard from other sources the story of my journey to lowestoft with mrs hurtle paul pleaded his own case with indignant heat not understanding at first that roger had come to him on a friendly mission  she did answer your letter  i have not had a line from hernot a word  she did answer your letter  what did she say to me  nayyou must ask her that  but if she will not see me  she will see you i can tell you that and i will tell you this alsothat she wrote to you as a girl writes to the lover whom she does wish to see  is that true exclaimed paul jumping up  i am here especially to tell you that it is true i should hardly come on such a message if there were a doubt you may go to her and need have nothing to fearunless indeed it be the opposition of her mother  she is stronger than her mother said paul  i think she is and now i wish you to hear what i have to say  of course said paul sitting down suddenly up to this moment roger carbury though he had certainly brought glad tidings had not communicated them as a joyous sympathetic messenger his face had been severe and the tone of his voice almost harsh and paul remembering well the words of the last letter which his old friend had written him did not expect personal kindness roger would probably say very disagreeable things to him which he must bear with all the patience which he could summon to his assistance  you know my what feelings have been roger began and how deeply i have resented what i thought to be an interference with my affections but no quarrel between you and me whatever the rights of it may be  i have never quarrelled with you paul began  if you will listen to me for a moment it will be better no anger between you and me let it arise as it might should be allowed to interfere with the happiness of her whom i suppose we both love better than all the rest of the world put together  i do said paul  and so do iand so i always shall but she is to be your wife she shall be my daughter she shall have my propertyor her child shall be my heir my house shall be her houseif you and she will consent to make it so you will not be afraid of me you know me i think too well for that you may now count on any assistance you could have from me were i a father giving you a daughter in marriage i do this because i will make the happiness of her life the chief object of mine now good night dont say anything about it at present byandby we shall be able to talk about these things with more equable temper having so spoken he hurried out of the room leaving paul montague bewildered by the tidings which had been announced to him     chapter xciv  john crumbs victory   in the meantime great preparations were going on down in suffolk for the marriage of that happiest of lovers john crumb john crumb had been up to london had been formally reconciled to rubywho had submitted to his floury embraces not with the best grace in the world but still with a submission that had satisfied her future husbandhad been intensely grateful to mrs hurtle and almost munificent in liberality to mrs pipkin to whom he presented a purple silk dress in addition to the cloak which he had given on a former occasion during this visit he had expressed no anger against ruby and no indignation in reference to the baronite when informed by mrs pipkin who hoped thereby to please him that sir felix was supposed to be still all one mash of gore he blandly smiled remarking that no man could be much worse for a few sich taps as them he only stayed a few hours in london but during these few hours he settled everything when mrs pipkin suggested that ruby should be married from her house he winked his eye as he declined the suggestion with thanks daniel ruggles was old and under the influence of continued gin and water was becoming feeble john crumb was of opinion that the old man should not be neglected and hinted that with a little care the five hundred pounds which had originally been promised as rubys fortune might at any rate be secured he was of opinion that the marriage should be celebrated in suffolkthe feast being spread at sheeps acre farm if dan ruggles could be talked into giving itand if not at his own house when both the ladies explained to him that this last proposition was not in strict accordance with the habits of the fashionable world john expressed an opinion that under the peculiar circumstances of his marriage the ordinary laws of the world might be suspended it aint jist like other folks after all as weve been through saidhe meaning probably to imply that having had to fight for his wife he was entitled to give a breakfast on the occasion if he pleased but whether the banquet was to be given by the brides grandfather or by himself he was determined that there should be a banquet and that he would bid the guests he invited both mrs pipkin and mrs hurtle and at last succeeded in inducing mrs hurtle to promise that she would bring mrs pipkin down to bungay for the occasion  then it was necessary to fix the day and for this purpose it was of course essential that ruby should be consulted during the discussion as to the feast and the bridegrooms entreaties that the two ladies would be present she had taken no part in the matter in hand she was brought up to be kissed and having been duly kissed she retired again among the children having only expressed one wish of her own namely that joe mixet might not have anything to do with the affair but the day could not be fixed without her and she was summoned crumb had been absurdly impatient proposing next tuesdaymaking his proposition on a friday they could cook enough meat for all bungay to eat by tuesday and he was aware of no other cause for delay thats out of the question ruby had said decisively and as the two elder ladies had supported her mr crumb yielded with a good grace he did not himself appreciate the reasons given because as he remarked gowns can be bought ready made at any shop but mrs pipkin told him with a laugh that he didnt know anything about it and when the 14th of august was named he only scratched his head and muttering something about thetford fair agreed that he would yet once again allow love to take precedence of business if tuesday would have suited the ladies as well he thought that he might have managed to combine the marriage and the fair but when mrs pipkin told him that he must not interfere any further he yielded with a good grace he merely remained in london long enough to pay a friendly visit to the policeman who had locked him up and then returned to suffolk revolving in his mind how glorious should be the matrimonial triumph which he had at last achieved  before the day arrived old ruggles had been constrained to forgive his granddaughter and to give a general assent to the marriage when john crumb with a sound of many trumpets informed all bungay that he had returned victorious from london and that after all the ups and downs of his courtship ruby was to become his wife on a fixed day all bungay took his part and joined in a general attack upon mr daniel ruggles the crossgrained old man held out for a long time alleging that the girl was no better than she should be and that she had run away with the baronite but this assertion was met by so strong a torrent of contradiction that the farmer was absolutely driven out of his own convictions it is to be feared that many lies were told on rubys behalf by lips which had been quite ready a fortnight since to take away her character but it had become an acknowledged fact in bungay that john crumb was ready at any hour to punch the head of any man who should hint that ruby ruggles had at any period of her life done any act or spoken any word unbecoming a young lady and so strong was the general belief in john crumb that ruby became the subject of general eulogy from all male lips in the town and though perhaps some slight suspicion of irregular behaviour up in london might be whispered by the bungay ladies among themselves still the feeling in favour of mr crumb was so general and his constancy was so popular that the grandfather could not stand against it i dont see why i aint to do as i likes with my own he said to joe mixet the baker who went out to sheeps acre farm as one of many deputations sent by the municipality of bungay  shes your own flesh and blood mr ruggles said the baker  no she aintno more than shes a pipkin shes taken up with mrs pipkin jist because i hate the pipkinses let mrs pipkin give em a breakfast  she is your own flesh and bloodand your name too mr ruggles and shes going to be the respectable wife of a respectable man mr ruggles  i wont give em no breakfastthats flat said the farmer  but he had yielded in the main when he allowed himself to base his opposition on one immaterial detail the breakfast was to be given at the kings head and though it was acknowledged on all sides that no authority could be found for such a practice it was known that the bill was to be paid by the bridegroom nor would mr ruggles pay the five hundred pounds down as in early days he had promised to do he was very clear in his mind that his undertaking on that head was altogether cancelled by rubys departure from sheeps acre when he was reminded that he had nearly pulled his granddaughters hair out of her head and had thus justified her act of rebellion he did not contradict the assertion but implied that if ruby did not choose to earn her fortune on such terms as those that was her fault it was not to be supposed that he was to give a girl who was after all as much a pipkin as a ruggles five hundred pounds for nothing but in return for that nights somewhat harsh treatment of ruby he did at last consent to have the money settled upon john crumb at his death an arrangement which both the lawyer and joe mixet thought to be almost as good as a free gift being both of them aware that the consumption of gin and water was on the increase and he moreover was persuaded to receive mrs pipkin and ruby at the farm for the night previous to the marriage this very necessary arrangement was made by mr mixets mother a most respectable old lady who went out in a fly from the inn attired in her best black silk gown and an overpowering bonnet an old lady from whom her son had inherited his eloquence who absolutely shamed the old man into compliancenot however till she had promised to send out the tea and white sugar and box of biscuits which were thought to be necessary for mrs pipkin on the evening preceding the marriage a private sittingroom at the inn was secured for the special accommodation of mrs hurtlewho was supposed to be a lady of too high standing to be properly entertained at sheeps acre farm  on the day preceding the wedding one trouble for a moment clouded the bridegrooms brow ruby had demanded that joe mixet should not be among the performers and john crumb with the urbanity of a lover had assented to her demandas far at least as silence can give consent and yet he felt himself unable to answer such interrogatories as the parson might put to him without the assistance of his friend although he devoted much study to the matter you could come in behind like joe just as if i knew nothin about it suggested crumb  dont you say a word of me and she wont say nothing you may be sure you aint going to give in to all her cantraps that way john john shook his head and rubbed the meal about on his forehead it was only just something for her to say what have i done that she should object to me  you didnt ever go for tokiss herdid you joe  what a oneer you are that wouldnt a set her again me it is just because i stood up and spoke for you like a man that night at sheeps acre when her mind was turned the other way dont you notice nothing about it when were all in the church she wont go back because joe mixets there ill bet you a gallon old fellow she and i are the best friends in bungay before six months are gone  nay nay she must have a better friend than thee joe or i must know the reason why but john crumbs heart was too big for jealousy and he agreed at last that joe mixet should be his best man undertaking to square it all with ruby after the ceremony  he met the ladies at the station andfor himwas quite eloquent in his welcome to mrs hurtle and mrs pipkin to ruby he said but little but he looked at her in her new hat and generally bright in subsidiary wedding garments with great delight aint she bootiful now he said aloud to mrs hurtle on the platform to the great delight of half bungay who had accompanied him on the occasion ruby hearing her praises thus sung made a fearful grimace as she turned round to mrs pipkin and whispered to her aunt so that those only who were within a yard or two could hear her he is such a fool then he conducted mrs hurtle in an omnibus up to the inn and afterwards himself drove mrs pipkin and ruby out to sheeps acre in the performance of all which duties he was dressed in the green cutaway coat with brass buttons which had been expressly made for his marriage thourt come back then ruby said the old man  i aint going to trouble you long grandfather said the girl  so bestso best and this is mrs pipkin  yes mr ruggles thats my name  ive heard your name ive heard your name and i dont know as i ever want to hear it again but they say as youve been kind to that girl as d a been on the town only for that  grandfather that aint true said ruby with energy the old man made no rejoinder and ruby was allowed to take her aunt up into the bedroom which they were both to occupy now mrs pipkin just you say pleaded ruby how was it possible for any girl to live with an old man like that  but ruby you might always have gone to live with the young man instead when you pleased  you mean john crumb  of course i mean john crumb ruby  there aint much to choose between em what one says is all spite and the other man says nothing at all  oh ruby ruby said mrs pipkin with solemnly persuasive voice i hope youll come to learn some day that a loving heart is better nor a fickle tonguespecially with vittels certain  on the following morning the bungay church bells rang merrily and half its population was present to see john crumb made a happy man he himself went out to the farm and drove the bride and mrs pipkin into the town expressing an opinion that no hired charioteer would bring them so safely as he would do himself nor did he think it any disgrace to be seen performing this task before his marriage he smiled and nodded at every one now and then pointing back with his whip to ruby when he met any of his specially intimate friends as though he would have said see ive got her at last in spite of all difficulties poor ruby in her misery under this treatment would have escaped out of the cart had it been possible but now she was altogether in the mans hands and no escape was within her reach whats the odds said mrs pipkin as they settled their bonnets in a room at the inn just before they entered the church drat ityou make me that angry im half minded to cuff you aint he fond o you aint he got a house of his own aint he well to do all round manners whats manners i dont see nothing amiss in his manners he means what he says and i call that the best of good manners  ruby when she reached the church had been too completely quelled by outward circumstances to take any notice of joe mixet who was standing there quite unabashed with a splendid nosegay in his buttonhole she certainly had no right on this occasion to complain of her husbands silence whereas she could hardly bring herself to utter the responses in a voice loud enough for the clergyman to catch the familiar words he made his assertions so vehemently that they were heard throughout the whole building i johntake thee ruby to my wedded wifeto ave and to oldfrom this day forrardfor better nor worserfor richer nor poorer and so on to the end and when he came to the worldly goods with which he endowed his ruby he was very emphatic indeed since the day had been fixed he had employed all his leisurehours in learning the words by heart and would now hardly allow the clergyman to say them before him he thoroughly enjoyed the ceremony and would have liked to be married over and over again every day for a week had it been possible  and then there came the breakfast to which he marshalled the way up the broad stairs of the inn at bungay with mrs hurtle on one arm and mrs pipkin on the other he had been told that he ought to take his wifes arm on this occasion but he remarked that he meant to see a good deal of her in future and that his opportunities of being civil to mrs hurtle and mrs pipkin would be rare thus it came to pass that in spite of all that poor ruby had said she was conducted to the marriagefeast by joe mixet himself ruby i think had forgotten the order which she had given in reference to the baker when desiring that she might see nothing more of joe mixet she had been in her pridebut now she was so tamed and quelled by the outward circumstances of her position that she was glad to have some one near her who knew how to behave himself mrs crumb you have my best wishes for your continued ealth and appiness said joe mixet in a whisper  its very good of you to say so mr mixet  hes a good un is he  oh i dare say  you just be fond of him and stroke him down and make much of him and im blessed if you maynt do amost anything with himalls one as a babby  a man shouldnt be alls one as a babby mr mixet  and he dont drink hard but he works hard and go where he will he can hold his own ruby said no more and soon found herself seated by her husbands side it certainly was wonderful to her that so many people should pay john crumb so much respect and should seem to think so little of the meal and flour which pervaded his countenance  after the breakfast or bit of dinner as john crumb would call it mr mixet of course made a speech he had had the pleasure of knowing john crumb for a great many years and the honour of being acquainted with miss ruby ruggleshe begged all their pardons and should have said mrs john crumbever since she was a child thats a downright story said ruby in a whisper to mrs hurtle and hed never known two young people more fitted by the gifts of nature to contribute to one anothers appinesses he had understood that mars and wenus always lived on the best of terms and perhaps the present company would excuse him if he likened this appy young couple to them two eathen gods and goddesses for miss rubymrs crumb he should say was certainly lovely as ere a wenus as ever was and as for john crumb he didnt believe that ever a mars among em could stand again him he didnt remember just at present whether mars and wenus had any young family but he hoped that before long there would be any number of young crumbs for the bungay birds to pick up appy is the man as as his quiver full of emand the woman too if youll allow me to say so mrs crumb the speech of which only a small sample can be given here was very much admired by the ladies and gentlemen presentwith the single exception of poor ruby who would have run away and locked herself in an inner chamber had she not been certain that she would be brought back again  in the afternoon john took his bride to lowestoft and brought her back to all the glories of his own house on the following day his honeymoon was short but its influence on ruby was beneficent when she was alone with the man knowing that he was her husband and thinking something of all that he had done to win her to be his wife she did learn to respect him now ruby give a fellow a bussas though you meant it he said when the first fitting occasion presented itself  oh johnwhat nonsense  it aint nonsense to me i can tell you id sooner have a kiss from you than all the wine as ever was swallowed then she did kiss him as though she meant it and when she returned with him to bungay the next day she had made up her mind that she would endeavour to do her duty by him as his wife     chapter xcv  the longestaffe marriages   in another part of suffolk not very far from bungay there was a lady whose friends had not managed her affairs as well as rubys friends had done for ruby miss georgiana longestaffe in the early days of august was in a very miserable plight her sisters marriage with mr george whitstable was fixed for the first of september a day which in suffolk is of all days the most sacred and the combined energies of the houses of caversham and toodlam were being devoted to that happy event poor georgeys position was in every respect wretched but its misery was infinitely increased by the triumph of those hymeneals it was but the other day that she had looked down from a very great height on her elder sister and had utterly despised the squire of toodlam and at that time still so recent this contempt from her had been accepted as being almost reasonable sophia had hardly ventured to rebel against it and mr whitstable himself had been always afraid to encounter the shafts of irony with which his fashionable future sisterinlaw attacked him but all that was now changed sophia in her pride of place had become a tyrant and george whitstable petted in the house with those sweetmeats which are always showered on embryo bridegrooms absolutely gave himself airs at this time mr longestaffe was never at home having assured himself that there was no longer any danger of the brehgert alliance he had remained in london thinking his presence to be necessary for the winding up of melmottes affairs and leaving poor lady pomona to bear her daughters ill humour the family at caversham consisted therefore of the three ladies and was enlivened by daily visits from toodlam it will be owned that in this state of things there was very little consolation for georgiana  it was not long before she quarrelled altogether with her sisterto the point of absolutely refusing to act as bridesmaid the reader may remember that there had been a watch and chain and that two of the ladies of the family had expressed an opinion that these trinkets should be returned to mr brehgert who had bestowed them but georgiana had not sent them back when a week had elapsed since the receipt of mr brehgerts last letter the matter had perhaps escaped lady pomonas memory but sophia was happily alive to the honour of her family georgey she said one morning in their mothers presence dont you think mr brehgerts watch ought to go back to him without any more delay  what have you got to do with anybodys watch the watch wasnt given to you  i think it ought to go back when papa finds that it has been kept im sure hell be very angry  its no business of yours whether hes angry or not  if it isnt sent george will tell dolly you know what would happen then  this was unbearable that george whitstable should interfere in her affairsthat he should talk about her watch and chain i never will speak to george whitstable again the longest day that ever i live she said getting up from her chair  my dear dont say anything so horrible as that exclaimed the unhappy mother  i do say it what has george whitstable to do with me a miserably stupid fellow because youve landed him you think hes to ride over the whole family  i think mr brehgert ought to have his watch and chain back said sophia  certainly he ought said lady pomona georgiana it must be sent back it really mustor i shall tell your papa  subsequently on the same day georgiana brought the watch and chain to her mother protesting that she had never thought of keeping them and explaining that she had intended to hand them over to her papa as soon as he should have returned to caversham lady pomona was now empowered to return them and they were absolutely confided to the hands of the odious george whitstable who about this time made a journey to london in reference to certain garments which he required but georgiana though she was so far beaten kept up her quarrel with her sister she would not be bridesmaid she would never speak to george whitstable and she would shut herself up on the day of the marriage  she did think herself to be very hardly used what was there left in the world that she could do in furtherance of her future cause and what did her father and mother expect would become of her marriage had ever been so clearly placed before her eyes as a condition of things to be achieved by her own efforts that she could not endure the idea of remaining tranquil in her fathers house and waiting till some fitting suitor might find her out she had struggled and struggled struggling still in vaintill every effort of her mind every thought of her daily life was pervaded by a conviction that as she grew older from year to year the struggle should be more intense the swimmer when first he finds himself in the water conscious of his skill and confident in his strength can make his way through the water with the full command of all his powers but when he begins to feel that the shore is receding from him that his strength is going that the footing for which he pants is still far beneath his feet that there is peril where before he had contemplated no dangerthen he begins to beat the water with strokes rapid but impotent and to waste in anxious gaspings the breath on which his very life must depend so it was with poor georgey longestaffe something must be done at once or it would be of no avail twelve years had been passed by her since first she plunged into the streamthe twelve years of her youthand she was as far as ever from the bank nay farther if she believed her eyes she too must strike out with rapid efforts unless indeed she would abandon herself and let the waters close over her head but immersed as she was here at caversham how could she strike at all even now the waters were closing upon her the sound of them was in her ears the ripple of the wave was already round her lips robbing her of breath ahmight not there be some last great convulsive effort which might dash her on shore even if it were upon a rock  that ultimate failure in her matrimonial projects would be the same as drowning she never for a moment doubted it had never occurred to her to consider with equanimity the prospect of living as an old maid it was beyond the scope of her mind to contemplate the chances of a life in which marriage might be well if it came but in which unmarried tranquillity might also be well should that be her lot nor could she understand that others should contemplate it for her no doubt the battle had been carried on for many years so much under the auspices of her father and mother as to justify her in thinking that their theory of life was the same as her own lady pomona had been very open in her teaching and mr longestaffe had always given a silent adherence to the idea that the house in london was to be kept open in order that husbands might be caught and now when they deserted her in her real difficultywhen they first told her to live at caversham all the summer and then sent her up to the melmottes and after that forbade her marriage with mr brehgertit seemed to her that they were unnatural parents who gave her a stone when she wanted bread a serpent when she asked for a fish she had no friend left there was no one living who seemed to care whether she had a husband or not she took to walking in solitude about the park and thought of many things with a grim earnestness which had not hitherto belonged to her character  mamma she said one morning when all the care of the household was being devoted to the future comfortschiefly in regard to linenof mrs george whitstable i wonder whether papa has any intention at all about me  in what sort of way my dear  in any way does he mean me to live here for ever and ever  i dont think he intends to have a house in town again  and what am i to do  i suppose we shall stay here at caversham  and im to be buried just like a nun in a conventonly that the nun does it by her own consent and i dont mamma i wont stand it i wont indeed  i think my dear that that is nonsense you see company here just as other people do in the countryand as for not standing it i dont know what you mean as long as you are one of your papas family of course you must live where he lives  oh mamma to hear you talk like thatit is horriblehorrible as if you didnt know as if you couldnt understand sometimes i almost doubt whether papa does know and then i think that if he did he would not be so cruel but you understand it all as well as i do myself what is to become of me is it not enough to drive me mad to be going about here by myself without any prospect of anything should you have liked at my age to have felt that you had no chance of having a house of your own to live in why didnt you among you let me marry mr breghert as she said this she was almost eloquent with passion  you know my dear said lady pomona that your papa wouldnt hear of it  i know that if you would have helped me i would have done it in spite of papa what right has he to domineer over me in that way why shouldnt i have married the man if i chose i am old enough to know surely you talk now of shutting up girls in convents as being a thing quite impossible this is much worse papa wont do anything to help me why shouldnt he let me do something for myself  you cant regret mr brehgert  why cant i regret him i do regret him id have him tomorrow if he came bad as it might be it couldnt be so bad as caversham  you couldnt have loved him georgiana  loved him who thinks about love nowadays i dont know any one who loves any one else you wont tell me that sophy is going to marry that idiot because she loves him did julia triplex love that man with the large fortune when you wanted dolly to marry marie melmotte you never thought of his loving her i had got the better of all that kind of thing before i was twenty  i think a young woman should love her husband  it makes me sick mamma to hear you talk in that way it does indeed when one has been going on for a dozen years trying to do somethingand i have never had any secrets from youthen that you should turn round upon me and talk about love mamma if you would help me i think i could still manage with mr brehgert lady pomona shuddered you have not got to marry him  it is too horrid  who would have to put up with it not you or papa or dolly i should have a house of my own at least and i should know what i had to expect for the rest of my life if i stay here i shall go mad or die  it is impossible  if you will stand to me mamma i am sure it may be done i would write to him and say that you would see him  georgiana i will never see him  why not  he is a jew  what abominable prejudicewhat wicked prejudice as if you didnt know that all that is changed now what possible difference can it make about a mans religion of course i know that he is vulgar and old and has a lot of children but if i can put up with that i dont think that you and papa have a right to interfere as to his religion it cannot signify  georgiana you make me very unhappy i am wretched to see you so discontented if i could do anything for you i would but i will not meddle about mr brehgert i shouldnt dare to do so i dont think you know how angry your papa can be  im not going to let papa be a bugbear to frighten me what can he do i dont suppose hell beat me and id rather he would than shut me up here as for you mamma i dont think you care for me a bit because sophy is going to be married to that oaf you are become so proud of her that you havent half a thought for anybody else  thats very unjust georgiana  i know whats unjustand i know whos illtreated i tell you fairly mamma that i shall write to mr brehgert and tell him that i am quite ready to marry him i dont know why he should be afraid of papa i dont mean to be afraid of him any more and you may tell him just what i say  all this made lady pomona very miserable she did not communicate her daughters threat to mr longestaffe but she did discuss it with sophia sophia was of opinion that georgiana did not mean it and gave two or three reasons for thinking so in the first place had she intended it she would have written her letter without saying a word about it to lady pomona and she certainly would not have declared her purpose of writing such letter after lady pomona had refused her assistance and moreoverlady pomona had received no former hint of the information which was now conveyed to hergeorgiana was in the habit of meeting the curate of the next parish almost every day in the park  mr batherbolt exclaimed lady pomona  she is walking with mr batherbolt almost every day  but he is so very strict  it is true mamma  and hes five years younger than she and hes got nothing but his curacy and hes a celibate i heard the bishop laughing at him because he called himself a celibate  it doesnt signify mamma i know she is with him constantly wilson has seen themand i know it perhaps papa could get him a living dolly has a living of his own that came to him with his property  dolly would be sure to sell the presentation said lady pomona  perhaps the bishop would do something said the anxious sister when he found that the man wasnt a celibate anything mamma would be better than the jew to this latter proposition lady pomona gave a cordial assent of course it is a comedown to marry a curatebut a clergyman is always considered to be decent  the preparations for the whitstable marriage went on without any apparent attention to the intimacy which was growing up between mr batherbolt and georgiana there was no room to apprehend anything wrong on that side mr batherbolt was so excellent a young man and so exclusively given to religion that even should sophys suspicion be correct he might be trusted to walk about the park with georgiana should he at any time come forward and ask to be allowed to make the lady his wife there would be no disgrace in the matter he was a clergyman and a gentlemanand the poverty would be georgianas own affair  mr longestaffe returned home only on the eve of his eldest daughters marriage and with him came dolly great trouble had been taken to teach him that duty absolutely required his presence at his sisters marriage and he had at last consented to be there it is not generally considered a hardship by a young man that he should have to go into a good partridge country on the 1st of september and dolly was an acknowledged sportsman nevertheless he considered that he had made a great sacrifice to his family and he was received by lady pomona as though he were a bright example to other sons he found the house not in a very comfortable position for georgiana still persisted in her refusal either to be a bridesmaid or to speak to mr whitstable but still his presence which was very rare at caversham gave some assistance and as at this moment his money affairs had been comfortably arranged he was not called upon to squabble with his father it was a great thing that one of the girls should be married and dolly had brought down an enormous china dog about five feet high as a wedding present which added materially to the happiness of the meeting lady pomona had determined that she would tell her husband of those walks in the park and of other signs of growing intimacy which had reached her earsbut this she would postpone until after the whitstable marriage  but at nine oclock on the morning set apart for that marriage they were all astounded by the news that georgiana had run away with mr batherbolt she had been up before six he had met her at the park gate and had driven her over to catch the early train at stowmarket then it appeared too that by degrees various articles of her property had been conveyed to mr batherbolts lodgings in the adjacent village so that lady pomonas fear that georgiana would not have a thing to wear was needless when the fact was first known it was almost felt in the consternation of the moment that the whitstable marriage must be postponed but sophia had a word to say to her mother on that head and she said it the marriage was not postponed at first dolly talked of going after his younger sister and the father did dispatch various telegrams but the fugitives could not be brought back and with some little delaywhich made the marriage perhaps uncanonical but not illegalmr george whitstable was made a happy man  it need only be added that in about a months time georgiana returned to caversham as mrs batherbolt and that she resided there with her husband in much connubial bliss for the next six months at the end of that time they removed to a small living for the purchase of which mr longestaffe had managed to raise the necessary money     chapter xcvi  where the wild asses quench their thirst   we must now go back a little in our storyabout three weeksin order that the reader may be told how affairs were progressing at the beargarden that establishment had received a terrible blow in the defection of herr vossner it was not only that he had robbed the club and robbed every member of the club who had ventured to have personal dealings with him although a bad feeling in regard to him was no doubt engendered in the minds of those who had suffered deeply it was not that alone which cast an almost funereal gloom over the club the sorrow was in thisthat with herr vossner all their comforts had gone of course herr vossner had been a thief that no doubt had been known to them from the beginning a man does not consent to be called out of bed at all hours in the morning to arrange the gambling accounts of young gentlemen without being a thief no one concerned with herr vossner had supposed him to be an honest man but then as a thief he had been so comfortable that his absence was regretted with a tenderness almost amounting to love even by those who had suffered most severely from his rapacity dolly longestaffe had been robbed more outrageously than any other member of the club and yet dolly longestaffe had said since the departure of the purveyor that london was not worth living in now that herr vossner was gone in a week the beargarden collapsedas germany would collapse for a period if herr vossners great compatriot were suddenly to remove himself from the scene but as germany would strive to live even without bismarck so did the club make its new efforts but here the parallel must cease germany no doubt would at last succeed but the beargarden had received a blow from which it seemed that there was no recovery at first it was proposed that three men should be appointed as trustees trustees for paying vossners debts trustees for borrowing more money trustees for the satisfaction of the landlord who was beginning to be anxious as to his future rent at a certain very triumphant general meeting of the club it was determined that such a plan should be arranged and the members assembled were unanimous it was at first thought that there might be a little jealousy as to the trusteeship the club was so popular and the authority conveyed by the position would be so great that a b and c might feel aggrieved at seeing so much power conferred on d e and f when at the meeting above mentioned one or two names were suggested the final choice was postponed as a matter of detail to be arranged privately rather from this consideration than with any idea that there might be a difficulty in finding adequate persons but even the leading members of the beargarden hesitated when the proposition was submitted to them with all its honours and all its responsibilities lord nidderdale declared from the beginning that he would have nothing to do with itpleading his poverty openly beauchamp beauclerk was of opinion that he himself did not frequent the club often enough mr lupton professed his inability as a man of business lord grasslough pleaded his father the club from the first had been sure of dolly longestaffes servicesfor were not dollys pecuniary affairs now in process of satisfactory arrangement and was it not known by all men that his courage never failed him in regard to money but even he declined i have spoken to squercum he said to the committee and squercum wont hear of it squercum has made inquiries and he thinks the club very shaky when one of the committee made a remark as to mr squercum which was not complimentaryinsinuated indeed that squercum without injustice might be consigned to the infernal deities dolly took the matter up warmly thats all very well for you grasslough but if you knew the comfort of having a fellow who could keep you straight without preaching sermons at you you wouldnt despise squercum ive tried to go alone and i find that does not answer squercums my coach and i mean to stick pretty close to him then it came to pass that the triumphant project as to the trustees fell to the ground although squercum himself advised that the difficulty might be lessened if three gentlemen could be selected who lived well before the world and yet had nothing to lose whereupon dolly suggested miles grendall but the committee shook its heads not thinking it possible that the club could be reestablished on a basis of three miles grendalls  then dreadful rumours were heard the beargarden must surely be abandoned it is such a pity said nidderdale because there never has been anything like it  smoke all over the house said dolly  no horrid nonsense about closing said grasslough and no infernal old fogies wearing out the carpets and paying for nothing  not a vestige of propriety or any beastly rules to be kept thats what i liked said nidderdale  its an old story said mr lupton that if you put a man into paradise hell make it too hot to hold him thats what youve done here  what we ought to do said dolly who was pervaded by a sense of his own good fortune in regard to squercum is to get some fellow like vossner and make him tell us how much he wants to steal above his regular pay then we could subscribe that among us i really think that might be done squercum would find a fellow no doubt but mr lupton was of opinion that the new vossner might perhaps not know when thus consulted the extent of his own cupidity  one day before the whitstable marriage when it was understood that the club would actually be closed on the 12th august unless some new heaveninspired idea might be forthcoming for its salvation nidderdale grasslough and dolly were hanging about the hall and the steps and drinking sherry and bitters preparatory to dinner when sir felix carbury came round the neighbouring corner and in a creeping hesitating fashion entered the hall door he had nearly recovered from his wounds though he still wore a bit of court plaster on his upper lip and had not yet learned to look or to speak as though he had not had two of his front teeth knocked out he had heard little or nothing of what had been done at the beargarden since vossners defection it was now a month since he had been seen at the club his thrashing had been the wonder of perhaps half nine days but latterly his existence had been almost forgotten now with difficulty he had summoned courage to go down to his old haunt so completely had he been cowed by the latter circumstances of his life but he had determined that he would pluck up his courage and talk to his old associates as though no evil thing had befallen him he had still money enough to pay for his dinner and to begin a small rubber of whist if fortune should go against him he might glide into ious as others had done before so much to his cost by george heres carbury said dolly lord grasslough whistled turned his back and walked upstairs but nidderdale and dolly consented to have their hands shaken by the stranger  thought you were out of town said nidderdale havent seen you for the last ever so long  i have been out of town said felixlying down in suffolk but im back now how are things going on here  theyre not going at alltheyre gone said dolly everything is smashed said nidderdale  we shall all have to pay i dont know how much  wasnt vossner ever caught asked the baronet  caught ejaculated dolly nobut he has caught us i dont know that there has ever been much idea of catching vossner we close altogether next monday and the furniture is to be gone to law for flatfleece says it belongs to him under what he calls a deed of sale indeed everything that everybody has seems to belong to flatfleece hes always in and out of the club and has got the key of the cellar  that dont matter said nidderdale as vossner took care that there shouldnt be any wine  hes got most of the forks and spoons and only lets us use what we have as a favour  i suppose one can get a dinner here  yes today you can and perhaps tomorrow  isnt there any playing asked felix with dismay  i havent seen a card this fortnight said dolly there hasnt been anybody to play everything has gone to the dogs there has been the affair of melmotte you knowthough i suppose you do know all about that  of course i know he poisoned himself  of course that had effect said dolly continuing his history though why fellows shouldnt play cards because another fellow like that takes poison i cant understand last year the only day i managed to get down in february the hounds didnt come because some old cove had died what harm could our hunting have done him i call it rot  melmottes death was rather awful said nidderdale  not half so awful as having nothing to amuse one and now they say the girl is going to be married to fisker i dont know how you and nidderdale like that i never went in for her myself squercum never seemed to see it  poor dear said nidderdale shes welcome for me and i dare say she couldnt do better with herself i was very fond of herill be shot if i wasnt  and carbury too i suppose said dolly  no i wasnt if id really been fond of her i suppose it would have come off i should have had her safe enough to america if id cared about it this was sir felixs view of the matter  come into the smokingroom dolly said nidderdale i can stand most things and i try to stand everything but by george that fellow is such a cad that i cannot stand him you and i are bad enoughbut i dont think were so heartless as carbury  i dont think im heartless at all said dolly im goodnatured to everybody that is goodnatured to meand to a great many people who aint im going all the way down to caversham next week to see my sister married though i hate the place and hate marriages and if i was to be hung for it i couldnt say a word to the fellow who is going to be my brotherinlaw but i do agree about carbury its very hard to be goodnatured to him  but in the teeth of these adverse opinions sir felix managed to get his dinnertable close to theirs and to tell them at dinner something of his future prospects he was going to travel and see the world he had according to his own account completely run through london life and found that it was all barren      in life ive rung all changes through        run every pleasure down     midst each excess of folly too        and lived with half the town  sir felix did not exactly quote the old song probably having never heard the words but that was the burden of his present story it was his determination to seek new scenes and in search of them to travel over the greater part of the known world  how jolly for you said dolly  it will be a change you know  no end of a change is any one going with you  wellyes ive got a travelling companiona very pleasant fellow who knows a lot and will be able to coach me up in things theres a deal to be learned by going abroad you know  a sort of a tutor said nidderdale  a parson i suppose said dolly  wellhe is a clergyman who told you  its only my inventive genius wellyes i should say that would be nicetravelling about europe with a clergyman i shouldnt get enough advantage out of it to make it pay but i fancy it will just suit you  its an expensive sort of thingisnt it asked nidderdale  wellit does cost something but ive got so sick of this kind of lifeand then that railway board coming to an end and the club smashing up and  marie melmotte marrying fisker suggested dolly  that too if you will but i want a change and a change i mean to have ive seen this side of things and now ill have a look at the other  didnt you have a row in the street with some one the other day this question was asked very abruptly by lord grasslough who though he was sitting near them had not yet joined in the conversation and who had not before addressed a word to sir felix we heard something about it but we never got the right story nidderdale glanced across the table at dolly and dolly whistled grasslough looked at the man he addressed as one does look when one expects an answer mr lupton with whom grasslough was dining also sat expectant dolly and nidderdale were both silent  it was the fear of this that had kept sir felix away from the club grasslough as he had told himself was just the fellow to ask such a questionillnatured insolent and obtrusive but the question demanded an answer of some kind yes said he a fellow attacked me in the street coming behind me when i had a girl with me he didnt get much the best of it though  ohdidnt he said grasslough i think upon the whole you know youre right about going abroad  what business is it of yours asked the baronet  wellas the club is being broken up i dont know that it is very much the business of any of us  i was speaking to my friends lord nidderdale and mr longestaffe and not to you  i quite appreciate the advantage of the distinction said lord grasslough and am sorry for lord nidderdale and mr longestaffe  what do you mean by that said sir felix rising from his chair his present opponent was not horrible to him as had been john crumb as men in clubs do not now often knock each others heads or draw swords one upon another  dont lets have a quarrel here said mr lupton i shall leave the room if you do  if we must break up let us break up in peace and quietness said nidderdale  of course if there is to be a fight im good to go out with anybody said dolly when theres any beastly thing to be done ive always got to do it but dont you think that kind of thing is a little slow  who began it said sir felix sitting down again whereupon lord grasslough who had finished his dinner walked out of the room that fellow is always wanting to quarrel  theres one comfort you know said dolly it wants two men to make a quarrel  yes it does said sir felix taking this as a friendly observation and im not going to be fool enough to be one of them  oh yes i meant it fast enough said grasslough afterwards up in the cardroom the other men who had been together had quickly followed him leaving sir felix alone and they had collected themselves there not with the hope of play but thinking that they would be less interrupted than in the smokingroom i dont suppose we shall ever any of us be here again and as he did come in i thought i would tell him my mind  whats the use of taking such a lot of trouble said dolly of course hes a bad fellow most fellows are bad fellows in one way or another  but hes bad all round said the bitter enemy  and so this is to be the end of the beargarden said lord nidderdale with a peculiar melancholy dear old place i always felt it was too good to last i fancy it doesnt do to make things too easyone has to pay so uncommon dear for them and then you know when youve got things easy then they get rowdyand by george before you know where you are you find yourself among a lot of blackguards if one wants to keep ones self straight one has to work hard at it one way or the other i suppose it all comes from the fall of adam  if solomon solon and the archbishop of canterbury were rolled into one they couldnt have spoken with more wisdom said mr lupton  live and learn continued the young lord i dont think anybody has liked the beargarden so much as i have but i shall never try this kind of thing again i shall begin reading blue books tomorrow and shall dine at the carlton next session i shant miss a day in the house and ill bet anybody a flyer that i make a speech before easter i shall take to claret at 20s a dozen and shall go about london on the top of an omnibus  how about getting married asked dolly  ohthat must be as it comes thats the governors affair none of you fellows will believe me but upon my word i liked that girl and idve stuck to her at lastonly there are some things a fellow cant do he was such a thundering scoundrel  after a while sir felix followed them upstairs and entered the room as though nothing unpleasant had happened below we can make up a rubber cant we said he  i should say not said nidderdale  i shall not play said mr lupton  there isnt a pack of cards in the house said dolly lord grasslough didnt condescend to say a word sir felix sat down with his cigar in his mouth and the others continued to smoke in silence  i wonder what has become of miles grendall asked sir felix but no one made any answer and they smoked on in silence he hasnt paid me a shilling yet of the money he owes me still there was not a word and i dont suppose he ever will there was another pause he is the biggest scoundrel i ever met said sir felix  i know one as big said lord grassloughor at any rate as little  there was another pause of a minute and then sir felix left the room muttering something as to the stupidity of having no cardsand so brought to an end his connection with his associates of the beargarden from that time forth he was never more seen by themor if seen was never known  the other men remained there till well on into the night although there was not the excitement of any special amusement to attract them it was felt by them all that this was the end of the beargarden and with a melancholy seriousness befitting the occasion they whispered sad things in low voices consoling themselves simply with tobacco i never felt so much like crying in my life said dolly as he asked for a glass of brandyandwater at about midnight goodnight old fellows goodbye im going down to caversham and i shouldnt wonder if i didnt drown myself  how mr flatfleece went to law and tried to sell the furniture and threatened everybody and at last singled out poor dolly longestaffe as his special victim and how dolly longestaffe by the aid of mr squercum utterly confounded mr flatfleece and brought that ingenious but unfortunate man with his wife and small family to absolute ruin the reader will hardly expect to have told to him in detail in this chronicle     chapter xcvii  mrs hurtles fate   mrs hurtle had consented at the joint request of mrs pipkin and john crumb to postpone her journey to new york and to go down to bungay and grace the marriage of ruby ruggles not so much from any love for the persons concerned not so much even from any desire to witness a phase of english life as from an irresistible tenderness towards paul montague she not only longed to see him once again but she could with difficulty bring herself to leave the land in which he was living there was no hope for her she was sure of that she had consented to relinquish him she had condoned his treachery to her and for his sake had even been kind to the rival who had taken her place but still she lingered near him and then though in all her very restricted intercourse with such english people as she met she never ceased to ridicule things english yet she dreaded a return to her own country in her heart of hearts she liked the somewhat stupid tranquillity of the life she saw comparing it with the rough tempests of her past days mrs pipkin she thought was less intellectual than any american woman she had ever known and she was quite sure that no human being so heavy so slow and so incapable of two concurrent ideas as john crumb had ever been produced in the united statesbut nevertheless she liked mrs pipkin and almost loved john crumb how different would her life have been could she have met a man who would have been as true to her as john crumb was to his ruby  she loved paul montague with all her heart and she despised herself for loving him how weak he washow inefficient how unable to seize glorious opportunities how swathed and swaddled by scruples and prejudiceshow unlike her own countrymen in quickness of apprehension and readiness of action but yet she loved him for his very faults telling herself that there was something sweeter in his english manners than in all the smart intelligence of her own land the man had been false to herfalse as hell had sworn to her and had broken his oath had ruined her whole life had made everything blank before her by his treachery but then she also had not been quite true with him she had not at first meant to deceivenor had he they had played a game against each other and he with all the inferiority of his intellect to weigh him down had wonbecause he was a man she had much time for thinking and she thought much about these things he could change his love as often as he pleased and be as good a lover at the end as everwhereas she was ruined by his defection he could look about for a fresh flower and boldly seek his honey whereas she could only sit and mourn for the sweets of which she had been rifled she was not quite sure that such mourning would not be more bitter to her in california than in mrs pipkins solitary lodgings at islington  so he was mr montagues partnerwas he now asked mrs pipkin a day or two after their return from the crumb marriage for mr fisker had called on mrs hurtle and mrs hurtle had told mrs pipkin so much to my thinking now hes a nicer man than mr montague mrs pipkin perhaps thought that as her lodger had lost one partner she might be anxious to secure the otherperhaps felt too that it might be well to praise an american at the expense of an englishman  theres no accounting for tastes mrs pipkin  and thats true too mrs hurtle  mr montague is a gentleman  i always did say that of him mrs hurtle  and mr fisker isan american citizen mrs hurtle when she said this was very far gone in tenderness  indeed now said mrs pipkin who did not in the least understand the meaning of her friends last remark  mr fisker came to me with tidings from san francisco which i had not heard before and has offered to take me back with him mrs pipkins apron was immediately at her eyes i must go some day you knew  i suppose you must i couldnt hope as youd stay here always i wish i could i never shall forget the comfort its been there hasnt been a week without everything settled and most ladylikemost ladylike you seem to me mrs hurtle just as though you had the bank in your pocket all this the poor woman said moved by her sorrow to speak the absolute truth  mr fisker isnt in any way a special friend of mine but i hear that he will be taking other ladies with him and i fancy i might as well join the party it will be less dull for me and i shall prefer company just at present for many reasons we shall start on the first of september as this was said about the middle of august there was still some remnant of comfort for poor mrs pipkin a fortnight gained was something and as mr fisker had come to england on business and as business is always uncertain there might possibly be further delay then mrs hurtle made a further communication to mrs pipkin which though not spoken till the latter lady had her hand on the door was perhaps the one thing which mrs hurtle had desired to say bythebye mrs pipkin i expect mr montague to call tomorrow at eleven just show him up when he comes she had feared that unless some such instructions were given there might be a little scene at the door when the gentleman came  mr montagueoh of course mrs hurtleof course ill see to it myself then mrs pipkin went away abashedfeeling that she had made a great mistake in preferring any other man to mr montague if after all recent difficulties were to be adjusted  on the following morning mrs hurtle dressed herself with almost more than her usual simplicity but certainly with not less than her usual care and immediately after breakfast seated herself at her desk nursing an idea that she would work as steadily for the next hour as though she expected no special visitor of course she did not write a word of the task which she had prescribed to herself of course she was disturbed in her mind though she had dictated to herself absolute quiescence  she almost knew that she had been wrong even to desire to see him she had forgiven him and what more was there to be said she had seen the girl and had in some fashion approved of her her curiosity had been satisfied and her love of revenge had been sacrificed she had no plan arranged as to what she would now say to him nor did she at this moment attempt to make a plan she could tell him that she was about to return to san francisco with fisker but she did not know that she had anything else to say then came the knock at the door her heart leaped within her and she made a last great effort to be tranquil she heard the steps on the stairs and then the door was opened and mr montague was announced by mrs pipkin herself mrs pipkin however quite conquered by a feeling of gratitude to her lodger did not once look in through the door nor did she pause a moment to listen at the keyhole i thought you would come and see me once again before i went said mrs hurtle not rising from her sofa but putting out her hand to greet him sit there opposite so that we can look at one another i hope it has not been a trouble to you  of course i came when you left word for me to do so  i certainly should not have expected it from any wish of your own  i should not have dared to come had you not bade me you know that  i know nothing of the kindbut as you are here we will not quarrel as to your motives has miss carbury pardoned you as yet has she forgiven your sins  we are friendsif you mean that  of course you are friends she only wanted to have somebody to tell her that somebody had maligned you it mattered not much who it was she was ready to believe any one who would say a good word for you perhaps i wasnt just the person to do it but i believe even i was sufficient to serve the turn  did you say a good word for me  well no replied mrs hurtle i will not boast that i did i do not want to tell you fibs at our last meeting i said nothing good of you what could i say of good but i told her what was quite as serviceable to you as though i had sung your virtues by the hour without ceasing i explained to her how very badly you had behaved to me i let her know that from the moment you had seen her you had thrown me to the winds  it was not so my friend  what did that matter one does not scruple a lie for a friend you know i could not go into all the little details of your perfidies i could not make her understand during one short and rather agonizing interview how you had allowed yourself to be talked out of your love for me by english propriety even before you had seen her beautiful eyes there was no reason why i should tell her all my disgrace anxious as i was to be of service besides as i put it she was sure to be better pleased but i did tell her how unwillingly you had spared me an hour of your companywhat a trouble i had been to you how you would have shirked me if you could  winifred that is untrue  that wretched journey to lowestoft was the great crime mr roger carbury who i own is poison to me  you do not know him  knowing him or not i choose to have my own opinion sir i say that he is poison to me and i say that he had so stuffed her mind with the flagrant sin of that journey with the peculiar wickedness of our having lived for two nights under the same roof with the awful fact that we had travelled together in the same carriage till that had become the one stumblingblock on your path to happiness  he never said a word to her of our being there  who did then but what matters she knew itand as the only means of whitewashing you in her eyes i did tell her how cruel and how heartless you had been to me i did explain how the return of friendship which you had begun to show me had been frozen harder than wenham ice by the appearance of mr carbury on the sands perhaps i went a little farther and hinted that the meeting had been arranged as affording you the easiest means of escape from me  you do not believe that  you see i had your welfare to look after and the baser your conduct had been to me the truer you were in her eyes do i not deserve some thanks for what i did surely you would not have had me tell her that your conduct to me had been that of a loyal loving gentleman i confessed to her my utter despairi abased myself in the dust as a woman is abased who has been treacherously illused and has failed to avenge herself i knew that when she was sure that i was prostrate and hopeless she would be triumphant and contented i told her on your behalf how i had been ground to pieces under your chariot wheels and now you have not a word of thanks to give me  every word you say is a dagger  you know where to go for salve for such skindeep scratches as i make where am i to find a surgeon who can put together my crushed bones daggers indeed do you not suppose that in thinking of you i have often thought of daggers why have i not thrust one into your heart so that i might rescue you from the arms of this puny spiritless english girl all this time she was still seated looking at him leaning forward towards him with her hands upon her brow but paul i spit out my words to you like any common woman not because they will hurt you but because i know i may take that comfort such as it is without hurting you you are uneasy for a moment while you are here and i have a cruel pleasure in thinking that you cannot answer me but you will go from me to her and then will you not be happy when you are sitting with your arm round her waist and when she is playing with your smiles will the memory of my words interfere with your joy then ask yourself whether the prick will last longer than the moment but where am i to go for happiness and joy can you understand what it is to have to live only on retrospects  i wish i could say a word to comfort you  you cannot say a word to comfort me unless you will unsay all that you have said since i have been in england i never expect comfort again but paul i will not be cruel to the end i will tell you all that i know of my concerns even though my doing so should justify your treatment of me he is not dead  you mean mr hurtle  whom else should i mean and he himself says that the divorce which was declared between us was no divorce mr fisker came here to me with tidings though he is not a man whom i specially lovethough i know that he has been my enemy with youi shall return with him to san francisco  i am told that he is taking madame melmotte with him and melmottes daughter  so i understand they are adventurersas i am and i do not see why we should not suit each other  they say also that fisker will marry miss melmotte  why should i object to that i shall not be jealous of mr fiskers attentions to the young lady but it will suit me to have some one to whom i can speak on friendly terms when i am back in california i may have a job of work to do there which will require the backing of some friends i shall be handandglove with these people before i have travelled half across the ocean with them  i hope they will be kind to you said paul  nobut i will be kind to them i have conquered others by being kind but i have never had much kindness myself did i not conquer you sir by being gentle and gracious to you ah how kind i was to that poor wretch till he lost himself in drink and then paul i used to think of better people perhaps of softer people of things that should be clean and sweet and gentleof things that should smell of lavender instead of wild garlic i would dream of fair feminine womenof women who would be scared by seeing what i saw who would die rather than do what i did and then i met you paul and i said that my dreams should come true i ought to have known that it could not be so i did not dare quite to tell you all the truth i know i was wrong and now the punishment has come upon me welli suppose you had better say goodbye to me what is the good of putting it off then she rose from her chair and stood before him with her arms hanging listlessly by her side  god bless you winifred he said putting out his hand to her  but he wont why should heif we are right in supposing that they who do good will be blessed for their good and those who do evil cursed for their evil i cannot do good i cannot bring myself now not to wish that you would return to me if you would come i should care nothing for the misery of that girlnothing at least nothing now for the misery i should certainly bring upon you look herewill you have this back as she asked this she took from out her bosom a small miniature portrait of himself which he had given her in new york and held it towards him  if you wish it i willof course he said  i would not part with it for all the gold in california nothing on earth shall ever part me from it should i ever marry another manas i may dohe must take me and this together while i live it shall be next my heart as you know i have little respect for the proprieties of life i do not see why i am to abandon the picture of the man i love because he becomes the husband of another woman having once said that i love you i shall not contradict myself because you have deserted me paul i have loved you and do love youoh with my very heart of hearts so speaking she threw herself into his arms and covered his face with kisses for one moment you shall not banish me for one short minute i will be here oh paul my lovemy love  all this to him was simply agonythough as she had truly said it was an agony he would soon forget but to be told by a woman of her love without being able even to promise love in returnto be so told while you are in the very act of acknowledging your love for another woman carries with it but little of the joy of triumph he did not want to see her raging like a tigress as he had once thought might be his fate but he would have preferred the continuance of moderate resentment to this flood of tenderness of course he stood with his arm round her waist and of course he returned her caresses but he did it with such stiff constraint that she at once felt how chill they were there she said smiling through her bitter tearsthere you are released now and not even my fingers shall ever be laid upon you again if i have annoyed you at this our last meeting you must forgive me  nobut you cut me to the heart  that we can hardly helpcan we when two persons have made fools of themselves as we have there must i suppose be some punishment yours will never be heavy after i am gone i do not start till the first of next month because that is the day fixed by our friend mr fisker and i shall remain here till then because my presence is convenient to mrs pipkin but i need not trouble you to come to me again indeed it will be better that you should not goodbye  he took her by the hand and stood for a moment looking at her while she smiled and gently nodded her head at him then he essayed to pull her towards him as though he would again kiss her but she repulsed him still smiling the while no sir no not again never again nevernevernever again by that time she had recovered her hand and stood apart from him goodbye pauland now go then he turned round and left the room without uttering a word  she stood still without moving a limb as she listened to his step down the stairs and to the opening and the closing of the door then hiding herself at the window with the scanty drapery of the curtain she watched him as he went along the street when he had turned the corner she came back to the centre of the room stood for a moment with her arms stretched out towards the walls and then fell prone upon the floor she had spoken the very truth when she said that she had loved him with all her heart  but that evening she bade mrs pipkin drink tea with her and was more gracious to the poor woman than ever when the obsequious but still curious landlady asked some question about mr montague mrs hurtle seemed to speak very freely on the subject of her late loverand to speak without any great pain they had put their heads together she said and had found that the marriage would not be suitable each of them preferred their own country and so they had agreed to part on that evening mrs hurtle made herself more than usually pleasant having the children up into her room and giving them jam and breadandbutter during the whole of the next fortnight she seemed to take a delight in doing all in her power for mrs pipkin and her family she gave toys to the children and absolutely bestowed upon mrs pipkin a new carpet for the drawingroom then mr fisker came and took her away with him to america and mrs pipkin was lefta desolate but grateful woman  they do tell bad things about them americans she said to a friend in the street and i dont pretend to know but for a lodger i only wish providence would send me another just like the one i have lost she had that good nature about her she liked to see the bairns eating pudding just as if they was her own  i think mrs pipkin was right and that mrs hurtle with all her faults was a goodnatured woman     chapter xcviii  marie melmottes fate   in the meantime marie melmotte was living with madame melmotte in their lodgings up at hampstead and was taking quite a new look out into the world fisker had become her devoted servantnot with that oldfashioned service which meant making love but with perhaps a truer devotion to her material interests he had ascertained on her behalf that she was the undoubted owner of the money which her father had made over to her on his first arrival in englandand she also had made herself mistress of that fact with equal precision it would have astonished those who had known her six months since could they now have seen how excellent a woman of business she had become and how capable she was of making the fullest use of mr fiskers services in doing him justice it must be owned that he kept nothing back from her of that which he learned probably feeling that he might best achieve success in his present project by such honestyfeeling also no doubt the girls own strength in discovering truth and falsehood shes her fathers own daughter he said one day to croll in abchurch lanefor croll though he had left melmottes employment when he found that his name had been forged had now returned to the service of the daughter in some undefined position and had been engaged to go with her and madame melmotte to new york  ah yees said croll but bigger he vas passionate and did lose his ead and vas blowd up vid bigness whereupon croll made an action as though he were a frog swelling himself to the dimensions of an ox e bursted himself mr fisker e vas a great man but the greater he grew he vas always less and less vise e ate so much that he became too fat to see to eat his vittels it was thus that herr croll analysed the character of his late master but mameselle ah she is different she vill never eat too moch but vill see to eat alvays thus too he analysed the character of his young mistress  at first things did not arrange themselves pleasantly between madame melmotte and marie the reader will perhaps remember that they were in no way connected by blood madame melmotte was not maries mother nor in the eye of the law could marie claim melmotte as her father she was alone in the world absolutely without a relation not knowing even what had been her mothers namenot even knowing what was her fathers true name as in the various biographies of the great man which were as a matter of course published within a fortnight of his death various accounts were given as to his birth parentage and early history the general opinion seemed to be that his father had been a noted coiner in new yorkan irishman of the name of melmody and in one memoir the probability of the descent was argued from melmottes skill in forgery but marie though she was thus isolated and now altogether separated from the lords and duchesses who a few weeks since had been interested in her career was the undoubted owner of the moneya fact which was beyond the comprehension of madame melmotte she could understandand was delighted to understandthat a very large sum of money had been saved from the wreck and that she might therefore look forward to prosperous tranquillity for the rest of her life though she never acknowledged so much to herself she soon learned to regard the removal of her husband as the end of her troubles but she could not comprehend why marie should claim all the money as her own she declared herself to be quite willing to divide the spoiland suggested such an arrangement both to marie and to croll of fisker she was afraid thinking that the iniquity of giving all the money to marie originated with him in order that he might obtain it by marrying the girl croll who understood it all perfectly told her the story a dozen timesbut quite in vain she made a timid suggestion of employing a lawyer on her own behalf and was only deterred from doing so by maries ready assent to such an arrangement maries equally ready surrender of any right she might have to a portion of the jewels which had been saved had perhaps some effect in softening the elder ladys heart she thus was in possession of a treasure of her ownthough a treasure small in comparison with that of the younger woman and the younger woman had promised that in the event of her marriage she would be liberal  it was distinctly understood that they were both to go to new york under mr fiskers guidance as soon as things should be sufficiently settled to allow of their departure and madame melmotte was told about the middle of august that their places had been taken for the 3rd of september but nothing more was told her she did not as yet know whether marie was to go out free or as the affianced bride of hamilton fisker and she felt herself injured by being left so much in the dark she herself was inimical to fisker regarding him as a dark designing man who would ultimately swallow up all that her husband had left behind himand trusted herself entirely to croll who was personally attentive to her fisker was of course going on to san francisco marie also had talked of crossing the american continent but madame melmotte was disposed to think that for her with her jewels and such share of the money as marie might be induced to give her new york would be the most fitting residence why should she drag herself across the continent to california herr croll had declared his purpose of remaining in new york then it occurred to the lady that as melmotte was a name which might be too well known in new york and which it therefore might be wise to change croll would do as well as any other she and herr croll had known each other for a great many years and were she thought of about the same age croll had some money saved she had at any rate her jewelsand croll would probably be able to get some portion of all that money which ought to be hers if his affairs were made to be identical with her own so she smiled upon croll and whispered to him and when she had given croll two glasses of curaçaowhich comforter she kept in her own hands as safeguarded almost as the jewelsthen croll understood her  but it was essential that she should know what marie intended to do marie was anything but communicative and certainly was not in any way submissive my dear she said one day asking the question in french without any preface or apology are you going to be married to mr fisker  what makes you ask that  it is so important i should know where am i to live what am i to do what money shall i have who will be a friend to me a woman ought to know you will marry fisker if you like him why cannot you tell me  because i do not know when i know i will tell you if you go on asking me till tomorrow morning i can say no more  and this was true she did not know it certainly was not fiskers fault that she should still be in the dark as to her own destiny for he had asked her often enough and had pressed his suit with all his eloquence but marie had now been wooed so often that she felt the importance of the step which was suggested to her the romance of the thing was with her a good deal worn and the material view of matrimony had also been damaged in her sight she had fallen in love with sir felix carbury and had assured herself over and over again that she worshipped the very ground on which he stood but she had taught herself this business of falling in love as a lesson rather than felt it after her fathers first attempts to marry her to this and that suitor because of her wealthattempts which she had hardly opposed amidst the consternation and glitter of the world to which she was suddenly introducedshe had learned from novels that it would be right that she should be in love and she had chosen sir felix as her idol the reader knows what had been the end of that episode in her life she certainly was not now in love with sir felix carbury then she had as it were relapsed into the hands of lord nidderdaleone of her early suitorsand had felt that as love was not to prevail and as it would be well that she should marry some one he might probably be as good as any other and certainly better than many others she had almost learned to like lord nidderdale and to believe that he liked her when the tragedy came lord nidderdale had been very goodnaturedbut he had deserted her at last she had never allowed herself to be angry with him for a moment it had been a matter of course that he should do so her fortune was still large but not so large as the sum named in the bargain made and it was moreover weighted with her fathers blood from the moment of her fathers death she had never dreamed that he would marry her why should he her thoughts in reference to sir felix were bitter enoughbut as against nidderdale they were not at all bitter should she ever meet him again she would shake hands with him and smileif not pleasantly as she thought of the things which were pastat any rate with good humour but all this had not made her much in love with matrimony generally she had over a hundred thousand pounds of her own and feeling conscious of her own power in regard to her own money knowing that she could do as she pleased with her wealth she began to look out into life seriously  what could she do with her money and in what way would she shape her life should she determine to remain her own mistress were she to refuse fisker how should she begin he would then be banished and her only remaining friends the only persons whose names she would even know in her own country would be her fathers widow and herr croll she already began to see madame melmottes purport in reference to croll and could not reconcile herself to the idea of opening an establishment with them on a scale commensurate with her fortune nor could she settle in her own mind any pleasant position for herself as a single woman living alone in perfect independence she had opinions of womens rightsespecially in regard to money and she entertained also a vague notion that in america a young woman would not need support so essentially as in england nevertheless the idea of a fine house for herself in boston or philadelphiafor in that case she would have to avoid new york as the chosen residence of madame melmottedid not recommend itself to her as to fisker himselfshe certainly liked him he was not beautiful like felix carbury nor had he the easy goodhumour of lord nidderdale she had seen enough of english gentlemen to know that fisker was very unlike them but she had not seen enough of english gentlemen to make fisker distasteful to her he told her that he had a big house at san francisco and she certainly desired to live in a big house he represented himself to be a thriving man and she calculated that he certainly would not be here in london arranging her fathers affairs were he not possessed of commercial importance she had contrived to learn that in the united states a married woman has greater power over her own money than in england and this information acted strongly in fiskers favour on consideration of the whole subject she was inclined to think that she would do better in the world as mrs fisker than as marie melmotteif she could see her way clearly in the matter of her own money  i have got excellent berths fisker said to her one morning at hampstead at these interviews which were devoted first to business and then to love madame melmotte was never allowed to be present  i am to be alone  oh yes there is a cabin for madame melmotte and the maid and a cabin for you everything will be comfortable and there is another lady goingmrs hurtlewhom i think you will like  has she a husband  not going with us said mr fisker evasively  but she has one  well yesbut you had better not mention him he is not exactly all that a husband should be  did she not come over here to marry some one elsefor marie in the days of her sweet intimacy with sir felix carbury had heard something of mrs hurtles story  there is a story and i dare say i shall tell you all about it some day but you may be sure i should not ask you to associate with any one you ought not to know  ohi can take care of myself  no doubt miss melmotteno doubt i feel that quite strongly but what i meant to observe was thisthat i certainly should not introduce a lady whom i aspire to make my own lady to any lady whom a lady oughtnt to know i hope i make myself understood miss melmotte  oh quite  and perhaps i may go on to say that if i could go on board that ship as your accepted lover i could do a deal more to make you comfortable particularly when you land than just as a mere friend miss melmotte you cant doubt my heart  i dont see why i shouldnt gentlemens hearts are things very much to be doubted as far as ive seen em i dont think many of em have em at all  miss melmotte you do not know the glorious west your past experiences have been drawn from this effete and stonecold country in which passion is no longer allowed to sway on those golden shores which the pacific washes man is still trueand woman is still tender  perhaps id better wait and see mr fisker  but this was not mr fiskers view of the case there might be other men desirous of being true on those golden shores and then said he pleading his cause not without skill the laws regulating womans property there are just the reverse of those which the greediness of man has established here the wife there can claim her share of her husbands property but hers is exclusively her own america is certainly the country for womenand especially california  ahi shall find out all about it i suppose when ive been there a few months  but you would enter san francisco miss melmotte under such much better auspicesif i may be allowed to say soas a married lady or as a lady just going to be married  aint single ladies much thought of in california  it isnt that come miss melmotte you know what i mean  yes i do  let us go in for life together weve both done uncommon well im spending 30000 dollars a yearat that ratein my own house youll see it all if we put them both togetherwhats yours and whats minewe can put our foot out as far as about any one there i guess  i dont know that i care about putting my foot out ive seen something of that already mr fisker you shouldnt put your foot out farther than you can draw it in again  you neednt fear me as to that miss melmotte i shouldnt be able to touch a dollar of your money it would be such a triumph to go into francisco as man and wife  i shouldnt think of being married till i had been there a while and looked about me  and seen the house welltheres something in that the house is all there i can tell you im not a bit afraid but what youll like the house but if we were engaged i could do everything for you where would you be going into san francisco all alone oh miss melmotte i do admire you so much  i doubt whether this last assurance had much efficacy but the arguments with which it was introduced did prevail to a certain extent ill tell you how it must be then she said  how shall it be and as he asked the question he jumped up and put his arm round her waist  not like that mr fisker she said withdrawing herself it shall be in this way you may consider yourself engaged to me  im the happiest man on this continent he said forgetting in his ecstasy that he was not in the united states  but if i find when i get to francisco anything to induce me to change my mind i shall change it i like you very well but im not going to take a leap in the dark and im not going to marry a pig in a poke  there youre quite right he saidquite right  you may give it out on board the ship that were engaged and ill tell madame melmotte the same she and croll dont mean going any farther than new york  we neednt break our hearts about thatneed we  it dont much signify wellill go on with mrs hurtle if shell have me  too much delighted shell be  and she shall be told were engaged  my darling  but if i dont like it when i get to frisco as you call it all the ropes in california shant make me do it wellyes you may give me a kiss i suppose now if you care about it and soor rather so far mr fisker and marie melmotte became engaged to each other as man and wife  after that mr fiskers remaining business in england went very smoothly with him it was understood up at hampstead that he was engaged to marie melmotteand it soon came to be understood also that madame melmotte was to be married to herr croll no doubt the father of the one lady and the husband of the other had died so recently as to make these arrangements subject to certain censorious objections but there was a feeling that melmotte had been so unlike other men both in his life and in his death that they who had been concerned with him were not to be weighed by ordinary scales nor did it much matter for the persons concerned took their departure soon after the arrangement was made and hampstead knew them no more  on the 3rd of september madame melmotte marie mrs hurtle hamilton k fisker and herr croll left liverpool for new york and the three ladies were determined that they never would revisit a country of which their reminiscences certainly were not happy the writer of the present chronicle may so far look forwardcarrying his reader with himas to declare that marie melmotte did become mrs fisker very soon after her arrival at san francisco     chapter xcix  lady carbury and mr broune   when sir felix carbury declared to his friends at the beargarden that he intended to devote the next few months of his life to foreign travel and that it was his purpose to take with him a protestant divineas was much the habit with young men of rank and fortune some years sincehe was not altogether lying there was indeed a sounder basis of truth than was usually to be found attached to his statements that he should have intended to produce a false impression was a matter of courseand nearly equally so that he should have made his attempt by asserting things which he must have known that no one would believe he was going to germany and he was going in company with a clergyman and it had been decided that he should remain there for the next twelve months a representation had lately been made to the bishop of london that the english protestants settled in a certain commercial town in the northeastern district of prussia were without pastoral aid and the bishop had stirred himself in the matter a clergyman was found willing to expatriate himself but the income suggested was very small the protestant english population of the commercial town in question though pious was not liberal it had come to pass that the morning breakfast table had interested itself in the matter having appealed for subscriptions after a manner not unusual with that paper the bishop and all those concerned in the matter had fully understood that if the morning breakfast table could be got to take the matter up heartily the thing would be done the heartiness had been so complete that it had at last devolved upon mr broune to appoint the clergyman and as with all the aid that could be found the income was still small the rev septimus blakea brand snatched from the burning of romehad been induced to undertake the maintenance and total charge of sir felix carbury for a consideration mr broune imparted to mr blake all that there was to know about the baronet giving much counsel as to the management of the young man and specially enjoining on the clergyman that he should on no account give sir felix the means of returning home it was evidently mr brounes anxious wish that sir felix should see as much as possible of german life at a comparatively moderate expenditure and under circumstances that should be externally respectable if not absolutely those which a young gentleman might choose for his own comfort or profitbut especially that those circumstances should not admit of the speedy return to england of the young gentleman himself  lady carbury had at first opposed the scheme terribly difficult as was to her the burden of maintaining her son she could not endure the idea of driving him into exile but mr broune was very obstinate very reasonable and as she thought somewhat hard of heart what is to be the end of it then he said to her almost in anger for in those days the great editor when in presence of lady carbury differed very much from that mr broune who used to squeeze her hand and look into her eyes his manner with her had become so different that she regarded him as quite another person she hardly dared to contradict him and found herself almost compelled to tell him what she really felt and thought do you mean to let him eat up everything you have to your last shilling and then go to the workhouse with him  oh my friend you know how i am struggling do not say such horrid things  it is because i know how you are struggling that i find myself compelled to say anything on the subject what hardship will there be in his living for twelve months with a clergyman in prussia what can he do better what better chance can he have of being weaned from the life he is leading  if he could only be married  married who is to marry him why should any girl with money throw herself away upon him  he is so handsome  what has his beauty brought him to lady carbury you must let me tell you that all that is not only foolish but wrong if you keep him here you will help to ruin him and will certainly ruin yourself he has agreed to golet him go  she was forced to yield indeed as sir felix had himself assented it was almost impossible that she should not do so perhaps mr brounes greatest triumph was due to the talent and firmness with which he persuaded sir felix to start upon his travels your mother said mr broune has made up her mind that she will not absolutely beggar your sister and herself in order that your indulgence may be prolonged for a few months she cannot make you go to germany of course but she can turn you out of her house and unless you go she will do so  i dont think she ever said that mr broune  noshe has not said so but i have said it for her in her presence and she has acknowledged that it must necessarily be so you may take my word as a gentleman that it will be so if you take her advice £175 a year will be paid for your maintenancebut if you remain in england not a shilling further will be paid he had no money his last sovereign was all but gone not a tradesman would give him credit for a coat or a pair of boots the key of the door had been taken away from him the very page treated him with contumely his clothes were becoming rusty there was no prospect of amusement for him during the coming autumn or winter he did not anticipate much excitement in eastern prussia but he thought that any change must be a change for the better  he assented therefore to the proposition made by mr broune was duly introduced to the rev septimus blake and as he spent his last sovereign on a last dinner at the beargarden explained his intentions for the immediate future to those friends at his club who would no doubt mourn his departure  mr blake and mr broune between them did not allow the grass to grow under their feet before the end of august sir felix with mr and mrs blake and the young blakes had embarked from hull for hamburghaving extracted at the very hour of parting a last five pound note from his foolish mother it will be just enough to bring him home said mr broune with angry energy when he was told of this but lady carbury who knew her son well assured him that felix would be restrained in his expenditure by no such prudence as such a purpose would indicate it will be gone she said long before they reach their destination  then why the deuce should you give it him said mr broune  mr brounes anxiety had been so intense that he had paid half a years allowance in advance to mr blake out of his own pocket indeed he had paid various sums for lady carburyso that that unfortunate woman would often tell herself that she was becoming subject to the great editor almost like a slave he came to her three or four times a week at about nine oclock in the evening and gave her instructions as to all that she should do i wouldnt write another novel if i were you he said this was hard as the writing of novels was her great ambition and she had flattered herself that the one novel which she had written was good mr brounes own critic had declared it to be very good in glowing language the evening pulpit had of course abused itbecause it is the nature of the evening pulpit to abuse so she had argued with herself telling herself that the praise was all true whereas the censure had come from malice after that article in the breakfast table it did seem hard that mr broune should tell her to write no more novels she looked up at him piteously but said nothing i dont think youd find it answer of course you can do it as well as a great many others but then that is saying so little  i thought i could make some money  i dont think mr leadham would hold out to you very high hopesi dont indeed i think i would turn to something else  it is so very hard to get paid for what one does  to this mr broune made no immediate answer but after sitting for a while almost in silence he took his leave on that very morning lady carbury had parted from her son she was soon about to part from her daughter and she was very sad she felt that she could hardly keep up that house in welbeck street for herself even if her means permitted it what should she do with herself whither should she take herself perhaps the bitterest drop in her cup had come from those words of mr broune forbidding her to write more novels after all then she was not a clever womannot more clever than other women around her that very morning she had prided herself on her coming success as a novelist basing all her hopes on that review in the breakfast table now with that reaction of spirits which is so common to all of us she was more than equally despondent he would not thus have crushed her without a reason though he was hard to her nowhe who used to be so softhe was very good it did not occur to her to rebel against him after what he had said of course there would be no more praise in the breakfast tableand equally of course no novel of hers could succeed without that the more she thought of him the more omnipotent he seemed to be the more she thought of herself the more absolutely prostrate she seemed to have fallen from those high hopes with which she had begun her literary career not much more than twelve months ago  on the next day he did not come to her at all and she sat idle wretched and alone she could not interest herself in hettas coming marriage as that marriage was in direct opposition to one of her broken schemes she had not ventured to confess so much to mr broune but she had in truth written the first pages of the first chapter of a second novel it was impossible now that she should even look at what she had written all this made her very sad she spent the evening quite alone for hetta was staying down in suffolk with her cousins friend mrs yeld the bishops wife and as she thought of her life past and her life to come she did perhaps with a broken light see something of the error of her ways and did after a fashion repent it was all leather or prunello as she said to herselfit was all vanityand vanityand vanity what real enjoyment had she found in anything she had only taught herself to believe that some day something would come which she would likebut she had never as yet in truth found anything to like it had all been in anticipationbut now even her anticipations were at an end mr broune had sent her son away had forbidden her to write any more novels and had been refused when he had asked her to marry him  the next day he came to her as usual and found her still very wretched i shall give up this house she said i cant afford to keep it and in truth i shall not want it i dont in the least know where to go but i dont think that it much signifies any place will be the same to me now  i dont see why you should say that  what does it matter  you wouldnt think of going out of london  why not i suppose i had better go wherever i can live cheapest  i should be sorry that you should be settled where i could not see you said mr broune plaintively  so shall ivery you have been more kind to me than anybody but what am i to do if i stay in london i can live only in some miserable lodgings i know you will laugh at me and tell me that i am wrong but my idea is that i shall follow felix wherever he goes so that i may be near him and help him when he needs help hetta doesnt want me there is nobody else that i can do any good to  i want you said mr broune very quietly  ahthat is so kind of you there is nothing makes one so good as goodnessnothing binds your friend to you so firmly as the acceptance from him of friendly actions you say you want me because i have so sadly wanted you when i go you will simply miss an almost daily trouble but where shall i find a friend  when i said i wanted you i meant more than that lady carbury two or three months ago i asked you to be my wife you declined chiefly if i understood you rightly because of your sons position that has been altered and therefore i ask you again i have quite convinced myselfnot without some doubts for you shall know all but still i have quite convinced myselfthat such a marriage will best contribute to my own happiness i do not think dearest that it would mar yours  this was said with so quiet a voice and so placid a demeanour that the words though they were too plain to be misunderstood hardly at first brought themselves home to her of course he had renewed his offer of marriage but he had done so in a tone which almost made her feel that the proposition could not be an earnest one it was not that she believed that he was joking with her or paying her a poor insipid compliment when she thought about it at all she knew that it could not be so but the thing was so improbable her opinion of herself was so poor she had become so sick of her own vanities and littlenesses and pretences that she could not understand that such a man as this should in truth want to make her his wife at this moment she thought less of herself and more of mr broune than either perhaps deserved she sat silent quite unable to look him in the face while he kept his place in his armchair lounging back with his eyes intent on her countenance well he said what do you think of it i never loved you better than i did for refusing me before because i thought that you did so because it was not right that i should be embarrassed by your son  that was the reason she said almost in a whisper  but i shall love you better still for accepting me now if you will accept me  the long vista of her past life appeared before her eyes the ambition of her youth which had been taught to look only to a handsome maintenance the cruelty of her husband which had driven her to run from him the further cruelty of his forgiveness when she returned to him the calumny which had made her miserable though she had never confessed her misery then her attempts at life in london her literary successes and failures and the wretchedness of her sons careerthere had never been happiness or even comfort in any of it even when her smiles had been sweetest her heart had been heaviest could it be that now at last real peace should be within her reach and that tranquillity which comes from an anchor holding to a firm bottom then she remembered that first kissor attempted kisswhen with a sort of pride in her own superiority she had told herself that the man was a susceptible old goose she certainly had not thought then that his susceptibility was of this nature nor could she quite understand now whether she had been right then and that the mans feelings and almost his nature had since changedor whether he had really loved her from first to last as he remained silent it was necessary that she should answer him you can hardly have thought of it enough she said  i have thought of it a good deal too i have been thinking of it for six months at least  there is so much against me  what is there against you  they say bad things of me in india  i know all about that replied mr broune  and felix  i think i may say that i know all about that also  and then i have become so poor  i am not proposing to myself to marry you for your money luckily for mei hope luckily for both of usit is not necessary that i should do so  and then i seem so to have fallen through in everything i dont know what ive got to give to a man in return for all that you offer to give to me  yourself he said stretching out his right hand to her  and there he sat with it stretched outso that she found herself compelled to put her own into it or to refuse to do so with very absolute words very slowly she put out her own and gave it to him without looking at him then he drew her towards him and in a moment she was kneeling at his feet with her face buried on his knees considering their ages perhaps we must say that their attitude was awkward they would certainly have thought so themselves had they imagined that any one could have seen them but how many absurdities of the kind are not only held to be pleasant but almost holyas long as they remain mysteries inspected by no profane eyes it is not that age is ashamed of feeling passion and acknowledging itbut that the display of it is without the graces of which youth is proud and which age regrets  on that occasion there was very little more said between them he had certainly been in earnest and she had now accepted him as he went down to his office he told himself now that he had done the best not only for her but for himself also and yet i think that she had won him more thoroughly by her former refusal than by any other virtue  she as she sat alone late into the night became subject to a thorough reaction of spirit that morning the world had been a perfect blank to her there was no single object of interest before her now everything was rosecoloured this man who had thus bound her to him who had given her such assured proofs of his affection and truth was one of the considerable ones of the world a man than whom fewso she told herselfwere greater or more powerful was it not a career enough for any woman to be the wife of such a man to receive his friends and to shine with his reflected glory  whether her hopes were realised oras human hopes never are realisedhow far her content was assured these pages cannot tell but they must tell that before the coming winter was over lady carbury became the wife of mr broune and in furtherance of her own resolve took her husbands name the house in welbeck street was kept and mrs brounes tuesday evenings were much more regarded by the literary world than had been those of lady carbury     chapter c  down in suffolk   it need hardly be said that paul montague was not long in adjusting his affairs with hetta after the visit which he received from roger carbury early on the following morning he was once more in welbeck street taking the brooch with him and though at first lady carbury kept up her opposition she did it after so weak a fashion as to throw in fact very little difficulty in his way hetta understood perfectly that she was in this matter stronger than her mother and that she need fear nothing now that roger carbury was on her side i dont know what you mean to live on lady carbury said threatening future evils in a plaintive tone hetta repeated though in other language the assurance which the young lady made who declared that if her future husband would consent to live on potatoes she would be quite satisfied with the potatopeelings while paul made some vague allusion to the satisfactory nature of his final arrangements with the house of fisker montague and montague i dont see anything like an income said lady carbury but i suppose roger will make it right he takes everything upon himself now it seems but this was before the halcyon day of mr brounes second offer  it was at any rate decided that they were to be married and the time fixed for the marriage was to be the following spring when this was finally arranged roger carbury who had returned to his own home conceived the idea that it would be well that hetta should pass the autumn and if possible the winter also down in suffolk so that she might get used to him in the capacity which he now aspired to fill and with that object he induced mrs yeld the bishops wife to invite her down to the palace hetta accepted the invitation and left london before she could hear the tidings of her mothers engagement with mr broune  roger carbury had not yielded in this matterhad not brought himself to determine that he would recognize paul and hetta as acknowledged loverswithout a fierce inward contest two convictions had been strong in his mind both of which were opposed to this recognition the first telling him that he would be a fitter husband for the girl than paul montague and the second assuring him that paul had illtreated him in such a fashion that forgiveness would be both foolish and unmanly for roger though he was a religious man and one anxious to conform to the spirit of christianity would not allow himself to think that an injury should be forgiven unless the man who did the injury repented of his own injustice as to giving his coat to the thief who had taken his cloakhe told himself that were he and others to be guided by that precept honest industry would go naked in order that vice and idleness might be comfortably clothed if any one stole his cloak he would certainly put that man in prison as soon as possible and not commence his lenience till the thief should at any rate affect to be sorry for his fault now to his thinking paul montague had stolen his cloak and were he roger to give way in this matter of his love he would be giving paul his coat also no he was bound after some fashion to have paul put into prison to bring him before a jury and to get a verdict against him so that some sentence of punishment might be at least pronounced how then could he yield  and paul montague had shown himself to be very weak in regard to women it might beno doubt it was truethat mrs hurtles appearance in england had been distressing to him but still he had gone down with her to lowestoft as her lover and to rogers thinking a man who could do that was quite unfit to be the husband of hetta carbury he would himself tell no tales against montague on that head even when pressed to do so he had told no tale but not the less was his conviction strong that hetta ought to know the truth and to be induced by that knowledge to reject her younger lover  but then over these convictions there came a thirdequally strong which told him that the girl loved the younger man and did not love him and that if he loved the girl it was his duty as a man to prove his love by doing what he could to make her happy as he walked up and down the walk by the moat with his hands clasped behind his back stopping every now and again to sit on the terrace wallwalking there mile after mile with his mind intent on the one ideahe schooled himself to feel that that and that only could be his duty what did love mean if not that what could be the devotion which men so often affect to feel if it did not tend to selfsacrifice on behalf of the beloved one a man would incur any danger for a woman would subject himself to any toilwould even die for her but if this were done simply with the object of winning her where was that real love of which sacrifice of self on behalf of another is the truest proof so by degrees he resolved that the thing must be done the man though he had been bad to his friend was not all bad he was one who might become good in good hands he roger was too firm of purpose and too honest of heart to buoy himself up into new hopes by assurances of the mans unfitness what right had he to think that he could judge of that better than the girl herself and so when many many miles had been walked he succeeded in conquering his own heartthough in conquering it he crushed itand in bringing himself to the resolve that the energies of his life should be devoted to the task of making mrs paul montague a happy woman we have seen how he acted up to this resolve when last in london withdrawing at any rate all signs of anger from paul montague and behaving with the utmost tenderness to hetta  when he had accomplished that task of conquering his own heart and of assuring himself thoroughly that hetta was to become his rivals wife he was i think more at ease and less troubled in his spirit than he had been during these months in which there had still been doubt the sort of happiness which he had once pictured to himself could certainly never be his that he would never marry he was quite sure indeed he was prepared to settle carbury on hettas eldest boy on condition that such boy should take the old name he would never have a child whom he could in truth call his own but if he could induce these people to live at carbury or to live there for at least a part of the year so that there should be some life in the place he thought that he could awaken himself again and again take an interest in the property but as a first step to this he must learn to regard himself as an old manas one who had let life pass by too far for the purposes of his own home and who must therefore devote himself to make happy the homes of others  so thinking of himself and so resolving he had told much of his story to his friend the bishop and as a consequence of those revelations mrs yeld had invited hetta down to the palace roger felt that he had still much to say to his cousin before her marriage which could be said in the country much better than in town and he wished to teach her to regard suffolk as the county to which she should be attached and in which she was to find her home the day before she came he was over at the palace with the pretence of asking permission to come and see his cousin soon after her arrival but in truth with the idea of talking about hetta to the only friend to whom he had looked for sympathy in his trouble as to settling your property on her or her children said the bishop it is quite out of the question your lawyer would not allow you to do it where would you be if after all you were to marry  i shall never marry  very likely notbut yet you may how is a man of your age to speak with certainty of what he will do or what he will not do in that respect you can make your will doing as you please with your propertyand the will when made can be revoked  i think you hardly understand just what i feel said roger and i know very well that i am unable to explain it but i wish to act exactly as i would do if she were my daughter and as if her son if she had a son would be my natural heir  but if she were your daughter her son wouldnt be your natural heir as long as there was a probability or even a chance that you might have a son of your own a man should never put the power which properly belongs to him out of his own hands if it does properly belong to you it must be better with you than elsewhere i think very highly of your cousin and i have no reason to think otherwise than well of the gentleman whom she intends to marry but it is only human nature to suppose that the fact that your property is still at your own disposal should have some effect in producing the more complete observance of your wishes  i do not believe it in the least my lord said roger somewhat angrily  that is because you are so carried away by enthusiasm at the present moment as to ignore the ordinary rules of life there are not perhaps many fathers who have regans and gonerils for their daughtersbut there are very many who may take a lesson from the folly of the old king thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown the fool said to him when thou gavst thy golden one away the world i take it thinks that the fool was right  the bishop did so far succeed that roger abandoned the idea of settling his property on paul montagues children but he was not on that account the less resolute in his determination to make himself and his own interests subordinate to those of his cousin when he came over two days afterwards to see her he found her in the garden and walked there with her for a couple of hours i hope all our troubles are over now he said smiling  you mean about felix said hettaand mamma  no indeed as to felix i think that lady carbury has done the best thing in her power no doubt she has been advised by mr broune and mr broune seems to be a prudent man and about your mother herself i hope that she may now be comfortable but i was not alluding to felix and your mother i was thinking of youand of myself  i hope that you will never have any troubles  i have had troubles i mean to speak very freely to you now dear i was nearly upsetwhat i suppose people call brokenheartedwhen i was assured that you certainly would never become my wife i ought not to have allowed myself to get into such a frame of mind i should have known that i was too old to have a chance  oh rogerit was not that  wellthat and other things i should have known it sooner and have got over my misery quicker i should have been more manly and stronger after all though love is a wonderful incident in a mans life it is not that only that he is here for i have duties plainly marked out for me and as i should never allow myself to be withdrawn from them by pleasure so neither should i by sorrow but it is done now i have conquered my regrets and i can say with safety that i look forward to your presence and pauls presence at carbury as the source of all my future happiness i will make him welcome as though he were my brother and you as though you were my daughter all i ask of you is that you will not be chary of your presence there she only answered him by a close pressure on his arm that is what i wanted to say to you you will teach yourself to regard me as your best and closest friendas he on whom you have the strongest right to depend of allexcept your husband  there is no teaching necessary for that she said  as a daughter leans on a father i would have you lean on me hetta you will soon come to find that i am very old i grow old quickly and already feel myself to be removed from everything that is young and foolish  you never were foolish  nor young either i sometimes think but now you must promise me this you will do all that you can to induce him to make carbury his residence  we have no plans as yet at all roger  then it will be certainly so much the easier for you to fall into my plan of course you will be married at carbury  what will mamma say  she will come here and i am sure will enjoy it that i regard as settled then after that let this be your homeso that you should learn really to care about and to love the place it will be your home really you know some of these days you will have to be squire of carbury yourself when i am gone till you have a son old enough to fill that exalted position with all his love to her and his goodwill to them both he could not bring himself to say that paul montague should be squire of carbury  oh roger please do not talk like that  but it is necessary my dear i want you to know what my wishes are and if it be possible i would learn what are yours my mind is quite made up as to my future life of course i do not wish to dictate to youand if i did i could not dictate to mr montague  praypray do not call him mr montague  well i will notto paul then there goes the last of my anger he threw his hands up as though he were scattering his indignation to the air i would not dictate either to you or to him but it is right that you should know that i hold my property as steward for those who are to come after me and that the satisfaction of my stewardship will be infinitely increased if i find that those for whom i act share the interest which i shall take in the matter it is the only payment which you and he can make me for my trouble  but felix roger  his brow became a little black as he answered her to a sister he said very solemnly i will not say a word against her brother but on that subject i claim a right to come to a decision on my own judgment it is a matter in which i have thought much and i may say suffered much i have ideas oldfashioned ideas on the matter which i need not pause to explain to you now if we are as much together as i hope we shall be you will no doubt come to understand them the disposition of a family property even though it be one so small as mine is to my thinking a matter which a man should not make in accordance with his own capricesor even with his own affections he owes a duty to those who live on his land and he owes a duty to his country and though it may seem fantastic to say so i think he owes a duty to those who have been before him and who have manifestly wished that the property should be continued in the hands of their descendants these things are to me very holy in what i am doing i am in some respects departing from the theory of my lifebut i do so under a perfect conviction that by the course i am taking i shall best perform the duties to which i have alluded i do not think hetta that we need say any more about that he had spoken so seriously that though she did not quite understand all that he had said she did not venture to dispute his will any further he did not endeavour to exact from her any promise but having explained his purposes kissed her as he would have kissed a daughter and then left her and rode home without going into the house  soon after that paul montague came down to carbury and the same thing was said to him though in a much less solemn manner paul was received quite in the old way having declared that he would throw all anger behind him and that paul should be again paul he rigidly kept his promise whatever might be the cost to his own feelings as to his love for hetta and his old hopes and the disappointment which had so nearly unmanned him he said not another word to his fortunate rival montague knew it all but there was now no necessity that any allusion should be made to past misfortunes roger indeed made a solemn resolution that to paul he would never again speak of hetta as the girl whom he himself had loved though he looked forward to a time probably many years hence when he might perhaps remind her of his fidelity but he spoke much of the land and of the tenants and the labourers of his own farm of the amount of the income and of the necessity of so living that the income might always be more than sufficient for the wants of the household  when the spring came round hetta and paul were married by the bishop at the parish church of carbury and roger carbury gave away the bride all those who saw the ceremony declared that the squire had not seemed to be so happy for many a long year john crumb who was there with his wifehimself now one of rogers tenants having occupied the land which had become vacant by the death of old daniel rugglesdeclared that the wedding was almost as good fun as his own john what a fool you are ruby said to her spouse when this opinion was expressed with rather a loud voice yes i be said johnbut not such a fool as to a missed a having o you no john it was i was the fool then said ruby well see about that when the bairns born said johnequally aloud then ruby held her tongue mrs broune and mr broune were also at carburythus doing great honour to mr and mrs paul montague and showing by their presence that all family feuds were at an end sir felix was not there happily up to this time mr septimus blake had continued to keep that gentleman as one of his protestant population in the german townno doubt not without considerable trouble to himself
