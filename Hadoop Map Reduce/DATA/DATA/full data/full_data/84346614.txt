84346614	chantry house     chapter ia nursery prose    and if it be the heart of man    which our existence measures far longer is our childhoods span    than that of manly pleasures  for long each month and year is then    their thoughts and days extending but months and years pass swift with men    to times last goal descending  isaac williams  the united force of the younger generation has been brought upon me  to record with the aid of diaries and letters the circumstances  connected with chantry house and my two dear elder brothers  once  this could not have been done without more pain than i could brook  but the lapse of time heals wounds brings compensations and when  the heart has ceased from aching and yearning makes the memory of  what once filled it a treasure to be brought forward with joy and  thankfulness  nor would it be well that some of those mentioned in  the coming narrative should be wholly forgotten and their place  know them no more  to explain all i must go back to a time long before the morning  when my father astonished us all by exclaiming poor old james  winslow  so chantry house is came to us after all  previous to  that event i do not think we were aware of the existence of that  place far less of its being a possible inheritance for my parents  would never have permitted themselves or their family to be  unsettled by the notion of doubtful contingencies  my father john edward winslow was a barrister and held an  appointment in the admiralty office which employed him for many  hours of the day at somerset house  my mother whose maiden name  was mary griffith belonged to a naval family  her father had been  lost in a west indian hurricane at sea and her uncle admiral sir  john griffith was the hero of the family having been at trafalgar  and distinguished himself in cutting out expeditions  my eldest  brother bore his name  the second was named after the duke of  clarence with whom my mother had once danced at a ball on board  ship at portsmouth and who had been rather fond of my uncle   indeed i believe my fathers appointment had been obtained through  his interest just about the time of clarences birth  we three boys had come so fast upon each others heels in the  novembers of 1809 10 and 11 that any two of us used to look like  twins  there is still extant a feeble watercoloured drawing of the  trio in nankeen frocks and long white trowsers with bare necks  and arms the latter twined together and with the free hands  griffith holding a bat clarence a trap and i a ball  i remember  the emulation we felt at griffiths privilege of eldest in holding  the bat  the sitting for that picture is the only thing i clearly remember  during those earlier days  i have no recollection of the disaster  which at four years old altered my life  the catastrophe as  others have described it was that we three boys were riding cock horse on the balusters of the second floor of our house in montagu  place russell square when we indulged in a general melee which  resulted in all tumbling over into the vestibule below  the others  to whom i served as cushion were not damaged beyond the power of  yelling and were quite restored in halfanhour but i was  undermost and the consequence has been a curved spine dwarfed  stature an elevated shoulder and a shortened nearly useless leg  what i do remember is my mother reading to me miss edgeworths  frank and the little do trusty as i lay in my crib in her bedroom   i made one of my nieces hunt up the book for me the other day and  the story brought back at once the little crib or the watered blue  moreen canopy of the big fourposter to which i was sometimes lifted  for a change even the scrawly pattern of the paper which my weary  eyes made into purple elves perpetually pursuing crimson ones the  foremost of whom always turned upside down and the knobs in the  marseilles counterpane with which my fingers used to toy  i have  heard my mother tell that whenever i was most languid and suffering  i used to whine out o do read frank and the little dog trusty  and never permitted a single word to be varied in the curious  childish love of reiteration with its soothing power  i am afraid that any true picture of our parents especially of my  mother will not do them justice in the eyes of the young people of  the present day who are accustomed to a far more indulgent  government and yet seem to me to know little of the loyal  veneration and submission with which we have through life regarded  our father and mother  it would have been reckoned disrespectful to  address them by these names they were through life to us in  private papa and mamma and we never presumed to take a liberty  with them  i doubt whether the petting patronising equality of  terms on which children now live with their parents be equally  wholesome  there was then however strong love and self sacrificing devotion but not manifested in softness or cultivation  of sympathy  nothing was more dreaded than spoiling which was  viewed as idle and unjustifiable selfgratification at the expense  of the objects thereof  there were an unlucky little pair in  russell square who were said to be spoilt children and who used  to be mentioned in our nursery with bated breath as a kind of  monsters or criminals  i believe our mother laboured under a  perpetual fear of spoiling griff as the eldest clarence as the  beauty me as the invalid emily two years younger as the only  girl and martyn as the afterthought six years below our sister   she was always performing little acts of conscientiousness little  as we guessed it  thus though her unremitting care saved my life and was such that  she finally brought on herself a severe and dangerous illness she  kept me in order all the time never wailed over me nor weakly  pitied me never permitted resistance to medicine nor rebellion  against treatment enforced little courtesies insisted on every  required exertion and hardly ever relaxed the rule of spartan  fortitude in herself as in me  it is to this resolution on her  part carried out consistently at whatever present cost to us both  that i owe such powers of locomotion as i possess and the habits of  exertion that have been even more valuable to me  when at last after many weeks nay months of this watchfulness  she broke down so that her life was for a time in danger the lack  of her bracing and tender care made my life very trying after i  found myself transported to the nursery scarcely understanding why  accused of having by my naughtiness made ray poor mamma so ill and  discovering for the first time that i was a miserable naughty  little fretful being and with nobody but clarence and the housemaid  to take pity on me  nurse gooch was a masterful trustworthy woman and was laid under  injunctions not to indulge master edward  she certainly did not err  in that respect though she attended faithfully to my material  welfare but woe to me if i gave way to a little moaning and what i  felt still harder she never said good boy if i contrived to  abstain  i hear of carpets curtains and pictures in the existing nurseries   they must be palaces compared with our great bare attic where  nothing was allowed that could gather dust  one bit of drugget by  the fireside where stood a round table at which the maids talked  and darned stockings was all that hid the bare boards the walls  were as plain as those of a workhouse and when the london sun did  shine it glared into my eyes through the great unshaded windows   there was a deal table for the meals and very plain meals they  were and two or three big presses painted white for our clothes  and one cupboard for our toys  i must say that gooch was strictly  just and never permitted little emily nor griffthough he was  very decidedly the favouriteto bear off my beloved woolly dog to  be stabled in the houses of wooden bricks which the two were  continually constructing for their menagerie of maimed animals  griff was deservedly the favourite with every one who was not like  our parents conscientiously bent on impartiality  he was so bright  and winning he had such curly tightrolled hair with a tinge of  auburn such merry bold blue eyes such glowing dimpled cheeks such  a joyous smile all over his face and such a ringing laugh he was  so strong brave and sturdy that he was a boy to be proud of and  a perfect king in his own way making every one do as he pleased   all the maids and peter the footman were his slaves every one  except nurse and mamma and it was only by a strong effort of  principle that they resisted him while he dragged clarence about as  his devoted though not always happy follower  alas for clarence  courage was not in him  the fearless infant  boy chiefly dwells in conventional fiction and valour seldom comes  before strength  moreover i have come to the opinion that though  no one thought of it at the time his nerves must have had a  terrible and lasting shock at the accident and at the sight of my  crushed and deathly condition which occupied every one too much for  them to think of soothing or shielding him  at any rate fear was  the misery of his life  darkness was his horror  he would scream  till he brought in some one though he knew it would be only to  scold or slap him  the housemaids closet on the stairs was to him  an abode of wolves  mrs gattys tale of the tiger in the coalbox  is a transcript of his feelings except that no one took the trouble  to reassure him something undefined and horrible was thought to wag  in the case of the eightday clock and he could not bear to open  the play cupboard lest something should jump out on him  the  first time he was taken to the zoological gardens the monkeys so  terrified him that a bystander insisted on goochs carrying him away  lest he should go into fits though griffith was shouting with  ecstasy and could hardly forgive the curtailment of his enjoyment  clarence used to aver that he really did see things in the dark  but as he only shuddered and sobbed instead of describing them he  was punished for telling fibs though the housemaid used to speak  under her breath of his being a sunday child  and after long  penance tied to his stool in the corner he would creep up to me  and whisper but eddy i really did  however it was only too well established in the nursery that  clarences veracity was on a par with his courage  when taxed with  any misdemeanour he used to look round scared and bewildered and  utter a flat demur  one scene in particular comes before me  there  were strict laws against going into shops or buying dainties without  express permission from mamma or nurse but one day when clarence  had by some chance been sent out alone with the good natured  housemaid his fingers were found sticky  now master clarence youve been a naughty boy eating of sweets  exclaimed stern justice in a mob cap and frills  nono faltered the victim but alas  mrs gooch had only to  thrust her hand into the little pocket of his monkey suit to convict  him on the spot  the maid was dismissed with a months wages and poor clarence  underwent a strange punishment from my mother who was getting about  again by that time namely a drop of hot sealingwax on his tongue  to teach him practically the doom of the false tongue  it might  have done him good if there had been sufficient encouragement to him  to make him try to win a new character but it only added a fresh  terror to his mind and nurse grew fond of manifesting her  incredulity of his assertions by always referring to griff or to me  or even to little emily  what was worse she used to point him out  to her congeners in the square or the park as such a false child  he was a very pretty little fellow with a delicately rosy face  wistful blue eyes and soft light wavy hair and perhaps gooch was  jealous of his attracting more notice than griffith and thought he  posed for admiration for she used to tell people that no one could  guess what a child he was for slyness so that he could not bear  going out with her and sometimes bemoaned himself to me  there must be a good deal of sneaking in the undeveloped nature for  in those days i was ashamed of my preference for clarence the  naughty one  but there was no helping it he was so much more  gentle than griff and would always give up any sport that  incommoded me instead of calling me a stupid little ape and  becoming more boisterous after the fashion of griff  moreover he  fetched and carried for me unweariedly and would play at  spillekins help to put up puzzles and enact little dramas with our  wooden animals such as griff scorned as only fit for babies  even  nurse allowed clarences merits towards me and little emily but  always with the sigh  if he was but as good in other respects but  them quiet ones is always sly  good nurse gooch  we all owe much to her staunch fidelity strong  discipline and unselfish devotion but nature had not fitted her to  deal with a timid sensitive child of highly nervous temperament   indeed persons of far more insight might have been perplexed by the  fact that clarence was exemplary at church and prayers family and  privatewhenever griff would let him that is to sayand would  add private petitions of his own sometimes of a startling nature   he never scandalised the nursery like griff by unseemly pranks on  sundays nor by innovations in the habits of noahs ark but was as  much shocked as nurse when the lion was made to devour the elephant  or the lion and wolf fought in an embrace fatal to their legs   bible stories and watts hymns were more to clarence than even to  me and he used to ask questions for which goochs theology was  quite insufficient and which brought the invariable answers now  master clarry i never did  little boys should not ask such  questions  whats the use of your pretending sir  its all  falseness thats what it is  i hates hypercriting  dont  worrit master clarence you are a very naughty boy to say such  things  i shall put you in the corner  even nurse was scared one night when clarence had a frightful  screaming fit declaring that he saw herherall white and even  while being slapped reiterated her lucy  lucy was a kind elder girl in the square gardens a protector of  little timid ones  she was known to be at that time very ill with  measles and in fact died that very night  both my brothers  sickened the next day and emily and i soon followed their example  but no one had it badly except clarence who had high fever and  very much delirium each night talking to people whom he thought he  saw so as to make nurse regret her severity on the vision of lucy    chapter iischoolroom days    in the loom of lifecloth pleasure    ere our childish days be told with the warp and woof enwoven    glitters like a thread of gold  jean ingelow  looking back i think my mother was the leading spirit in our  household though she never for a moment suspected it  indeed the  chess queen must be the most active on the home board and one of  the objects of her life was to give her husband a restful evening  when he came home to the six oclock dinner  she also had to make  both ends meet on an income which would seem starvation at the  present day but she was strong spirited and managing and equal  to all her tasks till the long attendance upon me and the  consequent illness forced her to spare herselfa littlea very  little  previously she had been our only teacher except that my father read  a chapter of the bible with us every morning before breakfast and  heard the catechism on a sunday  for we could all read long before  young gentlefolks nowadays can say their letters  it was well for  me since books with a small quantity of type and a good deal of  frightful illustration beguiled many of my weary moments  you may  see my special favourites bound up on the shelf in my bedroom   crabbes tales frank the parents assistant and later crokers  tales from english history lambs tales from shakespeare tales of  a grandfather and the rival crusoes stand preeminentalso mrs  leicesters school with the ghost story cut out  fairies and ghosts were prohibited as unwholesome and not unwisely   the one would have been enervating to me and the other would have  been a definite addition to clarences stock of horrors  indeed  one story had been cut out of crabbes tales and another out of an  annual presented to emily but not before griff had read the latter  and the version he related to us probably lost nothing in the  telling indeed to this day i recollect the man wont to slay the  harmless cricket on the hearth and in a storm at sea pursued by a  gigantic cockroach and thrown overboard  the night after hearing  this choice legend clarence was found crouching beside me in bed for  fear of the cockroach  i am afraid the vengeance was more than  proportioned to the offence  even during my illness that brave mother struggled to teach my  brothers daily lessons and my father heard them a short bit of  latin grammar at his breakfast five was thought in those days to be  the fit age to begin it and fathers the fit teachers thereof  and  he continued to give this morning lesson when on our return from  airing at ramsgate after our recovery from the measles my mother  found she must submit to transfer us to a daily governess  old miss newtons attainments could not have been great for her  answers to my inquiries were decidedly funny and prefaced sotto  voce with what a child it is  but she was a good kindly lady  who had the faculty of teaching and of forestalling rebellion and  her little thin corkscrew curls touched with gray her pale eyes  prim black silk apron and sandalled shoes rise before me full of  happy associations of tender kindness and patience  she was wise  too in her own simple way  when nurse would have forewarned her of  clarences failings in his own hearing she cut the words short by  declaring that she should like never to find out which was the  naughty one  and when habit was too strong and he had denied the  ink spot on the atlas she persuasively wiled out a confession not  only to her but to mamma who hailed the avowal as the beginning of  better things and kissed instead of punishing  clarences queries had been snubbed into reserve and i doubt  whether miss newtons theoretic theology was very much more  developed than that of mrs gooch but her practice and devotion  were admirable and she fostered religious sentiment among us  introducing little books which were welcome in the restricted range  of sunday reading  indeed mrs sherwoods have some literary  merit and her fairchild family indulged in such delicious and  eccentric acts of naughtiness as quite atoned for all the religious  teaching and fascinated griff though he was apt to be very  impatient of certain little affectionate lectures to which clarence  listened meekly  my father and mother were both of the old fashioned orthodox school with minds formed on jeremy taylor  blair south and secker who thought it their duty to go diligently  to church twice on sunday communicate four times a year their only  opportunities after grave and serious preparation read a sermon  to their household on sunday evenings and watch over their  childrens religious instruction though in a reserved  undemonstrative manner  my father always read one daily chapter  with us every morning one psalm at family prayers and my mother  made us repeat a few verses of scripture before our other studies  began besides which there was special teaching on sunday and an  abstinence from amusements such as would now be called sabbatarian  but a walk in the park with papa was so much esteemed that it made  the day a happy and honoured one to those who could walk  there was little going into society comparatively for people in  our stationsolemn dinnerparties from time to timetwo a year  did we give and then the house was turned upside downand now and  then my father dined out or brought a friend home to dinner and  there were socalled morning calls in the afternoon but no tea drinking  for the most part the heads of the family dined alone at  six and afterwards my father read aloud some book of biography or  travels while we children were expected to employ ourselves  quietly threading beads drawing or putting up puzzles and listen  or not as we chose only not interrupt as we sat at the big  central round mahogany table  to this hour i remember portions of  belzonis researches and franklins terrible american adventures  and they bring back tones of my fathers voice  as an authority  papa was seldom invoked except on very serious occasions such as  griffiths audacity clarences falsehood or my obstinacy and then  the affair was formidable he was judicial and awful and though he  would graciously forgive on signs of repentance he never was  sympathetic  he had not married young and there were forty years  or more between him and his sons so that he had left too far behind  him the feelings of boyhood to make himself one with us even if he  had thought it right or dignified to do soyet i cannot describe  the depth of the respect and loyalty he inspired in us nor the  delight we felt in a word of commendation or a special attention  from him  the early part of miss newtons rule was unusually fertile in such  pleasures and much might have been spared could clarence have been  longer under her influence but griff grew beyond her management  and was taunted by fellows in the square into assertions of  manliness such as kicking his heels stealing her odd little  fringed parasol pitching his books into the area keeping her in  misery with his antics during their walks and finally leading  clarence off after punch into the rookery of st giless where she  could not follow because emily was in her charge  this was the crisis  she had to come home without the boys and  though they arrived long before any of the authorities knew of their  absence she owned with tears that she could not conscientiously be  responsible any longer for griffithwho not only openly defied her  authority but had found out how little she knew and laughed at  her  i have reason to believe also that my mother had discovered  that she frequented the preachings of rowland hill and baptist noel  and had confiscated some unorthodox tracts presented to the  servants thus being alarmed lest she should implant the seeds of  dissent  parting with her after four years under her was a real grief  even  griff was fond of her when once emancipated he used to hug her and  bring her remarkable presents and she heartily loved her tormentor   everybody did  it remained a great pleasure to get her to spend an  evening with us while the elders were gone out to dinner nor do i  think she ever did us anything but good though i am afraid we  laughed at old newton as we grew older and more conceited  we  never had another governess  my mother read and enforced diligence  on emily and me and we had masters for different studies the two  boys went to school and when martyn began to emerge from babyhood  emily was his teacher    chapter iiiwin and slow    the rude will shuffle through with ease enough great schools best suit the sturdy and the rough  cowper  at school griffith was very happy and brilliantly successful alike  in study and sport though sports were not made prominent in those  days and triumphs in them were regarded by the elders with doubtful  pride lest they should denote a lack of attention to matters of  greater importance  all his achievements were however poured  forth by himself and clarence to emily and me and we felt as proud  of them as if they had been our own  clarence was industrious and did not fail in his school work but  when he came home for the holidays there was a cowed look about him  and private revelations were made over my sofa that made my flesh  creep  the scars were still visible caused by having been  compelled to grasp the bars of the grate barehanded and what was  worse he had been suspended outside a third story window by the  wrists held by a schoolfellow of thirteen  but what was griff about i demanded with hot tears of  indignation  oh winthats what they call him and me slowhe said it would  do me good  but i dont think it did eddy  it only makes my heart  beat fit to choke me whenever i go near the passage window  i could only utter a vain wish that i had been there and able to  fight for him and i attacked griff on the subject on the first  opportunity  oh was his answer it is only what all fellows have to bear if  theres no pluck in them  they tried it on upon me you know but i  soon showed them it would not dowith the cock of the nose the  flash of the eyes the clench of the fist that were peculiarly  griffs own and when i pleaded that he might have protected  clarence he laughed scornfully  as to slow wretched being a  fellow cant help bullying him  it comes as natural as to a cat  with a mouse  on further and reiterated pleadings griff declared  first that it was the only thing to do slow any good or make a man  of him and next that he heartily wished that winslow junior had  been miss clara at once as the fellows called himit was really  hard on him griff to have such a sneaking little coward tied to  him for a junior  i particularly resented the term slow for clarence had lately been  the foremost of us in his studies but the idea that learning had  anything to do with the matter was derided and as time went on  there was vexation and displeasure at his progress not being  commensurate with his abilities  it would have been treason to  schoolboy honour to let the elders know that though a strong high spirited popular boy like win might venture to excel big bullying  dunces such fair game as poor slow could be terrified into not  only keeping below them but into doing their work for them  to him  cowpers tirocinium had only too much sad truth  as to his old failing there were no special complaints but in  those prearnoldian times no lofty code of honour was even ideal  among schoolboys or expected of them by masters shuffling was  thought natural and allowances made for faults in indolent despair  my mother thought the navy the proper element of boyhood and her  uncle the admiral promised a nominationa simple affair in those  happy days involving neither examination nor competition  griffith  was however one of those independent boys who take an aversion to  whatever is forced on them as their fate  he was ready and  successful with his studies a hero among his comrades and  preferred continuing at school to what he pronounced on the  authority of the nautical tales freely thrown in our way to be the  life of a dog only fit for the fool of the family besides he had  once been out in a boat tasted of seasickness and been laughed  at  my father was gratified thinking his brains too good for a  midshipman and pleased that he should wish to tread in his own  steps at harrow and oxford and thus my mother could not openly  regret his degeneracy when all the rest of us were crazy over tom  cringles log and ready to envy clarence when the offer was passed  on to him and he appeared in the full glory of his naval uniform   not much choice had been offered to him  my mother would have  thought it shameful and ungrateful to have no son available my  father was glad to have the boys profession fixed and he himself  was rejoiced to escape from the miseries he knew only too well and  ready to believe that uniform and dirk would make a man of him at  once with all his terrors left behind  perhaps the chief drawback  was that the ladies would say what a darling affording griff  endless opportunities for the goodhumoured mockery by which he  concealed his own secret regrets  did not even selina clarkson  whose red cheeks dark blue eyes and jetty profusion of shining  curls were our notion of perfect beauty select the little naval  cadet for her partner at the dancing masters ball  in the first voyage a cruise in the pacific all went well  the  good admiral had carefully chosen ship and captain there were an  excellent set of officers a good tone among the midshipmen and  clarence who was only twelve years old was constituted the pet of  the cockpit  one lad in especial coles by name attracted by  clarences pleasant gentleness and impelled by the generosity that  shields the weak became his guardian friend and protected him from  all the roughnesses in his power  if there were a fault in that  excellent coles it was that he made too much of a baby of his  protege and did not train him to shift for himself  but wisdom and  moderation are not characteristics of early youth  at home we had  great enjoyment of his long descriptive letters which came under  cover to our father at the admiralty but were chiefly intended for  my benefit  all were proud of them and great was my elation when i  heard papa relate some fact out of them with the preface my boy  tells me my boy clarence in the calypso he writes a capital  letter  how great was our ecstasy when after three years and a half we had  him at home again handsome vigorous wellgrown excellently  reported of fully justifying my mothers assurances that the sea  would make a man of him  there was griffith in the fifth form and a  splendid cricketer but clarence could stand up to him now and  harrovian exploits were tame beside stories of sharks and negroes  monkeys and alligators  there was one in particular about a whole  boats crew sitting down on what they thought was a fallen tree but  which suddenly swept them all over on their faces and turned out to  be a boaconstrictor and would have embraced one of them if he had  not had the sail of the boat coiled round the mast and palmed off  upon him when he gorged it contentedly and being found dead on the  next landing his skin was used to cover the captains seachest   clarence declined to repeat this tale and many others before the  elders and was displeased with emily for referring to it in public   as to his terrors he took it for granted that an officer of hms  calypso had left them behind and in fact he naturally forgot and  passed over what he had not been shielded from while his hereditary  love of the sea really made those incidental to his profession much  more endurable than the bullying he had undergone at school  we were very happy that christmas and very proud of our boys  one  evening we were treated to a box at the pantomime and even i was  able to go to it  we put our young sailor and our sister in the  forefront and believed that every one was as much struck with them  as with the wonderful transformations of goodytwoshoes under the  wand of harlequin  brotherlike we might tease our one girl and  call her an affected little pussy cat but our private opinion was  that she excelled all other damsels with her bright blue eyes and  pretty curling hair which had the same chestnut shine as griffs enough to make us correct possible vanity by terming it red though  we were ready to fight any one else who presumed to do so  indeed  griff had defended its hue in single combat and his eye was treated  for it with beefsteak by peter in the pantry  we were immensely  though silently proud of her in her white embroidered cambric  frock red sash and shoes and coral necklace almost an heirloom  for it had been brought from sicily in nelsons days by my mothers  poor young father  how parents and doctors in these days would have  shuddered at her neck and arms bare not only in the evening but  by day  when she was a little younger she could so shrink up from  her clothes that griff or little martyn in a mischievous mood  would put things down her back to reappear below her petticoats   once it was a dead wasp which descended harmlessly the length of  her spine  she was a goodhumoured affectionate dear sister my  valued companion submitting patiently to be eclipsed when clarence  was present and everything to me in his absence  sturdy little  martyn too was held by us to be the most promising of small boys   he was a likeness of clarence only stouter hardier and without  the delicate girlish wistful look imitating griff in everything  and rather a heavy handful to emily and me when left to our care  though we were all the more proud of his high spirit and were fast  becoming a mutual admiration society  what then were our feelings when griff always fearless dashed to  the rescue of a boy under whom the ice had broken in st james  park and held him up till assistance came  martyn who was with  him was sent home to fetch dry clothes and reassure my mother  which he did by dashing upstairs shouting wheres mamma  heres  griff been into the water and pulled out a boy and they dont know  if he is drowned but he looksoh  even after my mother had elicited that martyns he meant the boy  and not griff she could not rest without herself going to see that  our eldest was unhurt greet him and bring him home  what happy  tears stood in her eyes how my father shook hands with him how we  drank his health after dinner and how ungrateful i was to think  clarence deserved his name of slow for having stayed at home to play  chess with me because my back was aching when he might have been  winning the like honours  how red and gruff and shy the hero  looked and how he entreated no one to say any more about it  he would not even look publicly at the paragraph about it in the  paper only vituperating it for having made him into a juvenile  etonian and hoping no one from harrow would guess whom it meant  i found that paragraph the other day in my mothers desk folded  over the case of the medal of the royal humane society which griff  affected to despise but which when he was well out of the way  used to be exhibited on high days and holidays  it seems now like  the boundary mark of the golden days of our boyhood and unmitigated  hopes for one another    chapter ivubi lapsus quid feci    clarence is comefalse fleeting perjured clarence  king richard iii  there was much stagnation in the navy in those days in the reaction  after the great war and though our family had fair interest at the  admiralty it was seven months before my brother went to sea again   to me they were very happy months with my helper of helpers  companion of companions who made possible to me many a little  enterprise that could not be attempted without him  my father made  him share my studies and thus they became doubly pleasant  and oh  ye boys who murmur at the waverley novels as a dry holiday task ye  may envy us the zest and enthusiasm with which we devoured them in  their freshness  strangely enough the last that we read together  was the fair maid of perth  clarence and his friend coles longed to sail together again but  coles was shelved and when clarences appointment came at last it  was to the brig clotho commander brydone going out in the  mediterranean fleet under sir edward codrington  my mother did not  like brigs and my father did not like what he heard of the captain  but there had been jealous murmurs about appointments being absorbed  by sons of officialshe durst not pick and choose and the admiral  pronounced that if the lad had been spoilt on board the calypso it  was time for him to rough ita dictum whence there was no appeal  half a year later the tidings of the victory of navarino rang  through europe and were only half welcome to the conquerors but in  our household it is connected with a terrible recollection  though  more than half a century has rolled by i shrink from dwelling on  the shock that fell on us when my father returned from somerset  house with such a countenance that we thought our sailor had fallen  but my mother could brook the fact far less than if her son had died  a gallant death  the clotho was on her way home and midshipman  william clarence winslow was to be tried by courtmartial for  insubordination disobedience and drunkenness  my mother was like  one turned to stone  she would hardly go out of doors she could  scarcely bring herself to go to church she would have had my father  give up his situation if there had been any other means of  livelihood  she could not talk only when my father sighed we  should never have put him into the navy she hotly replied  how was i to suppose that a son of mine would be like that  emily cried all day and all night  some others would have felt it a  relief to have cried too  in more furious language than parents in  those days tolerated griff wrote to me his utter disbelief and how  he had punched the heads of fellows who presumed to doubt that it  was not all a rascally villainous plot  when the time came my father went down by the night mail to  portsmouth  he could scarcely bear to face the matter but as he  said he could not have it on his conscience if the boy did anything  desperate for want of some one to look after him  besides there  might be some explanation  explanation said my mother bitterly  that there always is  the explanation was thisi have put together what came out in  evidence what my father and the admiral heard from commiserating  officers and what at different times i learned from clarence  himself  captain brydone was one of the rough old description of  naval men good sailors and stern disciplinarians but wanting in  any sense of moral duties towards their ships company  his  lieutenant was of the same class soured moreover by tardy  promotion and prejudiced against a gentlemanlike fairfaced lad  understood to have interest and bearing a name that implied it  of  the other two midshipmen one was a dull lad of low stamp the other  a youth of twenty a born bully with evil as well as tyrannical  propensitiesthe crew conforming to severe discipline on board  but otherwise wild and lawless  in such a ship a youth with good  habits sensitive conscience and lack of moral or physical courage  could not but lead a life of misery losing every day more of his  selfrespect and spirit as he was driven to the evil he loathed  dreading the consequences temporal and eternal with all his soul  yet without resolution or courage to resist  as every one knows the battle of navarino came on suddenly almost  by mistake and though it is perhaps no excuse the hurlyburly and  horror burst upon him at unawares  though the english loss was  comparatively very small the clotho was a good deal exposed and  two men were killedone so close to clarence that his clothes were  splashed with blood  this entirely unnerved him he did not even  know what he did but he was not to be found when required to carry  an order and was discovered hidden away below shuddering in his  berth and then made some shallow excuse about misunderstanding  orders  whether this would have been brought up against him under  other circumstances or whether it would have been remembered that  great men including charles v and henri iv have had their moment  de peur i cannot tell but there were other charges  i cannot give  date or details  there is no record among the papers before me and  i can only vaguely recall what could hardly be read for the sense of  agony was never discussed and was driven into the most oblivious  recesses of the soul fifty years ago  there was a story about  having let a boats crew of which he was in charge get drunk and  overstay their time  one of them deserted and apparently  prevarication ran to the bounds of perjury if it did not overpass  them  nbseeing seamen flogged was one of the sickening horrors  that haunted clarence in the clotho  also when on shore at malta  with the young man whose name i will not recordhis evil geniushe  was beguiled or bullied into a wineshop and while not himself was  made the catspaw of some insolent practical joke on the  lieutenant and when called to account was so bewildered and  excited as to use unpardonable language  whatever it might have been in detail so much was proved against  him that he was dismissed his ship and his father was recommended  to withdraw him from the service as being disqualified by want of  nerve  also it was added more privately that such vicious  tendencies needed home restraint  the big bully his corrupter  bore witness against him but did not escape scot free for one of  the captains spoke to him in scathing tones of censure  whenever my mother was in trouble she always rearranged the  furniture and a family crisis was always heralded by a revolution  of chairs tables and sofas  she could not sit still under  suspense and during these terrible days the entire house underwent  a setting to rights  emily attended upon her and i sat and dusted  books  no doubt it was much better for us than sitting still  my  fathers letter came by the morning mail telling us of the  sentence and that he and our poor culprit as he said would come  home by the portsmouth coach in the evening  one room was already in order when sir john griffith kindly came to  see whether he could bring any comfort to a spirit which would  infinitely have preferred death to dishonour and was above all  shocked at the lack of physical courage  never had i liked our old  admiral so well as when i heard how his chief anger was directed  against the general mismanagement and the cruelty of blighting a  poor lads life when not yet seventeen  his father might have been  warned to remove him without the public scandal of a courtmartial  and dismissal  the guilt and shame would have been all the same to us said my  mother  come mary dont be hard on the poor fellow  in quiet times like  these a poor boy cant look over the wall where one might have  stolen a horse ay or a dozen horses when there was something else  to think about  you would not have forgiven such a thing sir  it never would have happened under me or in any decently commanded  ship he thundered  there wasnt a fault to be found with him in  the calypso  what possessed winslow to let him sail with brydone   but the service is going etc etc he ran onforgetting that it  was he himself who had been unwilling perhaps rightly to press the  duke of clarence for an appointment to a crack frigate for his  namesake  however when he took leave he repeated as he kissed my  mother mind mary dont be set against the lad  thats the way  to make em desperate and he is a mere boy after all  poor mother it was not so much hardness as a wounded spirit that  made her look so rigid  it might have been better if the return  could have been delayed so as to make her yearn after her son but  there was nowhere for him to go and the coach was already on its  way  how strange it was to feel the wonted glow at clarences  return coupled with a frightful sense of disgrace and depression  the time was far on in october and it was thus quite dark when the  travellers arrived having walked from charing cross where the  coach set them down  my father came in first and my mother clung  to him as if he had been absent for weeks while all the joy of  contact with my brother swept over me even though his hand hung  limp in mine and was icy cold like his cheeks  my father turned to  him with one of the little set speeches of those days  here is our  son mary who has promised me to do his utmost to retrieve his  character as far as may be possible and happily he is still  young  my mothers embrace was in a sort of mechanical obedience to her  husbands gesture and her voice was not perhaps meant to be so  severe as it sounded when she said you are very coldcome and  warm yourself  they made room for him by the fire and my father stood up in front  of it giving particulars of the journey  emily and martyn were at  tea in the nursery in a certain awe that hindered them from coming  down indeed martyn seems to have expected to see some strange  transformation in his brother  indeed there was alteration in the  absence of the blue and gold and still more in the loss of the  lightsome hopeful expression from the young face  there is a picture of ary scheffers of an old knight whose son had  fled from the battle cutting the tablecloth in two between himself  and the unhappy youth  like that stern barons countenance was that  with which my mother sat at the head of the dinnertable and we  conversed by jerks about whatever we least cared for as if we could  hide our wretchedness from peter  when the children appeared each  gave clarence the shyest of kisses and they sat demurely on their  chairs on either side of my father to eat their almonds and raisins  after which we went upstairs and there was the usual reading  it  is curious but though none of us could have told at the time what  it was about on turning over not long ago a copy of heads pampas  and andes one chapter struck me with an intolerable sense of  melancholy such as the bull chases of south america did not seem  adequate to produce and by and by i remembered that it was the book  in course of being read at that unhappy period  my mother went on  as diligently as ever with some of those perpetual shirts which  seemed to be always in hand except before company when she used to  do tambour work for emilys frocks  clarence sat the whole time in  a dark corner never stirring except that he now and then nodded a  little  he had gone through many wakeful and worse than wakeful  nights of wretched suspense and now the worst was over  family prayers took place chill goodnights were exchanged and  nobody interfered with his helping me up to my bedroom as usual but  there was something in his face to which i durst not speak though  perhaps i looked for he exclaimed dont ned wrung my hand and  sped away to his own quarters higher up  then came a sound which  made me open my door to listen  dear little emily  she had burst  out of her own room in her dressinggown and flung herself upon her  brother as he was plodding wearily upstairs in the dark clinging  round his neck sobbing dear dear clarry  i cant bear it  i  dont care  youre my own dear brother and they are all wicked  horrid people  that was all i heard except hushings on clarences part as if the  opening of my door and the thread of light from it warned him that  there was risk of interruption  he seemed to be dragging her up to  her own room and i was left with a pang at her being foremost in  comforting him  my father enacted that he should be treated as usual  but how could  that be when papa himself did not know how changed were his own ways  from his kindly paternal air of confidence  all trust had been  undermined so that clarence could not cross the threshold without  being required to state his object and if he overstayed the time  calculated he was crossexamined and his replies received with a  sigh of doubt  he hung about the house not caring to do much except taking me out  in my bath chair or languidly reading the most exciting books he  could getbut there was no great stock of sensation then except  the byronic and from time to time one of my parents would exclaim  clarence i wonder you can find nothing more profitable to occupy  yourself with than trash like that  he would lay down the book without a word and take up smiths  wealth of nations or smolletts englandthe profitable studies  recommended and speedily become lost in a dejected reverie with  fixed eyes and drooping lips    chapter va helping hand    though hawks can prey through storms and winds the poor bee in her hive must dwell  henry vaughan  in imagination the piteous dejection of our family seems to have  lasted for ages but on comparison of dates it is plain that the  first lightening of the burthen came in about a fortnights time  the firm of frith and castleford was coming to the front in the  chinese trade  the junior partner was an old companion of my  fathers boyhood his london abode was near at hand and he was a  kind of semigodfather to both clarence and me having stood proxy  for our nominal sponsors  he was as good and openhearted a man as  ever lived and had always been very kind to us but he was scarcely  welcome when my father finding that he had come up alone to london  to see about some repairs to his house while his family were still  in the country asked him to dine and sleepour first guest since  our misfortune  my mother could hardly endure to receive any one but she seemed  glad to see my father become animated and like himself while roman  catholic emancipation was vehemently discussed and the ruin of  england hotly predicted  clarence moped about silently as usual  and tried to avoid notice and it was not till the next morning after breakfast when the two gentlemen were in the diningroom  nearly ready to go their several ways and i was in the window  awaiting my classical tutorthat mr castleford said  may i ask winslow if you have any plans for that poor boy  edward said my father almost wilfully misunderstanding  his  ambition is to be curator of something in the british museum isnt  it  mr castleford explained that he meant the other and my father  sadly answered that he hardly knew he supposed the only thing was  to send him to a private tutor but where to find a fit one he did  not know and besides what could be his aim  sir john griffith had  said he was only fit for the church but one does not wish to  dispose of a tarnished article there  certainly not said mr castleford and then he spoke words that  rejoiced my heart though they only made my father groan bidding  him remember that it was not so much actual guilt as the accident of  clarences being in the navy that had given so serious a character  to his delinquencies  if he had been at school perhaps no one  would ever have heard of them though i dont say added the good  man casting a new light on the subject that it would have been  better for him in the end  then quite humbly for he knew my  mother especially had a disdain for trade he asked what my father  would think of letting him give clarence work in the office for the  present  i know he said it is not the line your family might  prefer but it is present occupation and i do not think you could  well send a youth who has seen so much of the world back to  schooling  besides this would keep him under your own eye  my father was greatly touched by the kindness but he thought it  right to set before mr castleford the very worst side of poor  clarence declaring that he durst not answer for a boy who had  never in spite of pains and punishments learnt to speak truth at  home or abroad repeating captain brydones dreadful report and  even adding that what was most grievous of all there was an  affectation of piety about him that could scarcely be anything but  selfdeceit and hypocrisy  now he said my eldest son  griffith is just a boy makes no profession is notas i am afraid  you have seenexemplary at church when clarence sits as meek as a  mouse but then he is always aboveboard frank and straightforward   you know where to have a highspirited fellow who will tame down  but you never know what will come next with the other  i sometimes  wonder for what error of mine providence has seen fit to give me  such a son  just then an important message came for mr winslow and he had to  hurry away but mr castleford still remained and presently said  edward i should like to know what your eyes have been trying to  say all this time  oh sir i burst out do give him a chance  indeed he never  means to do wrong  the harm is not in him  he would have been the  best of us all if he had only been let alone  those were exactly my own foolish words for which i could have  beaten myself afterwards but mr castleford only gave a slight  grave smile and said you mean that your brothers real defect is  in courage moral and physical  yes i said with a great effort at expressing myself  when he  is frightened or bullied or browbeaten he does not know what he  is doing or saying  he is quite different when he is his own self  only nobody can understand  strange that though the favoured home son and nearly sixteen years  old it would have been impossible to utter so much to one of our  parents  indeed the last sentence felt so disloyal that the colour  burnt in my cheeks as the door opened but it only admitted  clarence who having heard the front door shut thought the coast  was clear and came in with a load of my books and dictionaries  clarence said mr castleford and the direct address made him  start and flush supposing your father consents should you be  willing to turn your mind to a desk in my countinghouse  he flushed deeper red and his fingers quivered as he held by the  table  thank you sir  anythinganything he said hesitatingly  well said mr castleford with the kindest of voices let us  have it out  what is in your mind  you know im a sort of  godfather to you  sir if you would only let me have a berth on board one of your  vessels and go right away  aye my poor boy thats what you would like best ive no doubt  but look at edwards face there and think what that would come to  at the best  yes i know i have no right to choose said clarence drooping his  head as before  tis not that my dear lad said the good man but that packing  you off like that among your inferiors in breeding and everything  else would put an end to all hope of your redeeming the past outwardly i mean of courseand lodge you in a position of  inequality to your brothers and sister and all  thats done already said clarence  if you were a man grown it might be so returned mr castleford  but bless me how old are you  seventeen next 1st of november said clarence  not a bit too old for a fresh beginning said mr castleford  cheerily  god helping you you will be a brave and good man yet  my boy then as my master rang at the doorcome with me and look  at the old shop  poor clarence muttered something unintelligible and i had to own  for him that he never went out without accounting for himself   whereupon our friend caused my mother to be hunted up and explained  to her that he wanted to take clarence out with himmaking some  excuse about something they were to see together  that walk enabled him to say something which came nearer to cheering  clarence than anything that had passed since that sad return and  made him think that to be connected with mr castleford was the best  thing that could befall him  mr castleford on his side told my  father that he was sure that the boy was goodhearted all the time  and thoroughly repentant but this had the less effect because  plausibility as my father called it was one of the qualities that  specially annoyed him in clarence and made him fear that his friend  might be taken in  however the matter was discussed between the  elders and it was determined that this most friendly offer should  be accepted experimentally  it was impressed on clarence with  unnecessary care that the line of life was inferior but that it  was his only chance of regaining anything like a position and that  everything depended on his industry and integrity  integrity commented clarence with a burning spot on his cheek  after one of these lectures i believe they think me capable of  robbing the office  we found out too that the senior partner mr frith a very crusty  old bachelor did not like the appointment and that it was made  quite against his will  youll be getting your clerks next from  newgate was what some amiable friend reported him to have said   however mr castleford had his way and clarence was to begin his  work with the new year being in the meantime cautioned and lectured  on the crime and danger of his evil propensities more than he could  well bear  oh he groaned it serves me right i know that very  well but if my father only knew how i hate and abhor all those  thingsand how i loathed them at the very time i was dragged into  them  why dont you tell him so i asked  that would make it no better  it is not so bad as if you had gone into it willingly and for your  own pleasure  he would only think that another lie  no more could be said for the idea of clarences untruthfulness and  depravity had become so deeply rooted in our fathers mind that  there was little hope of displacing it and even at the best his  manner was full of grave constrained pity  those few words were  clarences first approach to confidence with me but they led to  more and he knew there was one person who did not believe the  defect was in the bent of his will so much as in its strength  all the time the prospect of the countinghouse in comparison with  the sea was so distasteful to him that i was anxious whenever he  went out alone or even with griffith who despised the notion of  as he said sitting on a high stool dealing in tea so much that he  was quite capable of aiding and abetting in an escape from it  two  considerations however held clarence back one the timidity of  nature which shrank from so violent a step and the other the  strong affections that bound him to his home though his sojourn  there was so painful  he knew the misery his flight would have been  to me indeed i took care to let him see it  and griffiths return was like a fresh spring wind dispersing  vapours  he had gained an excellent scholarship at brazenose and  came home radiant with triumph cheering us all up and making a  generous use of his success  he was no letterwriter and after  learning that the disaster and disgrace were all too certain he  ignored the whole and hailed clarence on his return as if nothing  had happened  as eldest son and almost a university man he could  argue with our parents in a manner we never presumed on  at least i  cannot aver what he actually uttered but probably it was a revised  version of what he thundered forth to me  such nonsense such a  shame to keep the poor beggar going about with that hang dog look  as if he had done for himself for life  why ive known fellows do  ever so much worse of their own accord and nothing come of it  if  it was found out there might be a row and a flogging and there was  an end of it  as to going about mourning and keeping the whole  house in doleful dumps as if there was never to be any good again  it was utter folly and so ive told bill and papa and mamma both  of them  how this was administered or how they took it there is no knowing  but griff would neither skate nor go to the theatre nor to any  other diversion without his brother and used much kindly force and  banter to unearth him from his dismal den in the back drawingroom   he was only let alone when there were engagements with friends and  indeed when meetings in the streets took place by tacit agreement  clarence would shrink off in the crowd as if not belonging to his  companion and these were the moments that stung him into longing to  flee to the river and lose the sense of shame among common sailors   but there was always some good angel to hold him back from desperate  measureschiefly just then the love between us three brothers a  love that never cooled throughout our lives and which dear old  griff made much more apparent at this critical time than in the old  win and slow days of school  that return of his enlivened us all  and removed the terrible constraint from our meals bringing us  back as it were to ordinary life and natural intercourse among  ourselves and with our neighbours    chapter vithe valley of humiliation    but when i lay upon the shore    like some poor wounded thing i deemed i should not evermore    refit my wounded wing nailed to the ground and fastened there this was the thought of my despair  abp trench  clarences debut at the office was not wholly unsuccessful  he  wrote a good hand and had a good deal of method and regularity in  his nature together with a real sense of gratitude to mr  castleford and this bore him through the weariness of his new  employment and what was worse the cold reception he met with from  the other clerks  he was too quiet and reserved for the wilder  spirits too much of a gentleman for others and in the eyes of the  managers and especially of the senior partner a disgraced  untrustworthy youth foisted on the office by mr castlefords weak  partiality  that old mr frith had clarence used to say a  perfectly venomous way of accepting his salute and seemed always  surprised and disappointed if he came in in time or showed up  correct work  indeed the old man was disliked and feared by all  his subordinates as much as his partner was loved and while mr  castleford with his goodnatured irish wife and merry family lived  a life as cheerful as it was beneficent mr frith dwelt entirely  alone in rooms over the office preserving the habits formed when  his income had been narrow and mistrusting everybody  at the end of the first month of experiment mr castleford declared  himself contented with clarences industry and steadiness and  permanent arrangements were made to which clarence submitted with  an odd sort of passive gratitude such as almost angered my father  who little knew how trying the position really was nor how a  certain homesickness for the seafaring life was tugging at the  lads heart and making each mornings entrance at the counting house an efforteach merchantcaptain redolent of the sea an  object of envy  my mother would have sympathised here but clarence  feared her more than my father and she was living in continual  dread of some explosion so that her dark curls began to show  streaks of gray and her face to lose its round youthfulness  lent brought the question of confirmation  under the influence of  good bishop blomfield and in the wave of evangelical revivalthen  at its flood heightconfirmation was becoming a more prominent  subject with religious people than it had probably ever been in our  church and it was recognised that some preparation was desirable  beyond the power of repeating the church catechism  this was all  that had been required of my father at harrow  my mothers  godfather a dignified clergyman had simply said i suppose my  dear you know all about it and as for the admiral he remarked  confirmed  i never was confirmed anything but a postcaptain  our incumbent was more attentive to his duties or rather recognised  more duties than his predecessor  he preached on the subject and  formed classes sixteen being then the limit of agesince the idea  of the vow having become far more prominent than that of the  blessing it was held that full development of the will and  understanding was needful  i was of the requisite age and my father spoke to the clergyman  who called and as i could not attend the classes gave me books to  read and questions to answer  clarence read and discussed the  questions with me showing so much more insight into them and  fuller knowledge of scripture than i possessed that i exclaimed  why should you not go up for confirmation too  no he answered mournfully  i must take no more vows if i cant  keep them  it would just be profane  i had no more to say indeed my parents held the same view  it was  good mr castleford who saw things differently  he was a  clergymans son and had been bred up in the old orthodoxy which  was just beginning to put forth fresh shoots and as a quasi godfather he held himself bound to take an interest in our  religious life while the sponsors whose names stood in the family  bible and whose spoons reposed in the platechest never troubled  themselves on the matter  i remember clarence leaning over me and  saying mr castleford thinks i might be confirmed  he says it is  not so much the promise we make as of coming to almighty god for  strength to keep what we are bound by already  he is going to speak  to papa  perhaps no one except mr castleford could have prevailed over the  fear of profanation in the mind of my father who was in his old fashioned way one of the most reverent of men and could not bear  to think of holy things being approached by one under a stigma nor  of exposing his son to add to his guilt by taking and breaking  further pledges  however he was struck by his friends arguments  and i heard him telling my mother that when he had wished to wait  till there had been time to prove sincerity of repentance by a  course of steadiness the answer had been that it was hard to  require strength while denying the means of grace  my mother was  scarcely convinced but as he had consented she yielded without a  protest and she was really glad that i should have clarence at my  side to help me at the ceremony  the clergyman was applied to and  consented to let clarence attend the classes where his knowledge  comprehension and behaviour were exemplary so that a letter was  written to my father expressive of perfect satisfaction with him   there said my father i knew it would be so  it is not that  which i want  the confirmation seemed at the time a very short and perfunctory  result of our preparation and as things were conducted or  misconducted then involved so much crowding and distress that i  recollect very little but clinging to clarences arm under a strong  sense of my infirmitiesthe painful attempt at kneeling and the  big outstretched lawn sleeves while the blessing was pronounced over  six heads at once and then the struggle back to the pew while the  silverpokered apparitor looked grim at us as though the maimed and  halt had no business to get into the way  yet this was a great  advance upon former confirmations and the bishop met my father  afterwards and inquired most kindly after his lame son  we were disappointed and felt that we could not attain to the  feelings in the confirmation poem in the christian yearmr  castlefords gift to me  still i believe that though encumbered  with such a drag as myself clarence more than i did   felt him how strong our hearts how frail and longed to own him to the death   but the evangelical belief that dejection ought to be followed by a  full sense of pardon and assurance of salvation somewhat perplexed  and dimmed our easter communion  for one short moment as clarence  turned to help my father lift me up from the altarrail i saw his  face and eyes radiant with a wonderful rapt look but it passed only  too fast and the more than ordinary glimpse his spiritual nature  had had made him all the more sad afterwards when he said i would  give everything to know that there was any steadfastness in my  purpose to lead a new life  but you are leading a new life  only because there is no one to bully me he said  still there  had been no reproach against him all the time he had been at frith  and castlefords when suddenly we had a great shock  parties were running very high and there were scurrilous papers  about which my father perfectly abhorred and one day at dinner  when declaiming against something he had seen he laid down strict  commands that none should be brought into the house  then glancing  at clarence something possessed him to say you have not been  buying any  no sir clarence answered but a few minutes later when we were  alone together the others having left him to help me upstairs he  exclaimed edward what is to be done  i didnt buy it but there  is one of those papers in my greatcoat pocket  pollard threw it on  my desk and there was something in it that i thought would amuse  you  oh why didnt you say so  there i am again  i simply could not with his eye on me   miserable being that i am  oh where is the spirit of ghostly  strength  helping you now to take it to papa in the study and explain i  cried but the struggle in that tall fellow was as if he had been  seven years old instead of seventeen ere he put his hand over his  face and gave me his arm to come out into the hall fetch the paper  and make his confession  alas we were too late  the coat had been  moved the paper had fallen out and there stood my mother with it  in her hand looking at clarence with an awful stony face of mute  grief and reproach while he stammered forth what he had said  before and that he was about to give it to my father  she turned  away bitterly contemptuously indignant and incredulous and my  corroborations only served to give both her and my father a certain  dread of clarences influence over me as though i had been either  deceived or induced to back him in deceiving them  the unlucky  incident plunged him back into the depths just as he had begun to  emerge  slight as it was it was no trifle to him in spite of  griffiths exclamation how absurd  is a fellow to be bound to  give an account of everything he looks at as if he were six years  old  catch me letting my mother pry into my pockets  but you are  too meek bill you perfectly invite them to make a row about  nothing    chapter viithe inheritance    for he that needs five thousand pound to live is full as poor as he that needs but five but if thy son can make ten pound his measure then all thou addest may be called his treasure  george herbert  it was in the spring of 1829 that my father received a lawyers  letter announcing the death of james winslow esquire of chantry  house earlscombe and inviting him as heiratlaw to be present  at the funeral and opening of the will  the surprise to us all was  great  even my mother had hardly heard of chantry house itself far  less as a possible inheritance and she had only once seen james  winslow  he was the last of the elder branch of the family a third  cousin and older than my father who had known him in times long  past  when they had last met the squire of chantry house was a  married man with more than one child my father a young barrister  and as one lived entirely in the country and the other in town  without any special congeniality no intercourse had been kept up  and it was a surprise to hear that he had left no surviving  children  my father greatly doubted whether being heiratlaw would  prove to avail him anything since it was likely that so distant a  relation would have made a will in favour of some nearer connection  on his wifes or mothers side  he was very vague about chantry  house only knowing that it was supposed to be a fair property and  he would hardly consent to take griffith with him by the western  royal mail warning him and all the rest of us that our expectations  would be disappointed  nevertheless we looked out the gentlemens seats in patersons road  book and after much research for chantry house lay far off from  the main road we came uponchantry house earlscombe the seat of  james winslow esquire once a religious foundation beautifully  situated on a rising ground commanding an extensive prospect  a religious foundation cried emily  it will be a dear delicious  old abbey all gothic architecture with cloisters and ruins and  ghosts  ghosts said my mother severely what has put such nonsense into  your head  nevertheless emily made up her mind that chantry house would be  another melrose and went about repeating the moonlight scene in the  lay of the last minstrel whenever she thought no one was there to  laugh at her  my father and griffith returned with the good news that there was no  mistake  chantry house was really his own with the estate  belonging to it reckoned at 5000 pounds a year exclusive of a  handsome provision to miss selby the niece of the late mrs  winslow a spinster of a certain age who had lived with her uncle  and now proposed to remove to bath  mr winslow had it appeared  lost his only son as a schoolboy and his daughters like their  mother had been consumptive  he had always been resolved that the  estate should continue in the family but reluctance to see any one  take his sons place had withheld him from making any advances to my  father and for several years past he had been in broken health with  failing faculties  of course there was much elation  griff described as charming the  place perched on the southern slope of a wooded hill with a broad  fertile valley lying spread out before it and the woods behind  affording every promise of sport  the house my father said was  good odd and irregular built at different times but quite  habitable and with plenty of furniture though he opined that mamma  would think it needed modernising to which she replied that our  present chattels would make a great difference whereat my father  looking at the effects of more than twenty years of london blacks  gave a little whistle for she was always the economical one of the  pair  emily with glowing cheeks and eager eyes entreated to know whether  it was gothic and had a cloister  papa nipped her hopes of a  cloister but there were gothic windows and doorway and a bit of  ruin in the garden a fragment of the old chapel  my father could not resign his office without notice and besides  he wished miss selby to have leisure for leaving her home of many  years after which there would be a few needful repairs  the delay  was not a great grievance to any of us except little martyn  we  were much more cockney than almost any one is in these days of  railways  we were unusually devoid of kindred on both sides my  fathers holidays were short i was not a very movable commodity  and economy forbade long journeys so that we had never gone farther  than ramsgate where we claimed a certain lodginghouse as a sort of  right every summer  real country was as much unknown to us as the backwoods  my father  alone had been born and bred to village life and habits for my  mother had spent her youth in a succession of seaport towns  frequented by menofwar  we heard too that chantry house was  very secluded with only a few cottages near at handa mile and a  half from the church and village of earlscombe three from the tiny  country town of wattlesea four from the place where the coach  passed connecting it with the civilisation of bath and bristol  from each of which places it was about half a days distance  according to the measures of those times  it was a sort of  banishment to people accustomed to the stream of life in london and  though the consequence and importance derived from being raised to  the ranks of the squirearchy were agreeable they were a dear  purchase at the cost of being out of reach of all our friends and  acquaintances as well as of other advantages  to my father however the retirement from his many years of  drudgery was really welcome and he had preserved enough of country  tastes to rejoice that it was as he said a clear duty to reside on  his estate and look after his property  my mother saw his relief in  the prospect and suppressed her sighs at the dislocation of her  lifelong habits and the loss of intercourse with the acquaintance  whom separation raised to the rank of intimate friends even her  misgivings as to butchers bakers and grocers in the wilderness  and still worse as to doctors for me  humph said the admiral the boy will be all the better without  them  and so i was i cant say they were the subject of much regret but  i was really sorry to leave our big neighbour the british museum  where there were good friends who always made me welcome and  encouraged me in studies of coins and heraldry which were great  resources to me so that i used to spend hours there and was by no  means willing to resign my ambition of obtaining an appointment  there when i heard my father say that he was especially thankful  for his good fortune because it enabled him to provide for me   there were lessons too from masters in languages music and  drawing which emily and i shared and which she had just begun to  value thoroughly  we had filled whole drawingbooks with wriggling  twists of foliage in b b b marking pencil and had just been  promoted to watercolours and she was beginning to sing very  prettily  i feared too that i should no longer have a chance of  rivalling griffiths university studies  all this with my sisters  girl friends and those kind people who used to drop in to play  chess and otherwise amuse me would all be left behind and sorest  of all clarence who whatever he was in the eyes of others had  grown to be my mainstay during this last year  he it was who  fetched me from the museum took me into the gardens helped me up  and down stairs spared no pains to rout out whatever my fanciful  pursuits required from shops in the city and in very truth spoilt  me through all his hours that were free from business besides being  my most perfect sympathising and understanding companion  i feared too that he would be terribly lonesome though of late he  had been less haunted by longings for the sea had made some way  with his fellows and had been commended by the managing clerk and  it was painful to find the elders did not grieve on their own  account at parting with him  my mother told the admiral that she  thought it would be good for mr winslows spirits not to be  continually reminded of his trouble and my father might be heard  confiding to mr castleford that the separation might be good for  both her and her son if only the lad could be trusted  to which  that good man replied by giving him an excellent character but was  only met by a sigh and well we shall see  clarence was to be lodged with peter whose devotion would not  extend to following us into barbarism where as he told us he  understood there was no such thing as a harea and master would  have to kill his own mutton  peter had been tranquilly engaged to gooch for years untold  they  were to be transformed into mr and mrs robson with some small  appointment about the law courts for him and a lodginghouse for  her where clarence was to abide my mother feeling secure that  neither his health his morals nor his shirts could go much astray  without her receiving warning thereof  meanwhile by the help of an antiquarian friend of my father mr  stafford who was great in county history i hunted up in the museum  library all i could discover about our new possession  the chantry of st cecily at earlscombe in somersetshire had it  appeared been founded and endowed by dame isabel doyley in the  year of grace 1434 that constant prayers might be offered for the  souls of her husband and son slain in the french wars  the poor  ladys intentions which to our protestant minds appeared rather  shocking than otherwise had been frustrated at the break up of such  establishments when the chantry and the estate that maintained its  clerks and bedesmen was granted to sir harry power from whom  through two heiresses it had come to the fordyces the last of  whom by name margaret had died childless leaving the estate to  her stepson philip winslow our ancestor  moreover we learnt that a portion of the building was of ancient  date and that there was an interesting fragment of the old chapel  in the grounds which our good friend promised himself the pleasure  of investigating on his first holiday  to add to our newlyacquired sense of consideration and of high  pedigree the family chariot after taking miss selby to bath came  up post to london to be touched up at the coachbuilders have the  escutcheon altered so as to impale the griffith coat instead of the  selby and finally to convey us to our new abode in preparation for  which all its boxes came to be packed  a chariot  you young ones have as little notion of one as of a  british warchariot armed with scythes  yet people of a certain  grade were as sure to keep their chariot as their silver teapot  indeed we knew one young couple who started in life with no other  habitation but spent their time as nomads in visits to their  relations and friends for visits were visits then  the capacities of a chariot were considerable  within there was a  goodsized seat for the principal occupants and outside a dickey  behind and a driving box before though sometimes there was only  one of these and that transferable  the boxes were calculated to  hold family luggage on a six months tour  there they lay on the  spareroom floor ready to be packed the first earnest of our new  possessionsexcept perhaps the fivepound note my father gave each  of us four elder ones on the day the balance at the bank was made  over to him  there was the imperial a grand roomy receptacle  which was placed on the top of the carriage and would not always go  upstairs in small houses the capbox which fitted into a curved  place in front of the windows and could not stand alone but had a  frame to support it two long narrow boxes with the like infirmity  of standing which fitted in below square ones under each seat and  a drop box fastened on behind  there were pockets beneath each  window and curious relic in name and nature of the time when every  gentleman carried his weapon there was the sword case an  excrescence behind the back of the best seat accessible by lifting  a cushion where weapons used to be carried but where in our  peaceful times travellers bestowed their luncheon and their books  our chariot was black above canary yellow below beautifully  varnished and with our arms blazoned on each door  it was lined  with dark blue leather and cloth picked out with blue and yellow  lace in accordance with our liveries and was a gorgeous spectacle   i am afraid emily did not share in mistress gilpins humility when         the chaise was brought    but yet was not allowed to drive up to the door lest all    should say that she was proud   it was then that emily and i each started a diary to record the  events of our new life  hers flourished by fits and starts but i  having perforce more leisure than she mine has gone on with few  interruptions till the present time and is the backbone of this  narrative which i compile and condense from it and other sources  before destroying it    chapter viiithe old house    your history whither are you spinning    can you do nothing but describe a house there is and thats enough  gray  how we did enjoy our journey when the wrench from our old home was  once made  we did not even leave clarence behind for mr  castleford had given him a holiday so that he might not appear to  be kept at a distance as if under a cloud and might help me  through our travels  my mother and i occupied the inside of the carriage with emily  between us at the outset but when we were off the london stones she  was often allowed to make a third on the dickey with clarence and  martyn whose ecstatic heels could be endured for the sake of the  free air and the view  of course we posted and where there were  severe hills we indulged in four horses  the varieties of the  jackets of our postboys blue or yellow as supposed to indicate  the politics of their inns were interesting to us as everything  was interesting then  otherwise their equipment was exactly alike neat drab corduroy breeches and topboots and hats usually white  and they were all boys though the red faces and grizzled hair of  some looked as if they had faced the weather for at least fifty  years  it was a beautiful august and the harvest fields were a sight  perfectly new filling us with rapture unspeakable  at every hill  which offered an excuse our outsiders were on their feet thrusting  in their heads and hands to us within with exclamations of delight  and all sorts of discoveriesreally new to us three younger ones   ears of corn bearded barley graceful oats poppies cornflowers  were all delicious novelties to emily and me though griff and my  father laughed at our ecstasies and my mother occasionally objected  to the wonderful accumulation of curiosities thrust into her lap or  the door pockets and tried to persuade martyn that rooks wings  dead hedgehogs sticks and stones of various merits might be found  at earlscombe until clarence by the judicious purchase of a basket  at salisbury contrived to satisfy all parties and safely dispose of  the treasures  the objects that stand out in my memory on that  journey were salisbury spire and a long hill where the hedgebank  was one mass of the exquisite rosebay willow herba perfect  revelation to our citybred eyes but indeed the whole route was  like one panorama to us of lallegro and other descriptions on which  we had fed  for in those days we were much more devoted to poetry  than is the present generation which has a good deal of false shame  on that head  even dining and sleeping at an inn formed a pleasing novelty though  we did not exactly sympathise with martyn when he dashed in at  breakfast exulting in having witnessed the killing of a pig  as my  father observed it was too like realising peters forebodings of  our return to savage life  demonstrations were not the fashion of these times and there was a  good deal of dull discontent and disaffection in the air so that no  tokens of welcome were prepared for usnot even a peal of bells  nor indeed should we have heard them if they had been rung for the  church was a mile and a half beyond the house with a wood between  cutting off the sound except in certain winds  we did not miss a  reception which would rather have embarrassed us  we began to  think it was time to arrive and my father believed we were climbing  the last hill when just as we had passed a remarkably pretty  village and church griffith called out to say that we were on our  own ground  he had made his researches with the game keeper while  my father was busy with the solicitor and could point to our  boundary wall a little below the top of the hill on the northern  side  he informed us that the place we had passed was hillside fordyce propertybut this was earlscombe our own  it was a great  stony bit of pasture with a few scattered trees but after the flat  summit was past the southern side was all beechwood where a gate  admitted us into a drive cut out in a slant down the otherwise steep  descent and coming out into an open space  and there we were  the old house was placed on the widest part of a kind of shelf or  natural terrace of a sort of amphitheatre shape with wood on  either hand but leaving an interval clear in the midst broad enough  for house and gardens with a gentle green slope behind and a much  steeper one in front closed in by the beechwoods  the house stood  as it were sideways or had been made to do so by later inhabitants   i know this is very longwinded but there have been such  alterations that without minute description this narrative will be  unintelligible  the aspect was northwards so far as the lie of the ground was  concerned but the house stood across  the main body was of the big  symmetrical louis xiv styleor as it is now the fashion to call  it queen annebrick with stone quoins big sashwindows and a  great square hall in the midst with the chief rooms opening into  it  the principal entrance had been on the north with a huge front  door and a flight of stone steps and just space enough for a gravel  coach ring before the rapid grassy descent  later constitutions  however must have eschewed that northern front door and later  nerves that narrow verge and on the eastern front had been added  that gothic porch of which emily had heardand a flagrantly modern  gothic porch it was flanked by two comical little turrets with  loopholes from which a threadpaper or tom thumb might have  defended it  otherwise it resembled a church porch except for the  formidable points of a sham portcullis but there was no denying  that it greatly increased the comfort of the house with its two  sets of heavy doors and the seats on either side  the great hall  door had been closed up plastered over within and rendered  inoffensive  towards the west there was another modern addition of  drawing and dining rooms and handsome bedchambers above in gothic  taste ie with pointed arches filled up with glass over the sash windows  the drawingroom was very pretty with a glass door at the  end leading into an oldfashioned greenhouse and two french windows  to the south opening upon the lawn which soon began to slope  upwards curving as i said like an amphitheatre and was always  shady and sheltered tilting its flowerbeds towards the house as if  to display them  the diningroom had in like manner one west and  two north windows the latter commanding a grand view over the green  meadowland below dotted with round knolls and rising into blue  hills beyond  we became proud of counting the villages and church  towers we could see from thence  there was a still older portion more ancient than the square corps  de logis and built of the creamcoloured stone of the country  it  was at the southeastern angle where the ground began sloping so  near the house that this wingif it may so be calledcontaining  two goodsized rooms nearly on a level with the upper floor had  nothing below but some open stone vaultings under which it was only  just possible for my tall brothers to stand upright at the  innermost end  these opened into the cellars which no doubt  belonged to the fifteenthcentury structure  there seemed to have  once been a door and two or three steps to the ground which rose  very close to the southern end but this had been walled up  the  rooms had deep mullioned windows east and west and very handsome  groined ceilings and were entered by two steps down from the  gallery round the upper part of the hall  there was a very handsome  double staircase of polished oak shaped like a y the stem of which  began just opposite the original front doormaking us wonder if  people knew what draughts were in the days of queen anne and  remember madame de maintenons complaint that health was sacrificed  to symmetry  not far from this oldest portion were some broken bits  of wall and stumps of columns remnants of the chapel and prettily  wreathed with ivy and clematis  we rejoiced in such a pretty and  distinctive ornament to our garden and never troubled ourselves  about the desecration and certainly ours was one of the most  delightful gardens that ever existed what with green turf bright  flowers shapely shrubs and the grand beechtrees enclosing it with  their stately white pillars green foliage and the russet arcades  beneath them  the stillness was wonderful to ears accustomed to the  london roaralmost a new sensation  emily was found as she said  listening to the silence and my father declared that no one could  guess at the sense of rest that it gave him  of space within there was plenty though so much had been sacrificed  to the hall and staircase and this was apparently the cause of the  modern additions as the original sittingrooms wainscotted and  doubledoored were rather small for family requirements  one of  these once the diningroom became my fathers study where he read  and wrote saw his tenants and by and by acted as justice of the  peace  the opposite one towards the garden was termed the book room  here martyn was to do his lessons and emily and i carry on  our studies and do what she called keeping up her accomplishments   my couch and appurtenances abode there and it was to be my retreat  from companyor on occasion could be made a supplementary drawing room as its fittings showed it had been the parlour  it  communicated with another chamber which became my ownsparing the  difficulties that stairs always presented and beyond lay niched  under the grand staircase a tiny light closet a passageroom  where my mother put a bed for a manservant not liking to leave me  entirely alone on the ground floor  it led to a passage to the  garden door also to my mothers den dedicated to housewifely cares  and stores and ended at the back stairs descending to the  servants region  this was very old handsomely vaulted with stone  and owing to the fall of the ground had ample space for light on  the north sidewhere beyond the drive the descent was so rapid  as to afford martyn infinite delight in rolling down to the horror  of all beholders and the detriment of his white duck trowsers  i dont know much about the upper story so i spare you that  emily  had a hankering for one of the pretty old mullionedwindowed rooms the mullion chambers as she named them but griff pounced on them  at once the inner for his repose the outer for his guns and his  studiesnot smoking for young men were never permitted to smoke  within doors nor indeed in any home society  the choice of the son  and heir was undisputed and he proceeded to settle his possessions  in his new domains where they made an imposing appearance    chapter ixrats    as louder and louder drawing near the gnawing of their teeth he could hear  southey  what a ridiculous old fellow that chapman is said griff coming  in from a conference with the gaunt old man who acted as keeper to  our not very extensive preserves  i told him to get some gins for  the rats in my rooms and he shook his absurd head like any  mandarin and said there baint no trap as will rid you of them  kind of varmint sir  of course my father said rats are part of the entail of an old  house  you may reckon on them  those rooms of yours are the very place for them added my mother   i only hope they will not infest the rest of the house  to which griff rejoined that they perpetrated the most extraordinary  noises he had ever heard from rats and told emily she might be  thankful to him for taking those rooms for she would have been  frightened out of her little wits  he meant he said to get a  little terrier and have a thorough good rat hunt at which martyn  capered about in irrepressible ecstasy  this however was deferred by the unwillingness of old chapman of  whom even griff was somewhat in awe  his fame as a sportsman had to  be made and he had had only such practice as could be attained by  shooting at a mark ever since he had been aware of his coming  greatness  so he was desirous of conciliating chapman and not  getting laughed at as the london young gentleman who could not hit a  haystack  my father who had been used to carrying a gun in his  younger days was much amused in his quiet way at seeing griff  watch chapman off on his rounds and then betake himself to the  locality most remote from the keepers ears to practise on the rook  or crow  martyn always ran after him having solemnly promised not  to touch the gun and to keep behind  he was too goodnatured to  send the little fellow back though he often tried to elude the  pursuit not wishing for a witness to his attempts and he never  invited clarence who had had some experience of curious game but  never mentioned it  clarence devoted himself to emily and me tugging my gardenchair  along all the paths where it would go without too much jolting and  when i had had enough exploring those hanging woods either with  her or on his own account  they used to come home with their hands  full of flowers and this resulted in a vehement attack of botany a taste that has lasted all our lives together with the hortus  siccus to which we still make additions though there has been a  revolution there as well as everywhere else and the linnaean system  we learnt so eagerly from martins letters is altogether exploded  and antiquated  still my sister refuses to own the scientific  merits of the natural system and can point to schoolbred and  lectured young ladies who have no notion how to discover the name or  nature of a live plant  on the friday after our arrival the noises had been so fearful that  griff had been exasperated into going off across the hills  accompanied by his constant shadow martyn in search of the  professional ratcatcher of the neighbourhood in spite of chapmans  warningthat tom petty was the biggest rascal in the neighbourhood  and a regular out and out poacher and as to the noiseshe couldnt  tackle the like of they  after revelling in the beauty of the  beechwoods as long as was good for me or for clarence i was left in  the garden to sketch the ruin while my two companions started on  one of their exploring expeditions  it was getting late enough to think of going to prepare for the six  oclock dinner when emily came forth alone from the path between the  trees announcingan adventure edward  we have had such an  adventure  wheres clarence  gone for the doctor  oh no griff hasnt shot anybody  he is  gone for the ratcatcher you know  it is a poor little herdboy who  tumbled out of a tree and oh such a sweet beautiful young lady just like a book  when emily became less incoherent it appeared that on coming out on  the bit of common above the wood as she and clarence were halting  on the brow of the hill to admire the view they heard a call for  help and hurrying down in the direction whence it proceeded they  saw a stunted ashtree beneath which were a young lady and a little  child bending over a village lad who lay beneath moaning piteously   the girl whom emily described as the most beautiful creature she  ever saw explained that the boy who had been herding the cattle  scattered around had been climbing the tree a limb of which had  broken with him  she had seen the fall from a distance and hurried  up but she hardly knew what to do for her little sister was too  young to be sent in quest of assistance  clarence thought one leg  seriously injured and as the young lady seemed to know the boy  offered to carry him home  school officers were yet in the future  children were set to work almost as soon as they could walk and  this little fellow was so light and thin as to shock clarence when  he had been taken up on his back for he weighed quite a trifle   the young lady showed the way to a wretched little cottage where a  bigger girl had just come in with a sheaf of corn freshly gleaned  poised on her head  they sent her to fetch her mother and clarence  undertook to go for a doctor but to the surprise and horror of  emily there was a demur  something was said of old molly and her  ile and yarbs or perhaps madam could step round  when  clarence on this being translated to him pronounced the case  beyond such treatment it was explained outside the door that this  was a terribly poor family and the doctor would not come to parish  patients for an indefinite time after his summons besides which he  lived at wattlesea  indeed mamma does almost all the doctoring  with her medicine chest said the girl  on which clarence declared that he would let the doctor know that he  himself would be responsible for the cost of the attendance and set  off for wattlesea a kind of town village in the flat below  he  could not get back till dinner was half over and came in alarmed  and apologetic but he had nothing worse to encounter than griffs  unmerciful banter or as you would call it chaff about his knight  errantry and emilys lovely heroine in the sweetest of cottage  bonnets  griff could be slightly tyrannous in his merry mockery and when he  found that on the ensuing day clarence proposed to go and inquire  after the patient he made such wicked fun of the expectations the  pair entertained of hearing the sweet cottage bonnet reading a tract  in a silvery voice through the hovel window that he fairly teased  and shamed clarence out of starting till the renowned tom petty  arrived and absorbed all the three brothers and even their father  in delights as mysterious to me as to emily  how she shrieked when  martyn rushed triumphantly into the room where we were arranging  books with the huge patriarch of all the rats dangling by his tail   three hopeful families were destroyed rooms vaults and cellars  examined and cleared and petty declared the race to be  exterminated picturesque ruffian that he was in his shapeless hat  rusty velveteen long leggings a live ferret in his pocket and  festoons of dead rats over his shoulder  chapman who regarded him much as the ferret did the rat declared  that the rabbits and hares would suffer from letting that there  chap show his face here on any plea and moreover gave a grunt  very like a scoff at the idea of slumbers in the mullion rooms as  they were called being secured by his good offices  and chapman was right  the unaccountable noises broke out again screaming wailing sobbingsounds scarcely within the power of cat  or rat but possibly the effect of the wind in the old building  at  any rate griff could not stand them and declared that sleep was  impossible when the wind was in that quarter so that he must shift  his bedroom elsewhere though he still wished to retain the outer  apartment which he had taken pleasure in adorning with his special  possessions  my mother would scarcely have tolerated such fancies  in any one else but griff had his privileges    chapter xour tuneful choir    the church has been whitewashed but right long ago as the cracks and the dinginess amply doth show about the same time that a strange petrifaction confined the incumbent to mere sunday action so many abuses in this place are rife the only church things giving token of life are the singing within and the nettles without  both equally rampant without any doubt  f r havergal  all griffs teasing could not diminishnay rather increased emilys excitement in the hope of seeing and identifying the sweet  cottage bonnet at church on sunday  the distance we had to go was  nearly two miles and my mother and i drove thither in a donkey  chair which had been hunted up in london for that purpose because  the pheeaton as the servants insisted on calling it was too high  for me  my father had an oldfashioned feeling about the fourth  commandment which made him scrupulous as to using any animal on  sunday and even when in bad weather or for visitors the larger  carriage was used he always walked  he was really angry with griff  that morning for mischievously maintaining that it was a greater  breach of the commandment to work an ass than a horse  it was a pretty drive on a road slanting gradually through the  brushwood that clothed the steep face of the hillside and passing  farms and meadows full of cattleall things quieter and stiller  than ever in their sunday repose  we knew that the living was in  winslow patronage but that it was in the hands of one of the selby  connection who held it together with it is not safe to say how  many benefices and found it necessary for his health to reside at  bath  the vicarage had long since been turned into a farmhouse and  the curate lived at wattlesea  all this we knew but we had not  realised that he was likewise assistant curate there and only  favoured earlscombe with alternate morning and evening services on  sundays  still less were we prepared for the interior of the church  it had  a picturesque square tower covered with ivy and a general air of  fitness for a sketch indeed the photograph of it in its present  beautified state will not stand a comparison with our drawings of  it in those days of dilapidation in the middle of the untidy  churchyard with little boys astride on the sloping sunken lichen grown headstones mullein spikes and burdock leaves more graceful  than the trim borders and zinc crosses which are pleasanter to the  mental eye  the london church we had left would be a fearful shock to the  present generation but we were accustomed to decency order and  reverence and it was no wonder that my father was walking about the  churchyard muttering that he never saw such a place while my  brothers were full of amusement  their spruce looks in their tall  hats bright ties dark coats and white trowsers strapped tight  under their boots looked incongruous with the rest of the  congregation the most distinguished members of which were farmers  in drab coats with huge motherofpearl buttons and long gaiters  buttoned up to their knees and strapped up to their gay waistcoats  over their white corduroys  their wives and daughters were in  enormous bonnets fluttering with ribbons but then what my mother  and emily wore were no trifles  the rest of the congregation were the male part of itin white or gray smockfrocks the elderly  women in black bonnets the younger in straw but we had not long to  make our observations for chapman took possession of us  he was  parish clerk and was in great glory in his mourning coat and hat  and his object was to marshal us all into our pew before he had to  attend upon the clergyman and of course i was glad enough to get as  soon as possible out of sight of all the eyes not yet accustomed to  my figure  and hidden enough i was when we had been introduced through the  little north chancel door into a blackcurtained blackcushioned  blacklined pew well carpeted with a table in the midst and a  stove whose pipe made its exit through the floriated tracery of the  window overhead  the chancel arch was to the west of us blocked up  by a wooden parcelgilt erection and to the east a decorated window  that would have been very handsome if two sidelights had not been  obscured by the two tables of the law with the royal arms on the  top of the first table and over the other our own with the fordyce  in a scutcheon of pretence for as an inscription recorded they  had been erected by margaret daughter of christopher fordyce  esquire of chantry house and relict of sir james john winslow  kt sergeantatlaw ad 1700the last date i verily believe at  which anything had been done to the church  and on the wall  stopping up the southern chancel window was a huge marble slab  supported by angels blowing trumpets with a very long inscription  about the fordyce family ending with this same margaret who had  married the winslow lost two or three infants and died on 1st  january 1708 three years later than her husband  thus far i could see but griff was standing lifting the curtain  and showing by the working of his shoulders his amazement and  diversion so that only the daggers in my mothers eyes kept martyn  from springing up after him  what he beheld was an altar draped in  black like a coffin and on the step up to the rail boys and girls  eating apples and performing antics to beguile the waiting time  while a row of whitesmocked old men occupied the bench opposite to  our seat conversing loud enough for us to hear them  my father and clarence came in the bells stopped there was a sound  of steps and in the fabric in front of us there emerged a grizzled  head and the back of a very dirty surplice besprinkled with iron  moulds while chapmans back appeared above our curtain his desk  full of dilapidated prayerbooks being wedged in between us and  the readingdesk  the duet that then took place between him and the curate must have  been heard to be credible especially as being so close behind the  old man we could not fail to be aware of all the remarkable shots  at long words which he bawled out at the top of his voice and i  refrain from recording lest they should haunt others as they have  done by me all my life  now and then chapman caught up a long  switch and dashed out at some obstreperous child to give an audible  whack and towards the close of the litany he stumped outwe heard  his tramp the whole length of the church and by and by his voice  issued from an unknown height proclaiminglet us sing to the  praise and glory in an anthem taken from the 42d chapter of  genesis  there was an outburst of bassoon clarionet and fiddle and the  performance that followed was the most marvellous we had ever heard  especially when the big butcherfiddling all the timedeclared in  a mighty solo i am jojojojoseph and having reiterated this  information four or five times inquired with equal pertinacity  dothdoth my faauther yet live  poor emily was fairly  convulsed she stuffed her handkerchief into her mouth and grew  so crimson that my mother was quite frightened and very near  putting her out at the little door of excommunication  to our last  hour we shall never forget the shock of that first anthem  the commandments were read from the desk chapmans solitary  response coming from the gallery and while the second singingfour  verses from tate and bradywas going on we beheld the surplice  stripped offlike the slough of a mayfly as griff saidwhen a  rusty black gown was revealed in which the curate ascended the  pulpit and was lost to our view before the concluding verse of the  psalm which we had reason to believe was selected in compliment to  us as well as to earlscombe    my lot is falln in that blest land    where god is truly know he fills my cup with liberal hand    tis hetis hetis hesupports my throne   we had great reason to doubt how far the second line could justly be  applied to the parish but there was no judging of the sermon for  only detached sentences reached us in a sort of mumble  griff  afterwards declared churchgoing to be as good as a comedy and we  all had to learn to avoid meeting each others eyes whatever we  might hear  when the scuffle and tramp of the departing  congregation had ceased we came forth from our sable box and  beheld the remnants of a once handsome church mauled in every  possible way green stains on the walls windows bricked up and a  huge singing gallery  good bits of carved stall work were nailed  anyhow into the pews the floor was uneven no font was visible  there was a mouldy uncaredfor look about everything  the curate in  ridingboots came out of the vestrya pale wearylooking man  painfully meek and civil with gray hair sleeked round his face  he  louted low and seemed hardly to venture on taking the hand my  father held out to him  there was some attempt to enter into  conversation with him but he begged to be excused for he had to  hurry back to wattlesea to a funeral  poor man he was as great a  pluralist as his vicar for he kept a boys school partially day  partially boarding and his eyes looked hungrily at martyn  if the sweet cottage bonnet had been at church there would have  been little chance of discovering her but we found that we were the  only quality as chapman called it or things might not have been  so bad  old james winslow had been a mere foxhunting squire till  he became a valetudinarian nor had he ever cared for the church or  for the poor so that the village was in a frightful state of  neglect  there was a dissenting chapel old enough to be overgrown  with ivy and not too hideous erected by the nonconformists in the  reign of the great deliverer but this partook of the general  decadence of the parish and as we found the chapels principal  use was to serve as an excuse for not going to church  my father always went to church twice so he and clarence walked to  wattlesea where appearances were more respectable but they heard  the same sermon over again and as my father drily remarked it was  not a composition that would bear repetition  he was much distressed at the state of things and intended to write  to the incumbent though as he said whatever was done would end by  being at his own expense and the move and other calls left him so  little in hand that he sighed over the difficulties and declared  that he was better off in london except for the honour of the  thing  perhaps my mother was of the same opinion after a dreary  afternoon when griff and martyn had been wandering about aimlessly  and were at length betrayed by the barking of a little terrier  purchased the day before from tom petty besieging the stable cat  who stood with swollen tail glaring eyes and thunderous growls on  the top of the tallest pillar of the ruins  emily nearly cried at  their cruelty  martyn was called off by my mother and set down  half sulky half ashamed to henry and his bearer and griff vowing  that he believed it was that brute who made the row at night and  that she ought to be exterminated strolled off to converse with  chapman who was a quaint compound of clerk and keeperin the one  capacity upholding his late master in the other bemoaning mr  mears unpunctualities specially as regarded weddings and funerals  one corp having been kept waiting till a messenger had been sent  to wattlesea who finding both clergy out for the day had had to go  to hillside where they was always ready though the old squire  would have been mad with him if hed aguessed one of they fordys  had ever set foot in the parish  the only school in the place was close to the meetinghouse a very  dames school indeed as emily described it after a peep on monday   dame dearlove the old woman who presided was a picture of  shenstones schoolmistressblack bonnet horn spectacles fearful  birch rod threecornered buff kerchief checked apron and all but  on meddling with her she proved a very dragon the antipodes of her  name  tattered copies of the universal spellingbook served her  aristocracy ragged testaments the general herd whence all appeared  to be shouting aloud at once  she looked sour as verjuice when my  mother and emily entered and gave them to understand that she  wasnt used to no strangers in her school and didnt want em  we  found that in chapmans opinion she didnt larn em nothing  she  had succeeded her aunt who had taught him to read right off but  her baint to be compared with she  and now the farmers children  and the little aristocracy including his own grandchildrenall  indeed who in his phrase cared for eddicationwent to  wattlesea    chapter xithey fordys    of honourable reckoning are you both and pity tis you lived at odds so long  shakespeare  my father had a good deal of business in hand and was glad of  clarences help in writing and accountsa great pleasure though  it prevented his being griffs companion in his exploring and essays  at shooting  he had time however to make an expedition with me in  the donkey chair to inquire after the herdboy amos bell and carry  him some kitchen physic  to our horror we found him quite alone in  the wretched cottage while everybody was out harvesting but he did  not seem to pity himself or think it otherwise than quite natural  as he lay on a little bed in the corner disabled by what clarence  thought a dislocation  miss ellen had brought him a pudding and  little miss anne a picturebook  he was not so dense and shy as the children of the hamlet near us  and emily extracted from him that miss ellen was our passons young  lady  mr mears she exclaimed  no  ourn be passon fordy  it turned out that this place was not in earlscombe at all but in  hillside a different parish and the boy amos further  communicated that there was old passon fordy and passon frank and  madam what was mr franks lady  yes he could read he could he  went to sunday school and was in miss ellens class he had been to  school worky days only father was dead and farmer hartop gave him  a job  it was plain that hillside was under a very different rule from  earlscombe and emily was delighted to have discovered that the  sweet cottage bonnets owner was called ellen which just then was  the pet christian name of romance in honour of the lady of the  lake  in the midst of her raptures however just as we were about to turn  in at our own gate into the wood we heard horses hoofs and then  came careering by on ponies a very pretty girl and a youth of  about the same age  clarences hand rose to his hat and he made  his eager bow but the young lady did not vouchsafe the slightest  acknowledgment turned her head away and urged her pony to speed  emily broke out with an angry disappointed exclamation  clarences  face was scarlet and he said low and hoarsely thats lester  he  was in the argus at portsmouth two years agoand then as our  little sister continued her indignant exclamations he added hush   dont on any account say a word about it  i had better get back to  my work  i am only doing you harm by staying here  at which emily shed tears and together we persuaded him not to  curtail his holiday which indeed he could not have done without  assigning the reason to the elders and this was out of the  question  nor did he venture to hang back when as our service was  to be on sunday afternoon my father proposed to walk to hillside  church in the morning  they came back well pleased  there was care  and decency throughout  the psalms were sung to a grinder organ which was an advanced state of things in those daysand very  nicely  parson frank read well and impressively and the old  parson a fine venerable man had preached an excellent sermon really admirable as my father repeated  our party had been  scarcely in time and had been disposed of in seats close to the  door where clarence was quite out of sight of the disdainful young  lady and her squire of whom emily begged to hear no more  she looked askance at the cards left on the hall table the next day the rev christopher fordyce and the rev f c fordyce also  mrs f c fordyce hillside rectory  we had found out that hillside was a family living and that there  was much activity there on the part of the father and sonrector  and curate and that the other clerical folk ladies especially who  called on us spoke of mrs f c fordyce with a certain tone as if  they were afraid of her as sir horace lesters sistervery  superior very active very strict in her notionsas if these were  so many defects  they were an offshoot of the old fordyces of  chantry house but so far back that all recollection of kindred or  connection must have worn out  their propertyall in beautiful  ordermarched with ours and chapman was very particular about the  boundaries  old master he wouldnt have a bird picked up if it  fell over on they fordys groundnot he  he couldnt abide  passons couldnt the old squirenot miss hannah more and all they  cheddar lot and they fordys least of all  my sons wife she was  for sending her little maid to hillside to madam fordys school  but bless your heart twould have been as much as my place was  worth if master had known it  the visit was not returned till after clarence had gone back to his  london work  sore as was the loss of him from my daily life i  could see that the new world and fresh acquaintances were a trial to  him and especially since the encounter with young lester had driven  him back into his shell so that he would be better where he was  already known and had nothing new to overcome  emily though not  yet sixteen was emancipated from schoolroom habits and the dear  girl was my devoted slave to an extent that perhaps i abused  not being come out she was left at home on the day when we set  out on a regular progress in the chariot with posthorses  the  britshka and pair which were our ambition were to wait till my  fathers next rents came in  morning calls in the country were a  solemn and imposing ceremony and the head of the family had to be  taken on the first circuit nor was there much scruple as to making  them in the forenoon so several were to be disposed of before  fulfilling an engagement to luncheon at the farthest point where  some old london friends had borrowed a house for the summer and had  included me in their invitation  here alone did i leave the carriage but i had coopers spy and my  sketchbook as companions while waiting at doors where the  inhabitants were at home  the last visit was at hillside rectory a  house of architecture somewhat similar to our own but of the soft  creamy stone which so well set off the vine with purple clusters  the myrtles and fuchsias that covered it  i was wishing we had  drawn up far enough off for a sketch to be possible when from a  window close above i heard the following words in a clear girlish  voice   no indeed  im not going down  it is only those horrid  earlscombe people  i cant think how they have the face to come  near us  there was a reply perhaps that the parents had made the first  visit for the rejoinder wasyes grandpapa said it was a  christian duty to make an advance but they need not have come so  soon  indeed i wonder they show themselves at all  i am sure i  would not if i had such a dreadful son  presently i hate to  think of it  that i should have thanked him  depend upon it he  will never pay the doctor  a coward like that is capable of  anything  the proverb had been realised but there could hardly have been a  more involuntary or helpless listener  presently my parents came  back escorted by both the gentlemen of the house tall finelooking  men the elder with snowy hair and the dignity of men of the old  school the younger with a joyous hearty outofdoor countenance  more like a squire than a clergyman  the visit seemed to have been gratifying  mrs fordyce was declared  to be of higher stamp than most of the neighbouring ladies and my  father was much pleased with the two clergymen while as we drove  along he kept on admiring the wellordered fields and fences and  contrasting the pretty cottages and trim gardens with the dreary  appearance of our own village  i asked why amos bells home had  been neglected and was answered with some annoyance as i pointed  down the lane that it was on our land though in hillside parish   i am glad to have such neighbours observed my mother and i kept  to myself the remarks i had heard though i was still tingling with  the sting of them  we heard no more of they fordys for some time  the married pair  went away to stay with friends and we only once met the old  gentleman when i was waiting in the street at wattlesea in the  donkey chair while my mother was trying to match netting silk in  the odd little shop that united fancy work toys and tracts with  the post office  old mr fordyce met us as we drew up handed her  out with a grand seigneurs courtesy and stood talking to me so  delightfully that i quite forgot it was from christian duty  my father corresponded with the old rector about the state of the  parish and at last went over to bath for a personal conference but  without much satisfaction  the earlscombe people were pronounced to  be an ungrateful goodfornothing set for whom it was of no use to  do anything and indeed my mother made such discoveries in the  cottages that she durst not let emily fulfil her cherished scheme of  visiting them  the only resemblance to the favourite heroines of  religious tales that could be permitted was assembling a tiny sunday  class in chapmans lodge and it must be confessed that her brothers  thought she made as much fuss about it as if there had been a  hundred scholars  however between remonstrances and offers of undertaking a share of  the expense my father managed to get mr mears services dispensed  with from the ensuing lady day and that a resident curate should be  appointed the choice of whom was to rest with himself  it was then  and there decided that martyn should be brought up to the church  as people then used to term destination to holy orders  my father  said he should feel justified in building a good house when he could  afford it if it was to be a provision for one of his sons and he  also felt that as he had the charge of the parish as patron it was  right and fitting to train one of his sons up to take care of it   nor did martyn show any distaste to the idea as indeed there was  less in it then than at present to daunt the imagination of an  honest lively boy not as yet specially thoughtful or devout but  obedient truthful and fairly reverent and ready to grow as he was  trained    chapter xiimrs sophias feud    oer all there hung the shadow of a fear    a sense of mystery the spirit daunted and said as plain as whisper in the ear    the place is haunted  hood  we had a houseful at christmas  the rev charles henderson a  fellow of trinity college oxford lately ordained a deacon had  been recommended to us by our london vicar and was willing not only  to take charge of the parish but to direct my studies and to  prepare martyn for school  he came to us for the christmas vacation  to reconnoitre and engage lodgings at a farmhouse  we liked him  very muchmy mother being all the better satisfied after he had  shown her a miniature and confided to her that the original was  waiting till a college living should come to him in the distant  future  admiral griffith could not tear himself from his warm rooms and his  club but our antiquarian friend mr stafford came with his wife  and revelled in the ceilings of the mullion room where he would  much have liked to sleep but that its accommodations were only fit  for a bachelor  our other visitor was miss selby or rather mrs sophia selby as  she designated herself according to the becoming fashion of elderly  spinsters which to my mind might be gracefully resumed  it irked  my father to think of the good ladys solitary christmas at bath  and he asked her to come to us  she travelled halfway in a post chaise and then was met by the carriage  a very nice old lady she  was with a meek delicate babyish face which could not be spoilt  by the cap of the period one of the most disfiguring articles of  head gear ever devised though nobody thought so then  she was full  of kindness indeed if she had a fault it was the abundant pity she  lavished on me and her determination to amuse me  the weather was  of the kind that only the healthy and hardy could encounter and  when every one else was gone out and i was just settling in with a  new book or an old crabbed latin document that mr stafford had  entrusted to me to copy out fairly and translate she would glide in  with her worsted work on a charitable mission to enliven poor mr  edward  however this was the means of my obtaining some curious  enlightenments  a dinnerparty was in contemplation and she was  dismayed at the choice of the fashionable london hour of seven and  still more by finding that the fordyces were to be among the guests   she was too wellbred to manifest her feelings to her hosts but  alone with me she could not refrain from expressing her  astonishment to me all the more when she heard this was reciprocity  for an invitation that it had not been possible to accept  her poor  dear uncle would never hear of intercourse with hillside  on being  asked why she repeated what chapman had said that he could not  endure any one connected with mrs hannah more and her canting  humbugging set as the ungodly old man had chosen to call them  imbuing even this good woman with evil prejudices against their  noble work at cheddar  besides this fordyces and winslows could never be friends since  the fordyces had taken on themselves to dispute the will and say it  had been improperly obtained  what will  mrs winslowsmargaret fordyce that was  she was the heiress  and had every right to dispose of her property  but that was more than a hundred years ago  so it was my dear but though the law gave it to usto my uncles  grandfather or greatgrandfather was itthose fordyces never  could rest content  why one of thema clergymans son tooshot  young philip winslow dead in a duel  they have always grudged at  us  does your papa know it my dear mr edward  he ought to be  aware  i do not know i said but he would hardly care about what  happened in the time of queen anne  it was curious to see how the gentle little lady espoused the family  quarrel which after all was none of hers  well you are london people and the other branch and may not feel  as we do down here but i shall always say that madam winslows  husbands son had every right to come before her cousin once  removed  i asked if we were descended from her for having a turn for  heraldry and genealogy i wanted to make out our family tree  mrs  sophia was ready to hold up her hands at the ignorance of the other  branch  this poor heiress had lost all her children in their  infancy and bequeathed the estate to her stepson the fordyce male  heir having been endowed by her father with the advowson of hillside  and a handsome estate there which mrs selby thought ought to have  contented him but some people never know when they have enough  and on my observing that it might have been a matter of justice  she waxed hotter declaring that what the winslows felt so much was  the accusation of violence against the poor lady  she spoke as if  it were a story of yesterday and added indeed they made the  common people have all sorts of superstitious fancies about the room  where she diedthat old part of the house  then she added in a  low mysterious voice i hear that your brother mr griffith winslow  could not sleep there and when the rats and the wind were  mentionedyes that was what my poor dear uncle used to say  he  always called it nonsense but we never had a servant who would  sleep there  youll not mention it mr edward but i could not  help asking that very nice housemaid jane whether the room was  used and she said how mr griffith had given it up and none of the  servants could spend a night there when they are sleeping round  of  course i said all in my power to dispel the idea and told her that  there was no accounting for all the noises in old houses but you  never can reason with that class of people  did you ever hear the noises mrs selby  oh no i wouldnt sleep there for thousands  not that i attach  any importance to such follymy poor dear uncle would never hear  of such a thing but i am such a nervous creature i should lie  awake all night expecting the rats to run over me  i never knew of  any one sleeping there except in the gay times when i was a child  and the house used to be as full as or fuller than it could hold  for the hunt breakfast or a ball and my poor aunt used to make up  ever so many beds in the two rooms and then we never heard of any  disturbance except what they made themselves  this chiefly concerned me because home cosseting had made me old  woman enough to be uneasy about unaired beds and i knew that my  mother meant to consign clarence to the mullion chamber  so  without betraying jane i spoke to her and was answered oh sir  ill take care of that ill light a fire and air the mattresses  well  i wish that was all poor young gentleman  to the reply that the rats were slaughtered and the wind stopped  out jane returned a look of compassion but the subject was  dropped as it was supposed to be the right thing to hush up  instead of fostering any popular superstition but it surprised me  that as all our servants were fresh importations they should so  soon have become imbued with these undefined alarms  my father was much amused at being successor to this family feud  and said that when he had time he would look up the documents  mrs sophia was a sight when mr fordyce and his son and daughter inlaw were announced she was so comically stiff between her  deference to her hosts and her allegiance to her poor dear uncle  but her coldness melted before the charms of old mr fordyce who  was one of the most delightful people in the world  she even was  his partner at whist and won the game and that she did like  parson frank as we naughty young ones called him was all good nature and genialitya thorough clergyman after the ideas of the  time and a thorough farmer too and in each capacity as well as in  politics he suited my father or mr henderson  his lady in a  blonde cap exactly like the last equipment my mother had provided  herself with in london and a black satin dress had much more style  than the more gailydressed country dames and far more  conversation  mr stafford who had dreaded the party pronounced  her a sensible agreeable woman and she was particularly kind and  pleasant to me coming and talking over the botany of the country  and then speaking of my brothers kindness to poor amos bell who  was nearly recovered but was a weakly child for whom she dreaded  the toil of a ploughboy in thick clay with heavy shoes  i was sorry when after emilys wellstudied performance on the  piano mrs fordyce was summoned away from me to sing but her music  and her voice were both of a very different order from ordinary  drawingroom music and when our evening was over we congratulated  ourselves upon our neighbours and agreed that the fordyces were the  gems of the party  only mrs sophia sighed at us as degenerate winslows and emily  reserved to herself the right of believing that the daughter was a  horrid girl    chapter xiiia scrape    though bound with weakness heavy chain we in the dust of earth remain not all remorseful be our tears no agony of shame or fears need pierce its passions bitter tide  verses and sonnets  perhaps it was of set purpose that our dinner party had been given  before clarences return  griffith had been expected in time for  it but he had preferred going by way of london to attend a ball  given by the daughter of a barrister friend of my fathers  selina  clarkson was a fine showy girl with the sort of beauty to inspire  boyish admiration and griffs had been a standing family joke even  my father condescending to tease him when the young lady married sir  henry peacock a fat vulgar old man who had made his fortune in the  commissariat and purchased a baronetcy  he was allowing his young  wife her full swing of fashion and enjoyment  my mother did not  think it a desirable acquaintance and was restless until both the  brothers came home together long after dark on christmas eve  having been met by the gig at the corner where the coach stopped   the dinnerhour had been put off till halfpast six and we had to  wait for them the coach having been delayed by setting down  christmas guests and christmas fare  they were a contrast griffith  looking very handsome and manly all in a ruddy glow from the frosty  air and clarence though equally tall wellmade and with more  refined features looked pale and effaced now that his sailor tan  was worn off  the one talked as eagerly as he ate the other was  shy spiritless and with little appetite but as he always shrank  into himself among strangers it was the less wonder that he sat in  his drooping way behind my sofa while griffith kept us all merry  with his account of the humours of the peacock at home the  lumbering efforts of old sir henry to be as young and gay as his  wife in spite of gout and portliness and the extreme delight of  his lady in her new splendoursa gold spotted muslin and white  plumes in a diamond agraffe  he mimicked sir henrys cockneyisms  more than my fathers chivalry approved towards his recent host as  he described the complaints he had heard against my lady being  refused the hentry at halmacks but treated like the wery canal  and how the devoted husband wowed he would get up a still more  hexclusive circle and shut hout these himpertinent fashionables who  regarded halmacks as the seventh eaven  my mother shook her head at his audacious fun about paradise and the  peri but he was so brilliant and goodhumoured that no one was ever  long displeased with him  at night he followed when clarence helped  me to my room and carefully shutting the door griff began  now  teddy youre always as rich as a jew and i told bill youd help  him to set it straight  id do it myself but that im cleaned out   id give ten times the cash rather than see him with that hangdog  look again for just nothing at all if he would only believe so and  be rational  clarence did look indescribably miserable while it was explained  that he had been commissioned to receive about 20 pounds which was  owing to my father and to discharge therewith some small debts to  london tradesmen  all except the last for a little more than four  pounds had been paid when clarence met in the street an old  messmate a goodnatured rattlepated youthone of those who had  thought him harshly treated  there was a cordial greeting and an  invitation to dine at once at a hotel where they were joined by  some other young men and by and by betook themselves to cards when  my poor brothers besetting enemy prevented him from withdrawing  when he found the points were guineas  thus he lost the remaining  amount in his charge and so much of his own that barely enough was  left for his journey  his salary was not due till lady day mr  castleford was in the country and no advances could be asked from  mr frith  thus griff had found him in utter despair and had ever  since been trying to cheer him and make light of his trouble  if i  advanced the amount which was no serious matter to me clarence  could easily get peter to pay the bill and if my father should  demand the receipt too soon it would be easy to put him off by  saying there had been a delay in getting the account sent in  i couldnt do that said clarence  well i should not have thought you would have stuck at that  returned griff  there must be no untruth i broke in but if without that he can  avoid getting into a scrape with papa  clarence interrupted in the wavering voice we knew so well but  growing clearer and stronger  thank you edward butbutno i cant  theres the sacrament  tomorrow  ohh said griff in an indescribable tone  but he will never  believe you nor let you go  better so said clarence half choked than go profanely deceivingor not knowing whether i shall  just then we heard our father wishing the other gentlemen good night and to our surprise clarence opened the door though he was  deadly white and with dew starting on his forehead  my father turned goodnaturedly  boys boys you are glad to be  together but mamma wont have you talking here all night keeping  her baby up  sir said clarence holding by the rail of the bed i was waiting  for you  i have something to tell you  the words that followed were incoherent and wrong end foremost nor  had many indeed been uttered before my father cut them short with    no false excuses sir i know you too well to listen  go  i have  ceased to hope for anything better  clarence went without a word but griff and i burst out with  entreaties to be listened to  our father thought at first that ours  were only the pleadings of partiality and endeavours to shield the  brother we both so heartily loved but when he understood the  circumstances the real amount of the transgression and clarences  rejection of our united advice and assistance to conceal it he was  greatly touched and softened  poor lad poor fellow he muttered  he is really doing his best  i need not have cut him so short  i  was afraid of more falsehoods if i let him open his mouth  ill go  and see  he went off and we remained in suspense griff observing that he  had done his best but poor bill always would be a fool and that no  one who had not always lived at home like me would have let out that  we had been for the suppression policy  as i was rather shocked he  went off to bed saying he should look in to see what remained of  clarence after the pelting of the pitiless storm he was sure to  bring on himself by his ridiculous faltering instead of speaking out  like a man  i longed to have been able to do the same but my father kindly came  back to relieve my mind by telling me that he was better satisfied  about clarence than ever he had been before  when encouraged to  speak out the narrative of the temptation had so entirely agreed  with what we had said as to show there had been no prevarication  and this had done more to convince my father that he was on the  right track than the having found him on his knees  he had had a  patient hearing and thus was able to command his nerves enough to  explain himself and it had ended in my father giving entire  forgiveness for what as griff truly said would have been a mere  trifle but for the past  the voluntary confession had much  impressed my father and he could not help adding a word of gentle  reproof to me for having joined in aiding him to withhold it but he  accepted my explanation and went away observing by the by i  dont wonder at what griffith says of that room i never heard such  strange effects of currents of air  clarence was in my room before i was drest full of our fathers  wonderful goodness to him  he had never experienced anything like  it he said  why he really seemed hopeful about me were words  uttered with a gladness enough to go to ones heart  o edward i  feel as if there was some chance of steadfastly purposing this  time  it was not the way of the family to say much of religious feeling  and this was much for clarence to utter  he looked white and tired  but there was an air of rest and peace about him above all when my  mother met him with a very real kiss  moreover mr castleford had  taken care to brighten our christmas with a letter expressive of  great satisfaction with clarence for steadiness and intelligence   even mr frith allowed that he was the most punctual of all those  young dogs  i do believe said my father that his piety is doing him some  good after all  so our mutual wishes of a happy christmas were verified though not  much according to the notions of this half of the century  people  made their christmas day either mere merriment or something little  different from the grave sunday of that date  and ours except for  the admirals dining with us had always been of the latter  description all the more that when celebrations of the holy  communion were so rare they were treated with an awe and reverence  which frequency has perhaps diminished and a feeling possibly  puritanical prevailed which made it appear incongruous to end with  festivity a day so begun  that we had a christmas day communion at  all at earlscombe was an innovation only achieved by mr henderson  going to assist the old rector at wattlesea and there were no  communicants except from our house besides chapman his daughter inlaw and five old creatures between whom the alms were  immediately divided  we afterwards learnt that our best farmer and  his wife were much disappointed at the change from sunday  interfering with the family jollification and mrs sophia selby was  annoyed at the contradiction to her habits under the rule of her  poor dear uncle  of the irregularities irreverences and squalor of the whole i will  not speak  they were not then such stumblingblocks as they would  be now and many passed unperceived by us buried as we were in our  big pew with our eyes riveted on our books yet even thus there was  enough evident to make my mother rejoice that mr henderson would be  with us before easter  still this could not mar the thankful  gladness that was with us all that day and which shone in  clarences eyes  his countenance always had a remarkable expression  in church as if somehow his spirit went farther than ours did and  things unseen were more real to him  hillside as usual had two services and my father and his friend  were going to walk thither in the afternoon but it was a raw cold  day threatening snow and emily was caught by my mother in the hail  and ordered back as well as clarence who had shown symptoms of  having caught cold on his dismal journey  emily coaxed from her  permission to have a fire in the bookroom and there we three had a  memorably happy time  we read our psalms and lessons and our  christian year which was more and more the lodestar of our  feelings  we compared our favourite passages and discussed the  obscurer ones and clarence was led to talk out more of his heart  than he had ever shown to us before  perhaps he had lost some of  his reserve through his intercourse with our good old governess  miss newton who was still grinding away at her daily mill though  with somewhat failing eyesight so that she could do nothing but  knit in the long evenings and was most grateful to her former pupil  for coming as often as he could to talk or read to her  she was a most excellent and devout woman and when emily who in  youthful gaiete de coeur had got a little tired of her exclaimed at  his taste and asked if she made him read nothing but pikes early  piety he replied gravely she showed me where to lay my burthen  down and turned to the two last verses of the poem for good  friday in the christian year as well as to the one we had just  read on the holy communion  my fathers kindness had seemed to him the pledge of the heavenly  fathers forgiveness and he added perhaps a little childishly  that it had been his impulse to promise never to touch a card again  but that he dreaded the only too familiar reply what availed his  promises  do promise clarry cried emily and then you wont have to play  with that tiresome old mrs sophia  that would rather deter me said clarence goodhumouredly  a cardplaying old age is despicable pronounced miss emily much  to our amusement  after that we got into a bewilderment  we knew nothing of the  future question of temperance versus total abstinence but after it  had been extracted that miss newton regarded cards as the devils  books the inconsistent little sister changed sides and declared it  narrow and evangelical to renounce what was innocent  clarence  argued that what might be harmless for others might be dangerous for  such as himself and that his real difficulty in making even a  mental vow was that if broken there was an additional sin  it is not oneself that one trusts i said  no said clarence emphatically and setting up a vow seems as if  it might be sticking up the reed of ones own word and leaning on  thatwhen it breaks at least mine does  if i could always get the  grasp of him that i felt today there would be no more bewildered  heart and failing spirit which are worse than the actual falls they  cause  and as emily said she did not understand he replied in  words i wrote down and thought over what we are is the point more  than even what we do  we do as we are and yet we form ourselves by  what we do  and i put in i know somebody who won a victory last night over  himself and his two brothers  surely doing that is a sign that he  is more than he used to be  if he were it would not have been an effort at all said  clarence but with his rare sweet smile  just then griff called him away and emily sat pondering and  impressed  it did seem so odd she said that clarry should be  so much the best and yet so much the worst of us  i agreed  his insight into spiritual things and his enjoyment of  them always humiliated us both yet he fell so much lower in  practicebut then we had not his temptations  yes said emily but look at griff  he goes about like other  young men and keeps all right and yet he doesnt care about  religious things a bit more than he can help  it was quite true  religion was life to the one and an insurance to  the other and this had been a mystery to us all our young lives as  far as we had ever reflected on the contrast between the practical  failure and success of each  our mother on the other hand viewed  clarences tendencies as part of an unreal selfdeceptive nature  and regretted his intimacy with miss newton who she said had  fostered that kind of thing in his childhoodmade him fancy talk  feeling and preaching were more than truth and honourand might  lead him to run after irving rowland hill or baptist noel about  whose tenets she was rather confused  it would be an additional  misfortune if he became a fanatical evangelical light and he was  just the character to be worked upon  my father held that she might be thankful for any good influence or  safe resort for a young man in lodgings in london and he merely  bade clarence never resort to any variety of dissenting preacher   we were of the school calleda little laterhigh and dry but were  strictly orthodox according to our lights and held it a prime duty  to attend our parish church whatever it might be nor indeed had  clarence swerved from these traditions  poor mrs sophia was baulked of the game at whist which she viewed  as a legitimate part of the christmas pleasures and after we had  eaten our turkey we found the evening long except that martyn  escaped to snapdragon with the servants and by and by chapman  magnificent in patronage ushered in the church singers into the  hall and clarionet bassoon and fiddle astonished our ears    chapter xivthe mullion chamber    a lady with a lamp i see pass through the glimmering gloom    and flit from room to room  longfellow  for want of being able to take exercise the first part of the night  had always been sleepless with me though my dear mother thought it  wrong to recognise the habit or allow me a lamp  a fire however i  had and by its light on the second night after christmas i saw my  door noiselessly opened and clarence creeping in halfdressed and  barefooted  to my frightened interrogation the answer came through  chattering teeth its ionly itednonothings the matter  only i cant stand it any longer  his hands were cold as ice when he grasped mine as if to get hold  of something substantial and he trembled so as to shake the bed   that room he faltered  tis not only the moans  ive seen  her  whom  i dont know  there she stands with her lamp crying  i could  scarcely distinguish the words through the clashing of his teeth  and as i threw my arms round him the shudder seemed to pass to me  but i did my best to warm him by drawing the clothes over him and  he began to gather himself together and speak intelligibly  there  had been sounds the first night as of wailing but he had been too  much preoccupied to attend to them till soon after one oclock  they ended in a heavy fall and long shriek after which all was  still  christmas night had been undisturbed but on this the voices  had begun again at eleven and had a strangely human sound but as  it was windy sleety weather and he had learnt at sea to disregard  noises in the rigging he drew the sheet over his head and went to  sleep  i was dreaming that i was at sea he said as i always do  on a noisy night but this was not a dream  i was wakened by a  light in the room and there stood a woman with a lamp moaning and  sobbing  my first notion was that one of the maids had come to call  me and i sat up but i could not speak and she gave another awful  suppressed cry and moved towards that walledup door  then i saw  it was none of the servants for it was an antique dress like an old  picture  so i knew what it must be and an unbearable horror came  over me and i rushed into the outer room where there was a little  fire left but i heard her going on still and i could endure it no  longer  i knew you would be awake and would bear with me so i came  down to you  then this was what chapman and the maids had meant  this was mrs  sophia selbys vulgar superstition  i found that clarence had heard  none of the mysterious whispers afloat and only knew that griff had  deserted the room after his own return to london  i related what i  had learnt from the old lady and in that midnight hour we agreed  that it could be no mere fancy or rumour but that cruel wrong must  have been done in that chamber  our feeling was that all ought to  be made known and in that impression we fell asleep clarence  first  by and by i found him moving  he had heard the clock strike four  and thought it wiser to repair to his own quarters where he  believed the disturbance was over  lucifer matches as yet were not  but he had always been a noiseless being with a sailors foot so  that by the help of the moonlight through the hall windows he  regained his room  and when morning had come the nocturnal visitation wore such a  different aspect to both our minds that we decided to say nothing to  our parents who said clarence would simply disbelieve him and  indeed i inclined to suppose it had been an uncommonly vivid dream  produced in that sensitive nature by the uncanny sounds of the wind  in the chinks and crannies of the ancient chamber  had not scotts  demonology and witchcraft which we studied hard on that day proved  all such phantoms to be explicable  the only person we told was  griff who was amused and incredulous  he had heard the noisesoh  yes and objected to having his sleep broken by them  it was too  had to expose clarence to thempoor billon whom they worked such  fancies  he interrogated chapman however but probably in that bantering way  which is apt to produce reserve  chapman never gave heed to them  fictious tales he said but when hard pressed he allowed that he  had heerd that a lady do walk o winter nights and that was why  the garden door of the old rooms was walled up  griff asked if this  was done for fear she should catch cold and this somewhat affronted  him so that he averred that he knew nought about it and gave no  thought to such like  just then they arrived at the winslow arms and took each a glass of  ale when griff partly to tease chapman asked the landladyan old  chantry house servantwhether she had ever met the ghost  she  turned rather pale which seemed to have impressed him and demanded  if he had seen it  it always walked at christmas timebetween  then and the new year  she had once seen a light in the garden by  the ruin in wintertime and once last spring it came along the  passage but that was just before the old squire was took for  deathfolks said that was always the way before any of the family  diedif youll excuse it sir  oh no she thought nothing of  such things but she had heard tell that the noises were such at all  times of the year that no one could sleep in the rooms but the  light wasnt to be seen except at christmas  griff with the philosophy of a university man was certain that all  was explained by clarence having imbibed the impression of the place  being haunted and going to sleep nervous at the noises his brain  had shaped a phantom in accordance  let clarence declare as he  might that the legends were new to him griff only smiled to think  how easily people forgot and he talked earnestly about catching  ideas without conscious information  however he volunteered to sit up that night to ascertain the exact  causes of the strange noises and convince clarence that they were  nothing but the effects of draughts  the fire in his gunroom was  surreptitiously kept up to serve for the vigil which i ardently  desired to share  it was an enterprise it would gratify my  curiosity and besides though griffith was goodnatured and  forbearing in a general way towards clarence i detected a spirit of  mockery about him which might break out unpleasantly when poor  clarry was convicted of one of his unreasonable panics  both brothers were willing to gratify me the only difficulty being  that the tap of my crutches would warn the entire household of the  expedition  however they hadall unknown to my motherseveral  times carried me about queens cushion fashion as being always  much of a size they could do most handily and as both were now  fine strong wellmade youths of twenty and nineteen they had no  doubt of easily and silently conveying me up the shallowstepped  staircase when all was quiet for the night  emily with her sharp ears guessed that something was in hand but  we promised her that she should know all in time  i believe griff  being a little afraid of her quickness led her to suppose he was  going to hold what he called a symposium in his rooms and to think  it a mystery of college life not intended for young ladies  he really had prepared a sort of supper for us when after my  fathers resounding turn of the key of the drawingroom door my  brothers in their stocking soles bore me upstairs the fun of the  achievement for the moment overpowering all sense of eeriness   griff said he could not receive me in his apartment without doing  honour to the occasion and that dutch courage was requisite for us  both but i suspect it was more in accordance with oxford habits  that he had provided a bottle of sherry and another of ale some  brandy cherries bread cheese and biscuits by what means i do not  know for my mother always locked up the wine  he was disappointed  that clarence would touch nothing and declared that inanition was  the preparation for ghostseeing or imagining  i drank his health  in a glass of sherry as i looked round at the curious old room with  its panelled roof the heraldic devices and badges of the power  family and the trophy of swords dirks daggers and pistols  chiefly relics of our naval grandfather but reinforced by the  sword helmet and spurs of the county yeomanry which griff had  joined  griff proposed cards to drive away fancies especially as the sounds  were beginning but though we generally yielded to him we could not  give our attention to anything but these  there was first a low  moan  no great harm in that said griff it comes through that  crack in the wainscot where there is a sham window  some putty will  put a stop to that  then came a more decided wail and sob much nearer to us  griff  hastily swallowed the ale in his tumbler and striking a theatrical  attitude exclaimed angels and ministers of grace defend us  clarence held up his hand in deprecation  the door into his bedroom  was open and griff taking up one of the flat candlesticks pursued  his researches holding the flame to all chinks or cracks in the  wainscotting to detect draughts which might cause the dreary sounds  which were much more like suppressed weeping than any senseless gust  of wind  of draughts there were many and he tried holding his hand  against each crevice to endeavour to silence the wails but these  became more human and more distressful  presently clarence  exclaimed there and on his face there was a whiteness and an  expression which always recurs to me on reading those words of  eliphaz the temanite then a spirit passed before my face and the  hair of my flesh stood up  even griff was awestruck as we cried  where what  dont you see her  there  by the presslook  i see a patch of moonlight on the wall said griff  moonlighther lamp  edward dont you see her  i could see nothing but a spot of light on the wall  griff plainly  putting a force on himself came back and gave him a goodnatured  shake  dreaming again old bill  wake up and come to your  senses  i am as much in my senses as you are said clarence  i see her  as plainly as i see you  nor could any one doubt either the reality of the awe in his voice  and countenance nor of the lighta kind of hazy ballnor of the  choking sobs  what is she like i asked holding his hand for though infected  by his dread my fears were chiefly for the effect on him but he  was much calmer and less horrorstruck than on the previous night  though still he shuddered as he answered in a low voice as if loth  to describe a lady in her presence a dark cloak with the hood  fallen back a kind of lace headdress loosely fastened brown hair  thin white face eyesoh poor thingstaring with fright dark oh how swollen the lids all red below with cryingblack dress  with white about ita widow kind of looka glove on the arm with  the lamp  is she beckoninglooking at us  oh you poor thing if  i could tell what you mean  i felt the motion of his muscles in act to rise and grasped him   griff held him with a strong hand hoarsely crying dontdont dont follow the thing whatever you do  clarence hid his face  it was very awful and strange  once the  thought of conjuring her to speak by the holy name crossed me but  then i saw no figure and with incredulous griffith standing by it  would have been like playing nor perhaps could i have spoken  how  long this lasted there is no knowing but presently the light moved  towards the walledup door and seemed to pass into it  clarence  raised his head and said she was gone  we breathed freely  the farce is over said griff  mr edward winslows carriage  stops the way  i was hoisted up candle in hand between the two and had nearly  reached the stairs when there came up on the garden side a sound as  of tipsy revellers in the garden  the scoundrels how can they  have got in cried griff looking towards the window but all the  windows on that side had peculiarly heavy shutters and bars with  only a tiny heartshaped aperture very high up so they somewhat  hurried their steps downstairs intending to rush out on the  intruders from the back door  but suddenly in the middle of the  staircase we heard a terrible heartrending womans shriek making  us all start and have a general fall  my brothers managed to seat  me safely on a step without much damage to themselves but the  candle fell and was extinguished and we made too heavy a weight to  fall without real noise enough to bring the household together  before we could pick ourselves up in the dark  we heard doors opening and hurried calls and something about  pistols impelling griff to call out its nothing papa but there  are some drunken rascals in the garden  a light had come by this time and we were detected  there was a  general sally upon the enemy in the garden before any one thought of  me except a you here when they nearly fell over me  and there i  was left sitting on the stair helpless without my crutches till in  a few minutes all returned declaring there was nothingno signs of  anything and then as clarence ran up to me with my crutches my  father demanded the meaning of my being there at that time of night  well sir said griff it is only that we have been sitting up to  investigate the ghost  ghost  arrant stuff and nonsense  what induced you to be dragging  edward about in this dangerous way  i wished it said i  you are all mad together i think  i wont have the house  disturbed for this ridiculous folly  i shall look into it to morrow    chapter xvrational theories    these are the reasons they are natural  julius caesar  if anything could have made our adventure more unpleasant to mr and  mrs winslow it would have been the presence of guests  however  inquiry was suppressed at breakfast in deference to the signs my  mother made to enjoin silence before the children all unaware that  emily was nearly frantic with suppressed curiosity and martyn knew  more about the popular version of the legend than any of us  clarence looked wan and heavyeyed  his head was aching from a bump  against the edge of a step and his cold was much worse no wonder  said my mother but she was always softened by any ailment and  feared that the phantoms were the effect of coming illness  i have  always thought that if clarence could have come home from his court martial with a brain fever he would have earned immediate  forgiveness but unluckily for him he was a very healthy person  all three of us were summoned to the tribunal in the study where my  father and my mother sat in judgment on what they termed this  preposterous business  in our morning senses our impressions were  much more vague than at midnight and we betrayed some confusion  but griff and i had a strong instinct of sheltering clarence and we  stoutly declared the noises to be beyond the capacities of wind  rats or cats that the light was visible and inexplicable and that  though we had seen nothing else we could not doubt that clarence  did  thought he did corrected my father  without discussing the word said griff i mean that the effect  on his senses was the same as the actual sight  you could not look  at him without being certain  exactly so returned my mother  i wish dr fellowes were near  indeed nothing saved clarence from being consigned to medical  treatment but the distance from bath or bristol and the  contradictory advice that had been received from our county  neighbours as to our family doctor  however she formed her theory  that his nervous imaginingswhether involuntary or acted she hoped  the former and wished she could be surehad infected us and as  she was really uneasy about him she would not let him sleep in the  mullion room but having nowhere else to bestow him she turned out  the manservant and put him into the little room beyond mine and  she also forbade any mention of the subject to him that day  this was a sore prohibition to emily who had been discussing it  with the other ladies and was in a mingled state of elation at the  romance and terror at the supernatural which found vent in excited  giggle and moved griff to cram her with rawhead and bloodybone  horrors conventional enough to be suspicious and send her to me  tearfully to entreat to know the truth  if by day she exulted in a  haunted chamber in the evening she paid for it by terrors at  walking about the house alone and when sent on an errand by my  mother looked piteous enough to be laughed at or scolded on all  sides  the gentlemen had more serious colloquies and the upshot was a  determination to sit up together and discover the origin of the  annoyance  mr staffords antiquarian researches had made him  familiar with such mysteries and enough of them had been explained  by natural causes to convince him that there was a key to all the  rest  owls coiners and smugglers had all been convicted of  simulating ghosts  in one venerable mansion behind the wainscot  there had been discovered nine skeletons of cats in different stages  of decay having trapped themselves at various intervals of time  and during the gradual extinction of their eightyone lives having  emitted cries enough to establish the ghastly reputation of the  place  perhaps mr henderson was inclined to believe there were  more things in heaven and earth than were dreamt of in even an  antiquarys philosophy  he owned himself perplexed but reserved  his opinion  at breakfast clarence was quite well except for the remains of his  sore throat and the two seniors were gruff and brief as to their  watch  they had heard odd noises and should discover the cause  the carpenter had already been sent for and they had seen a light  which was certainly due to reflection or refraction  mr henderson  committed himself to nothing but that it was very extraordinary  and there was a wicked look of diversion on griffs face and an  exchange of glances  afterwards in our own domain we extracted a  good deal more from them  griff told us how the two elders started on politics and denounced  brougham and oconnell loud enough to terrify any save the most  undaunted ghost till henderson said hush and they paused at the  moan with which the performance always commenced making mr  stafford turn as griff said white in the gills though he talked  of the wind on the stillest of frosty nights  then came the sobbing  and wailing which certainly overawed them all henderson called  them agonising but griff was in a manner inured to this and felt  as if master of the ceremonies  let them say what they would by  daylight about owls cats and rats they owned the human element  then and were far from comfortable though they would not  compromise their good sense by owning what both their younger  companions had perceivedtheir feeling of some undefinable  presence  vain attempts had been made to account for the light or  get rid of it by changing the position of candles or bright objects  in the outer room and henderson had shut himself into the bedroom  with it but there he still only saw the hazy lightthough all was  otherwise pitch dark except the keyhole and the small gray patch of  sky at the top of the windowshutters  you saw nothing else said  griff  i thought i heard you break out as clarence did just  before my father opened the door  perhaps i did so  i had the sense strongly on me of some being in  grievous distress very near me  and you should have power over it suggested emily  i am afraid he said that more thorough conviction and  comprehension are needed before i could address the thing with  authority  i should like to have stayed longer and heard the  conclusion  for mr stafford had grown impatient and weary and my father having  satisfied himself that there was something to be detected would not  remain to the end and not only carried his companions off but  locked the doors perhaps expecting to imprison some agent in a  trick and find him in the morning  indeed clarence had a dim remembrance of having been half wakened by  some one looking in on him in the night when he was sleeping  heavily after his cold and the previous nights disturbance and we  suspected though we would not say that our father might have  wished to ascertain that he had no share in producing these  appearances  he was however fully acquitted of all wilful  deception in the case and he was not surprised though he was  disappointed that his vision of the lady was supposed to be the  consequence of excited imagination  i cant help it he said to me in private  i have always seen or  felt or whatever you may call it things that others do not  dont  you remember how nobody would believe that i saw lucy brooke  that was in the beginning of the measles   i know and i will tell you something curious  when i was at  gibraltar i met mrs emmott  mary brooke  yes i spent a very happy sunday with her  we talked over old  times and she told me that lucy had all through her illness been  very uneasy about having promised to bring me a macaws feather the  next time we played in the square gardens  it could not be sent to  me for fear of carrying the infection but the dear girl was too  lightheaded to understand and kept on fretting and wandering about  breaking her word  i have no doubt the wish carried her spirit to  me the moment it was free he added with tears springing to his  eyes  he also said that before the courtmartial he had night  after night dreams of sinking and drowning in huge waves and his  friend coles struggling to come to his aid but being forcibly  withheld and he had since learnt that coles had actually  endeavoured to come from plymouth to bear testimony to his previous  character but had been refused leave and told that he could do no  good  there had been other instances of perception of a presence and of a  prescient foreboding  it is like a sixth sense he said and a  very uncomfortable one  i would give much to be rid of it for it  is connected with all that is worst in my life  i had it before  navarino when no one expected an engagement  it made me believe i  should be killed and drove me to what was much worseor at least i  used to think so  dont you now i asked  no said clarence  it was a great mercy that i did not die then   theres something to conquer first  but youll never speak of this  ted  i have left off telling of such thingsit only gives another  reason for disbelieving me  however this time his veracity was not called in questionbut he  was supposed to be under a hallucination the creation of the noises  acting on his imagination and memory of the persecuted widow which  must have been somewhere dormant in his mind though he averred that  he had never heard of it  it had now however made a strong  impression on him he was convinced that some crime or injustice had  been perpetrated and thought it ought to be investigated but  griffith made us laugh at his championship of this shadow of a  shade and even wrote some mock heroic verses about itnor would  it have been easy to stir my father to seek for the motives of an  apparition which no one in the family save clarence professed to  have seen  the noises were indisputable but my mother began to suspect a cause  for them  to oblige a former cook we had brought down with us as  stableboy her son george sims an imp accustomed to be the pet and  jester of a mews  martyn was only too fond of his company and he  made no secret of his contempt for the insufferable dulness of the  country enlivening it by various acts of monkeymischief in some  of which martyn had been implicated  that very afternoon as mrs  sophia selby was walking home in the twilight from chapmans lodge  in company with mr henderson an eldritch yell proceeding from the  vaults beneath the mullion chambers nearly frightened her into fits   henderson darted in and captured the two boys in the fact  martyns  asseveration that he had taken the pair for griff and emily would  have pacified the goodnatured clergyman but mrs sophia was too  much agitated or too spiteful as we declared not to make a scene  martyn spent the evening alone and in disgrace and only his  unimpeachable character for truth caused the acceptance of his  affirmation that the yell was an impromptu fraternal compliment and  that he had nothing to do with the noises in the mullion chamber   he had been supposed to be perfectly unconscious of anything of the  kind and to have never so much as heard of a phantom so my mother  was taken somewhat aback when in reply to her demand whether he had  ever been so naughty as to assist george in making a noise in  clarences room he said why thats the ghost of the lady that  was murdered atop of the steps and always walks every christmas  who told you such ridiculous nonsense  the answer george was deemed conclusive that all had been got up  by that youth and there was considerable evidence of his talent for  ventriloquism and taste for practical jokes  my mother was certain  that having heard of the popular superstition he had acted ghost   she appealed to woodstock to prove the practicability of such feats  and her absolute conviction persuaded the maids who had given  warning en masse that the enemy was exorcised when george sims had  been sent off on the royal mail under clarences guardianship  none of the junior part of the family believed him guilty but he  had hunted the cows round the paddock mounted on my donkey had  nearly shot the kitchenmaid with griffs gun and if not much  maligned knew the way to the applechamber only too wellso that  he richly deserved his doom rejoiced in it himself and was  unregretted save by martyn  clarence viewed him in the light of a  victim and tried to keep an eye on him but he developed his talent  as a ventriloquist made his fortune and retired on a publichouse  my mother would fain have had the vaults under the mullion rooms  bricked up but mr stafford cried out on the barbarism of such a  proceeding  the mystery was declared to be solved and was added to  mr staffords good stories of haunted houses  and at home my father forbade any further mention of such rank folly  and deception  the inner mullion chamber was turned into a lumber room and as weeks passed by without hearing or seeing any more of  lady or of lamp we began to credit the wonderful freaks of the  goblin page    chapter xvicat language    soon as she parted thencethe fearful twayne that blind old woman and her daughter deare came forth and finding kirkrapine there slayne for anguish greate they gan to rend their heare and beate their breasts and naked flesh to teare and when they both had wept and wayled their fill then forth they ran like two amazed deere half mad through malice and revenging will to follow her that was the causer of their ill  spenser  the christmas vacation was not without another breeze about  griffiths expenses at oxford  he held his head high and declared  that people expected something from the eldest son of a man of  property and my father tried to convince him that a landed estate  often left less cash available than did the fixed salary of an  office  griff treated all in his light goodhumoured way promised  to be careful and came to me to commiserate the poor old  gentlemans ignorance of the ways of the new generation  there ensued some trying weeks of dark days raw frost and black  east wind when the home party cast longing lingering recollections  back to the social intercourse lamplit streets and ready  interchange of books and other amenities we had left behind us  we  were not accustomed to have our nearest neighbours separated from us  by two miles of dirty lane or road mended with excruciating stones  nor were they very congenial when we did see them  the fordyce  family might be interesting but we younger ones could not forget  the slight to clarence and besides the girls seemed to be  entirely in the schoolroom mrs fordyce was delicate and was shut  up all the winter and the only intercourse that took place was when  my father met the elder mr fordyce at the magistrates bench also  there was a conference about amos bell who was preferred to the  post left vacant by george sims in right of his being our tenant  but more civilised than earlscombers a widows son and not  sufficiently recovered from his accident to be exposed to the severe  tasks of a ploughboy in the winter  mrs fordyce was the manager of a bookclub which circulated  volumes covered in white cartridge paper with a printed list of the  subscribers names  two volumes at a time might be kept for a month  by each member in rotation novels were excluded and the manager  had a veto on all orders  we found her more liberal than some of  our other neighbours who looked on our wants and wishes with  suspicion as savouring of london notions  happily we could read old  books and standard books over again and we gloated over blackwood  and the quarterly enjoying too every outofdoor novelty of the  coming spring as each revealed itself  emily will never forget her  first primroses nor i the first thrush in early morning  blankets broth and what were uncomfortably termed broken victuals  had been given away during the winter and a bewildering amount of  begging women and children used to ask interviews with the lady  winslow with stories that crumbled on investigation so as to make  us recollect the rectors character of earlscombe  however mr henderson came in the second week of lent and what our  steps towards improvement introduced would have seemed almost as  shocking to you youngsters as what they displaced  for instance a  plain crimson cloth covered the altar instead of the rags in the  colours of the winslow livery presented according to the queer old  register by the unfortunate margaret  there was talk of velvet and  the gold monogram surrounded by rays alternately straight and  wavy as in our london church but this was voted unfit for a plain  village church  still the new hangings of pulpit desk and altar  were all good in quality and colour and huge square cushions were  provided as essential to each  moreover the altar vessels were  made somewhat more respectableall this being at my fathers  expense  he also carried in the vestry though not without strong opposition  from a dissenting farmer that new linen and a fresh surplice should  be provided by the parish which surplice would have made at least  six of such as are at present worn  the farmers were very jealous  of the interference of the squire in the vestrywhat he had no  call to and of church rates applied to any other object than the  reward of birdslayers as thus in the register    hairy wills 1 score sprows heds 2d jems brown 1 poulcat 6d jarge bell 2 howls 6d   it was several years before this appropriation of the church rates  could be abolished  the year 1830 with a brand new squire and  parson was too ticklish a time for many innovations  hillside church was the only one in the neighbourhood where holy  week or ascension day had been observed in the memory of man  when  we proposed going to church on the latter day the gardener asked my  mother if it was her will to keep thursday holy as if he expected  its substitution for sunday  monthly communions and baptisms after  the second lesson were viewed as not fit for a country church and  every attempt at even more secular improvements was treated with the  most disappointing distrust and aversion  when my father laid out  the allotment grounds the labourers suspected some occult design  for his own profit and the farmers objected that the gardens would  be used as an excuse for neglecting their work and stealing their  potatoes  coalclub and clothingclub were regarded in like manner  and while a few took advantage of these offers in a grudging manner  the others viewed everything except absolute gifts as mean on our  part the principle of aid to selfhelp being an absolute novelty   when i look back to the notes in our journals of that date i see how  much has been overcome  perhaps we listened more than was strictly wise to the revelations  of amos bell when he attended emily and me on our expeditions with  the donkey  though living over the border of hillside he had a  family of relations at earlscombe and for a time lodged with his  grandmother there  when his shyness and lumpishness gave way he  proved so bright that emily undertook to carry on his education  he  soon had a wonderful eye for a wild flower and would climb after it  with the utmost agility and when once his tongue was loosed he  became almost too communicative and made us acquainted with the  opinions of they earlscoom folk with a freedom not to be found in  an elder or a native  moreover he was the brightest light of the sunday school which mr  henderson opened at oncefor want of a more fitting placein the  disused north transept of the church  it was an uncouth illclad  crew which assembled on those dilapidated paving tiles  their own  grandchildren look almost as far removed from them in dress and  civilisation as did my sister in her white worked cambric dress  silk scarf huge tuscan bonnet and the little curls beyond the lace  quilling round her bright face far rosier than ever it had been in  town  and what would the present generation say to the odd little  contrivances in the way of cotton sunbonnets check pinafores list  tippets and print capes and other wonderful manufactures from the  ragbag which were then grand prizes and stimulants  previous knowledge or intelligence scarcely existed and then was  not due to dame dearloves tuition  mr henderson pronounced an  authorised school a necessity  my father had scruples as to vested  rights for the old woman was the last survivor of a family who had  had recourse to primer and hornbook after their ejection on black  bartholomews day and when the meetinghouse was built after the  revolution had combined preaching with teaching  monopoly had  promoted degeneracy and this last of the race was an unfavourable  specimen in all save outward picturesqueness  however much against  hendersons liking an accommodation was proposed by which books  were to be supplied to her and the church catechism be taught in  her school with the assistance of the curate and miss winslow  the terms were rejected with scorn  no school board could be more  determined against the catechism nor against passons meddling wi  she and as to assistance she had been a governess this thirty  year and didnt want no one trapesing in and out of her school  she was warned but probably did not believe in the possibility of  an opposition school and really there were children enough in the  place to overfill both her room and that which was fitted up after a  very humble fashion in one of our cottages  hm inspector would  hardly have thought it even worth condemnation any more than the  attainments of the mistress the young widow of a small bristol  skipper  her qualifications consisted in her piety and  conscientiousness good temper and excellent needlework together  with her having been a scholar in one of mrs hannah mores schools  in the cheddar district  she could read and teach reading well but  as for the dangerous accomplishments of writing and arithmetic such  as desired to pass beyond the rudiments of them must go to  wattlesea  so nice did she look in her black that earlscombe voted her a mere  town lady and even at a penny a week hesitated to send its children  to her  indeed it was currently reported that her school was part  of a deep and nefarious scheme of the gentlefolks for reducing the  poorrates by enticing the children and then shipping them off to  foreign parts from bristol  but the great crisis was one unlucky summer evening when emily and i  were out with the donkey and griffith just come home from oxford  was airing the new acquisition of a handsome black retriever  close by the old chapel a black cat was leisurely crossing the  road  at her dashed nero stimulated perhaps by an almost  involuntary scssscssfrom his master if not from amos and me   the cat flew up a low wall and stood at bay on the top on tiptoe  with bristling tail arched back and fiery eyes while the dog  danced round in agony on his hind legs barking furiously and  almost reaching her  female sympathy ever goes to the cat and  emily screamed out in the fear that he would seize her or even that  griff might aid him  perhaps amos would have done so if left to  himself but griff who saw the cat was safe could not help egging  on his dogs impotent rage when in the midst out flew pussys  mistress dame dearlove herself broomstick in hand using language  as vituperative as the cats and more intelligible  she was about to strike the dogindeed i fancy she did for there  was a howl and griff sprang to his defence withdont hurt my  dog i say  he hasnt touched the brute  she can take care of  herself  here theres halfacrown for the fright as the cat  sprang down within the wall and nero slunk behind him  but dame  dearlove was not so easily appeased  her blood was up after our  long series of offences and she broke into a regular tirade of  abuse  thats the way with you fine folk thinking you can tread down poor  people like the dirt under your feet and insult em when youve  taken the bread out of the mouths of them that were here before you   passons and ladies a meddin where no one ever set a foot before   ay ay but yell all be down before long  griff signed to us to go on and thundered out on her to take care  what she was about and not be abusive but this brought a fresh  volley on him heralded by a derisive laugh  ha ha fine talking  for the likes of you winslows that you are  but theres a curse on  you all  the poor lady as was murdered wont let you be  why  theres one of you poor humpy object  at this savage attack on me griff waxed furious and shouted at her  to hold her confounded tongue but this only diverted the attack on  himself  and as for youfine chap as ye think yourself  swaggering and swearing at poor folk and setting your dog at them your times coming  look out for yourself  its well known as how  the curse is on the firstborn  the lady margaret dont let none of  em live to come after his father  griff laughed and said there we have had enough of this and in  fact we had already moved on so that he had to make some long steps  to overtake us muttering so weve started a meg merrilies  my  father wont keep such a foulmouthed hag in the parish long  to which i had to respond that her cottage belonged to the trustees  of the chapel whereat he whistled  i dont think he knew that we  had heard her final denunciation and we did not like to mention it  to him scarcely to each other though emily looked very white and  scared  we talked it over afterwards in private and with henderson who  confessed that he had heard of the old womans saying something of  the kind to other persons  we consulted the registers in hopes of  confuting it but did not satisfy ourselves  the last squire had  lost his only son at school  he himself had been originally second  in the family and in the generation before him there had been some  childdeaths after which we came back to a young man apparently  the eldest who according to miss selbys story had been killed in  a duel by one of the fordyces  it was not comfortable till i  remembered that our family bible recorded the birth baptism and  death of a son who had preceded griffith and only borne for a day  the name afterwards bestowed on me  and henderson who was so little our elder as to discuss things on  fairly equal grounds had some very interesting talks with us two  over ancestral sin and its possible effects dwelling on the 18th of  ezekiel as a comment on the second commandment  indeed we agreed  that the uncomfortable state of disaffection which in 1830 was  becoming only too manifest in the populace was the result of  neglect in former ages and that even in our own parish the  bitterness distrust and ingratitude were due to the careless  riotous and oppressive family whom we represented    chapter xviithe siege of hillside    ferments arise imprisoned factions roar represt ambition struggles round the shore till overwrought the general system feels its motion stop or frenzy fire the wheels  goldsmith  griffith had come straight home this year  there were no peacock  gaieties to tempt him in london for old sir henry had died suddenly  soon after the ball in december nor was there much of a season that  year owing to the illness and death of george iv  a regiment containing two old schoolmates of his was at bristol and  he spent a good deal of time there and also in yeomanry drill  as  autumn came on we rejoiced in having so stalwart a protector for  the agricultural riots had begun and the forebodings of another  french revolution seemed about to be realised  we stayed on at  chantry house  my father thought his duty lay there as a  magistrate and my mother would not leave him nor indeed was any  other place much safer certainly not london whence clarence wrote  accounts of formidable mobs who were expected to do more harm than  they accomplished though their hatred of the hero of our country  filled us with direful prognostications and made us think of the  guillotine which was linked with revolution in our minds before we  had i beheld the numerous changes that followed upon the thirty  years of peace in which we grew up  the ladies did not much like losing so stalwart a defender when  griff returned to oxford and jane the housemaid went to bed every  night with the pepperpot and a poker the first wherewith to blind  the enemy the second to charge them with  from our height we could  more than once see blazing ricks and were glad that the home farm  was not in our own hands and that our only stack of hay was a good  way from the house  when the onset came at last it was december  and the enemy only consisted of about thirty drearylooking men and  boys in smockfrocks and chalked or smutted faces armed only with  sticks and an old gun diverted from its purpose of birdscaring   they shouted for food money and arms but my father spoke to them  from the hall steps told them they had better go home and learn  that the publichouse was a worse enemy to them than any machine  that had ever been invented and assured them that they would get no  help from him in breaking the laws and getting themselves into  trouble  a stone or two was picked up whereupon he went back and  had the hall door shut and barred the heavy shutters of the windows  having all been closed already so that we could have stood a much  more severe siege than from these poor fellows  one or two windows  were broken as well as the glass of the conservatory and the  flower beds were trampled but finding our fortress impregnable they  sneaked away before dark  we fared better than our neighbours some  of whom were seriously frightened and suffered loss of property   old mr fordyce had for many years past been an active magistrate that a clergyman should be on the bench having been quite correct  according to the notions of his younger days and in spite of his  beneficence he incurred a good deal of unpopularity for withstanding  the lax goodnature which made his brother magistrates give orders  for parish relief refused to ablebodied paupers by their own  vestries  this was a mischievous abuse of the old poorlaw times  which made people dispose of every ones money save their own  he  had also been a keen sportsman and though his son had given up  field sports in deference to higher notions of clerical duty his  wifes as people said the old mans feeling prompted him to  severity on poachers  frank fordyce while by far the most earnest  hardworking clergyman in the neighbourhood worked off his  superfluous energy on scientific farming making the glebe and the  hereditary estate as much the model farm as hillside was the model  parish  he had lately set up a threshingmachine worked by horses  which was as much admired by the intelligent as it was vituperated  by the ignorant  neither paupers nor poachers abounded in hillside the natives were  chiefly tenants and employed on the property and between good  management and beneficence there was little real want and much  friendly confidence and affection and thus in spite of surrounding  riots hillside seemed likely to be an exception proving what could  he done by rightful care and attention  nor indeed did the attack  come from thence but the two parsons were bitterly hated by  outsiders beyond the reach of their personal influence and  benevolence  it was on a saturday evening the day after griff had come back for  the christmas vacation that as emily was giving amos his lesson  she saw that the boy was crying and after examination he let out  that folk should say that the lads were agoing to break parson  fordys machine and fire his ricks that very night but he would  not give his authority and when he saw her about to give warning  entreated now dontze say nothing miss emily  what she cried indignantly do you think i could hear of such a  thing without trying to stop it  us says he blurted out as how winslows be always fain of ought  as happens to the fordys  we are not such wicked winslows as you have heard of returned  emily with dignity and she rushed off in quest of papa and griff  but when she brought them to the bookroom amos had decamped and  was nowhere to be found that night  we afterwards learnt that he  lay hidden in the hayloft not daring to return to his grannys  lest he should be suspected of being a traitor to his kind for our  lawless untamed discontented parish furnished a large quota to the  rioters and he has since told me that though all seemed to know  what was about to be done he did not hear it from any one in  particular  it was no time to make light of a warning but very difficult to  know what to do  rural police were nonexistent there were no  soldiers nearer than keynsham and the yeomanry were all in their  own homesteads  however the captain of griffs troop sir george  eastwood lived about three miles beyond wattlesea and had a good  many dependants in the corps so it was resolved to send him a note  by the gardener good james ellis a steady resolute man on  emilys fasttrotting pony while my father and griff should hasten  to hillside to warn the fordyces who were not unlikely to be able  to muster trustworthy defenders among their own people and might  send the ladies to take shelter at chantry house  my mothers brave spirit disdained to detain an effective man for  her own protection and the groom was to go to hillside he was in  the yeomanry and like griff put on his uniform while my father  had the riot act in his pocket  all the horses were thus absorbed  but chapman and the manservant followed on foot  never did i feel my incapacity more than on that strange night when  emily was flying about with martyn to all the doors and windows in a  wild state of excitement humming to herself    when the dawn on the mountain was misty and gray my true love has mounted his steed and away   my mother was equally restless prolonging as much as possible the  preparation of rooms for possible guests and when she did come and  sit down she netted her purse with vehement jerks and scolded  emily for jumping up and leaving doors open  at last after an hour according to the clock but far more by our  feelings wheels were heard in the distance emily was off like a  shot to reconnoitre and presently martyn bounced in with the  tidings that a pair of carriage lamps were coming up the drive  my  mother hurried out into the hall i made my best speed after her  and found her hastily undoing the doorchain as she recognised the  measured courteous voice of old mr fordyce  in a moment more they  were all in the house the old gentleman giving his arm to his  daughterinlaw who was quite overcome with distress and alarm  then came his tall slim granddaughter carrying her little sister  with arms full of dolls and sundry maidservants completed the  party of fugitives  we are taking advantage of mr winslows goodness said the old  rector  he assured us that you would be kind enough to receive  those who would only be an encumbrance  oh but i must go back to frank now that you and the children are  safe cried the poor lady  dont send away the carriage i must  go back to frank  nonsense my dear returned mr fordyce frank is in no danger   he will get on much better for knowing you are safe  mrs winslow  will tell you so  my mother was enforcing this assurance when the little girls sobs  burst out in spite of her sister who had been trying to console  her  it is celestina mary she cried pointing to three dolls  whom she had carried in clasped to her breast  poor celestina  mary  she is left behind and ellen wont let me go and see if she  is in the carriage  my dear if she is in the carriage she will be quite safe in the  morning  oh but she will be so cold  she had nothing on but rosellas old  petticoat  the distress was so real that i had my hand on the bell to cause a  search to be instituted for the missing damsel when mrs fordyce  begged me to do no such thing as it was only a doll  the child  while endeavouring to shelter with a shawl the dolls snatched in  their nightgear from their beds wept so piteously at the rebuff  that her grandfather had nearly gone in quest of the lost one but  was stopped by a special entreaty that he would not spoil the child   martyn however who had been standing in openmouthed wonder at  such feeling for a doll exclaimed dont cry dont cry  ill go  and get it for you and rushed off to the stableyard  this episode had restored mrs fordyce and while providing some of  our guests with wine and others with tea we heard the story only  interrupted by martyns return from a vain search and annes  consequent tears which however were somehow hushed and smothered  by fears of being sent to bed coupled with his promises to search  every step of the way tomorrow  it appeared that while the fordyce family were at dinner shouts  howls and yells had startled them  the rabble had surrounded the  rectory bawling out abuse of the parsons and their machines and  occasionally throwing stones  there was no help to be expected the  only hope was in the strength of the doors and windows and the  knowledge that personal violence was very uncommon but those were  terrible moments and poor mrs fordyce was nearly dead with  suppressed terror when her husband tried haranguing from an upper  window and was received with execrations and a volley of stones  while the glass crashed round him  at that instant the shouts turned to yells of dismay the sodiers  the sodiers  our party had found everything still and dark in the village for in  truth the men had hidden themselves  they were being too much  attached to their masters to join in the attack but were afraid of  being compelled to assist the rioters and not resolute enough  against their own class either to inform against them or oppose  them  through the midnightlike stillness of the street rose the tumult  around the rectory and by the light of a few lanterns and from the  upper windows they could see a mass of old hats smockfrocked  shoulders and the tops of bludgeons while at soonest sir george  eastwoods troop could not be expected for an hour or more  we must get to them somehow said my father and griff to one  another and griff added these rascals are arrant cowards and  they cant see the number of us  then before my father knew what he was aboutcertainly before he  could get hold of the riot acthe found the stable lantern made  over to him and griffs sword flashing in light as making all  possible clatter and jingling with their accoutrements the two  yeomen dashed among the throng shouting with all their might and  striking with the flat of their swords  the rioters illfed dull hearted men for the most partmany dragged out by compulsion and  already terrifiedwent tumbling over one another and running off  headlong bearing off with them as we afterwards learnt their  leaders by their weight taking the blows and pushes they gave one  another in their pellmell rush for those of the soldiery and  falling blindly against the low wall of the enclosure  the only  difficulty was in clearing them out at the two gates of the drive  when mr fordyce opened the door to hail his rescuers he was utterly  amazed to behold only three and asked in a bewildered voice where  are the others  there were two prisoners petty the ratcatcher who had attempted  some resistance and had been knocked down by griffs horse and a  young lad in a smockfrock who had fallen off the wall and hurt his  knee and who blubbered piteously declaring that them chaps had  forced him to go with them or they would duck him in the horse pond  they were supposed to be given in charge to some one but  were lost sight of and no wonder  for just then it was discovered  that the machine shed was on fire  the rioters had apparently  detached one of their number to kindle the flame before assaulting  the house  the matter was specially serious because the stackyard  was on a line with the rectory at some distance indeed but on  lower ground and what with barns hay and wheat ricks sheds  cowhouses and stables all thatched a big woodpile and a long  oldfashioned greenhouse there was almost continuous communication   clouds of smoke and an ominous smell were already perceptible on the  wind generated by the heat and the loose straw in the centre of  the farmyard was beginning to be ignited by the flakes and sparks  carrying the mischief everywhere and rendering it exceedingly  difficult to release the animals and drive them to a place of  safety  water was scarce  there were only two wells besides the  pump in the house and a shallow pond  the brook was a quarter of a  mile off in the valley and the nearest engine a poor feeble thing  at wattlesea  moreover the assailants might discover how small was  the force of rescuers and return to the attack  thus while griff  who had given amateur assistance at all the fires he could reach in  london was striving to organise resistance to this new enemy my  father induced the gentlemen to cause the horses to be put to the  various vehicles and employ them in carrying the women and children  to chantry house  the old rector was persuaded to go to take care  of his daughterinlaw and she only thought of putting her girls in  safety  she listened to reason and indeed was too much exhausted  to move when once she was laid on the sofa  she would not hear of  going to bed though her little daughter anne was sent off with her  nurse grandpapa persuading her that rosella and the others were  very much tired  when she was gone he declared his fears that he  had sat down on celestinas head and showed so much compunction  that we were much amused at his relief when martyn assured him of  having searched the carriage with a stable lantern so that whatever  had befallen the lady he was not the guilty person  he really  seemed more concerned about this than at the loss of all his own  barns and stores  and little anne was certainly as lovely and  engaging a little creature as ever i saw while as to her elder  sister in all the trouble and anxiety of the night i could not  help enjoying the sight of her beautiful eager face and form  she  was tall and very slight sylphlike as it was the fashion to call  it but every limb was instinct with grace and animation  her face  was perhaps rather too thin for robust health though this  enhanced the idea of her being all spirit as also did the  transparency of complexion tinted with an exquisite varying  carnation  her eyes were of a clear bright rather light brown  and were sparkling with the lustre of excitement her delicate lips  parted showing the pretty pearly teeth as she was telling emily  in a low voice of enthusiasm scarcely designed for my ears how  glorious a sight our brother had been riding there in his glancing  silver bearing down all before him with his good sword like the  captal de buch dispersing the jacquerie  to which emily responded oh dont you love the captal de buch   and their friendship was cemented  next i heard and that you should have been so good after all my  rudeness  but i thought you were like the old winslows and instead  of that you have come to the rescue of your enemies  isnt it  beautiful  oh no not enemies said emily  that was all over a hundred  years ago  so my papa and grandpapa say returned miss fordyce but the last  mr winslow was not a very nice man and never would be civil to  us  a report was brought that the glare of the fire could be seen over  the hill from the top of the house and off went the two young  ladies to the leads after satisfying themselves that anne was  asleep among her homeless dolls  old mr fordyce devoted himself to keeping up the spirits of his  daughterinlaw as the night advanced without any tidings except  that the girls from time to time rushed down to tell us of fresh  outbursts of red flame reflected in the sky then that the glow was  diminishing by which time they were tired out and both sinking  into a big armchair they went to sleep in each others arms   indeed i believe we all dozed more or less before any one returned  from the scene of actionat about three oclock  the struggle with the flames had been very unequal  the long  tongues soon reached the roof of the large barn which was filled  with straw nor could the flakes of burning thatch be kept from the  stable while the water of the pond was soon reduced to mud   helpers began to flock in but who could tell which were  trustworthy and all were uncomprehending  there was so little hope of saving the house that the removal of  everything valuable was begun under my fathers superintendence   frank fordyce was here there and everywhere while griffith like  a gallant general fought the foe with very helpless unmanageable  forces  villagers male and female had emerged and stood gaping  round but let him rage and storm as he might they would not go  and collect pails and buckets and form a line to the brook  still  less would they assist in overthrowing and carrying away the faggots  of a big woodpile so as to cut off the communication with the  offices  only chapman and one other man gave any help in this and  presently the stack caught and griff on the top was in great  peril of the faggots rolling down with him into the middle and  imprisoning him in the blazing pile  i never felt so like dido  said griff  that woodstack gave fearful aliment to the roaring flame which came  on so fast that the destruction of the adjoining buildings quickly  followed  the wattlesea engine had come but the yard well was  unattainable and all that could be done was to saturate the house  with water from its own well and cover the side with wet blankets  but these reeked with steam and then shrivelled away in the intense  glow of heat  however by this time the eastwood yeomanry together with some  reasonable men had arrived  a raid was made on the cottages for  buckets a chain formed to the river and at last the fire was got  under having made a wreck of everything outofdoors and consumed  one whole wing of the house though the older and more esteemed  portion was saved    chapter xviiithe portrait    when day was gone and night was come    and all men fast asleep there came the spirit of fair margret    and stood at williams feet  scotch ballad  when i emerged from my room the next morning the phaeton was at the  door to take the two clergymen to reconnoitre their abode before  going to church  miss fordyce went with them and my father was for  once about to leave his parish church to give them his sympathy and  join in their thanksgiving that neither life nor limb had been  injured  he afterwards said that nothing could have been more  touching than old mr fordyces manner of mentioning this special  cause for gratitude before the general thanksgiving and frank  fordyce having had all his sermons burnt gave a short address  extempore a very rare and almost shocking thing at that date  reducing half the congregation to tears for they really loved the  famly though they had not spirit enough to defend it and their  passiveness always remained a subject of pride and pleasure to the  fordyces  it was against the will of these good people that petty  the ratcatcher was arrested but he had been engaged in other  outrages though this was the only one in which a dwellinghouse had  suffered  and chapman observed that there was nothing to be done  with such chaps but to string em up out of the way  griff had toiled that night till he was as stiff as a rheumatic old  man when he came down only just in time for luncheon  mrs fordyce  did not appear at all  she was a fragile creature and quite  knocked up by the agitations of the night  the gentlemen had  visited the desolate rectory and found that though the fine ancient  kitchen had escaped the pleasant living rooms had been injured by  the water and the place could hardly be made habitable before the  spring  they proposed to take a house in bath whence frank fordyce  could go and come for sunday duty and general superintendence but  my parents were urgent that they should not leave us until after  christmas and they consented  their larger possessions were to be  stored in the outhouses their lesser in our house notably in the  inner mullion chamber which would thus be so blocked that there  would be no question of sleeping in it  old mr fordyce had ascertained that he might acquit himself of  smashing celestina mary for no remains appeared in the carriage  but a miserable trunk was discovered in the ruins which he  identifiedthough surely no one else save the disconsolate parent  could have done so  poor little annes private possessions had  suffered most severely of all for her whole nursery establishment  had vanished  her surviving dolls were left homeless and devoid of  all save their nightclothing which concerned her much more than  the loss of almost all her own garments  for what dolls were to her  could never have been guessed by us who had forced emily to disdain  them whereas they were children to the maternal heart of this  lonely child  she was quite a new revelation to us  all the fordyces were  handsome and her chestnut curls and splendid eyes her pretty  colour and unconscious grace were very charming  emily was so near  our own age that we had never known the winsomeness of a little  maidchild amongst us and she was a perpetual wonder and delight to  us  indeed from having always lived with her elders she was an odd  little oldfashioned person advanced in some ways and comically  simple in others  her dollheart was kept in abeyance all sunday  and it was only on monday that her anxiety for celestina manifested  itself with considerable vehemence but her grandfather gravely  informed her that the young lady was gone to an excellent doctor  who would soon effect a cure  the which was quite true for he had  sent her to a toyshop by one of the maids who had gone to restore  the ravage on the wardrobes and who brought her back with a new  head and arms her identity apparently not being thus interfered  with  the hoards of scraps were put under requisition to reclothe  the survivors and i won my first step in miss annes good graces by  undertaking a knitted suit for rosella  the good little girl had evidently been schooled to repress her  dread and repugnance at my unlucky appearance and was painfully  polite only shutting her eyes when she came to shake hands with me  but after rosella condescended to adopt me we became excellent  friends  indeed the following conversation was overheard by emily  and set down  do you know martyn theres a fairies ring on hillside down  mushrooms quoth martyn  yes dont you know  they are the fairies tables  they come out  and spread them with lily tablecloths at night and have acorn cups  for dishes with honey in them  and they dance and play there   well couldnt mr edward go and sit under the beechtree at the  edge till they come  i dont think he would like it at all said martyn  he never  goes out at odd times  oh but dont you know when they come they begin to sing    sunday and monday monday and tuesday   and if he was to sing nicely   wednesday and thursday   they would be so much pleased that they would make his back straight  again in a moment  at least perhaps wednesday and thursday would  not do because the little tailor taught them those but friday  makes them angry  but suppose he made some nice verse    monday and tuesday the fairies are gay tuesday and wednesday they dance away   i think that would do as well perhaps  do get him to do so  martyn  it would be so nice if he was tall and straight  dear little thing  martyn who was as much her slave as was her  grandfather absolutely made her shed tears over his history of our  accident and then caressed them off but i believe he persuaded her  that such a case might be beyond the fairies reach and that i  could hardly get to the spot in secret which it seems is an  essential point  he had imagination enough to be almost persuaded  of fairyland by her earnestness and she certainly took him into  dollland  he had a turn for carpentry and contrivance and he  undertook that the ladies rosella etc should be better housed  than ever  a great packingcase was routed out and much ingenuity  was expended much delight obtained in the process of converting it  into a dolls mansion and replenishing it with furniture  some was  bought but martyn aspired to make whatever he could i did a good  deal and i believe most of our achievements are still extant   whatever we could not manage clarence was to accomplish when he  should come home  his arrival was as usual late in the evening and as before he  had the little room within mine  in the morning as we were  crossing the hall to the bright wood fire around which the family  were wont to assemble before prayers he came to a pause asking  under his breath whats that  whos that  it is one of the hillside pictures  you know we have a great many  things here from thence  it is she he said in a low awestricken voice  no need to say  who she meant  i had not paid much attention to the picture  it had come with  several more such as are rife in country houses and was one of the  worst of the lot a poor imitation of lelys style with a certain  air common to all the family but clarences eyes were riveted on  it  she looks younger he said but it is the same  i could  swear to the lip and the whole shape of the brow and chin  nothe  dress is different  for in the portrait there was nothing on the head and one long  lock of hair fell on the shoulder of the lowcut whitesatin dress  done in very heavy gray shading  the three girls came down  together and i asked who the lady was  dont you know  you ought for that is poor margaret who married  your ancestor  no more was said then for the rest of the world was collecting and  then everybody went out their several ways  some tin tacks were  wanted for the dolls house and there were reports that wattlesea  possessed a dolls grate and fireirons  the children were wild to  go in quest of them but they were not allowed to go alone and it  was pronounced too far and too damp for the elder sister so that  they would have been disappointed if clarencestimulated by  martyns kicks under the tablehad not offered to be their escort   when mrs fordyce demurred my mother replied you may perfectly  trust her with clarence  yes i dont know a safer squire rejoined my father  commendation was so rare that clarence quite blushed with pleasure  and the pretty little thing was given into his charge prancing and  dancing with pleasure and expecting much more from sixpence and  from wattlesea than was likely to be fulfilled  griff went out shooting and the two young ladies and i intended to  spend a very rational morning in the bookroom reading aloud mme de  la rochejaqueleins memoirs by turns  our occupations were on  emilys part completing a reticule in a mosaic of shaded coloured  beads no bigger than pins heads for a christmas gift to mammaa  most wearisome business of which she had grown extremely tired   miss fordyce was elaborately copying our mullers print of  raffaelles st john in pencil on cardboard so as to be as near as  possible a facsimile and she had trusted me to make a finished  watercoloured drawing from a rough sketch of hers of the hillside  barn and farmbuildings now no more  in a pause ellen fordyce suddenly asked what did you mean about  that picture  only clarence said it was like and here emily came to a dead  stop  grandpapa says it is like me said miss fordyce  what you dont  mean that  oh oh oh is it true  does she walk  have you seen  her  mamma calls it all nonsense and would not have anne hear of  it for anything but old aunt peggy used to tell me and i am sure  grandpapa believes it just a little  have you seen her  only clarence has and he knew the picture directly  she was much impressed and on slight persuasion related the story  which she had heard from an elder sister of her grandfathers and  which had perhaps been the more impressed on her by her mothers  consternation at such folly having been communicated to her  aunt  peggy who was much older than her brother had died only four years  ago at eightyeight having kept her faculties to the last and  handed down many traditions to her greatniece  the old ladys  father had been contemporary with the margaret of ghostly fame so  that the stages had been few through which it had come down from  1708 to 1830  i wrote it down at once as it here stands  margaret was the only daughter of the elder branch of the fordyces   her father had intended her to marry her cousin the male heir on  whom the hillside estates and the advowson of that living were  entailed but before the contract had been formally made the father  was killed by accident and through some folly and ambition of her  mothers such seemed to be the fordyce belief the poor heiress  was married to sir james winslow one of the successful intriguers  of the days of the later stewarts and with a family nearly as old  if not older than herself  her own children died almost at their  birth and she was left a young widow  being meek and gentle her  stepsons and daughters still ruled over chantry house  they  prevented her hillside relations from having access to her whilst in  a languishing state of health and when she died unexpectedly she  was found to have bequeathed all her property to her stepson  philip winslow instead of to her blood relations the fordyces  this was certain but the fordyce tradition was that she had been  kept shut up in the mullion chambers where she had often been heard  weeping bitterly  one night in the winter when the gentlemen of  the family had gone out to a christmas carousal she had endeavoured  to escape by the steps leading to the garden from the door now  bricked up but had been met by them and dragged back with violence  of which she died in the course of a few days and what was very  suspicious she had been entirely attended by her stepdaughter and  an old nurse who never would let her own woman come near her  the fordyces had thought of a prosecution but the winslows had  powerful interest at court in those corrupt times and contrived to  hush up the matter as well as to win the suit in which the fordyces  attempted to prove that there was no right to will the property  away  bitter enmity remained between the families they were always  opposed in politics and their animosity was fed by the belief which  arose that at the anniversaries of her death the poor lady haunted  the rooms lamp in hand wailing and lamenting  a duel had been  fought on the subject between the heirs of the two families  resulting in the death of the young winslow  and now cried ellen fordyce the feud is so beautifully ended  the doom must be appeased now that the head of one hostile line has  come to the rescue of the other and saved all our lives  my suggestion that these would hardly have been destroyed even  without our interposition fell very flat for romance must have its  swing  ellen told us how on the news of our kinsmans death and  our inheritance the ancestral story had been discussed and her  grandfather had said he believed there were letters about it in the  iron deedbox and how he hoped to be on better terms with the new  heir  the ghost story had always been hushed up in the family especially  since the duel and we all knew the resemblance of the picture would  be scouted by our elders but perhaps this gave us the more pleasure  in dwelling upon it while we agreed that poor margaret ought to be  appeased by griffiths prowess on behalf of the fordyces  the two young ladies went off to inspect the mullion chamber which  they found so crammed with hillside furniture that they could  scarcely enter and returned disappointed except for having  inspected and admired all griffs weapons especially what miss  fordyce called the sword of her rescue  she had been learning germanrather an unusual study in those days  and she narrated to us most effectively the story of die weisse  frau working herself up to such a pitch that she would have  actually volunteered to spend a night in the room to see whether  margaret would hold any communication with a descendant after the  example of the white woman and lady bertha if there had been either  fire or accommodation and if the only entrance had not been through  griffs private sittingroom    chapter xixthe white feather    the white does milk is not out of his mouth  scott  clarence had come home free from all blots  his summer holiday had  been prevented by the illness of one of the other clerks whose  place mr castleford wrote he had so well supplied that ere long  he would be sure to earn his promotion  that kind friend had  several times taken him to spend a sunday in the country and as we  afterwards had reason to think would have taken more notice of him  but for the rooted belief of mr frith that it was a case of  favouritism and that piety and strictness were assumed to throw  dust in the eyes of his patron  such distrust had tended to render clarence more reserved than ever  and it was quite by the accident of finding him studying one of mrs  trimmers manuals that i discovered that at the request of his good  rector he had become a sundayschool teacher and was as much  interested as the enthusiastic girls but i was immediately  forbidden to utter a word on the subject even to emily lest she  should tell any one  such reserve was no doubt an outcome of his natural timidity  he  had to bear a certain amount of scorn and derision among some of his  fellowclerks for the stricter habits and observances that could not  be concealed and he dreaded any fresh revelation of them partly  because of the cruel imputation of hypocrisy partly because he  feared the bringing a scandal on religion by his weakness and  failures  nor did our lady visitors ways reassure him though they meant to  be kind  they could not help being formal and stiff not as they  were with griff and me  the two gentlemen were thoroughly friendly  and hearty parson frank could hardly have helped being so towards  any one in the same house with himself and as to little anne she  found in the newcomer a carpenter and upholsterer superior even to  martyn but her candour revealed a great deal which i overheard one  afternoon when the two children were sitting together on the  hearthrug in the bookroom in the twilight  i want to see mr clarences white feather observed anne  griff has a white plume in his yeomanry helmet replied martyn  clarence hasnt one  oh i saw mr griffiths she answered but cousin horace said  mr clarence showed the white feather  cousin horace is an ape cried martyn  i dont think he is so nice as an ape said anne  he is more  like a monkey  he tries the dolls by courtmartial and he shot  arabella with a peashooter and broke her eye only grandpapa made  him have it put in again with his own money and then he said i was  a little sneak and if i ever did it again he would shoot me  mind you dont tell clarence what he said said martyn  oh no  i think mr clarence very nice indeed but horace did  tease so about that day when he carried poor amos bell home  he  said ellen had gone and made friends with the worst of all the  wicked winslows who had shown the white feather and disgraced his  flag  no i know you are not wicked  and mr griff came all  glittering like richard coeur de lion and saved us all that night   but ellen cried to think what she had done and mamma said it showed  what it was to speak to a strange young man and she has never let  ellen and me go out of the grounds by ourselves since that day  it is a horrid shame exclaimed martyn that a fellow cant get  into a scrape without its being for ever cast up to him  i like him said anne  he gave mary bell a nice pair of boots  and he made a new pair of legs for poor old arabella and she can  really sit down  oh he is very nice butin an awful whisper does he tell stories  i mean fibsfalsehoods  who told you that exclaimed martyn  mamma said it  ellen was telling them something about the picture  of the whitesatin lady and mamma said oh if it is only that  young man no doubt it is a mere mystification and papa said  poor young fellow he seems very amiable and well disposed and  mamma said if he can invent such a story it shows that horace was  right and he is not to be believed  then they stopped but i  asked ellen who it was and she said it was mr clarence and it was  a sad thing for emily and all of you to have such a brother  martyn began to stammer with indignation and i thought it time to  interfere so i called the little maid and gravely explained the  facts adding that poor clarences punishment had been terrible but  that he was doing his best to make up for what was past and that  as to anything he might have told though he might be mistaken he  never said anything now but what he believed to be true  she raised  her brown eyes to mine full of gravity and said i do like him   moreover i privately made martyn understand that if he told her  what had been said about the whitesatin lady he would never be  forgiven the others would be sure to find it out and it might  shorten their stay  that was a dreadful idea for the presence of those two creatures  to say nothing of their parents was an unspeakable charm and  novelty to us all  we all worshipped the elder and the little one  was like a new discovery and toy to us who had never been used to  such a presence  she was not a commonplace child but even if she  had been she would have been as charming a study as a kitten and  she had all the four of us at her feet though her mother was  constantly protesting against our spoiling her and really kept up  so much wholesome discipline that the little maid never exceeded the  bounds of being charming to us  after that explanation there was  the same sweet wistful gentleness in her manner towards clarence as  she showed to me while he who never dreamt of such a child knowing  his history was brighter and freer with her than with any one else  played with her and martyn and could be heard laughing merrily with  them  perhaps her mother and sister did not fully like this but  they could not interfere before our faces  and parson frank was  really kind to him took him out walking when going to hillside and  talked to him so as to draw him out certifying perhaps that he  would do no harm although indeed the family looked on dear good  frank as a sort of boy too kindhearted and genial for his approval  to be worth as much as that of the more severe  these were our only christmas visitors for the state of the country  did not invite londoners but we did not want them  the suppression  of clarence was the only flaw in a singularly happy time and after  all i believe i felt the pity of it more than he did who expected  nothing and was accustomed to being in the background  for instance one afternoon in the course of one of the grave  discussions that used to grow up between miss fordyce emily and  me over subjects trite to the betterinstructed younger generation  we got quite out of our shallow depths  i think it was on the  meaning of the communion of saints for the two girls were both  reading in preparation for a confirmation at bristol and miss  fordyce knew more than we did on these subjects  all the time  clarence had sat in the window carving a bit of dolls furniture  and quite forgotten but at night he showed me the exposition copied  from pearson on the creed a bit of hooker and extracts from one or  two sermons  i found these were notes written out in a blank book  which he had had in hand ever since his confirmationhis logbook as  he called it but he would not hear of their being mentioned even to  emily and only consented to hunt up the books on condition i would  not bring him forward as the finder  it was of no use to urge that  it was a deprivation to us all that he should not aid us with his  more thorough knowledge and deeper thought  he could not do so  he said in a quiet decisive manner it was enough for him to watch  and listen to miss fordyce when she could forget his presence  she often did forget it in her eagerness  she was by nature one of  the most ardent beings that i ever saw yet with enthusiasm kept in  check by the selfcontrol inculcated as a primary duty  it would  kindle in those wonderful light brown eyes glow in the clear  delicate cheek quiver in the voice even when the words were only  half adequate to the feeling  she was not what is now called  gushing  oh no not in the least  she was too reticent and had  too much dignity for anything of the kind  emily had always been  reckoned as our romantic young lady and teased accordingly but her  enthusiasm beside ellens was   as moonlight is to sunlight as water is to wine    a mere reflection of the tone of the period compared with a real  element in the character  at least so my sister tells me though at  the time all the difference i saw was that miss fordyce had the most  originality and unconsciously became the leader  the bookroom was  given up to us and there in the morning we drew worked read  copied and practised music wrote out extracts and delivered our  youthful minds to one another on all imaginable topics from slea  silk to predestination  religious subjects occupied us more than might have been held  likely  a spirit of reflection and revival was silently working in  many a heart  evangelicalism had stirred oldfashioned orthodoxy  and we felt its action  the christian year was ellens guiding  staras it was ours nay doubly so in proportion to the ardour of  her nature  certain poems are dearer and more eloquent to me still  because the verses recall to me the thrill of her sweet tones as she  repeated them  we were all very ignorant alike of church doctrine  and history but talking out and comparing our discoveries and  impressions was as useful as it was pleasant to us  what the christian year was in religion to us scott was in history   we read to verify or illustrate him and we had little raving fits  over his characters and jokes founded on them  indeed ellen saw  life almost through that medium and the siege of hillside  dispersed by the splendid prowess of griffith the champion with  silver helm and flashing sword was precious to her as a renewal of  the days of ivanhoe or damian de lacy  as may be believed these quiet mornings were those when that true  knight was employed in field sports or yeomanry duties such as the  state of the country called for  when he was at home all was fun  and merriment and noisewalks and rides on fine days battledore  and shuttlecock on wet ones music singing paper games giggling  and making giggle and sometimes dancing in the hallmr frank  fordyce joining with all his heart and drollery in many of these  like the boy he was  i could play quadrilles and country dances and now and then a reel nobody thought of waltzesand the three couples changed and  counterchanged partners  clarence had the sailors foot and did  his part when needed emily generally fell to his share and their  silence and gravity contrasted with the mirth of the other pairs   he knew very well he was the pis aller of the party and only danced  when parson frank was not dragged out nothing loth by his little  daughter  with miss fordyce clarence never had the chance of  dancing she was always claimed by griff or pounced upon by martyn  miss fordyce she always was to us in those days and those pretty  lips scrupulously mistered and winslowed us  i dont think she  would have been more to us if we had called her nell and had been  griff bill and ted to her or if there had not been all the little  formalities of avoiding tete a tetes and the like  they were  essentials of propriety thennatural and never viewed as prudish   nor did it detract from the sweet dignity of maidenhood that there  was none of the familiarity which breeds something one would rather  not mention in conjunction with a lady  altogether there was a sunshine around miss fordyce by which we all  seemed illuminated even the least favoured and least demonstrative  we were all her willing slaves and thought her smile and thanks  full reward  one day when griff and martyn were assisting at the turn out of an  isolated barn at hillside where frank fordyce declared all the  burntout rats and mice had taken refuge the young ladies went out  to cater for house decorations for christmas under clarences  escort  nobody but the clerk ever thought of touching the church  where there were holes in all the pews to receive the holly boughs  the girls came back telling in eager scared voices how while  gathering butchers broom in farmer hodges home copse a savage dog  had flown out at them but had been kept at bay by mr clarence  winslow with an umbrella while they escaped over the stile  clarence had not come into the drawingroom with them and while my  mother who had a great objection to people standing about in out door garments sent them up to doff their bonnets and furs i  repaired to our room and was horrified to find him on my bed white  and faint  bitten i cried in dismay  yes but not much  only im such a fool  i turned off when i  began taking off my boots  no nodont  dont call any one  it  is nothing  he was springing up to stop me but was forced to drop back and i  made my way to the drawingroom where my mother happened to be  alone  she was much alarmed but a glass of wine restored clarence  and inspection showed that the thick trowser and winter stocking had  so protected him that little blood had been drawn and there was  bruise rather than bite in the calf of the leg where the brute had  caught him as he was getting over the stile as the rearguard  it  was painful though the faintness was chiefly from tension of nerve  for he had kept behind all the way home and no one had guessed at  the hurt  my mother doctored it tenderly and he begged that  nothing should be said about it he wanted no fuss about such a  trifle  my mother agreed with the proud feeling of not enhancing  the obligations of the fordyce family but she absolutely kissed  clarences forehead as she bade him lie quiet till dinnertime  we kept silence at table while the girls described the horrors of  the monster  a tawny creature with a hideous black muzzle said  emily  like a bad dream said miss fordyce  the two fathers  expressed their intention of remonstrating with the farmer and  griff declared that it would be lucky if he did not shoot it  miss  fordyce generously took its part saying the poor dog was doing its  duty and griff ejaculated if i had been there  it would not have dared to show its teeth eh said my father  when there was a good deal of banter  my father however came at night with mamma to inspect the hurt and  ask details and he ended with well done clarence boy i am  gratified to see you are acquiring presence of mind and can act  like a man  clarence smiled when they were gone saying that would have been  an insult to any one else  emily perceived that he had not come off unscathed and was much  aggrieved at being bound to silence  well she broke out if the  dog goes mad and clarence has the hydrophobia i suppose i may  tell  in that pleasing contingency said clarence smiling  dont you  see emily it is the worst compliment you can pay me not to treat  this as a matter of course  still he was the happier for not  having failed  whatever strengthened his selfrespect and gave him  trust in himself was a steppingstone  as to rivalry or competition with griff the idea seemingly never  crossed his mind and envy or jealousy were equally aloof from it   one subject of thankfulness runs through these recollections namely that nothing broke the tie of strong affection between us  three brothers  griffith might figure as the vary parfite knight  the st george of the piece glittering in the halo shed round him  by the bright eyes of the rescued damsel while clarence might drag  himself along as the poor recreant to be contemned and tolerated  and he would accept the position meekly as only his desert without  a thought of bitterness  indeed he himself seemed to have imbibed  nurse goochs original opinion that his genuine love for sacred  things was a sort of impertinence and pretension in such as hea  kind of hypocrisy even when they were the realities and helps to  which he clung with all his heart  still this depression was only  shown by reserve and troubled no one save myself who knew him best  guessed what was lost by his silence and burned in spirit at seeing  him merely endured as one unworthy  in one of our varieties of waverley discussions the crystal hardness  and inexperienced intolerance of youth made miss fordyce declare  that had she been edith plantagenet she would never never have  forgiven sir kenneth  how could she when he had forsaken the  kings banner  unpardonable  then came a sudden awful silence as she recollected her audience  and blushed crimson with the misery of perceiving where her random  shaft had struck nor did either of us know what to say but to our  surprise it was clarence who first spoke to relieve the desperate  embarrassment  is forgiven quite the right word when the offence  was not personal  i know that such things can neither be repaired  nor overlooked and i think that is what miss fordyce meant  oh mr winslow she exclaimed i am very sorryi dont think i  quite meantand then as her eyes for one moment fell on his  subdued face she added no i said what i ought not  if there is  sorrowher voice trembledand pardon above no one below has any  right to say unpardonable  clarence bowed his head and his lips framed but he did not utter  thank you  emily nervously began reading aloud the page before  her full of the jingling recurring rhymes about sir thomas of kent  but i saw ellen surreptitiously wipe away a tear and from that time  she was more kind and friendly with clarence    chapter xxveni vidi vici    none but the brave none but the brave none but the brave deserve the fair  song  christmas trees were not yet heard of beyond the fatherland and  both the mothers held that christmas parties were not good for  little children since mrs winslows strong common sense had  arrived at the same conclusion as mrs fordyce had derived from  hannah more and richard lovell edgeworth  besides rickburning and  mobs were far too recent for our neighbours to venture out at night  but as we were all resolved that little anne should have a memorable  christmas at chantry house we begged an innocent though iced cake  from the cook painted a set of characters ourselves including all  the dolls and bespoke the presence of frank fordyce at a feast in  the outer mullion roomgriffs apartment of course  the locality  was chosen as allowing more opportunity for high jinks than the  bookroom and also because the swords and pistols in trophy over the  mantelpiece had a great fascination for the two sisters and to  drink tea with mr griffith was always known to be a great  ambition of the little queen of the festival  as to the mullion  chamber legends they had nearly gone out of our heads though  clarence did once observe you remember it will be the 26th of  december but we did not think this worthy of consideration  especially as annes entertainment at its latest could not last  beyond nine oclock and the ghostly performancesnow entirely laid  to the account of the departed stableboynever began before  eleven  nor did anything interfere with our merriment  the fun of fifty  years ago must be intrinsically exquisite to bear being handed down  to another generation so i will attempt no repetition though some  of those twelfth day characters still remain pasted into my diary   we anticipated twelfth day because our guests meant to go to visit  some other friends before the new year and we knew anne would have  no chance there of fulfilling her great ambition of drawing for king  and queen  these homemade characters were really charming  mrs  fordyce had done several of them and she drew beautifully  a  little manipulation contrived that the exquisite oberon and titania  should fall to martyn and anne for whom crowns and robes had been  prepared worn by her majesty with complacent dignity but barely  tolerated by him  the others took their chance  parson frank was  tom thumb and convulsed us all the evening by acting as if no  bigger than that worthy keeping us so merry that even clarence  laughed as i had never seen him laugh before  cock robin and jenny wrenthe best drawn of allfell to griff and  miss fordyce  there was a suspicion of a tint of real carnation on  her cheek as on his low highlydelighted bow she held up her  impromptu fan of folded paper and drollery about currant wine and  hopping upon twigs went on more or less all the time while somehow  or other the beauteous glow on her cheeks went on deepening so that  i never saw her look so pretty as when thus playing at jenny wrens  coyness though neither she nor griff had passed the bounds of her  gracious precise discretion  the joyous evening ended at last  with the stroke of nine jenny  wren bore away queen titania to put her to bed for the servants  were having an entertainment of their own downstairs for all the  outdoor retainers etc  oberon departed after an interval  sufficient to prove his own dignity and advanced age  emily went  down to report the success of the evening to the elders in the  drawingroom but we lingered while frank fordyce was telling good  stories of oxford life and griff capping them with more recent  ones  we too broke upi dont remember how but clarence was to help me  down the stairs and mr fordyce frowning with anxiety at the  process was offering assistance while we had much rather he had  gone out of the way when suddenly in the gallery round the hall  giving access to the bedrooms there dawned upon us the startled but  scarcely displeased figure of jenny wren in her white dress not  turning aside that blushing face while cock robin was clasping her  hand and pressing it to his lips  the tap of my crutches warned  them  she flew back within her door and shut it griff strode  rapidly on caught hold of her fathers hand exclaiming sir sir  i must speak to you and dragged him back into the mullion room  leaving clarence and me to convey ourselves downstairs as best we  might  our sister our sweet sister  we were immensely excited  all the three of us were so far in love  with ellen fordyce that her presence was an enchantment to us and  at any rate none of us ever saw the woman we could compare to her  and as we both felt ourselves disqualified in different ways from  any nearer approach we were content to bask in the reflected rays  of our brothers happiness  not that he had gone that length as yet as we knew before the night  was over when he came down to us  even with the dear maiden  herself he had only made sure that she was not averse and that  merely by her eyes and lips and he had extracted nothing from her  father but that they were both very young a great deal too young  and had no business to think of such things yet  it must be talked  over etc etc  but just then griff told us frank fordyce jumped up and turned  round with the sudden exclamation ellen looking towards the door  behind him with blank astonishment as he found it had neither been  opened nor shut  he thought his daughter had recollected something  left behind and coming in search of it had retreated  precipitately  he had seen her he said in the mirror opposite   griff told him there was no mirror and had to carry a candle across  to convince him that he had only been looking at the door into the  inner room which though of shining dark oak could hardly have made  a reflection as vivid as he declared that his had been  indeed he  ascertained that ellen had never left her own room at all  it must  have been thinking about the dear child he said  and after all  it was not quite like hersomehowshe was paler and had something  over her head  we had no doubt who it was  griff had not seen  her but he was certain that there had been none of the moaning nor  crying in fact she has come to give her consent he said with  earnest in his mocking tone  yes said clarence gravely and with glistening eyes  you are  happy griff  it is given to you to right the wrong and quiet that  poor spirit  happy  the happiest fellow in the world said griff even  without that latter clauseif only madam and the old man will have  as much sense as she has  the next day was a thoroughly uncomfortable one  griff was not half  so near his goal as he had hoped last night when with kindly parson  frank  the commotion was as if a thunderbolt had descended among the  elders  what they had been thinking of i cannot tell not to have  perceived how matters were tending but their minds were full of the  reform bill and the state of the country and besides we were all  looked on still as mere children  indeed griff was scarcely one andtwenty and ellen wanted a month of seventeen and the crisis  had really been a sudden impulse as he said she looked so sweet  and lovely he could not help it  the first effect was a serious lecture upon maidenliness and  propriety to poor ellen from her mother who was sure that she must  have transgressed the bounds of discretion or such illbred  presumption would have been spared her and bitterly regretted the  having trusted her to take care of herself  there were sufficient  grains of truth in this to make the poor girl cry herself out of all  condition for appearing at breakfast or luncheon and emilys report  of her despair made us much more angry with mrs fordyce than was  perhaps quite due to that good lady  my parents were at first inclined to take the same line and be  vexed with griff for an act of impertinence towards a guest  he had  a great deal of difficulty in inducing the elders to believe him in  earnest or treat him as a man capable of knowing his own mind and  even thus they felt as if his addresses to miss fordyce were under  present circumstances taking almost an unfair advantage of the  other familyat which our youthful spirits felt indignant  yet after all such a match was as obvious and suitable as if it  had been a family compact and the only objection was the youth of  the parties  mrs fordyce would fain have believed her daughters  heart to be not yet awake and was grieved to find childhood over  and the hero of romance become the lover and she was anxious that  full time should be given to perceive whether her daughters  feelings were only the result of the dazzling aureole which  gratitude and excited fancy had cast around the fine handsome  winning youth  her husband however who had himself married very  young and was greatly taken with griff besides being always  tenderhearted did not enter into her scruples but as we had  already found out the grandlooking and clever man of thirtyeight  was chiefly from his impulsiveness and goodnature treated as the  boy of the family  his old father too was greatly pleased with  griffs spirit affection and purpose as well as with my fathers  conduct in the matter and so after a succession of private  interviews very tantalising to us poor outsiders it was conceded  that though an engagement for the present was preposterous it might  possibly be permitted when ellen was eighteen if griff had completed  his university life with full credit  he was fervently grateful to  have such an object set before him and my father was warmly  thankful for the stimulus  that last evening was very odd and constrained  we could not help  looking on the lovers as new specimens over which some strange  transformation had passed though for the present it had stiffened  them in public into the strictest good behaviour  they would have  been awkward if it had been possible to either of them and save  for a certain look in their eyes comported themselves as perfect  strangers  the three elder gentlemen held discussions in the diningroom but  we were not trusted in our playground adjoining  mrs fordyce  nailed griff down to an interminable game at chess and my mother  kept the two girls playing duets while clarence turned over the  leaves and i read over the lady of the lake a study which i always  felt and still feel as an act of homage to ellen fordyce though  there was not much in common between her and the maid of douglas   indeed it was a joke of her fathers to tease her by criticising  the famous passage about the tears that old douglas shed over his  duteous daughters headwhat in the world should the man go  whining and crying for  he had much better have laughed with her  little did the elders know what was going on in the next room where  there was a grand courtship among the dolls the hero being a small  jointed dutch one in swiss costume about an eighth part of the size  of the resuscitated celestina mary but the only available male  character in dollland  anne was supposed to be completely ignorant  of what passed above her head and her mother would have been aghast  had she heard the remarkable discoveries and speculations that she  and martyn communicated to one another    chapter xxithe outside of the courtship    or framing as a fair excuse the book the pencil or the muse something to give to sing to say some modern tale some ancient lay  scott  it seems to me on looking back that i have hardly done justice to  mrs fordyce and certainly weas griffiths eager partisansoften  regarded her in the light of an enemy and opponent but after this  lapse of time i can see that she was no more than a prudent mother  unwilling to see her fair young daughter suddenly launched into  womanhood and involved in an attachment to a young and untried man  the part of a drag is an invidious one and this must have been her  part through most of her life  the fordyces father and son were  of good family gentlemen to their very backbones and thoroughly  good religious men but she came of a more aristocratic strain had  been in london society and brought with her a highbred air which  implanted on the fordyce good looks made her daughter especially  fascinating  but that air did not recommend mrs fordyce to all her  neighbours any more than did those stronger stricter more  thoroughgoing notions of religious obligation which had led her  husband to make the very real and painful sacrifice of his sporting  tastes and attend to the parish in a manner only too rare in those  days  she was a very wellinformed and highly accomplished woman  and had made her daughter the same keeping her children up in a  somewhat exclusive style away from all gossip or undesirable  intimacies as recommended by miss edgeworth and other more  religious authorities and which gave great offence in houses where  there were girls of the same age  no one however could look at  ellen and doubt of the success of the system or of the young  girls entire content and perfect affection for her mother though  her father was her beloved playfellowyet always with respect  she  never took liberties with him nor called him pap or any other  ridiculous name inconsistent with the fifth commandment though she  certainly was more entirely at ease with him than ever we had been  with our elderly father  when once mrs fordyce found on what terms  we were to be she accepted them frankly and fully  already emily  had been the first girl not a relation whose friendship she had  fostered with ellen and she had also become thoroughly affectionate  and at home with my mother who suited her perfectly on the  conscientious and likewise on the prudent and sensible side of her  nature  to me she was always kindness itself so kind that i never felt as  i did on so many occasions that she was very pitiful and attentive  to the deformed youth but that she really enjoyed my companionship  and i could help her in her pursuits  i have a whole packet of  charming notes of hers about books botany drawings little bits of  antiquarianism written with an arch grace and finish of expression  peculiarly her own and in a very pointed hand yet too definite to  be illegible  i owe her more than i can say for the windows of  wholesome hope and ambition she opened to me giving a fresh motive  and zest even to such a life as mine  i can hardly tell which was  the most delightful companion she or her husband  in spite of ill  health she knew every plant and every bit of fair scenery in the  neighbourhood and had fresh amusing criticisms to utter on each  new book while he not neglecting the books was equally well  acquainted with all beasts and birds and shed his kindly light over  everything he approached  he was never melancholy about anything  but politics and even there it was an immense consolation to him to  have the owner of chantry house staunch on the same side instead of  in chronic opposition  the family party moved to a tall house at bath but there still was  close intercourse for the younger clergyman rode over every week  for the sunday duty and almost always dined and slept at chantry  house  he acted as bearer of long letters which in spite of a  reticulation of crossings were too expensive by post for young  ladies pocketmoney often exceeding the regular quarto sheet  it  was a favourite joke to ask emily what ellen reported about bath  fashions and to see her look of scorn  for they were a curious  mixture those girlish letters of village interests discussion of  books and thoughts beyond their age tommy toogood and prometheus  or du guesclin in the closest juxtaposition with reports of progress  in abercrombie on the intellectual powers  it was the desire of  ellen to prove herself not unsettled but improved by love and to  become worthy of her ideal griffith never guessing that he would  have been equally content with her if she had been as frivolous as  the idlest girl who lingered amid the waning glories of bath  we all made them a visit there when martyn was taken to a  preparatory school in the place  mrs fordyce took me out for  drives on the beautiful hills and emily and i had a very delightful  time undisturbed by the engrossing claims of lovemaking  very  good too were our friends after our departure in letting martyn  spend sundays and holidays with them play with anne as before say  his catechism with her to mrs fordyce and share her little sunday  lessons which had he has since told a force and attractiveness he  had never known before and really did much young as he was in  preparing the way towards the fulfilment of my fathers design for  him  when the rectory was ready and the family returned it was high  summer and there were constant meetings between the households  no  doubt there were the usual amount of trivial disappointments and  annoyances but the whole season seems to me to have been bathed in  sunlight  the reform bill agitations and the london mobs of which  clarence wrote to us were like waves surging beyond an isle of  peace  clarence had some unpleasant walks from the office  once or  twice the shutters had to be put up at frith and castlefords to  prevent the windows from being broken and once clarence actually  saw our nations hero the duke riding quietly and slowly through  a yelling furious mob who seemed withheld from falling on him by  the perfect impassiveness of the eagle face and spare figure   moreover a pretty little boy on his pony suddenly pushed forward  and rode by the dukes side as if proud and resolute to share his  peril  if griffith had been there said ellen and emily though they did  not exactly know what they expected him to have done  the chief storms that drifted across our sky were caused by mrs  fordyces resolution that griffith should enjoy none of the  privileges of an accepted suitor before the engagement was an actual  fact  ellen was obedient and conscientious and would neither  transgress nor endure to have her mother railed at by griffs hasty  tongue and this affronted him and led to little breezes  when people overstay their usual time tempers are apt to get rather  difficult  griffith had kept all his terms at oxford and was not  to return thither after the long vacation but was to read with a  tutor before taking his degree  moreover bills began to come from  oxford not very serious but vexing my father and raising  annoyances and frets for griff resented their being complained of  and thought himself illused going off to see his own friends  whenever he was put out  one morning at breakfast late in october he announced that lady  peacock was in lodgings at clifton and asked my mother to call on  her  but mamma said it was too far for the horseshe visited no  one at that distance and had never thought much of selina clarkson  before or after her marriage  but now that she is a widow it would be such a kindness pleaded  griff  depend upon it a gay young widow needs no kindness from me and  had better not have it from you said my mother getting up from  behind her urn and walking off followed by my father  griff drummed on the table  i wonder what good ladies of a certain  age do with their charity he said  and while we were still crying out at him ellen fordyce and her  father appeared like mirth bidding goodmorrow at the window  all  was well for the time but griff wanted ellen to set out alone with  him and take their leisurely way through the woodpath and she  insisted on waiting for her father who had got into an endless  discussion with mine on the reform bill thrown out in the last  session  griff tried to wile her on with him but though she  consented to wander about the lawn before the windows with him she  always resolutely turned at the great beech tree  emily and i  watched them from the window at first amused then vexed as we  could see by his gestures that he was getting out of temper and  her straw bonnet drooped at one moment and was raised the next in  eager remonstrance or defence  at last he flung angrily away from  her and went off to the stables leaving her leaning against the  gate in tears  emily in an access of indignant sympathy rushed  out to her and they vanished together into the summerhouse until  her father called her and they went home together  emily told me that ellen had struggled hard to keep herself from  crying enough to show traces of tears which her father could  observe and that she had excused griff with all her might on the  plea of her own tiresomeness  we were all the more angry with him for his selfishness and want of  consideration for ellen in her torrent of grief had even  disclosed that he had said she did not care for himno one really  in love ever scrupled about a mothers nonsense etc etc  we were resolved like two sages to give him a piece of our minds  and convince him that such dutifulness was the pledge of future  happiness and that it was absolute cruelty to the rare creature he  had won to try to draw her in a direction contrary to her  conscience  however we saw him no more that day and only learnt that he had  left a message at the stables that dinner was not to be kept waiting  for him  such a message from clarence would have caused a great  commotion but it was quite natural and a matter of course from him  in the eyes of the elders who knew nothing of his parting with  ellen  however there was annoyance enough when bedtime came  family prayers were over and still there was no sign of him  my  father sat up till one oclock to let him in then gave it up and  i heard his step heavily mounting the stairs    chapter xxiibristol diamonds    stafford  and you that are the kings friends follow me  cade  and you that love the commons follow me we will not leave one lord one gentleman spare none but such as go in clouted shoon  act i  henry vi  the next day was sunday and no griff appeared in the morning   vexation perhaps prevented us from attending as much as we  otherwise might have done to mr henderson when he told us that  there were rumours of a serious disturbance at bristol until emily  recollected that griff had been talking for some days past of riding  over to see his friend in the cavalry regiment there stationed and  we all agreed that it was most likely that he was there and our  wrath began to soften in the belief that he might have been detained  to give his aid in the cause of order though his single arm could  not be expected to effect as much as at hillside  long after dark we heard a horses feet and in another minute  griff singed splashed and battered had hurried into the room it has begun he said  the revolution  i have brought herlady  peacock  she was at clifton dreadfully alarmed  she is almost at  the door now in her carriage  ill just take the pony and ride  over to tell eastwood in case he will call out the yeomanry  the wheels were to be heard and everybody hastened out to receive  lady peacock who was there with her maid full of gratitude  i  heard her broken sentences as she came across the hall about  dreadful scenesfrightful mobshe knew not what would have become  of her but for griffiththe place was in flames when they left it the military would not actgriffith had assured her that mr and  mrs winslow would be so kindas long as any place was a refuge  we really did believe we were at the outbreak of a revolution or  civil war and all little frets forgotten listened appalled to the  tidings how the appearance of sir charles wetherall the recorder  of bristol a strong opponent to the reform bill seemed to have  inspired the mob with fury  griff and his friend the dragoon while  walking in broad street were astonished by a violent rush of  riotous men and boys hooting and throwing stones as the recorders  carriage tried to make its way to the guildhall  in the midst a  piteous voice exclaimed   oh griffith  mr griffith winslow  is it you and lady peacock  was seen retreating upon the stone steps of a house either empty or  where the inhabitants were too much alarmed to open the doors  she  was terribly frightened and the two gentlemen stood in front of her  till the tumultuary procession had passed by  she was staying in  lodgings at clifton and had driven in to bristol to shop when she  thus found herself entangled in the mob  they then escorted her to  the place where she was to meet her carriage and found it for her  with some difficulty  then while the officer returned to his  quarters griff accompanied her far enough on the way to clifton to  see that everything was quiet before her and then returned to seek  out his friend  the court at the guildhall had had to be adjourned  but the rioters were hunting sir charles to the mansionhouse   griff was met by one of the town council a tradesman with whom we  dealt who having perhaps heard of his prowess at hillside  entreated him to remain offering him a bed and saying that all  friends of order were needed in such a crisis as this  griff wrote  a note to let us know what had become of him but everything was  disorganised and we did not get it till two days afterwards  in the evening the mob became more violent and in the midst of  dinner a summons came for griffs host to attend the mayor in  endeavouring to disperse it  getting into the mansionhouse by  private back ways they were able to join the mayor when he came  out amid a shower of brickbats sticks and stones and read the  riot act three times over after warning them of the consequences of  persisting in their defiance  but they were far past caring for that said griff  an iron rail  from the square was thrown in the midst of it and if i had not  caught it there would have been an end of his worship  the constables with such help as griff and a few others could give  them defended the front of the mansionhouse while the recorder  for whom they savagely roared made his escape by the roof to  another house  a barricade was made with beds tables and chairs  behind which the defenders sheltered themselves while volleys of  stones smashed in the windows and straw was thrown after them  but  at last the tramp of horses feet was heard and the dragoons came  up  we thought all over then said griff but colonel brereton would  not have a blow struck far less a shot fired  he would have it  that it was a goodhumoured mob  i heard him  when one of his own  men was brought up badly hurt with a brickbat i heard ludlow the  townclerk ask him what he thought of their good humour and he had  nothing to say but that it was an accident  and the rogues knew it   he took care they should he walked about among them and shook hands  with them  griff waited at the mansionhouse all night and helped to board up  the smashed windows but at daylight colonel brereton came and  insisted on withdrawing the piquet on guardnot however sending a  relief for them on the plea that they only collected a crowd  the  instant they were withdrawn down came the mob in fresh force so  desperate that all the defences were torn down and they swarmed in  so that there was nothing for it but to escape over the roofs  griffith was sent to rouse the inhabitants of college green and st  augustines back to come in the kings name to assist the  magistrates and he had many good stories of the various responses  he met with  but the rioters inflamed by the wine they had found  in sacking the mansionhouse and encouraged by the passiveness of  the troops had become entirely masters of the situation  and  colonel brereton seems to have imagined that the presence of the  soldiers acted as an irritation for in this crisis he actually sent  them out of the city to keynsham then came and informed the mob  who cheered him as well they might  in the night the recorder had left the city and notices were posted  to that effect also that the riot act had been read and any  further disturbance would be capital felony  this escape of their  victim only had the effect of directing the rage of the populace  against bishop grey who had likewise opposed the reform bill  messages had been sent to advise the bishop who was to preach that  day at the cathedral to stay away and sanction the omission of the  service but his answer to one of his clergy wasthese are times  in which it is necessary not to shrink from danger  our duty is to  be at our post  and he also said where can i die better than in  my own cathedral  since the bells were ringing and it was understood that the bishop  was actually going to dare the peril griff and others of the  defenders decided that it was better to attend the service and fill  up the nave so as to hinder outrage  he said it was a most strange  and wonderful service  chants and psalms and lessons and prayers  going on their course as usual but every now and then in the pauses  of the organ a howl or yell of the voice of the multitude would  break on the ear through the thick walls  griff listened and hoped  for a volley of musketry  he was not tenderhearted  but none  came and by the time the service was over the mob had been greatly  reinforced and had broken into the prisons set them on fire and  released the prisoners  they were mustering on college green for an  attack on the palace  griff aided in guarding the entrance to the  cloisters till the bishop and his family had had time to drive away  to almondsbury four miles off and then the rush became so strong  that they had to give way  there was another great struggle at the  door of the palace but it was forced open with a crowbar while  shouts rang out no king and no bishops  a fire was made in the  diningroom with chairs and tables and live coals were put into the  beds while the plunder went on  griff meantime had made his way to the party headed by the  magistrates and accompanied by the dragoons and the mob began to  flee but colonel brereton had given strict orders that the soldiers  should not fire and the plunderers rallied made a fire in the  chapter house and burnt the whole of the library shouting with the  maddest triumph  they next attacked the cathedral intending to burn that likewise  but two brave gentlemen mr ralph and mr linne succeeded in  saving this last outrage at the head of the better affected  griff had fought hard  he was all over bruises which he really had  never felt at the time scarcely even now though one side of his  face was turning purple and his clothes were singed  in a sort of  council held at the repulse of the attack on the cathedral it had  been decided that the best thing he could do would be to give notice  to sir george eastwood in order that the yeomanry might be called  out since the troops were so strangely prevented from acting  as  he rode through clifton he had halted at lady peacocks and found  her in extreme alarm  indeed no one could guess what the temper of  the mob might be the next day or whether they might not fall upon  private houses  the mansionhouse the prisons the palace were all  burning and were an astounding sight which terrified her  exceedingly and she was sending out right and left to endeavour to  get horses to take her away  in common humanity and for old  acquaintance sake it was impossible not to help her and griff had  delayed to offer any amount of reward in her name for posthorses  which he had at last secured  her own manservant whom she had  sent in quest of some had never returned and she had to set off  without him griff acting as outrider but after the first there was  no more difficulty about horses and she had been able to change  them at the next stage  we all thought the days of civil war were really begun as the heads  of this account were hastily gathered but there was not much said  only mr frank fordyce laid his hand on griffs shoulder and said  well done my boy but you have had enough for today  if youll  lend me a horse winslow ill ride over to eastwood  thats work  for the clergy in these times eh  griffith should rest  he may be  wanted tomorrow  only is there any one to take a note home for me  to say where im gone and then he added with that sweet smile of  his some one will be more the true knight than ever eh you  griffith you  griffith coloured a little and lady peacocks eyes looked  interrogative  when the horse was announced griff followed mr  fordyce into the hall and came back announcing that unless  summoned elsewhere he should go to breakfast at hillside and so  hear what was decided on  he longed to be back at the scene of  action but was so tired out that he could not dispense with another  nights rest though he took all precautions for being called up in  case of need  however nothing came and he rode to the rectory in yeomanry  equipment  nor could any one doubt that in the ecstasy of meeting  such a hero all the little misunderstanding and grief of the night  before was forgotten  ellen looked as if she trod on air when she  came down with her father to report that griffith had gone  according to the orders sent to join the rest of the yeomanry who  were to advance upon bristol  they had seen and tried to turn  back some of the villagers who were starting with bludgeons to  share in the spoil and who looked sullen as if they were  determined not to miss their share  i do not think we were very much alarmed for griffs safety or for  our own not even the ladies  my mother had the lionheart of her  naval ancestors and ellen was in a state of exaltation  would that  i could put her before other eyes as she stood with hands clasped  and glowing cheek  ohthinkthink of having one among us who is as real and true  knight as ever watched his armour    for king for church for lady fight it has all come gloriously true   should not you like to bind on his spurs i asked somewhat  mischievously but she was serious as she said i am sure he has  won them  all the rest of the fordyces came down afterwards too  anxious to stay at home  our elders felt the matter more gravely  thinking of what civil war might mean to us all and what an awful  thing it was for englishmen to be enrolled against each other   nottingham castle had just been burnt and things looked only too  like revolution especially considering the inaction of the  dragoons  after griff had left bristol there had been some  terrible scenes at the custom house where the ringleadersunhappy  menwere caught in a trap of their own and perished miserably  however by the morning the order sent from lord hill the arrival  of major beckwith from gloucester and the proceedings of the good humoured mob had put an end to poor breretons hesitations a  determined front had been shown the mob had been fairly broken up  troops from all quarters poured into the city and by dinnertime  griff came back with the news that all was quiet and there was  nothing more to fear  ellen and emily both flew out to meet him at  the first sound of the horses feet and they all came into the  drawingroom togethereach young lady having hold of one of his  handsand ellens face in such a glow that i rather suspect that  he had snatched a reward which certainly would not have been granted  save in such a moment of uplifted feeling and when she was thankful  to her hero for forgetting how angry he had been with her two days  before  minor matters were forgotten in the details of his tidings as he  stood before the fire shining in his silver lace and relating the  tragedy and the comedy of the scene  it was curious as the evening passed on to see how ellen and lady  peacock regarded each other now that the tension of suspense was  over  to ellen the guest was primarily a distressed and widowed  dame delivered by griff to whom she as his lady love was bound  to be gracious and kind nor had they seen much of one another the  elder ladies sitting in the drawingroom and we in our own regions  but we were all together at dinner and afterwards and lady peacock  who had been in a very limp nervous and terrified state all day  began to be the selina clarkson we remembered and more too  she  was still in mourning but she came down to dinner in gray satin  sheen and with her hair in a most astonishing erection of bows and  bands on the very crown of her head raising her height at least  four inches  emily assures me that it was the mode in use and that  she and ellen wore their hair in the same style appealing to  portraits to prove it  i can only say that they never astonished my  weak mind in the like manner and that their heads however dressed  only appeared to me a portion of the general woman and part of the  universal fitness of things  ellen was likewise amazed most likely  not at the hair but at the transformation of the disconsolate  frightened widow into the handsome fashionable stylish lady  talking over london acquaintance and london news with my father and  griff whenever they left the endless subject of the bristol  adventures  the widow had gained a good deal in beauty since her early girlhood  having regular features eyes of an uncommon deep blue very black  brows eyelashes and hair and a form of the kind that is better  after early youth is over  a fine figure of a woman parson frank  pronounced her and his wife with the fine edge of her lips  replied exactly what she is  she looked upon us younger ones as mere children stillindeed she  never looked at me at all if she could help itbut she mortally  offended emily by penning her up in a corner and asking if griff  were engaged to that sentimental little girl  emily coloured like a turkey cock between wrath and embarrassment  and hotly protested against the word sentimental  ah yes i see she said in a patronising tone she is your bosom  friend eh  thats the way those things always begin  you need not  answer  i see it all  and no doubt it is a capital thing for him  properties joining and all  and she will get a little air and style  when he takes her to london  it was a tremendous offence even to  hint that ellens style was capable of improvement perhaps an  unprejudiced eye would have said that the difference was between  highbred simplicity and the air of fashion and society  in our eyes lady peacock was the companion of the elders and as  such was appreciated by the gentlemen but neither of the two  mothers was equally delighted with her nor was mine at all sorry  when on tuesday the boxes were packed posthorses sent for and my  lady departed with great expressions of thankfulness to us all  a tulip to a jessamine muttered griff as she drove off and he  looked up at his ellens sweet refined face  the unfortunate colonel brereton put an end to himself when the  courtmartial was half over  how clarence was shocked and how  ardent was his pity  but griffith received the thanks of the  corporation of bristol for his gallant conduct when the special  assize was held in january  mrs fordyce was almost as proud of him  as we were and there was much less attempt at restraining the terms  on which he stood with ellenthough still the formal engagement was  not permitted    chapter xxiiiquicksands       whither shall i go where shall i hide my forehead and my eyes  tennyson  it was in the may of the ensuing year 1832 that clarence was sent  down to bristol for a few weeks to take the place of one of the  clerks in the office where the cargoes of the incoming vessels of  the firm were received and overhauled  this was a goodnatured arrangement of mr castlefords in order to  give him change of work and a sight of home where by the help of  the coach he could spend his sundays  that first spring day on his  way down was a great delight and even surprise to him who had never  seen our profusion of primroses cowslips and bluebells nor our  splendid blossom of treesapple lilac laburnumall vieing in  beauty with one another  emily conducted him about in great  delight taking him over to hillside to see mrs fordyces american  garden blazing with azaleas and glowing with rhododendrons  he  came back with a great bouquet given to him by ellen who had been  unusually friendly with him and he was more animated and full of  life than for years before  next time he came he looked less happy  there was plenty of room in  our house but he used by preference the little chamber within  mine and there at night he asked me to lend him a few pounds since  griffith had written one of his offhand letters asking him to  discharge a little bill or two at bristol giving the addresses but  not sending the accounts  this was no wonder since any enclosure  doubled the already heavy postage  one of these bills was for some  sporting equipments from the gunsmiths another much heavier from  a tavern for breakfasts or rather luncheons to parties of  gentlemen mostly bearing date in the summer and autumn of 1830  before the friendship with the fordyces had begun  on clarences  defraying the first and applying for the second two more had come  in one from a jeweller for a pair of dropearrings the other from  a nurseryman for a bouquet of exotics  doubting of these two last  clarence had written to griff but had not yet received an answer   the whole amount was so much beyond what he had been led to expect  that he had not brought enough money to meet it and wanted an  advance from me promising repayment to which latter point i could  not assent as both of us knew but did not say we should never see  the sum again and to me it only meant stinting in new books and  curiosities  we were anxious to get the matter settled at once as  griffith spoke of being dunned and it might be serious if the  tradesmen applied to my father when he was still groaning over  revelations of college expenses  on the ensuing saturday clarence showed me griffs answeri had  forgotten these items  the earrings were a wedding present to the  pretty little barmaid who had been very civil  the bouquet was for  lady peacock i felt bound to do something to atone for mammas  severe virtue  it is all right you best of brothers  it was consolatory that all the dates were prior to the hillside  fire except that of the bouquet  as to the earrings we all knew  that griff could not see a pretty girl without talking nonsense to  her  anyway if they were a wedding present there was an end of  it and we were only glad to prevent any hint of them from reaching  the ears of the authorities  clarence had another trouble to confide to me  he had strong reason  to believe that tooke the managing clerk at bristol was carrying  on a course of peculation and feathering his nest at the expense of  the firm  what a grand discovery thought i for such a youth to  have made  the firm would be infinitely obliged to him and his  fortune would be secured  he shook his head and said that was all  my ignorance the man tooke was greatly trusted especially by mr  frith the senior partner and was so clever and experienced that it  would be almost impossible to establish anything against him   indeed he had browbeaten clarence and convinced him at the moment  that his suspicions and perplexities were only due to the ignorance  of a foolish scrupulous youth who did not understand the customs  and perquisites of an agency  it was only when clarence was alone  and reflected on the matter by the light of experience gained on a  similar expedition to liverpool that he had perceived that mr  tooke had been throwing dust in his eyes  i shall only get into a scrape myself said clarence despondently   i have felt it coming ever since i have been at bristol and he  pushed his hair back with a weary hopeless gesture  but you dont mean to let it alone i cried indignantly  he hesitated in a manner that painfully recalled his failing and  said at last i dont know i suppose i ought not  suppose i cried  it is not so easy as you think he answered especially for one  who has forfeited the right to be believed  i must wait till i have  an opportunity of speaking to mr castleford and then i can hardly  do more than privately give him a hint to be watchful  you dont  know how things are in such houses as ours  one may only ruin  oneself without doing any good  you cannot write to him  certainly not  he has taken his family to mrs castlefords home  in the north of ireland for a month or six weeks  i dont know the  address and i cannot run the risk of the letter being opened at the  office  cant you speak to my father  impossible it would be a betrayal  he would do things for which i  should never be forgiven  and after all remember it is no  business of mine  i know of agents at the docks who do such things  as a matter of course  it is only that i happen to know that harris  at liverpool does not  very possibly old frith knows all about it   i should only get scored down as a meddlesome prig worse hypocrite  than they think me already  he said a good deal more to this effect and i remember exclaiming  oh clarence the old story and then being frightened at the  whiteness that came over his face  little did i know the suffering to which those words of mine  condemned him  for not only had he to make up his mind to  resistance which to his nature was infinitely worse than it was to  griffith to face a raging mob but he knew very well that it would  almost inevitably produce his own ruin and renew the disgrace out  of which he was beginning to emerge  i did noteven while i prayed  that he might do the rightguess at his own agony of supplication  carried on incessantly day and night sleeping and waking that the  holy spirit of might should brace his will and govern his tongue  and make him say the right thing at the right time be the  consequences what they might  no one not constituted as he was  can guess at the anguish he endured  i knew no more  clarence did  not come home the next saturday to my mothers great vexation but  on tuesday a small parcel was given to me brought from our point of  contact with the bristol coach  it contained some pencils i had  asked him to get and a note marked private  here it is    dear edwardi am summoned to town  tooke has no doubt forestalled  me  we have had some curious interviews in which he first as i  told you persuaded me out of my senses that it was all right and  then finding me still dissatisfied tried in a delicate fashion to  apprise me that i had a claim to a share of the plunder  when i  refused to appropriate anything without sanction from headquarters  he threatened me with the consequences of presumptuous interference   it came to bullying at last  i hardly know what i answered but i  dont think i gave in  now a sharp letter from old frith recalls  me  say nothing at home and whatever you do do not betray griff   he has more to lose than i  help me in the true way as you know  however yours w c w   i need not dwell on the misery of those days  it was well that my  father had ruled that our letters should not be family property   here were all the others discussing a proposed tour in the north of  devon to be taken conjointly with the fordyces as soon as griff  should come home  my mother said it would do me good she saw i was  flagging but she little guessed at the continual torment of  anxiety and my wonder at the warning about griff  at the end of the week came another letter   you need not speak yet  papa and mamma will know soon enough  i  brought down 150 pounds in specie to be paid over to tooke  he  avers that only 130 pounds was received  what is my word worth  against his  i am told that if i am not prosecuted it will only be  out of respect to my father  i am not dismissed yet but shall get  notice as soon as letters come from ireland  i have written but it  is not in the nature of things that mr castleford should not accept  such proofs as have been sent him  i have no hope and shall be  glad when it is over  the part of black sheep is not a pleasant  one  say not a word and do not let my father come up  he could do  no good and to see him believing it all would be the last drop in  the bucket  nbin this pass nothing would be saved by bringing griff into  it so be silent on your life  innocence does not seem to be much  comfort at present  maybe it will come in time  i know you will  not drop me dear ted wherever i may be   need i tell the distress of those days of suspense and silence when  my only solace was in being left alone and in writing letters to  clarence which were mostly torn up again  my horror was lest he should be driven to go off to the sea which  he loved so well knowing as nobody else did the longing that  sometimes seized him for it a hereditary craving that curiously  conflicted with the rest of his disposition and indeed his lack  was more of moral than of physical courage  it haunted me  constantly that his entreaty that my father should not come to  london was a bad sign and that he would never face such another  return home  and was i justified in keeping all this to myself  when my fathers presence might save him from the flight that would  indeed be the surrender of his character and to the life of a  common sailor  never have i known such leaden days as these yet  the misery was not a tithe of what clarence was undergoing  i was right in my forebodings  prosecution and a second return home  in shame and disgrace were alike hideous to clarence and the  present was almost equally terrible for nobody at the office had  any doubt of his guilt and the young men who had sneered at his  strictness and religious habits regarded him as an unmasked  hypocrite only waiting on sufferance till his greatly deceived  patron should write to decide on the steps to be taken with him  while he knew he was thought to be brazening it out in hopes of  again deceiving mr castleford  the sea began to exert its power over him and he thought with  longing of its freedom as if the sails of the vessels were the  wings of a dove to flee away and be at rest  he had no illusions as  to the roughness of the life and companionship but in his present  mood the frank rudeness and profanity of the sailors seemed  preferable to his cramped life and the scowls of his fellows and  he knew himself to have seamanship enough to rise quickly even if  he could not secure a mates berth at first  mr castleford could not be heard from till the end of the week   friday saturday came and not a word  that was the climax  when  the consignment of cash hitherto carried by clarence to the bank of  england was committed to another clerk the very office boy  sniggered and the manager demonstratively waited to see him depart  unable to bear it any longer he walked towards wapping bought a  southwester examined the lists of shipping and entered into  conversation with one or two sailors about the vessels making up  their crews intending to go down after dark to meet the skipper of  a craft bound for lisbon who he heard was so much in want of a  mate as perhaps to overlook the lack of testimonials and at any  rate take him on board on sunday  going home to pick up a few necessaries a book lent to him by miss  newton came in his way and he felt drawn to carry it home and see  her face for the last time  all unconscious of his trouble and of his intentions the good lady  told him of her strong desire to hear a celebrated preacher at a  neighbouring church on the sunday evening but said that in her  partial blindness and weakness she was afraid to venture unless he  would have the extreme goodness as she said to take care of her   he saw that she wished it so much that he had not the heart to  refuse and he recollected likewise that very early on monday  morning would answer his purpose equally well  it was the 7th of june  the psalm was the 37ththe supreme lesson  of patience  hold thee still in the lord and abide patiently on  him and he shall bring it to pass  he shall make thy righteousness  as clear as the light and thy just dealing as the noonday  the awful sense of desolation seemed to pass away under those words  with that gentle woman beside him  and the sermon was on oh tarry  thou the lords leisure be strong and he shall comfort thine  heart and put thou thy trust in the lord  clarence remembered nothing but the text  but it was borne in upon  him that his purpose of flight was the old storycowardice and  virtual distrust of the lord as well as absolute cruelty to us who  loved him  when he had deposited miss newton at her own door he whispered  thanks and an entreaty for her prayers  and then he went home and fought the battle of his life with his  own horrible dread of mr castlefords disappointment of possible  prosecution of the shame at home the misery of a life a second  time blighted  he fought it out on his knees many a time  persuading himself that flight would not be a sin then returning to  the sense that it was a temptation of his worse self to be overcome   and by morning he knew that it would be a surrender of himself to  his lower nature and the evil spirit behind it while by facing  the worst that could befall him he would be falling into the hand  of the lord    chapter xxivafter the tempest    nor deem the irrevocable past as wholly wasted wholly vain if rising on its wrecks at last to something nobler we attain  longfellow  all the rest of the family were out and i was relieved by being  alone with my distress not forced to hide it when the door opened  and mr castleford was announced  after one moments look at me  one touch of my hand he must have seen that i was faint with  anxiety and said it is all right edward i see you know all  i  am come from bristol to tell your father that he may be proud of his  son clarence  i dont know what i did  perhaps i sobbed and cried but the first  words i could get out were does he know  oh it may be too late   he may be gone off to sea i cried breaking out with my chief  fear  mr castleford looked astounded then said i trust not  i  sent off a special messenger last night as soon as i saw my way  then i breathed a little more freely and could understand what he  was telling me namely that tooke had accused clarence of  abstracting 20 pounds from the sum in his charge  the fellow  accounted for it by explaining that young winslow had been paying  extravagant bills at a tavern where the barmaid showed his  presents and boasted of her conquest  all this had been written to  mr castleford by his partner and he was told that it was out of  deference to himself that his protege was not in custody nor had  received notice of dismissal but no doubt he would give his  sanction to immediate measures and communicate with the family  the effect had been to make the good man hurry at once from the  giants causeway to bristol where he had arrived on sunday to  investigate the books and examine the underlings  in the midst  tooke attempted to abscond but he was brought back as he was  embarking in an american vessel and he then confessed the whole how speculation had led to dishonesty and following evil customs  not uncommon in other firms  then when the fugitive found that  young winslow was too acute to be blinded and that it had been a  still greater mistake to try to overcome his integrity selfdefence  required his ruin or at any rate his expulsion before he could  gain mr castlefords ear  tooke really believed that the discreditable bills were the young  mans own and proofs of concealed habits of dissipation but this  excellent man had gone into the matter repaired to the tradesfolk  learnt the date and whose the accounts really were and had even  hunted up the barmaid who was not married after all and had no  hesitation in avowing that her beau had been the handsome young  yeomanry lieutenant  mr castleford had spent the greater part of  monday in this painful task but had not been clear enough till  quite late in the evening to despatch an express to his partner and  to clarence whom he desired to meet him here  he has acted nobly said our kind friend  his only error seems  to have been in being too good a brother  this made me implore that nothing should be said about griffiths  bills showing those injunctions of clarences which had so puzzled  me and explaining the circumstances  mr castleford hummed and hawed and perhaps wished he had seen my  father before me but i prevailed at last and when the others came  in from their drive there was nothing to alloy the intelligence  that clarence had shown rare discernment as well as great  uprightness steadfastness and moral courage  my mother when she had taken in the fact actually shed tears of  joy  emily stood by me holding my hand  my father said it is  all owing to you castleford and the helping hand you gave the poor  boy  nay was the answer it seems to me that it was owing to his  having the root of the matter in him to overcome his natural  failings  still in all the rejoicing my heart failed me lest the express  should have come too late and clarence should be already on the  high seas for there had been no letter from him on sunday morning   it was doubtful whether mr castlefords messenger could reach  london in time for tidings to come down by the coachfar less did  we expect clarenceand we had nearly finished the first course at  dinner when we heard the front door open and a voice speaking to  the butler  emily screamed its he  oh mamma may i and flew  out into the hall dragging in a pale worn and weary wight all  dust and heat having travelled down outside the coach on a broiling  day and walked the rest of the way  he looked quite bewildered at  the rush at him my fathers well done clarence and strong  clasp and my mothers fervent kiss and muttered something about  washing his hands  formal folks such as we were had to sit in our chairs and when he  came back apologising for not dressing as he had left his  portmanteau for the carrier he looked so white and ill that we were  quite shocked and began to realise what he had suffered  he could  not eat the food that was brought back for him and allowed that his  head was aching dreadfully but after a glass of wine had been  administered it was extracted that he had met mr frith at the  office door and been gruffly told that mr castleford was  satisfied and he might consider himself acquitted  and then i had your letter sir thank you said clarence  scarcely restraining his tears  the thanks are on our side my dear boy said mr castleford  i  must talk it over with you but not till you have had a nights  rest  you look as if you had not known one for a good while  clarence gave a sort of trembling smile not trusting himself to  speak  approbation at home was so new and strange to him that he  could scarcely bear it worn out as he was by nearly a month of  doubt distress apprehension and selfdebate  my mother went herself to hasten the preparation of his room and  after she had sent him to bed went again to satisfy herself that he  was comfortable and not feverish  she came back wiping away a tear  and saying he had looked up at her just as when she had the three of  us in our nursery cribs  in truth these two had seldom been so  happy together since those days though the dear mother while  thankful that he had not failed was little aware of the conflict  his resolution had cost him and the hot journey and long walk came  in for more blame for his exhaustion than they entirely deserved  my father perhaps understood more of the trial for when she came  back declaring that all that was needed was sleep and forbidding  me to go to my room before bedtime he said he must bid the boy  goodnight  and he spoke as his reserve would have never let him speak at any  other time telling clarence how deeply thankful he felt for the  manifestation of such truthfulness and moral courage as he said  showed that the man had conquered the failings of the boy  nevertheless when i retired for the night it was to find clarence  asleep indeed but most uneasily tossing moaning and muttering  broken sentences about disgracing his pennant never bearing to  see mammas faceand the like  i thought it a kindness to wake  him and he started up  ted is it you  i thought i should never  hear your dear old crutch again  is it really all rightthen  sitting up and passing his hand over his face i always mix it up  with the old affair and think the courtmartial is coming again  theres all the difference now  thank god yeshe has dragged me through  but it did not seem so  in ones sleep nor waking neitherthough sleep is worst and  happily there was not much of that  sit down ted i want to look  at you  i cant believe it is not three weeks since i saw you  last  we talked it all out and i came to some perception of the fearful  ordeal it had beenfirst in the decision neither to shut his eyes  nor to conceal that they were open and then in the lack of presence  of mind and the sense of confusion that always beset him when  browbeaten and talked down so that in the critical contest with  tooke he felt as if his feet were slipping from under him and what  had once been clear to him was becoming dim so that he had only  been assured that he had held his ground by tookes redoubled  persuasions and increased anger  and for a clerk whose years were  only twentyone to oppose a manager who had been in the service  more than the whole of that space was preposterous insolence and  likely to result in the utter ruin of his own prospects and the  character he had begun to retrieve  it was just after this the  real crisis that he had the only dream which had not been misery  and distress  in it sheshe yonderyes the lady with the lamp  came and stood by him and said be steadfast  it was a dream said clarence  she was not as she is in the  mullion room not crying but with a sweet sad look almost like  miss fordyceif miss fordyce ever looked sad  it was only a  dream  yet it had so refreshed and comforted him that we have often since  discussed whether the spirit really visited him or whether this was  the manner in which conscience and imagination acted on his brain   indeed he always believed that the dream had been either heaven sent or heavenpermitted  the die had been cast in that interview when he had let it be seen  that he was dangerous and could not be bought over  the after  consequences had been the terrible distress and temptation i have  before described only most inadequately  but that said  clarence half smiling only came of my being such a wretched  creature as i am  there dear old miss newton saved meyes she  didmost unconsciously dear old soul  dont you remember how  griff used to say she maundered over the text  well she did it all  the way home in my ear as she clung to my armbe strong and he  shall comfort thine heart  and then i knew my despair and  determination to leave it all behind were a temptationthe old  story as you told me and i prayed god to help me and just  managed to fight it out  thank god for her  if it had not been for that good woman he would have been out of  reachalready out in the riverbefore mr castlefords messenger  had reached london  he might call himself a poor creatureand  certainly a man of harder bolder stuff would not have fared so  badly in the strife but it always seemed to me in after years that  much of what he called the poor creaturethe old nervous timid  diffident selfhad been shaken off in that desperate struggle  perhaps because it had really given him more selfreliance and  certainly inspired others with confidence in him  we talked late enough to have horrified my mother but i did not  leave him till he was sleeping like a child nor did he wake till i  was leaving the room at the sound of the bell  it was alleged that  it was the first time in his life that he had been late for prayers   mr castleford said he was very glad and my mother looking  severely at me said she knew we had been talking all night and  then went off to satisfy herself whether he ought to be getting up  there was no doubt on that score for he was quite himself again  though he was in looks and in weariness just as if he had  recovered from a bad illness or as he put it himself he felt as  tired and bruised as if he had been in a stiff gale  mr castleford  was sorry to be obliged to ask him to go through the whole matter  with him in the study and the result was that he was pronounced to  have an admirable head for business as well as the higher qualities  that had been put to the test  after that his good friend insisted  that he should have a long and complete holiday at first proposing  to take him to ireland but giving the notion up on hearing of our  projected excursion to the north of devon  pending this clarence  was for nearly a week fit for nothing but lying on the grass in  the shade playing with the cats and dogs or with little anne  looking over our drawings listening to wordsworth our reigning  idoland enjoying with almost touching gratitude the first  approach to petting that had ever fallen to his share  the only trouble on his mind was the quartersession  mr  castleford would hardly have prosecuted an old employe but mr  frith was furious and resolved to make an example  tooke had  however so carefully entrenched himself that nothing could be  actually made a subject of prosecution but the abstraction of the 20  pounds of which he had accused clarence who had to prove the having  received and delivered it  it was a very painful affair and tooke was sentenced to seven  years transportation  i believe he became a very rich and  prosperous man in new south wales and founded a family  my father  received warm compliments upon his sons and clarence had the new  sensation of being honourably coupled with griffith though he  laughed at the idea of mere honesty with fierce struggles being  placed beside heroism with no struggle at all    chapter xxvholidaymaking    the child upon the mountain side    plays fearless and at ease while the hush of purple evening    spreads over earth and seas the valley lies in shadow    but the valley lies afar and the mountain is a slope of light    upreaching to a star  menella smedley  how pleasant it was to hear griffiths cheery voice as he swung  himself down out of a cloud of dust from the top of the coach at  the wayside stagehouse whither clarence and i had driven in the  new britshka to meet him  while the four fine coachhorses were led  off and their successors harnessed in almost the twinkling of an  eye griff was with us and we did nothing but laugh and poke fun at  each other all the way home without a word of graver matters  i was resolved however that griff should know how terribly his  commission had added to clarences danger and how carefully the  secret had been guarded and the first time i could get him alone i  told him the whole  the effect was one of his most overwhelming fits of laughter  poor  old bill  to think of his being accused of gallanting about with  barmaids an explosion at every pause and revelling with  officers  poor old bill it was as bad as malvolio himself  when indignant at the mirth excited by what had nearly cost us so  dear i observed that these items had nearly turned the scale  against our brother griff demanded how we could have been such  idiots as not to have written to him i might at least have had the  sense to do so  as to its doing him harm at hillside parson frank  was no fool and knew what men were made of  griff would have taken  the risk come at once and thrust the story down the fellows  throat as indeed he would have done  the idea of betsy putting up  with a pious young man like bill whose only flame had ever been old  miss newton  and he roared again at the incongruous pair  oh  wasnt she married after all the hussy  she always had a dozen  beaux and professed to be on the point of putting up her banns so  if the earrings were not a wedding present they might have been  ought to have been and would be some time or other  then he patted me and declared there was no occasion for my  disgusted looks for no one knew better than himself that he had the  best brace of brothers in existence wanting in nothing but common  sense and knowledge of the world  as to betsyfaugh  i need not  make myself uneasy about her she knew what a civil word was worth  much better than i did  he showed considerable affection for clarence after a fashion of his  own which we three perfectly understood and preferred to anything  more conventional  griff was always delightful and he was  especially so on that vacation when every one was in high spirits  so that the journey is as i look back on it like a spot of  brilliant sunshine in the distant landscape  mrs fordyce kept house with her fatherinlaw little anne and  martyn whose holidays began a week after we had started  the two  children were allowed to make a desert island and a robbers cave in  the beech wood and the adventures which their imaginations  underwent there completely threw ours into the shade  the three ladies and i started in the big hillside open carriage  with my brothers on the box and the two fathers on horseback  frank  fordyce was a splendid rider as indeed was the old rector who had  followed the hounds made a leap over a fearful chasm still known  as the parsons stride and had been an excellent shot  the  renunciation of field sports had been a severe sacrifice to frank  fordyce and showed of what excellent stuff he was made  he used to  say that it was his own fault that he had to give them up another  man would have been less engrossed by them  though he only read by  fits and starts when his enthusiasm was excited he was thorough  able and acute and his intelligence and sympathy were my fathers  best compensation for the loss of london society  the two riders were a great contrast  mr winslow had the  thoroughly wellappointed somewhat precise and highlypolished air  of a barrister and a thin somewhat worn and colourless face with  grizzled hair and white whiskers and though he rode well with full  command of his horse he was old enough to have chosen chancery for  her sterling qualities  parson frank on the other hand though a  thorough gentleman was as ruddy and weatherbrowned as any farmer  andalbeit his features were handsome and refined and his figure  well poised and athletiche lost something of dignity by easiness  of gesture and carelessness of dress except on state occasions  when he discarded his beloved rusty old coat and oxford mixture  trousers and came out magnificent enough for an archdeacon if not  an archbishop while his magnificent horse cossack was an animal  that a sporting duke might have envied  nothing ever tired that couple but my father had stipulated for  exchanges with griffith  on these occasions it almost invariably  happened that there was a fine view for ellen to see so that she  was exalted to the box with griffith to show it to her and chancery  was consigned to clarence  griff was wont to say that chancery  deserved her name and that he would defy the ninetyninth part of a  tailor to come to harm with her but clarence was utterly  unpractised in riding did not like it was tormented lest cossacks  antics should corrupt chancery and was mortally afraid of breaking  the knees of the precious mare  not all parson franks good advice  and kindly raillery would induce him to risk riding her on a  descent and as our travels were entirely up and down hill he was  often left leading her far behind in hot sun or misty rain and  then would come cantering hastily up reckless of parallels with  john gilpin and only anxious to be in time to help me out at the  haltingplace but more than once only coming in when the beefsteaks  were losing their first charm and then goodhumouredly serving as  the general butt for his noble horsemanship  did any one fully  comprehend how much pleasanter our journey was through the presence  of one person entirely at the service of the others  for my own  part it made an immense difference to have one pair of strong arms  and dextrous wellaccustomed hands always at my service enabling me  to accomplish what no one else kind as all were would have  ventured on letting me attempt  primarily he was my devoted slave  but he was at the beck and call of every one making the inquiries  managing the bargains going off in search of whatever was wanting taking in fact all the must be dones of the journal  the  contemplation of cossack and chancery being rubbed down and  devouring their oats was so delightful to frank fordyce and griffith  that they seldom wished to shirk it but if there were any more  pleasing occupation it was a matter of course that clarence should  watch to see that the ostlers did their duty by the animalsan  obsolete ceremony by the bye  he even succeeded in hunting up and  hiring a side saddle when the lovers with the masterfulness of  their nature devised appropriating the horses at all the most  beautiful places in spite of franks murmur what will mamma say   but as griff said it was a real mercy for ellen was infinitely  more at her ease with chancery than was clarence  then emily had  clarence to walk up the hills with her and help her in botanyher  special department in our tour  mine was sketching ellens  keeping the journal though we all shared in each others work at  times and griff whose line was decidedly lovemaking interfered  considerably with us all especially with our chronicler  i spare  you the tour young people it lies before me on the table  profusely illustrated and written in many hands  as i turn it over  i see noble dunster on its rock clarence leading chancery down  porlock hill parson frank in vain pursuit of his favourite ancient  hat over that wild and windy waste the sheep running away from him  a boat tossing at lovely minehead a native bargaining over a crab  with my mother the wonderful valley of rocks and many another  scene ludicrous or grand for indeed we were for ever taking the  one step between the sublime and the ridiculous  i am inclined to  believe it is as well worth reading as many that have rushed into  print and it is full of precious reminiscences to emily and me but  the younger generation may judge for itself and it would be an  interruption here  the country we saw was of utterly unimagined  beauty to the untravelled eyes of most of us  i remember ellen  standing on hartland point with her face to the infinite expanse of  the atlantic and waving back griff with oh dont speak to me   yet the sea was a delight above all to my mother and clarence  to  them it was a beloved friend and magnificent as was lynmouth  wonderful as was clovelly and glorious as was hartland i believe  they would equally have welcomed the waves if they had been on the  flattest of muddy shores  the ripple plash and roar were as  familiar voices the salt smell as native air and my mother never  had thawed so entirely towards clarence as when she found him the  only person who could thoroughly participate her feeling  at minehead they stayed out walking up and down together in the  summer twilight till long after every one else was tired out and  had gone in and when at last they appeared she was leaning on  clarences arm an unprecedented spectacle  at appledore the only place on that rugged coast where boating  tempted them there was what they called a pretty little breeze but  quite enough to make all the rest of us decline venturing out into  bideford bay  they however found a boatman and made a trip which  was evidently such enjoyment to them that my father who had been a  little restless and uneasy all the time declared on their return  that he felt quite jealous of neptune and had never known what a  cruelty he was committing in asking a seanymph to marry a london  lawyer  mr fordyce told him he was afraid of being like the fisherman who  wedded a mermaid and made ellen tell the story in her own pretty  way but while we were laughing over it i saw my mother steal her  hand into my fathers and give it a strong grasp  such gestures  which she denominated pawing when she witnessed them in emily were  so alien to her in general that no doubt this little action was  infinitely expressive to her husband  she was wonderfully softened  and clarence implied to me that it was the first time she had ever  seemed to grieve for him more than she despised him or to recognise  his deprivation more than his disgraceimplied i say for the  words he used were little more thanyou cant think how nice she  was to me  the regaining of esteem and selfrespect was lessening clarences  bashfulness and bringing out his powers of conversation so that he  began to be appreciated as a pleasant companion answering griffs  raillery in like fashion and holding his own in goodnatured  repartee  mr fordyce got on excellently with him in their tetea tetes who would not with parson frank and held him in higher  estimation than did ellen  to her honesty was common tame and  uninteresting in comparison with heroism and griffs vague  statement that clarence was the best brother in the world did not go  for much  emily and i longed to get the two better acquainted but  it did not become possible while griff absorbed the maiden as his  exclusive property  the engagement was treated as an avowed and settled thing though i  do not know that there had been a formal ratification by the  parents but in truth mrs fordyce must have tacitly yielded her  consent when she permitted her daughter to make the journey under  the guardianship of parson frank  after a walk in the ravine of  lynton we became aware of a ring upon ellens finger and emily was  allowed at night to hear how and when it had been put on  ellen only slightly deepened her lovely carnation tints when her  father indulged in a little tender teasing and lamentation over  himself  she was thoroughly happy and proud of her hero and not  ashamed of owning it  there was one evening when she and i were sitting with our  sketchbooks in the shade on the beech at ilfracombe while the rest  had gone some to bathe the others to make purchases in the town   we had been condoling with one another over the impossibility of  finding anything among our watercolours that would express the  wondrous tints before our eyes  no nothing can do it i said at last we can only make a sort of  blot to assist our memories  sunshine outside and in said ellen  the memory of such days as  these can never fade awayno nor thankfulness for them i hope  something then passed about the fact that it was quite possible to  go on in complete content in a quiet monotonous life in an oyster like way till suddenly there was an unveiling and opening of  unimagined capacities of enjoymentas by a scene like this before  us by a great poem an oratorio or as i supposed by niagara or  the alps  ellen put itoh and by feelings for the great and  good  dear girl her colour deepened and i am sure she meant her  bliss in her connection with her hero  presently however she  passed on to saying how such revelations of unsuspected powers of  enjoyment helped one to enter into what was meant by eye hath not  seen nor ear heard neither hath it entered into the heart of man  to conceive the things that god hath prepared for them that love  him  then there was a silence and an inevitable quoting of the  christian year the guide to all our best thoughts    but patience there may come a time   and then a turning to the ode to immortality for wordsworth was  our second leader and we carried him on our tour as our one secular  book as keble was our one religious book  we felt that the  principal joy of all this beauty and delight was because there was  something beyond  presently ellen said prettily and shyly i am  sure all this has opened much more to me than i ever thought of  i  always used to be glad that we had no brothers because our cousins  were not always pleasant with us but now i have learnt what  valuable possessions they are she added with the sweetest  prettiest glance of her bright eyes  i ventured to say that i was glad she said they and hoped it was a  sign that she was finding out clarence  i have found out that i behaved so ill to him that i have been  ashamed ever since to look at him or speak to him said ellen i  long to ask his pardon but i believe that would distress him more  than anything  in which she was right and i was able to tell her of the excuses  there had been for the poor boy how he had suffered and how he had  striven to conquer his failings and she replied that the words  judge not that ye be not judged always smote her with the  remembrance of her disdainfully cantering past him  there was a  tear on her eyelashes and it drew from me an apology for having  brought a painful recollection into our bright day  there must be shade to throw up the lights she said with her  sparkling look  was it shade that we never fell into one of these grave talks when  griffith was present and that the slightest approach to them was  sure to be turned by him into jest  we made our journey a little longer than we intended crossing the  moors so as to spend a sunday at exeter but frank fordyce left us  not liking to give his father the entire duty of a third sunday  emily says she has come to have a superstition that extensions of  original plans never turn out well and certainly some of the charm  of our journey departed with the merry genial parson frank  our  mother was more anxious about ellen and put more restrictions on  the lovers than when the father was present to sanction their  doings  griffith absolutely broke out against her in a way he had  never ventured before when she forbade ellens riding with him when  he wanted to hire a horse at lydford and take an excursion on the  moor before joining us at okehampton  my father looked up and said griffith i am surprised at you   he was constrained to mutter some apology and i believe ellen  privately begged my mothers pardon owning her to have been quite  right but by the dear girl the wonderful cascade and narrow gorge  were seen through swollen eyes  and poor clarence must have had a  fine time of it when griffith had to ride off with him faute de  mieux  all was cleared off however when we met again for griffs storms  were very fleeting and ellen treated him as if she had to make her  own peace with him  she sacrificed her own enjoyment of exeter  cathedral to go about with him when he had had enough of it but on  sunday afternoon she altogether declined to walk with him till after  the second service  he laughed at her supposed passion for sacred  music and offered to wait with her to hear the anthem from the  nave  no she said that would be amusing ourselves instead of  worshipping  weve done our devoir in that way already said griff  paid our  dues  one cant cried ellen with an eager look  one longs to do all  the more when he has just let us have such a taste of his beautiful  things  one perhaps when one is a little saint returned griff  oh dont griff  im not that but you know every one wants all  the help and blessing that can be got  and then it is so  delightful  he gave a long whistle  every one to his taste he said  especially you ladies  he did come to the cathedral with us but he had more than half  spoilt this last sunday  did he value her for what was best in her  or was her influence raising him    chapter xxvic morbus esq    forgot were hatred wrongs and fears the plaintive voice alone she hears    sees but the dying man  scott  c morbus esq  such was the card that some wicked wag one of  clarences fellowclerks probably left at his lodgings in the  course of the epidemic which was beginning its ravages even while we  were upon our pleasant journeya shade indeed to throw out the  light  in these days the tidings of a visitation of cholera are heard with  compassion for crowded towns but without special alarm for  ourselves or our friends since its conditions and the mode of  combating it have come to be fairly understood  in 1832 however it was a disease almost unknown and unprecedented  except in its indian abode whence it had advanced city by city  seaport by seaport sweeping down multitudes before it nor had  science yet discovered how to encounter or forestall it  we heard  of it in a helpless sort of way as if it had been the plague or the  black death and thought of its victims as doomed  that terrible german engraving death as a foe which represents  the grisly form as invading a ballroom in paris is an expression of  the feeling with which the scourge was regarded on that first  occasion  two years ago gives some notion of the condition of  things in 1849 but by that time there had been some experience and  means of prevention were better understood  on the alarm in that  year there was a great inspection of cottages throughout earlscombe  and hillside but in 1832 there was no notion of such precautions   nevertheless on neither visitation nor any subsequent one has the  disease come nearer to us than bristol  as far as memory serves me the idea was that wholesome food  regular habits and cleanliness were some protection but one  locality might be as dangerous as another  there had been cases in  london all the spring but no special anxiety was felt when clarence  returned to his work in the end of july much refreshed and  invigorated by his holiday and with the understanding that he was  to have a rise in position and salary on mr castlefords return  from ireland where he was still staying with his wifes relations   clarence was received at the office with a kind of shamefaced  cordiality as if every one would fain forget the way in which he  had been treated and he was struck by finding that all the talk was  of the advances of the cholera chiefly at rotherhithe  and a great  shock awaited him  he went as soon as business hours were over to  thank good old miss newton for the comfort and aid she had  unwittingly given him and to tell her from what she had saved him   alas it was the last benefit she was ever to confer on her old  pupil  at the door he was told by a weeping terrified maid that  she was very ill with cholera and that no hope was given  he tried  to send up a message but she was in a state of collapse and  insensible and when he inquired the next morning the gentle spirit  had passed away  he attended her funeral that same evening  griff said it was a  proof how your timid people will do the most foolhardy things but  clarence always held that the good woman had really done more for  him than any one in actually establishing a contact so to say  between his spirit and external truth and he thought no mark of  respect beyond her deserts  she was a heavy loss to him for no one  else in town gave him the sense of home kindness and there was much  more to depress him for several of his sunday class were dead and  the school had been broken up for the time while the heats and the  fruits of august contributed to raise the mortality  his return had released a couple more clerks for their holiday it  was a slack time of year with less business in hand than usual and  the place looked empty  mr frith worked on as usual but preserved  an ungracious attitude as though he were either still incredulous  or if convinced against his will resolved that that prig of a  winslow should not presume upon his services  altogether the poor  fellow was quite unhinged and wrote such dismal bills of mortality  and meek resigned forebodings that my father was almost angry  declaring that he would frighten himself into the sickness yet i  suppressed a good deal and never told them of the last will and  testament in which he distributed his possessions amongst us  griff  said he had a great mind to go and shake old bill up and row him  well but he never did  more than a week passed by two of clarences regular days for  writing but no letter came  my mother grew uneasy and talked of  writing to mrs robson or as we still called her gooch but it  was doubtful whether the answer would contain much information and  it was quite certain that any ill tidings would be sent to us  at last we did hear and found as we had foreboded that the letter  had not been written for fear of alarming us or carrying infection  though clarence underlined the words i am perfectly well  having to take a message into the senior partners room clarence  had found the old man crouched over the table writhing in the  unmistakable grip of the deadly enemy  no one else was available  clarence had to collect himself send for the doctor and manage the  conveyance of the patient to his rooms which fortunately adjoined  the office for through all his influx of wealth mr frith had  retained the habits and expenditure of his early struggling days   his old housekeeper and her drudge showed themselves terrified out  of their senses and as incapable as unwilling  naval experience  and waiting on me had taught clarence helpfulness and handiness  and though this was the very thing that had appalled his  imagination he seemed as he said afterwards to have got beyond  his fright to the use of his commonsense  and when at last the  doctor came and talked of finding a nurse if possible for they  were scarce articles the sufferer only entreated between his  paroxysms stay winslow  is winslow there  dont go  dont  leave me  no nurse was to be found but to clarences amazement gooch arrived   he had sent by the office boy to explain his absence and before  night the faithful woman descended on him intending as in her old  days of authority simply to put master clarry out of harms way  and take the charge upon herself  then as he proved unmanageable  and would not leave his patient neither would she leave him and  through the frightful night that ensued there was quite employment  enough for them both  gooch fully thought the end would come before  morning and was murmuring something about a clergyman but was cut  short by a sharp prohibition  however detecting clarences lips  moving the old man said eh speak it out  and with difficulty  feeling as if i were somebody else said clarence i did get out  some short words of prayer  it seemed so awful for him to die  without any  when the doctor came in early morning the watchers were astonished  to hear that their charge had taken a turn for the better and might  recover if their admirable care were continued  the doctor had  brought a nurse but mr frith would not let her come into the room  and there was plenty of need for her elsewhere  several days of unremitting care followed during which clarence  durst not write to us so little were the laws of infection  understood  good mrs robson stayed all the time and probably  saved clarence from falling a victim to his zeal for she looked  after him as anxiously as after the sick man and with a wondering  and thankful heart he found himself in full health when both were  set free to return home  clarence had written at the beginning of  the illness to the only relations of whose existence or address he  was aware an old sister mrs stevens and a young greatnephew in  the office at liverpool and the consequence was the arrival of a  sourlooking old widow sister who came to take charge of the  convalescence and as the indignant gooch overheard her say to  prevent that young winslow from getting round him  there were no signs of such a feat having been performed when the  panic being past my father went up to london with griffith who was  to begin eating his terms at the temple  he was to share clarences  lodgings for the robsons had plenty of room and gooch was  delighted to extend her cares to her special favourite as she  already reigned over clarences wardrobe and table as entirely as in  nursery days and to my great exultation my father said it would  be good for griffith to be with his brother and moreover we  should hear of the latter  nothing could be a greater contrast than  his rare notifications or requests scrawled on a single side of the  quarto sheet with clarences regular weekly lines of clerkly  manuscript telling all that could interest any of us and covering  every available flap up to the blank circle left for the trim red  seal  promotion had come to clarence in the natural course of seniority  and a small sum due to him on his coming of age was invested in  the house of business so that the two brothers could take between  them all the robsons available rooms  clarences post was one of  considerable trust but there were no tokens of special favour  except that mr frith was more civil to my father than usual and  when he heard of the arrangement about the lodgings he snarled out  hm  law student indeed  dont let him spoil his brother  which was so far an expression of gratitude that it showed that he  considered that there was something to be spoilt  mr castleford  however showed real satisfaction in the purchase of a share in the  concern for clarence  his own eldest son inherited a good deal of  his mothers irish nature and was evidently unfit to be anything  but a soldier and the next was so young that he was glad to have a  promising and trustworthy young man from whom a possible joint head  of the firm might be manufactured    chapter xxviipeters thunderbolt    if you can separate yourself and your misdemeanours you are welcome  to the house if not an it would please you to take leave of her  she is very willing to bid you farewell   twelfth night  in the early summer of 1833 we had the opportunity of borrowing a  friends house in portman square for six weeks and we were allowed  to take ellen with us for introduction to the admiral and other old  friends while we were to make acquaintance with her connections the family of sir horace lester mp  we were very civil but there were a good many polite struggles for  the exclusive possession of ellen whom both parties viewed as their  individual right and her unselfish goodhumour and brightness must  have carried her over more worries than we guessed at the time  she had stayed with the lesters before but in schoolroom days   they were indolent and uninterested and had never shown her any of  the permanent wonders of london despising these as only fit for  country cousins whereas we had grown up to think of them with  intelligent affection  to me however much was as new as to ellen   country life had done so much for me that i could venture on what i  had never attempted before  the admiral said it was getting away  from doctors and their experiments but i had also done with the  afflictions of attempts at growth in wrong directions  old friends  did not know me and more than once as i sat in the carriage  addressed me for one of my brothersa compliment which griff said  turned my head  happily i was too much accustomed to my own  appearance and people were too kind for me to have much shyness on  that score  our small dinner parties were great enjoyment to me  and the two girls were very happy in their little gaieties  braham and catalani fanny kemble and turners landscapes at his  best rise in my memory as supreme delights and revelations in their  different lines and awakening trains of thought and then there was  that entertainment which griffith and clarence gave us in their  rooms when they regaled us with all the delicacies of the season  and peter and gooch looked all pride and hospitality  the dining parlour or what served as such was griffs property as any one  could see by the pictures of horses dogs and ladies the cups  whips and boxinggloves that adorned it the sittingroom had  tokens of other occupation in clarences piano windowbox of  flowers and his one extravagance in engravings from raffaelle and  a marine watercolour or two besides all my own attempts at family  portraits with a case of wellbound books  those two rooms were  perfectly redolent of their mastersi say it literallyfor the  scent of flowers was in clarences room and in griffs the odour  of cigars had not wholly been destroyed even by much airing  for in  those days it was regarded by parents and guardians as an  objectionable thing  peter was radiant on that occasion but a few evenings later when  all were gone to an evening party except my father and myself mr  robson was announced as wishing to speak to mr winslow  after the  civilities proper to the visit of an old servant had passed he  entered with obvious reluctance on the purpose of his visit namely  his dissatisfaction with griff as a lodger  his wife he said  would not have had him speak she was that attached to mr griffith  it couldnt be more if he was her own son nor was it for want of  liking for the young gentleman on his part as had known him from a  boy but the wife of ones bosom must come first sir as stands to  reason and its for the good of the young gentleman himself and  his family as some one should speak  i never said one word against  it when she would not be satisfied without running the risk of her  life after mr clarence hattending of mr frith in the cholery   that was only her dooty sir and i have never a word to say against  dooty  but i cannot see her nearly wore out and for no good to  nobody  it appeared that mrs robson was pretty nigh wore out a setting up  for mr griffiths untimely hours  he laughed and coaxedwhat i  calls cajolingdid mr griff to get a latchkey but we knows our  dooty too well for that and mrs winslow had made us faithfully  promise when master clarence first came to us that he should never  have a latchkeymr clarence as had only been five times later  than eleven oclock and then he was going to dine with mr  castleford or to the theayter and spoke about it beforehand  if  he was not reading to poor miss newton as was gone or with some of  his languagemasters he was setting at home with his books and  papers not giving no trouble to nobody after he had had his bit of  bread and cheese and glass of beer to his supper  ay peter knew what young gentlemen was  he did not expect to see  them all like poor master clarence as had had his troubles the  very life knocked out of him in his youth as one might say  indeed  peter would be pleased to see him a bit more sprightly and taking  more to society and hamusements of his hage  nor would there be any  objection if the late ours was only once a week or so and things  was done in a style fitting the family but when it came to mostly  every night often to two or three oclock it was too much for mrs  robson for she would never go to bed being mortal afraid of fire  and not always certain that mr griffith wasto sayfit to put out  his candle  what do you mean peter thundered my father whose  brow had been getting more and more furrowed every moment  say it  outdrunk  well sir no no not to say that exactly but a little excited  sir and women is timid  no sir not to call intoxicated  no thats to come muttered my father  has this often  happened  peter did not think that it had been noticed more than three times  at the most but he went on to offer his candid and sensible advice  that mr griffith should be placed in a family where there was a  gentleman or lady who would have some hauthority and could not be  put aside with his goodumoured haffabilityyoure an old fogy  peter  never mind nursey ill be a good boy next time and the  like  it is a disadvantage you see sir to have been in his  service and tis for the young gentlemans own good as i speaks  but it would be better if he were somewheres elseunless you would  speak to him sir  to the almost needless question whether clarence had been with his  brother on these occasions there was a most decided negative  he  had never gone out with griffith except once to the theatre and to  dine at the castlefords and at first he had sat up for his return  but it led to words between the young gentlemen said peter whose  confidences were becoming reckless and it appeared that when  clarence had found that gooch would not let him spare her vigil he  had obeyed her orders and ceased to share it  peter was thanked for the revelations which had been a grievous  effort to him and dismissed  my father sat still in great distress  and perplexity asking me whether clarence had ever told me anything  of this and i had barely time to answer no before clarence  himself came in from what peter called his languagemaster  he was  taking lessons in french and spanish finding a knowledge of these  useful in business  to his extreme distress my father fell on him  at once demanding what he knew of the way griffith was spending his  time coming home at all sorts of hours in a disreputable  condition  no prevarication sir he added as the only too  familiar look of consternation and bewilderment came over clarences  face  you are doing your brother no good by conniving at his  conduct  speak truth if you can he added with more cruelty than  he knew in his own suffering  sir gasped clarence i know griff often comes home after i am in  bed but i do not know the exact time nor anything more  is this all you can tell me  really all  all i knowthat isof my own knowledge said clarence  recovering a little but still unable to answer without hesitation  which vexed my father  what do you mean by that  do you hear nothing  i am afraid said clarence that i do not see as much of him as i  had hoped  he is not up till after i have to be at our place and  he does not often spend an evening at home  he is such a popular  fellow and has so many friends and engagements  ay and of what sort  cant you tell or will you not  i sent him  up to you thinking you a steady fellow who might influence him for  good  the colour rushed into clarences face as he answered looking up  and speaking low have i not forfeited all such hopes  nonsense  youve lived down that old story long ago  you would  make your mark if you only showed a little manliness and force of  character  griffith was always fond of you  cant you do anything  to hinder him from ruining his own life and that sweet girls  happiness  i wouldi would give my life to do so exclaimed clarence in  warm eager tones  i have tried but he says i know nothing about  it and it is very dull at our rooms for him  i have got used to  it but you cant expect a fellow like griff to stay at home with  no better company than me and do nothing but read law  then you do know began my father but clarence with full self possession said i think you had better ask me no more questions  papa  i really know nothing or hardly anything personally of his  proceedings  i went to one supper with him after going to the  play and did not fancy it besides it almost unfitted me for my  mornings work nor does it answer for me to sit up for himit only  vexes him as if i were watching him  did you ever see him come home showing traces of excess  no said clarence i never saw and under a stern distressed  look once i heard tones thatthat startled me and mrs robson  has grumbled a good dealbut i think peter takes it for more than  it is worth  i see said my father more gently i will not press you farther   i believe i ought to be glad that these habits are only hearsay to  you  as far as i can see said clarence diffidently but quite restored  to himself griff is only like most of his set young men who go  into society  oh said my father in a thats your opinion kind of tone and  as at that moment the yell of a newsboy was heard in the street he  exclaimed that he must go and get an evening paper  clarence made a  step to go instead but was thrust back as apparently my father  merely wanted an excuse for rushing into the open air to recover the  shock or to think it over  clarence gave a kind of groan and presently exclaimed if only  untruth were not such a sin and on my exclamation of dismay he  added i dont think a blowing up ever does good  but this state of things should not last  it will not  it would have come to an end without peters  springing this mine  griff says he cant stand gooch any longer   and really she does worry him intolerably  peter professed to come without her knowledge or consent  exactly so  it will almost break the good old souls heart for  griff to leave her but she expects to have him in hand as if he was  in the nursery  she is ever so much worse than she was with me and  he is really goodnature itself to laugh off her nagging as he does about what he chooses to put on or eating or smoking or leaving  his room untidy as well as other things  and those other things  do you suspect more than you told papa  it amounts to no more  griff likes amusement and everybody likes  himthats all  yes i know my father read law ten hours a day  but his whole nature and circumstances were different  i dont  believe griff could go on in that way  not with such a hope before him  you would clarence  his face and not his tongue answered me but he added griff is  sure of that without so much labour and trouble  and do you see so little of him  i cant help it  i cant keep his hours and do my work  yes i  know we are drifting apart i wish i could help it but being  coupled up together makes it rather worse than better  it  aggravates him and he will really get on better without gooch to  worry him and thrust my droning old ways down his throatas if  prince hal could bear to be twitted with that sober boy lord john  of lancaster  not he added catching himself up that i meant  to compare him to the madcap prince  he is the finest of fellows  if they only would let him alone  and that was all i could get from clarence    chapter xxviiia squire of dames       spited with a fool  spited and angered both  cymbeline  this long stay of ellens in our family had made our fraternal  relations with her nearer and closer  familiarity had been far from  lessening our strong feeling for her goodness and sweetness  emily  who knew her best used to confide to me little instances of the  spirit of devotion and selfdiscipline that underlay all her sunny  gaietyhow she never failed in her mornings devout readings how  she learnt a verse or two of scripture every day and persuaded  emily to join with her in repeating it ere they went downstairs for  their evenings pleasure how she had set herself a little task of  plain work for the poor which she did every day in her own room  and the like dutiful habits which seemed as it were to help her  to keep herself in hand and not be carried away by what was a whirl  of pleasure to her though a fashionable young lady would have  despised its mildness  indeed lady peacock with whom we exchanged calls made no secret of  her compassion when she found how many parties the ladies were not  going to and ellens own relations the lesters would have taken  her out almost every night if she had not staunchly held to her  promise to her mother not to go out more than three evenings in the  week for mrs fordyce knew her to be delicate and feared late  hours for her  the vexation her cousins manifested made her feel  the more bound to give them what time she could at hours when  griffith was not at liberty  she did not like them to be hurt and  jealous of us or to feel forsaken and she tried to put her  affection for us on a different footing by averring that it was not  the same kind of thingemily was her sister  one day she had gone to luncheon with the lesters in cavendish  square and was to be called for in the carriage by me on the way  to take up the other two ladies who were shopping in regent street  ellen came running downstairs with her cheeks in a glow under the  pink satin lining of her pretty bonnet and her eyes sparkling with  indignation which could not but break forth  i dont know how i shall ever go there again she exclaimed they  have no right to say such things  then she explained  mary and  louisa had been saying horrid things about griffithher griff  it  was always their way  think how horace had made her treat clarence   it was their way and habit to tease and call it fun and she had  never minded it before but this was too bad  would not i put it in  her power to give a flat contradiction such as would make them  ashamed of themselves  contradict what  then it appeared that the misses lester had laughed at her who was  so very particular and scrupulous for having taken up with a  regular young man about town  oh no they did not think much of it no doubt he was only just like other people only the funny thing  was that it should be ellen for whom it was always supposed that no  saint in the calendar no knight in all the waverley novels would  be good enough  and then on her hot desire to know what they  meant they quoted john the brother in the guards as having been  so droll about poor ellens perfect hero and especially at his  straightlaced aunt fordyce having been taken inbut of course it  was the convenience of joining the estates and it was agreeable to  see that your very good folk could wink at things like other people  in such a case  then when ellen fairly drove her inquiries home  in her absolute trust of confuting all slanders she was told that  griffith did what she called all sorts of thingsbilliards and  all that  and even that he was always running after a horrid lady  peacock a gay widow  they went on in fun said ellen and laughed the more whenyes  i am afraid i didi lost my temper  no dont say i well might i  know i ought not but i told them i knew all about lady peacock and  that you were all old friends even before he rescued her from the  bristol riots and brought her home to chantry house and that only  made mary merrier than ever and say what another distressed  damsel  take care ellen i would not trust such a squire of  dames  and then louisa chimed in oh no you see this peacock  dame was only conducted like princess micomicona and all the rest  of them to the feet of his peerless dulcinea  and then i heard  the knock and i was never so glad in my life  well i could not help remarking i have heard of womens  spitefulness but i never believed it till now  i really dont think it was altogether what you call malice so  much as the lester idea of fun said ellen recovering herself  after her outpouring  a very odd notion i always thought it was  and mary and louisa are not really illnatured and cannot wish to  do the harm they might have done if i did not know griff too well  then after considering a little she said blushing i believe i  have told you more than i ought edwardi couldnt help having it  out but please dont tell any one especially that shocking way of  speaking of mamma which they could not really mean  no one could who knew her  of course not  ill tell you what i mean to do  i will write to  mary when we go in and tell her that i know she really cares for me  enough to be glad that her nonsense has done no mischief and  though i was so foolish and wrong as to fly into a passion of  course i know it is only her way and i do not believe one word of  it  somehow as she looked with those radiant eyes full of perfect  trust i could not help longing not to have heard peter robsons  last nights complaint but family feeling towards outsiders  overcomes many a misgiving and my wrath against the malignity of  the lesters was quite as strong as if i had been devoid of all  doubts whether griff wore to all other eyes the same halo of pure  glory with which ellen invested him  such doubts were very transient  dear old griff was too delightful  too bright and too brave too ardent and too affectionate not to  dispel all clouds by the sunshine he carried about with him  if  rest and reliance came with clarence zest and animation came with  griffith  he managed to take the initiative by declining to remain  any longer with the robsons saying they had been spoilt by such a  model lodger as clarence who would let gooch feed him on bread and  milk and boiled mutton and put on his clean pinafore if she chose  to insist whereas her indignation when griff found fault with the  folding of his white ties amounted to et tu brute and he really  feared she would have had a fit when he ordered devilled kidneys for  breakfast  he was sure her determination to tuck him up every night  and put out his candle was shortening her life and he had made  arrangements to share the chambers of a friend who had gone through  school and college with him  there was no objection to the friend  who had stayed at chantry house and was an agreeable lively young  man well reported of satisfactorily connected fairly industrious  and in good society so that griff was likely to be much less  exposed to temptation of the lower kinds than when left to his own  devices or only with clarence who had neither time nor disposition  to share his amusements  there was a scene with my father but in private and all that came  to general knowledge was that griff felt himself injured by any  implication that he was given to violent or excessive dissipation  such as could wreck ellens happiness or his own character  he declared with all his heart that immediate marriage would be the  best thing for both and pleaded earnestly for it but my father  could not have arranged for it even if the fordyces would have  consented and there were matters of business as well as other  reasons which made it inexpedient for them to revoke their decision  that the wedding should not take place before ellen was of age and  griffith called to the bar  so we took our young ladies home loaded with presents for their  beloved school children of whom emily said she dreamt as the time  for seeing them again drew near  after all the london enjoyment it  was pretty to see the girls delight in the fresh country sights and  sounds in full summer glory and how ellen proved to have been  hungering after all her dear ones at home  when we left her at her  own door our last sight of her was in her fathers arms little  anne clinging to her dress mother and grandfather as close to her  as could bea perfect tableau of a joyous welcome    chapter xxixlove and obedience    unless he give me all in change    i forfeit all things by him the risk is terrible and strange  mrs browning  you will be weary of my lengthiness and perhaps i am lingering too  long over the earlier portion of my narrative  something is due to  the disproportion assumed in our memories by the first twenty years  of existencesomething perhaps to reluctance to passing from  comparative sunshine to shadow  there was still a period of  brightness but it was so uneventful that i have no excuse for  dwelling on it further than to say that henderson our excellent  curate had already made a great difference in the parish and it  was beginning to be looked on as almost equal to hillside  the  children were devoted to emily who was the source of all the  amenities of their poor little lives  the needlework of the school  was my mothers pride and our church and its services though you  would shudder at them now were then thought presumptuously superior  for a country parish  they were a real delight and blessing to  us as well as to many more of the flock who still in their old  age remember and revere parson henderson as a sort of apostle  the dawning of the new poorlaw led to investigations which revealed  the true conditions of the peasants lifeits destitution  recklessness and dependence  we tried to mend matters by inducing  families to emigrate but this renewed the distrust which had at  first beheld in the schools an attempt to enslave the children   even accounts sent home by the exceptionally enterprising who did  go to canada were we found scarcely trusted  amos bell who  would have gone if he had not been growing into my special personal  attendant was letterwriter and reader to all his relations and  revealed to us that it had been agreed that no letter should be  considered as genuine unless it bore a certain private mark  to be  sure the accounts of prosperity might well sound fabulous to the  toilers and moilers at home  harriet martineaus hamlets which we  lent to many of our neighbours is a fair picture of the state of  things  we much enjoyed those tales and emily says they were the  only political economy she ever learnt  the model arrangements of our vestries led to a summons to my father  and the younger mr fordyce to london to be examined on the  condition of the pauper and the working of the old elizabethan  poorlaw  they were absent for about a fortnight of early spring and emily  and i could not help observing that our mother was unusually  uncommunicative about my fathers letters and moreover there was  a tremendous revolution of the furniture a far more ominous token  in our household than any comet  the truth came on us when the two fathers returned  mine told me  himself that frank fordyce was so much displeased with griffiths  conduct that he had declared that the engagement could not continue  with his consent  this from goodnatured tenderhearted parson frank  i cried out hotly that those lesters had done this  they had  always been set against us and any one could talk over mr frank   my father shook his head  he said frank fordyce was not weak but  all the stronger for his gentleness and charity and moreover that  he was quite rightto our shame and grief be it spokenquite  right  it was true that the first information had been given by sir horace  lester mrs fordyces brother but it had not been lightly spoken  like the daughters chatter and my father himself had found it only  too true so that he could not conscientiously call griffith worthy  of such a creature as ellen fordyce  poor griff he had been idle and impracticable over his legal  studies which no persuasion would make him view as otherwise than a  sort of nominal training for a country gentleman nor had he ever  believed or acted upon the fact that the earlscombe property was not  an unlimited fortune such as would permit him to dispense with any  profession and spend time and money like the youths with whom he  associated  still this might have been condoned as part of the  effervescence which had excited him ever since my father had  succeeded to the estate and patience might still have waited for  greater wisdom but there had been graver complaints of  irregularities which were forcing his friend to dissolve  partnership with him  there was evidence of gambling which he not  only admitted but defended and moreover he was known at parties  at races and at the theatre as one of the numerous satellites who  revolved about that gay and conspicuous young fashionable widow  lady peacock  yes frank has every right to be angry said my father pacing the  room  i cant wonder at him  i should do the same but it is  destroying the best hope for my poor boy  then he began to wish clarence had morehe knew not what to call  itin him something that might keep his brother straight  for of  course he had talked to clarence and discovered how very little the  brothers saw of one another  clarence had been to look for griff in  vain more than once and they had only really met at a castleford  dinnerparty  in fact clarences youthful spirits and the tastes  which would have made him companionable to griff had been crushed  out of him and he was what more recent slang calls such a muff  that he had perforce drifted out of our elder brothers daily life  as much as if he had been a grave senior of fifty  it was as he  owned a heavy penalty of his youthful fall that he could not help  his brother more effectually  it appeared that frank fordyce thoroughly roused had had it out  with griffith and had declared that his consent was withdrawn and  the engagement annulled  griff astounded at the resolute tone of  one whom he considered as the most goodnatured of men had answered  hotly and proudly that he should accept no dismissal except from  ellen herself and that he had done no more than was expected of any  young man of position and estate  on the other indictment he  scorned any defence and the two had parted in mutual indignation   he had however shown himself so much distressed at the threat of  being deprived of ellen that neither my father nor clarence had the  least doubt of his genuine attachment to her nor that his  attentions to lady peacock were more than the effect of old habit  and love of amusement and that they had been much exaggerated  he  scouted the bare idea of preferring her to ellen and in his second  interview with my father was ready to make any amount of promises  of reformation provided his engagement were continued  this was on the last evening before leaving town and he came to the  coachoffice looking so pale jaded and unhappy that parson franks  kind heart was touched and in answer to a muttered ive been ten  thousand fools sir but if you will overlook it i will try to be  worthy of her he made some reply that could be construed into if  you keep to that all may yet be well  ill talk to her mother and  grandfather  perhaps this was cruel kindness for as we well knew mrs fordyce  was far less likely to be tolerant of a young mans failings than  was her husband and she was besides a lester and might take the  same view  abusing the lesters was our great resource for we did not believe  either the sailor or the guardsman to be immaculate and we knew  them to be jealous  we had to remain in ignorance of what we most  wished to know for ellen was kept away from us and my mother would  not let emily go in search of her  only anne who was a high spirited independent little person made a sudden rush upon me as i  sat in the garden  she had no business to be so far from home  alone but said she i dont care it is all so horrid  please  edward is it true that griff has been so very wicked  i heard the  maids talking and they said papa had found out that he was a bad  lot and that he was not to marry ellen but she would stick to him  through thick and thin like poor kitty brown who would marry the  man that got transported for seven years  will he be transported  edward and would ellen go too like the nutbrown maid  is that  what she cries so about  not by day but all night  i know she  does for her handkerchief is wet through and there is a wet place  on her pillow always in the morning but she only says never  mind and nobody will tell me  they only say little girls should  not think about such things  and i am not so very little  i am  eight and have read the lay of the last minstrel and i know all  about people in love  so you might tell me  i relieved annes mind as to the chances of transportation and  after considering how many confidences might be honourably exchanged  with the child i explained that her father thought griff had been  idle and careless and not fit as yet to be trusted with ellen  her parish experience came into play  does papa think he would be  like joe sparks  but then gentlemen dont beat their wives nor go  to the publichouse nor let their children go about in rags  i durst not inquire much but i gathered that there was a heavy  shadow over the house and that ellen was striving to do as usual  but breaking down when alone  just then parson frank appeared   anne had run away from him while on a farming inspection when the  debate over the turnips with the factotum had become wearisome  he  looked grave and sorrowful quite unlike his usual hearty self and  came to me leaning over my chair and saying this is sad work  edward and on an anxious venture of an inquiry for ellen poor  little maid it is very sore work with her  she is a good child and  obedientwants to do her duty but we should never have let it go  on so long  we have only ourselves to thanktaking the family  character you seeand he made a kindly gesture towards me  your  father sees how it is and wont let it make a split between us  i  believe that not seeing as much of your sister as usual is one of my  poor lassies troubles but it may be bestit may be best  he lingered talking unwilling to tear himself away and ended by  disclosing almost at unawares that ellen had held out for a long  time would not understand nor take in what she was told accepted  nothing on lester authority declared she understood all about lady  peacock and showed a strength of resistance and independence of  view that had quite startled her parents by proving how far their  darling had gone from them in heart  but they still held her by the  bonds of obedience and by dealing with her conscience her mother  had obtained from her a piteous little note    my dear griffithi am afraid it is true that you have not always  seemed to be doing right and papa and mamma forbid our going on as  we are  you know i cannot be disobedient  it would not bring a  blessing on you  so i must break off though   the though could be read through an erasure followed by the  initials e m fas if the dismal conclusion had been felt to be  only too trueand there followed the postscript forgive me and  if we are patient it may come right  this letter was displayed when on the ensuing evening it brought  griff down in towering indignation and trying to prove the coercion  that must have been exercised to extract even thus much from his  darling  over he went headlong to hillside to insist on seeing her  but to encounter a succession of stormy scenes  mrs fordyce was  the most resolute but was ill for a week after  the old rector was  gentle and somewhat overawed griff by his compassion and by  representations that were only too true and parson frank with his  tender heart torn to pieces showed symptoms of yielding another  probation  the interview with ellen was granted  she however was intrenched  in obedience  she had promised submission to the rupture of her  engagement and she kept her wordthough she declared that nothing  could hinder her love and that she would wait patiently till her  lover had proved himself to everybodys satisfaction as good and  noble as she knew him to be  when he told her she did not love him  she smiled  she was sure that whatever mistakes there might have  been he would give no further occasion against himself and then  every one would see that all had been mere misunderstanding and  they should be happy again  such trust humbled him and he was ready to make all promises and  resolutions but he could not obtain the renewal of the engagement  nor permission to correspond  only there was wrung out of parson  frank a promise that if he could come in two years with a perfectly  unstained unblotted character the betrothal might be renewed  we were very thankful for the hope and motive and griff had no  doubts of himself  one cant look at the pretty creature and think of disappointing  her he said  she is altered you know ted theyve bullied her  till she is more ethereal than ever but it only makes her lovelier   i believe if she saw me kill some one on the spot she would think it  all my generosity or if she could not she would take and die  oh  no  ill not fail her  no i wont not if i have to spend seven  years after the model of old bill whose liveliest pastime is a good  long sermon when it is not a ghost    chapter xxxuna or duessa    soone as the elfin knight in presence came and false duessa seeming ladye fayre a gentle husher vanitie by name made roome and passage did for them prepare  spenser  the two families were supposed to continue on unbroken terms of  friendship and we men did so but mrs fordyce told my mother that  she had disapproved of the probation and mrs winslow was hurt   though the two girls were allowed to be together as usual it was on  condition of silence about griff and though as emily said they  really had not been always talking about him in former times the  prohibition seemed to weigh upon all they said  old mr fordyce had long been talking of a round of visits among  relations whom he had not seen for many years and it was decided to  send ellen with him chiefly no doubt to prevent difficulties  about griffith in the long vacation  there was no embargo on the correspondence with my sister and  letters full of description came regularly but how unlike they were  to our journal  they were clear intelligent with a certain  liveliness but no ring of youthful joy no echo of the heart  always as if under restraint  griff was much disappointed  he had  been on his good behaviour for two months and expected his reward  and i could not here repeat all that he said about her parents when  he found she was absent  yet after all he got more pity and  sympathy from parson frank than from any one else  that good man  actually sent a message for him when emily was on honour to do no  such thing  poor emily suffered much in consequence when she would  neither afford griff a blank corner of her paper nor write even a  veiled message while as to the letters she received and gave to  him what was the use he said of giving him what might have  been read aloud by the towncrier  you dont understand griff it is all dear ellens  conscientiousness  oh deliver me from such conscientiousness he answered in a  tone of bitter mimicry and flung out of the room leaving emily in  tears  he could not appreciate the nobleness of ellens selfcommand and  the obedience which was the security of future happiness but was  hurt at what he thought weak alienation  one note of sympathy would  have done much for griff just then  i have often thought it over  since and come to the conclusion that mrs fordyce was justified in  the entire separation she brought about  no one can judge of the  strength with which true love has mastered any individual nor how  far change may be possible and on the other hand unless there  were full appreciation of ellens character she might only have  been looked on as    puppet to a fathers threat servile to a shrewish tongue   yet after all frank fordyce was very kind to griff making himself  as much of a medium of communication as he could consistently with  his conscience but of course not satisfying one who believed that  the strength of love was to be proved not by obedience but  disobedience  ellens letters showed increasing anxiety about her grandfather who  was not favourably affected by the change of habits consequent on a  long journey and staying in different houses  his return was fixed  two or three times and then delayed by slight attacks of illness  till at last he became anxious to get home and set off about the  end of september but after sleeping a night at an inn at warwick  he was too ill to proceed any farther  his old manservant was with  him but poor ellen went through a great deal of suspense and  responsibility before her parents reached her  the attack was  paralysis and he never recovered the full powers of mind or body  though they managed to bring him back to hillsideas indeed his  restlessness longed for his native home  when once there he became  calmer but did not rally and a second stroke proved fatal just  before easter  he was mourned alike by rich and poor he was a  gentleman said even chapman always the same to rich or poor  though he was one of they fordys  my father wrote to summon both his elder sons to the funeral at  hillside and in due time clarence appeared by the coach but alone   he had gone to griffiths chambers to arrange about coming down  together but found my fathers letter lying unopened on the table  and learnt that his brother was supposed to be staying at a villa in  surrey where there were to be private theatricals  he had  forwarded the letter thither and it would still be possible to  arrive in time by the night mail  so entirely was griff expected that the gig was sent to meet him at  seven oclock the next morning but there was no sign of him  my  father and clarence went without him to the gathering which showed  how deeply the good old man was respected and loved  it was the only funeral clarence had attended except miss newtons  hurried one and his sensitive spirit was greatly affected  he had  learnt reserve when amongst others but i found that he had a strong  foreboding of evil he tossed and muttered in his sleep and  confessed to having had a wretched night of dreams though he would  not describe them otherwise than that he had seen the lady whose  face he always looked on as a presage of evil  two days later the morning post gave a full account of the amateur  theatricals at bella vista the seat of benjamin bullock esquire  and the lady louisa bullock and in the list of dramatis personae  there figured griffith winslow esquire as captain absolute and  the fair and accomplished lady peacock as lydia languish  amateur theatricals were much less common in those days than at  present and were held as the ne plus ultra of gaiety  moreover  the lady louisa bullock was noted for fashionable extravagance of  the semireputable style and there would have been vexation enough  at griffiths being her guest even had not the performance taken  place on the very day of the funeral of ellens grandfather so as  to be an outrage on decorum  at the same time there came a packet franked by a not very  satisfactory peer brother to lady louisa  my father threw a note  over to clarence and proceeded to read a very properly expressed  letter full of apologies and condolences for the fordyces  he could not have got the letter in time was my fathers comment   when did you forward the letter  how was it addressed  clarence  i say didnt you hear  clarence lifted up his face from his letter so much flushed that my  mother broke inwhats the matter  a mistake in the posttown  would account for the delay  has he had the letter  oh yes  not in timeeh  im afraid and he faltered he did  did he or did he not demanded my mother  what does he say exclaimed my father  sir always an unpropitious beginning for poor clarence i  should prefer not showing you  nonsense exclaimed my mother  you do no good by concealing it  let me see his letter said my father in the voice there was no  gainsaying and absolutely taking it from clarence  none of us will  ever forget the tone in which he read it aloud at the breakfast table   dear billwhat possessed you to send a deathshead to the feast   the letter would have bitten no one in my chambers  a nice scrape i  shall be in if you let out that your officious precision forwarded  it  of course at the last moment i could not upset the whole affair  and leave lydia to languish in vain  the whole thing went off  magnificently  keep counsel and no harm is done  you owe me that  for sending on the letteryours  j g w   clarence had not read to the end when the letter was taken from him   indeed to inclose such a note in a dispatch sure to be opened en  famille was one of griffiths haphazard proceedings which arose  from the present being always much more to him than the absent   clarence was much shocked at hearing these last sentences and  exclaimed he meant it in confidence papa i implore you to treat  it as unread  my father was always scrupulous about private letters and said i  beg your pardon clarence i should not have forced it from you  i  wish i had not seen it  my mother gave something between a snort and a sigh  it is right  for us to know the truth she said but that is enough  there is  no need that they should know at hillside what was griffiths  alternative  i would not add a pang to that dear girls grief said my father  but i see the fordyces were right  i shall never do anything to  bring these two together again  my mother chimed in with something about preferring lady peacock and  the bella vista crew to ellen and hillside which made us rush into  the breach with incoherent defence  i know how it was said clarence  his acting is capital and of  course these people could not spare him nor understand how much it  signified that he should be here  they make so much of him  who do asked my mother  lady peacock  how do you know  have  you been with them  i have dined at mr clarksons clarence avowed and on further  pressure it was extracted that griffithhandsome and with talents  such as tell in societywas a general favourite and much engrossed  by people who found him an enlivenment and ornament to their  parties  there had been little or nothing of late of the former  noisy boyish dissipation but that the more fashionable varieties  were getting a hold on him became evident under the cross questioning to which clarence had to submit  my father said he felt like a party to a falsehood when he sent  griffs letter up to hillside and he indemnified himself by writing  a letter more indignantnot than was just but than was prudent  especially in the case of one little accustomed to strong censure   indeed clarence could not restrain a slight groan when he perceived  that our mother was shut up in the study to assist in the  composition  her denunciations always outran my fathers and her  pain showed itself in bitterness  i ought to have had the presence  of mind to refuse to show the letter he said griff will hardly  forgive me  ellen looked very thin and with a transparent delicacy of  complexion  she had greatly grieved over her grandfathers illness  and the first change in her happy home and she must have been much  disappointed at griffiths absence  emily dreaded her mention of  the subject when they first met  but said my sister she said no word of him  all she cared to  tell me was of the talks she had with her grandfather when he made  her read his favourite chapters in the bible and though he had no  memory for outside things his thoughts were as beautiful as ever   sometimes his face grew so full of glad contemplation that she felt  quite awestruck as if it were becoming like the face of an angel   it made her realise she said how little the ups and downs of this  life matter if there can be such peace at the last  and after  all i could not help thinking that it was better perhaps that griff  did not come  any other sort of talk would have jarred on her just  now and you know he would never stand much of that  much as we loved our griff we had come to the perception that ellen  was a treasure he could not esteem properly  the lester cousins never remarkable for good taste forced on her  the knowledge of his employment  her father could not refrain from  telling us that her exclamation had been poor griff how shocked  he must be  he was so fond of dear grandpapa  pray papa get mr  winslow to let him know that i am not hurt for i know he could not  help it  or may i ask emily to tell him so  i wish mrs fordyce would have absolved her from the promise not to  mention griff to us  that innocent reliance might have touched him  as emily would have narrated it but it only rendered my father more  indignant and more resolved to reserve the message till a repentant  apology should come  and alas none ever came  just wrath on a  voiceless paper has little effect  there is reason to believe that  griff did not like the air of my fathers letter and never even  read it  he diligently avoided clarence and the pain and shame his  warm heart must have felt only made him keep out of reach    chapter xxxifacilis descensus    the slippery verge her feet beguiled    she tumbled headlong in  gray  one of griffiths briefest notes in his largest hand announced that  he had accepted various invitations to country houses for cricket  matches archery meetings and the like nor did he even make it  clear where his address would be except that he would be with a  friend in scotland when grouseshooting began  clarence however came home for a brief holiday  he was startled  at the first sight of ellen  he said she was indeed lovelier than  ever with an added sweetness in her clear eyes and the wild rose  flush in her delicate cheek but that she looked as if she was being  refined away to nothing and was more than ever like the vision with  the lamp  of course the fordyces had not been going into society though ellen  and emily were as much together as before helping one another in  practising their school children in singing and sharing in one  anothers studies and pursuits  there had been in the spring a  change at wattlesea the old incumbent died and the new one was  well reported of as a very earnest hardworking man  he seemed to be  provided with a large family and there was no driving into  wattlesea without seeing members of it scattered about the place  the fordyces being anxious to show them attention without a regular  dinnerparty decided on inviting all the family to keep annes  ninth birthday and emily and martyn were of course to come and  assist at the entertainment  it was on the morning of the day fixed that a letter came to me  whose contents seemed to burn themselves into my brain  martyn  called across the breakfasttable look at edward  has any one  sent you a young basilisk  i wish it was i gasped out  dont look so entreated emily  tell us  is it griff  not illhurt cried my mother  oh no no  worse and then  somehow i articulated that he was married and clarence exclaimed  not the peacock and at my gesture my father broke out  he has  done for himself the unhappy boy  a disgraceful scotch marriage   eh  it was his sense of honour i managed to utter  sense of fiddlestick said my poor father  dont stop to excuse  him  weve had enough of that  let us hear  i cannot give a copy of the letter  it was so painful that it was  destroyed for there was a tone of bravado betraying his uneasiness  but altogether unbecoming  all that it disclosed was that some one  staying in the same house had paid insulting attentions to lady  peacock she had thrown herself on our brothers protection and  after interfering on her behalf he had found that there was no  means of sheltering her but by making her his wife  this had been  effected by the assistance of the lady of the house where they had  been staying and griffith had written to me two days later from  edinburgh declaring that selina had only to be known to be loved  and to overcome all prejudices  prejudices said my father bitterly  prejudices in favour of  truth and honour  and my mother uttered the worst reproach of all when in my  agitation i slipped and almost fell in risingoh my poor edward  that i should have lived to think yours the least misfortune that  has befallen my sons  nay mother said clarence putting martyn toward her here is  one to make up for us all  clarence said my father your mother did not mean anything but  that you and edward are the comfort of our lives  i wish there were  a chance of griffith redeeming the past as you have done but i see  no hope of that  a man is never ruined till he is married  at that moment there was a step in the hall a knock at the door  and there stood mr frank fordyce  he looked at us and said it is  true then  to our shame and sorrow it is said my father  fordyce how can  we look you in the face  as my dear good friend and my fathers said the kind man  shaking him by the hand heartily  do you think we could blame you  for this youths conduct  stayfor we young ones were about to  leave the room  my poor girl knows nothing yet  her mother  luckily got the letter in her bedroom  we cant put off the  reynoldses you know so i came to ask the young people to come up  as if nothing had happened and then ellen need know nothing till  the day is over  if i can said emily  you can be capable of selfcommand i hope said my mother  severely or you do not deserve to be called a friend  such speeches might not be pleasant but they were bracing and we  all withdrew to leave the elders to talk it over together when as  i believe kind parson frank was chiefly concerned to argue my  parents out of their shame and humiliation  clarence told us what he knew or guessed and we afterwards  understood the matter to have come about chiefly through poor  griffs weakness of character and love of amusement and flattery   the boyish flirtation with selina clarkson had never entirely died  away though it had been nothing more than the elder womans  bantering patronage and easy acceptance of the youths equally gay  jesting admiration  it had however involved some raillery on his  attachment to the little methodistical country girl and this  gradually grew into jealousy of herespecially as griff became more  of a man and a brilliant member of society  the detention from the  funeral had been a real victory on the widows part and the few  times when clarence had seen them together he had been dismayed at  the cavaliere serviente terms on which griff seemed to stand but  his words of warning were laughed down  the rest was easy to  gather  he had gone about on the round of visits almost as an  appendage to lady peacock till they came to a free and easy house  where her coquetry and love of admiration brought on one of those  disputes which rendered his championship needful and such defence  could only have one conclusion especially in scotland where hasty  private marriages were still legal  what an exchange  only had  griff ever comprehended the worth of his treasure  emily went as late as she could that there might be the less chance  of a teteatete in which she might be surprised into a betrayal of  her secret  indeed she only started at last when martyns  impatience had become intolerable  what was our amazement when much earlier than we expected we saw  mr fordyce driving up in his phaeton and heard the story he had to  tell  emilys delay had succeeded in bringing her only just in time for  the luncheon that was to be the childrens dinner  there was a  keenlooking active sallow clergyman grizzled and with an air of  having seen much service a pale worn wife with a gentle sensible  face and a bewildering flock of boys and girls all apparently  under the command of a very brisk effectivelooking elder sister of  fourteen or fifteen who seemed to be the readiest authority and to  decide what and how much each might partake of among delicacies  evidently rare novelties  the day was late in august  the summer had broken there had been  rain and though fine the temperature was fitter for active sports  than anything else  croquet was not yet invented and besides  most of the party were of the age for regular games at play  ellen  and emily did their part in starting thesefinding however that  the reynolds boys were rather rough in spite of the objurgations of  their sister who evidently thought herself quite beyond the age for  romps  the sports led them to the great homefield on the opposite  slope of the ridge from our own  the new farmbuildings were on the  level ground at the bottom to the right where the declivity was  much more gradual than to the left which was very steep and ended  in furze bushes and low copsewood  it was voted a splendid place  for hideandseek and the game was soon in such full career that  ellen who had had quite running enough could fall out of it and  with her the other two elder girls  emily felt fanny reynolds  presence a sort of protection little guessing what she was up to  to use her own expression  perhaps the girl had not earlier made  out who emily was or she had been too much absorbed in her cares  but as the three sat resting on a stump overlooking the hill she  was prompted by the singular inopportuneness of precocious fourteen  to observe i ought to have congratulated you miss winslow  emily gabbled out thank you never mind hoping thus to put a  stop to whatever might be coming but there was no such good  fortune  we saw it in the paper  it is your brother isnt it  what asked unsuspicious ellen thinking no doubt of some fresh  glory to griffith  and before emily could utter a word if there were any she could  have uttered out it came  the marriagejohn griffith winslow  esquire eldest son of john edward winslow of chantry house to  selina relict of sir henry peacock and daughter of george clarkson  esquire qc  i didnt think it could be you at first because you  would have been at the wedding  emily had not even time to meet ellens eyes before they were  startled by a shriek that was not the merry whoop and i spy of  the game and springing up the girls saw little anne fordyce  rushing headlong down the very steepest part of the slope just  where it ended in an extremely muddy pool the wateringplace of the  cattle  the child was totally unable to stop herself and so was  martyn who was dashing after her  not a word was said though  perhaps there was a shriek or two but the elder sisters flew with  one accord towards the pond  they also were some way above it but  at some distance off so that the descent was not so perpendicular  and they could guard against overrunning themselves  ellen  perhaps from knowing the ground better was far before the other  two but already poor little anne had gone straight down and fallen  flat on her face in the water martyn after her perhaps with a  little more free will for though he too fell he was already  struggling to lift anne up and had her head above water when ellen  arrived and dashed in to assist  the pond began by being shallow but the bottom sloped down into a  deep hollow and was besides covered several feet deep with heavy  cattletrodden mire and weeds in which it was almost impossible to  gain a footing or to move  by the time emily and miss reynolds had  come to the brink ellen and martyn were standing up in the water  leaning against one another and holding poor little annes head up all they could do  ellen called out dont dont come in  call  some one  the farm  we are sinking in  you cant help  call  the danger was really terrible of their sinking in the mud and  weeds and being sucked into the deep part of the pool and they  were too far in to be reached from the bank  emily perceived this  and ran as she had never run before happily meeting on the way with  the gentlemen who had been inspecting the new model farmbuildings  and had already taken alarm from the screams  they found the three still with their heads above water but no  more for every struggle to get up the slope only plunged them  deeper in the horrible mud  moreover fanny reynolds was up to her  ankles in the mud holding by one of her brothers but unable to  reach martyn  it seems she had had some idea of forming a chain of  hands to pull the others out  even now the rescue was not too easy  mr fordyce hurried in and  took anne in his arms but even with his height and strength he  found his feet slipping away under him and could only hand the  little insensible girl to mr reynolds bidding him carry her at  once to the house while he lifted martyn up only just in time and  ellen clung to him  thus weighted he could not get out till the  bailiff and another man had brought some faggots and a gate that  were happily near at hand and helped him to drag the two out  perfectly exhausted and martyn hardly conscious  they both were  carried to the rectoryellen by her father martyn by the  foremanand they were met at the door by the tidings that little  anne was coming to herself  indeed by the time mr fordyce had put on dry clothes all three  were safe in warm beds and quite themselves again so that he  trusted that no mischief was done though he decided upon fetching  my mother to satisfy herself about martyn  however a ducking was  not much to a healthy fellow like martyn and my mother found him  quite fit to dress himself in the clothes she brought and to return  home with her  both the girls were asleep but ellen had had a  shivering fit and her mother was with her and was anxious  emily  told her mother of fanny reynolds unfortunate speech and it was  thought right to mention it  mrs fordyce listened kindly kissed  emily and told her not to be distressed for possibly it might turn  out to have been the best thing for ellen to have learnt the fact at  such a moment and at any rate it had spared her parents some  doubt and difficulty as to the communication    chapter xxxiiwaly waly    and am i then forgot forgot it broke the heart of ellen  campbell  clarence and martyn walked over to hillside the first thing the next  morning to inquire for the two sisters  as to one they were  quickly reassured for anne was in the porch feeding the doves and  no sooner did she see them than out she flew and was clinging round  martyns neck her hat falling back as she kissed him on both  cheeks with an eagerness that made him as clarence reported turn  the colour of a lobster and look shy not to say sheepish while  she exclaimed  oh martyn mamma says she never thanked you for  you really and truly did save my life and i am so glad it was you   it was not i it was ellen gruffly muttered martyn  oh yes but papa says i should have been smothered in that horrid  mud before ellen could get to me if you had not pulled me up  directly  the elders came out by this time and clarence was able to get in  his inquiry  ellen had had a feverish night and her chest seemed  oppressed but her mother did not think her seriously ill  once she  had asked is it true what fanny reynolds said and on being  answered yes my dear i am afraid it is she had said no more  and as the fordyce habit of treating colds was with sedatives her  mother thought her scarcely awake to the full meaning of the  tidings and hoped to prevent her dwelling on them till she had  recovered the physical shock  having answered these inquiries the  two parents turned upon martyn who in an access of shamefacedness  had crept behind clarence and a great orangetree and was thence  pulled out by annes vigorous efforts  the full story had come to  light  the reynolds boys had grown boisterous as soon as the  restraint of the young ladies participation had been removed and  had whether intentionally or not terrified little anne in the  chases of hideandseek  finally one of them had probably been  unable to withstand the temptation of seeing her timid nervous way  of peeping and prying about and had without waiting to be properly  found leapt out of his lair with a roar that scared the little girl  nearly out of her wits and sent her flying she knew not whither   martyn was a few steps behind only not holding her hand because  the other children had derided her for clinging to his protection   he had instantly seen where she was going and shouted to her to  stop and take care but she was past attending to him and he had no  choice but to dart after her seeing what was inevitable while  george reynolds had sense to stop in time and seek a safer descent   had martyn not been there to raise the child instantly from the  stifling mud her sister could hardly have been in time to save her  mrs fordyce tearfully kissed him her husband called him a little  hero as if in joke then gravely blessed him and he looked  clarence related as if he had been in the greatest possible  disgrace  it was the second time that one of us had saved a life from  drowning but there was none of the exultation we had felt that time  before in london  it was a much graver feeling where the danger  had really been greater and the rescue had been of one so dear to  us  it was tempered likewise by anxiety about our dear ellenours  alas no longer  she was laid up for several days and it was  thought better that she should not see emily till she had recovered  but after a week had passed her father drove over to discuss some  plans for the poorlaw arrangements and begged my sister to go back  in the carriage and spend the day with his daughter  we brothers could now look forward to some real intelligence we  became restless and in the afternoon clarence and i set out with  the donkeychair on the woodland path to meet emily  we gained more  than we had hoped for as we came round one of the turns in the  winding path up the hanging beechwood we came on the two friends ellen a truly unalike figure in her white dress with her black  scarf making a sable stole  perhaps we betrayed some confusion for  there was a bright flush on her cheeks as she came towards us and  standing straight up said clarence edward i am so glad you are  here i wanted to see you  i wantedto sayi know he could not  help it  it was his generosityhelping those that need it and andim not angry  and though thats all over youll always be my  brothers wont you  she held her outstretched hands to us both  i could not help it i  drew her down and kissed her brow clarence clasped her other hand  and held it to his lips but neither of us could utter a word  she turned back and went quietly away through the wood while emily  sank down under the beechtree in a paroxysm of grief  you may see  which it was for clarence cut out e m f 1835 upon the bark   he soothed and caressed poor emily as in old nursery troubles and  presently she told us that it would be long before we saw that dear  one again for mrs fordyce was going to take her away on the  morrow  mrs fordyce had seen emily in private before letting her go to  ellen  there was evidently a great wish to be kind  mrs fordyce  said she could never forget what she owed to us all and could not  think of blaming any of us  but she said you are a sensible  girl emilyhow i hate being called a sensible girl observed  the poor child in parenthesisand you must see that it is  desirable not to encourage her to indulge in needless discussion  after she once understands the facts  she added that she thought a  cessation of present intercourse would be wise till the sore was in  some degree healed  she had not been satisfied about her daughters  health for some time and meant to take her to bath the next day to  consult a physician and then decide what would be best  and my  dear she said if there should be a slackening of correspondence  do not take it as unkindness but as a token that my poor child is  recovering her tone  do not discontinue writing to her but be  guarded and perhaps less rapid in replying  it was for her friendship that poor emily wept so bitterlythe  first friendship that had been an enthusiasm to her looking at it  as a cruel injustice that griffs misdoing should separate them   the prediction that all might be lived down and forgotten was too  vague and distant to be much consolation indeed we were too young  to take it in  we had it all over again in a somewhat grotesque form when at  another turn in the wood we came upon martyn and anne loaded with  treasures from their robbers cave some of which were bestowed in  my chair the others carried off between anne and her not very  willing nurserymaid  anne kissed us all round and augured cheerfully that she should lay  up a store of shells and rocks by the seaside to make a perfect  robinson crusoe cavern she said and then clarence can come and  be the spaniards and the savages  but that wont be till next  summer she added shaking her head  i shall get ellen to tell  emily what shells i find and then she can tell martyn for mamma  says girls never write to boys unless they are their brothers  and  now martyn will never be my brother she added ruefully  you will always be our darling i said  thats not the same as your sister she answered  however amid  auguries of the combination of robbers and robinson crusoe the  parting was effected and anne borne off by the maid while we had  martyn on our hands stamping about and declaring that it was very  hard that because griff chose to be a faithless inconstant ruffian  all his pleasure and comfort in life should be stopped  he said  such outrageous things that between scolding him and laughing at  him emily had been somewhat cheered by the time we reached the  house  my father had written to griffith in his first displeasure curt  wishes that he might not have reason to repent of the step he had  taken though he had not gone the right way to obtain a blessing   as it was not suitable that a man should be totally dependent on his  wife his allowance should be continued but under present  circumstances he must perceive that he and lady peacock could not be  received at chantry house  we were shown the letter and thought it  terribly brief and cold but my mother said it would be weak to  offer forgiveness that was not sought and my father was specially  exasperated at the absence of all contrition as to the treatment of  ellen  all griff had vouchsafed on that head wasthe rupture had  been the fordyces doing he was not bound  as to intercourse with  him clarence and i might act as we saw fit  only said my father as clarence was leaving home i trust you  not to get yourself involved in this set  clarence gave a queer smile they would not take me as a gift  papa  and as my father turned from the hall door he laid his hand on his  wifes arm and said who would have told us what that young fellow  would be to us  she sighed and said he is not twentythree he has plenty of  money and is very fond of griff    chapter xxxiiithe rivers bank    and my friend rose up in the shadows    and turned to me be of good cheer i said faintly    for he called thee  b m  mr fordyce waited at hillside till after sunday and then went to  bath to hear the verdict of the physician  he returned as much  depressed as it was in his sanguine nature to be for great delicacy  of the lungs had been detected and to prevent the recent chill from  leaving permanent injury ellen must have a winter abroad and warm  sea or mountain air at once  whether the disease were  constitutional and would have come on at all events no one could  tell  consumption was much less understood half a century ago codliver  oil was unknown and stethoscopes were new inventions only used by  the more advanced of the faculty  the only escape poor parson frank  had from accepting the doom was in disbelieving that a thing like a  trumpet could really reveal the condition of the chest  moreover  mrs fordyce had had a brother who had under the famous cowhouse  cure recovered enough to return home and be killed by the  upsetting of a stage coach  mrs fordyce took her daughter to lyme and waited there till her  husband had found a curate and made all arrangements  it must have  been very inconvenient not to come home but no doubt she wanted  to prevent any more partings  then they went abroad travelling  slowly and seeing all the sights that came in their way to  distract ellens thoughts  she was not allowed to hear what ailed  her but believed her languor and want of interest in everything to  be the effect of the blow she had received struggling to exert  herself and to enter gratefully into the enjoyments provided for  her  she was not prevented from writing to emily indeed no one  liked to hinder anything she wished but they were guidebook  letters describing all she saw as a kind of duty but scarcely  concealing the trouble it was to look  such sentences would slip  out as this is a nice quiet place and i am happy to say there is  nothing that one ought to see  or i sat in the cathedral at  lucerne while the others were going round  the organ was playing  and it was such rest  or again after a day on the lago di como  it was glorious and if you and edward were here perhaps the  beauty would penetrate my sluggish soul  ellens sluggish soulwhen we remembered her keen ecstasy at the  valley of rocks  those letters were our chief interest in an autumn which seemed  dreary to us in spite of friendly visitors for had not our family  hope and joy been extinguished  there was no direct communication  with griffith after his unpleasant reply to my fathers letter but  clarence saw the newly married pair on their return to lady  peacocks house in london and reported that they were very kind and  friendly to him and gave him more invitations than he could accept   being crossexamined when he came home for christmas he declared  his conviction that lady peacock had married griff entirely from  affection and that he had beenwellflattered into it  they  seemed very fond of each other now and were launching out into all  sorts of gaieties but though he did not tell my father he confided  to me that he feared that griffith had been disappointed in the  amount of fortune at his wifes disposal  it was at that christmas time one night having found an intrusive  cat upon my bed clarence carried her out at the back door close to  his room and came back in haste and rather pale  it is quite true  about the lady and the light being seen out of doors he said in an  awestricken voice i have just seen her flit from the mullion room  to the ruin  we only noted the fact in that ghostdiary of ourswe told nobody  and looked no more  we already believed that these appearances on  the lawn must be the cause that every window up to the attics on  the garden side of the house were so heavily shuttered and barred  that there was no opening them without noise  indeed those on the  ground floor had in addition bells attached to them  no doubt the  former inhabitants had done their best to prevent any one from  seeing or inquiring into what was unacknowledged and unaccountable   it might be only a coincidence but we could not help remarking that  we had seen and heard nothing of her during the engagement which  might have united the two families though of course it would be  ridiculous to suppose her cognisant of it like the white lady of  avenel dancing for joy at marys marriage with halbert glendinning  the fordyces had settled at florence where they suffered a great  deal more from cold than they would have done at hillside and there  was such a cessation of ellens letters that emily feared that mrs  fordyce had attained her wish and separated the friends effectually   however frank fordyce beguiled his enforced leisure with long  letters to my father on home business austrian misgovernment and  the italian church and people full of shrewd observations and new  lights and one of these ended thus my poor lassie has been in bed  for ten days with a severe cold  she begs me to say that she has  begun a letter to emily and hopes soon to finish it  we had  thought her gaining ground but she is sadly pulled down  fiat  voluntas  the letter which had been begun never came but after three long  weeks there was one from the dear patient herself mentioning her  illness and declaring that it was so comfortable to be allowed to  be tired and to go nowhere and see nothing except the fragment of  beautiful blue sky and the corner of a campanile and the flowers  anne brought in daily  as soon as she could be moved they took her to genoa where she  revived enough to believe that she should be well if she were at  home again and to win from her parents a promise to take her to  hillside as soon as the spring winds were over  so anxious was she  that as soon as there was any safety in travelling the party began  moving northwards going by sea to marseilles to avoid the corniche  so early in the year  there were many fluctuations and it was only  her earnest yearning for home and strong resolution that could have  made her parents persevere but at last they were at hillside just  after whitsuntide in the last week of may  frank fordyce walked over to see us on the very evening after their  arrival  he was much altered his kindly handsome face looked  almost as if he had gone through an illness and indeed apart from  all his anxiety and sorrow he had pined in foreign parts for his  human flock as well as his bullocks and his turnips  he had also  read thought and observed a great deal and had left his long  boyhood behind him during a space for study and meditation such as  he had never had before  he was quite hopeless of his daughters recovery and made no secret  of it  in passing through london the best advice had been taken  but only to obtain the verdict that the case was beyond all skill  and that it was only a matter of weeks when all that could be done  was to give as much gratification as possible  the one thing that  ellen did care about was to be at hometo have emily with her and  once more see her school children her church and her garden   tired as she was she had sprung up in the carriage at the first  glimpse of hillside spire and had leant forward at the window  nodding and smiling her greetings to all the villagers  she had been taken at once to her room and her bed but her father  had promised to beg emily to come up by noon on the morrow  then he  sat talking of local matters not able to help showing what infinite  relief it was to him to be at home and what music to his ears was  the somersetshire dialect and deep english voice after all those  thin shrill screeching foreigners  poor emily  it was in mingled grief and gladness that she set off  the next day with the trepidation of one to whom sickness and decay  were hitherto unknown  when she returned it was in a different  mood unable to believe the doctors could be right and in the  delight of having her own bright sweet ellen back again all  herself  they had talked but more of home and village than of  foreign experiences and though ellen did not herself assist she  had much enjoyed watching the unpacking of the numerous gifts which  had cost a perfect fortune at the custom house  no one seemed  forgottenvillagers children servants friends  some of these  tokens are before me still  the florentine mosaic paperweight she  brought me presses this very sheet the antique lamp she gave my  father is on the mantelpiece clarences engraving of raffaelles  st michael hangs opposite to me on the wall  most precious in our  eyes was the collection of plants dried and labelled by herself  which she brought to emily and mepoor mummies now but redolent of  undying affection  her desire was to bestow all her keepsakes with  her own hands and in most cases she actually did soa few daily  as her strength served her  the little figures in costume coloured  prints swiss carvings french knicknacks are preserved in many a  hillside cottage as treasured relics of our young lady  many  years later martyn recognised a hillside native in a back street in  london by a little purpleblue picture of vesuvius and thereby  reached the soft spot in a nearly driedup heart  so bright and playful was the dear girl over all her old familiar  interests that we inexperienced beings believed not only that the  wound to her affections was healed but that she either did not know  or did not realise the sentence that had been pronounced on her but  when this was repeated to her mother it was met by a sad smile and  the reply that we only saw her in her best hours  still through  the summer it was impossible to us to accept the truth she looked  so lovely was so cheerful and took such delight in all that was  about her  with the first cold however she seemed to shrivel up and the bad  nights extended into the days  emily ascribed the change to the  lack of going out into the air and always found reasons for the  increased languor and weakness till at last there came a day when  my poor little sister seemed as if the truth had broken upon her for  the first time when ellen talked plainly to her of their parting  and had asked us both her dear brother and sister to be with her  at her communion on all saints day  she had written a little letter to clarence begging his forgiveness  for having cut him and treated him with the scorn which i believe  was the chief fault that weighed upon her conscience and hearing  my fathers voice in the house she sent a message to beg him to  come and see her in her mothers dressingroomthat very window  where i had first heard her voice refusing to come down to those  winslows  she had sent for him to entreat him to forgive griffith  and recall the pair to chantry house  not now she said but  when i am gone  my father could deny her nothing though he showed that the sight of  her made the entreaty all the harder to him and she pleaded but  you know this was not his doing  i never was strong and it had  begun before  only think how sad it would have been for him  my father would have promised anything with that wasted hand on his  those fervent eyes gazing on him and he told her he would have  given his pardon long ago if it had been sought as it never had  been  ah perhaps he did not dare she said  wont you write when all  this is over and then you will be one family again as you used to  be  he promised though he scarcely knew where griffith was  clarence  however did  he had answered ellens letter and it had made him  ask for a few days leave of absence  so he came down on the  saturday and was allowed a quarter of an hour beside ellens sofa  in the sunday evening twilight  he brought away the calm rapt  expression i had sometimes seen on his face at church and ellen  made a special entreaty that he might share the morrows feast  there are some things that cannot be written of and that was one   still we had not thought the end near at hand though on tuesday  morning a message was sent that ellen was suffering and exhausted  and could not see emily  it was a wild stormy day with fierce  showers of sleet and we clung to the hope that consideration for my  sister had prompted the message  in the afternoon clarence battled  with a severe gale made his way to hillside and heard that the  weather affected the patient and that there was much bodily  distress  for one moment he saw her father who said in broken  accents that we could only pray that the spirit might be freed  without much more suffering though no doubt it is all right  before daylight before any one in the house was up clarence was  mounting the hill in the gusts that had done their work on the trees  and were subsiding with the darkness  and just as he was beginning  the descent as the sun tipped the hillside steeple with light he  heard the knell and counted the twentyone for the years of our  ellenfor ours she will always be  somehow he told me i could not help taking off my hat and  giving thanks for her and then all the drops on all the boughs  began sparkling and there was a hush on all around as if she were  passing among the angels and a thrush broke out into a regular song  of jubilee    chapter xxxivnot in vain    then cheerly to your work again    with hearts new braced and set to run untired loves blessed race as meet for those who face to face    over the grave their lord have met  keble  that dying request could not but be held sacred and overtures were  made to griffith who returned an odd sort of answer friendly and  affectionate but rather as if my father were the offending party in  need of forgiveness  he and his wife were obliged for the  invitation but could not accept it as they had taken a house near  meltonmowbray for the hunting season and were entertaining  friends  in some ways it was disappointing in others it was a relief not to  have the restraint of lady peacocks presence during the last days  we were to have with the fordyces  for a fresh loss came upon us   beachharbour was a fishingvillage on the northwestern coast  which within the previous decade had sprung into importance on  the one hand as a fashionable resort on the other as a minor port  for colliers  the living was wretchedly poor and had been held for  many years by one of the old inferior stamp of clergy scarcely  superior in habits or breeding to the farmers and only outliving  the scandals of his youth to fall into a state of indolent  carelessness  it was in the gift of a child for whom sir horace  lester was trustee and that gentleman had written about a  fortnight before ellens death to consult mr fordyce on its  disposal declaring the great difficulties and deficiencies of the  place which made it impossible to offer it to any one without  considerable private means and also able to attract and improve the  utterly demoralised population  he ended almost in joke by  saying in fact i know no one who could cope with the situation  but yourself i wish you could find me your own counterpart or come  yourself in earnest  it is just the air that suits my sister bracing seabreezes the parsonage though a wretched place is well  situated and she would be all the stronger but in poor ellens  state there is no use in talking of it and besides i know you are  wedded to your fertile fields and somersetshire clowns  that letter afterwards shown to us had worked on mr fordyces  mind during those mournful days  he was still young enough to leave  behind him parson frank and the squarson habits of hillside in  which he had grown up and the higher and more spiritual side of his  nature had been fostered by the impressions of the last year  he  was conscious as he said that his talk had been overmuch of  bullocks and that his farm had engrossed him more than he wished  should happen again though a change would be tearing himself up by  the roots and as to his own people at hillside the curate an  active young man had well supplied his place and in his truly  humble opinion though by no means in theirs introduced several  improvements even in that model parish  what had moved him most however was a conversation he had had with  ellen with whom during this last year he had often held deep and  serious counsel with a growing reverence on his side  he had read  her uncles letter to her and to his great surprise found that she  looked on it as a call  devotedly fond as she herself was of  hillside she could see that her fathers abilities were wasted on  so small a field in a manner scarcely good for himself and she had  been struck with the greater force of his sermons when preaching to  educated congregations abroad  if no one else could or would take  efficient charge of these beachharbour souls she could see that it  would weigh on his conscience to take comparative ease in his own  beloved meadows among a flock almost his vassals  moreover she  relieved his mind about her mother  she had discovered what the  good wife kept out of sight that the northcountry woman never  could entirely have affinities with the south and she had come to  the conclusion that mrs fordyces spirits would be heavily tried by  settling down at hillside in the altered state of things  after this talk mr fordyce had suggested a possible incumbent to  his brotherinlaw but left the matter open and when sir horace  came down to the funeral it was more thoroughly discussed and as  soon as mrs fordyce saw that departure would not break her  husbands heart she made no secret of the way that both her opinion  and her inclinations lay  she told my mother that she had always  believed her own illhealth was caused by the southern climate and  that she hoped that anne would grow up stronger than her sister in  the northern breezes  poor little anne  of all the family to her the change was the  greatest grief  the tour on the continent had been a dull affair to  her she was of the age to weary of long confinement in the carriage  and in strange hotels and too young to appreciate grownup  sights  picturegalleries and cathedrals were only a drag to her  and if the experiences that were put into rosellas mouth for the  benefit of her untravelled sisters could have been written down  they would have been as unconventional as mark twains adventures   rosella went through the whole tour and left a leg behind in the  hinge of a door but in compensation brought home a paris bonnet and  mantle  she seemed to have been her young mistresss chief comfort  next to an occasional game of play with her father or a walk  looking in at the shop windows and watching marionettes or still  better the wonderful sports of brownlegged street children  without trying to make her speak french or italianin her eyes one  of the inflictions of the journey in those of her elders the one  benefit she might gain  she had missed the petting to which she had  been accustomed from her grandfather and from all of us and she had  absolutely counted the days till she could get home again and had  fallen into dire disgrace for fits of crying when ellens weakness  caused delays  martyns holidays had been a time of rapture to her  for there was no one to attend much to her at home and she was too  young to enter into the weight of anxiety so the two had run as  wild together as a gracious welltrained damsel of ten and a  fourteenyearold boy with tender chivalry awake in him could well  do  to be out of the way was all that was asked of her for the  time and all old delights such as the robbers cave were renewed  with fresh zest   it was the sweetest and the last   and though martyn was gone back to school the child felt the wrench  from home most severely  as she told me on one of those sorrowful  days she did think she had come back to live at dear dear little  hillside all the days of her life  poor child we became convinced  that this vehement attachment to griffiths brothers was one factor  in mrs fordyces desire to make a change that should break off  these habits of intimacy and dependence  pluralities had not become illegal and frank fordyce being still  the chief landholder in hillside and wishing to keep up his  connection with his people did not resign the rectory though he  put the curate into the house and let the farm  once or twice a  year he came to fulfil some of a landlords duties and was as  genial and affectionate as ever but more and more absorbed in the  needs of beachharbour and unconsciously showing his own growth in  devotion and activity while he brought his splendid health and  vigour his talent his wealth and above all his winning charm of  manner and address to that magnificent work at beachharbour well  known to all of you though perhaps you never guessed that the  foundation of all those churches and their grand dependent works of  piety mercy and beneficence was laid in one young girls grave  i  never heard of a fresh achievement there without remembering how the  funeral psalm ends with    prosper thou the work of our hands upon us o prosper thou our handiwork   and emily  her drooping after the loss of her friend was sad but  it would have been sadder but for the spirit ellen had infused  we  found the herbs to heal our woe round our pathway though the first  joyousness of life had departed  the reports mr henderson and the  hillside curate brought from oxford were great excitements to us  and we thought and puzzled over church doctrine and tried to impart  it to our scholars  we i say for henderson had made me take a  lads class which has been the chief interest of my life  even the  roughest were good to their helpless teacher and some men as gray headed as myself still come every sunday to read with mr edward  and are among the most faithful friends of my life    chapter xxxvgriffs bird    shall such mean little creatures pretend to the fashion cousin turkey cock well may you be in a passion  the peacock at home  it was not till the second christmas after dear ellen fordyces  death that my eldest brother brought his wife and child to chantry  house after an urgent letter to lady peacock from my mother who  yearned for a sight of griffiths boy  i do not wish to dwell on that visit  selina or griffs bird as  martyn chose to term her was certainly handsome and stylish but  her complexion had lost freshness and delicacy and the ladies said  her colour was rouge and her fine figure due to other female  mysteries  she meant to be very gracious and patronised everybody  especially emily who she said would be quite striking if not  sacrificed by her dress and whom she much wished to take to london  engaging to provide her with a husband before the season was over  not for a moment believing my mothers assurance that it would be a  trial to us all whenever we had to resign our emily  nay she tried  to condole with the poor moped family slave and was received with  such hot indignation as made her laugh for to do her justice she  was goodnatured and easytempered  however i saw less of her than  did the others for i believe she thought the sight of me made her  ill  griff poor old fellow was heartily glad to be with us again  but quite under her dominion  he had lost his glow of youth and  grace of figure his complexion had reddened and no one would have  guessed him only a year older than clarence whose shoulders did  indeed reveal something of the desk but whose features though  pale were still fair and youthful  the boy was another clarence  not so much in compliment to his godfather as because it was the  most elegant name in the family and favoured an interesting belief  current among his mothers friends that the king had actually stood  sponsor to the uncle  poor little man his grandmother shut herself  into the bookroom and cried after her first sight of him  he was a  wretched pinched morsel of humanity though mamma and emily  detected wonderful resemblances i never saw them but then he  inherited his mothers repulsion towards me and roared doubly at  the sight of me  my mother held that he was the victim of selinas  dissipations and mismanagement of herself and him and gave many  matronly groans at his treatment by the smart flighty nurse who  waged one continual warfare with the household  accustomed to absolute supremacy in domestic matters it was very  hard for my mother to have her counsels and experience set at  naught and if she appealed to griff to find her notions treated  with the polite deference he might have shown to a cottage dame  a course of dinnerparties could not hinder her ladyship from  finding chantry house insufferably dull always like sunday and  when she found that we were given to saints day services her pity  and astonishment knew no bounds  it was all very well for a poor  object like edward she held but as to mr winslow and clarence  did they go for the sake of example  though to be sure clarence  might be a papist any day  popery instead of methodism was just beginning to be the bugbear  set up for those whom the world held to be ultrareligious and my  mother was so far disturbed at our interest in what was termed  oxford theology that the warning would have alarmed her if it had  come from any other quarter  however lady peacock was rather fond  of clarence and entertained him with schemes for improving chantry  house when it should have descended to griffith  the mullion rooms  were her special aversion and were all to be swept away together  with the vaultings and the ruinenough to give one the blues if  there were nothing else she averred  we really felt it to the credit of our country that sir george  eastwood sent an invitation to an early dance to please his young  daughters and for this our visitors prolonged their stay  my  mother made clarence go that she might have some one to take care  of her and emily since griff was sure to be absorbed by his lady   emily had not been to a ball since those gay days in london with  ellen  she shrank back from the contrast and would have begged  off but she was told that she must submit and though she said she  felt immeasurably older than at that happy time i believe she was  not above being pleased with the pale pink satin dress and wreath of  white jessamine which my father presented to her and in which  according to martyn she beat griffs bird all to shivers  clarence had grown much less bashful and embarrassed since the tooke  affair had given him a kind of position and a sense of not being a  general disgrace  he really was younger in some ways at fiveand twenty than at eighteen he enjoyed dancing and especially enjoyed  the compliments upon our sister whom in our usual fashion we viewed  as the belle of the ball  he was standing by my fire telling me  the various humours of the night when a succession of shrieks ran  through the house  he dashed away to see what was the matter and  returned in a few seconds saying that selina had seen some one in  the garden and neither she nor mamma would be satisfied without  examinationthough of course i know what it must be he added  as he drew on his coat  bill are you coming said griff at the door  you neednt if  you dont like it  i bet it is your old friend  im coming  im coming  im sure it is shouted martyn from  behind with the inconsistent addition ive got my gun  enough to dispose of any amount of robbers or phantoms either  observed griff as they went forth by the back door reinforced by  amos bell with a lantern in one hand and a poker in the other  my father was fortunately still asleep and my mother came down to  see whether i was frightened  she said she had no patience with selina and had left her to emily  and her maid but before many words had been spoken they all came  creeping down after her feeling safety in numbers or perhaps in  her entire fearlessness  the report of a gun gave us all a shock  and elicited another scream or two  my mother hoping that no one  was hurt hastened into the hall but only to meet griff hurrying  in laughing to reassure us with the tidings that it was only martyn  who had shot the old sundial by way of a robber and he was  presently followed by the others martyn rather crestfallen but  arguing with all his might that the sundial was exactly like a man  and my mother hurried every one off upstairs without further  discussion  clarence was rather white and when martyn demanded do you really  think it was the ghost  fancy her selection of the bird he  gravely answered martyn boy if it were it is not a thing to  speak of in that tone  you had better go to bed  martyn went off somewhat awed  clarence was cold and shivering  and stood warming himself  he was going to wind up his watch but  his hand shook and i did it for him noting the hourtwenty  minutes past one  it appeared that selina on going upstairs recollected that she had  left her purse in griffs sittingroom before going to dress and  had gone in quest of it  she heard strange shouts and screams  outside and going to one of the old windows where the shutters  were less unmanageable than elsewhere she beheld a woman rushing  towards the house pursued by at least a couple of men  filled with  terror she had called out and nearly fainted in griffs arms  it agrees with all we have heard before said clarence the very  day and hour  as martyn said the person is strange  villagers less concerned have seen the like he said and  indeed all unconsciously poor selina has cut away the hope of  redress he sighed  poor restless spirit would that i could do  anything for her  let me ask do you ever see her now  nno i suppose not but whenever i am anxious or worried the  trouble takes her form in my dreams  lady peacock had soon extracted the ghost story from her husband  and though she professed to be above the vulgar folly of belief in  it her nerves were so upset she said that nothing would have  induced her to sleep another night in the house  the rational  theory on this occasion was that one of the maids must have stolen  out to join in the christmas entertainment at the winslow arms and  been pursued home by some tipsy revellers but this explanation was  not productive of goodwill between the mother and daughterinlaw  since mamma had from the first so entirely suspected selinas smart  nurse as actually to have gone straight to the nursery on the plea  of seeing whether the baby had been frightened  the woman was found  asleepapparently sosaid my mother but all her clothes were in  an untidy heap on the floor which to my mother was proof conclusive  that she had slipped into the house in the confusion and settled  herself there  had not my mother with her own eyes watched from the  window her flirtations with the gardener and was more evidence  requisite to convict her  mamma entertained the hope that her  proposal would be adopted of herself taking charge of her grandson  and fattening his poor little cheeks on our cows milk while the  rest of the party continued their round of visits  lady peacock however treated it as a personal imputation that her  nurse should be accused instead of any servant of mrs winslows  own though as griff observed not only character but years and  features might alike acquit them of any such doings but even he  could not laugh long for it was no small vexation to him that such  offence should have arisen between his mother and wife  of course  there was no open quarrelmy mother had far too much dignity to  allow it to come to thatbut each said in private bitter things of  the other and my ladys manner of declining to leave her baby at  chantry house was almost offensive  poor griffith who had been growing more like himself every day  tried in vain to smooth matters and would have been very glad to  leave his child to my mothers management though of course he  acquitted the nurse of the midnight adventure  he privately owned  to us that he had no opinion of the woman but he defended her to my  mother in whose eyes this was tantamount to accusing her own  respectable maids since it was incredible that any rational person  could accept the phantom theory  gladly would he have been on better terms for he had had to confess  that his wifes fortune had turned out to be much less than common  report had stated or than her style of living justified and that  his marriage had involved him in a sea of difficulties so that he  had to beg for a larger allowance and for assistance in paying off  debts  the surrender of the london house and of some of the chief expenses  were made conditions of such favours and griffith had assented  gratefully when alone with his father but after an interview with  his wife demonstrations were made that it was highly economical to  have a house in town and horses carriages and servants and that  any change would be highly derogatory to the heir of earlscombe and  the sacred wishes of the late sir henry peacock  in fact it was impressed on us that we were mere homely  countrified beings who could not presume to dictate to her  ladyship but who had ill requited her condescension in deigning to  beam upon us    chapter xxxvislack water    o dinna look ye prideful queen on a aneath your ken for he wha seems the farthest but aft wins the farthest ben and whiles the doubie of the

mothers eyes when  the doom on the firstborn of the winslows was fulfilled and the  poor little baby clarence succumbed to a cold on the chest caught  while his nurse was gossiping with a guardsman  he was buried in london  it was better for selina to get those  things over as quickly as possible said griff but clarence saw  that he suffered much more than his wife would let him show to her   it is so bad for him to dwell on it she said  you see  i never  let myself give way  and she was soon going out nearly as usual till their one other  infant came to open its eyes only for a few hours on this  troublesome world and owe its baptism to clarences exertions  my  mother who was in london just after attending on the good old  admirals last illness was greatly grieved and disgusted with all  she heard and saw of the young pair and that was not much  she  felt their disregard of her uncle as heartless or rather as  insulting on selinas part and weak on griffs and on all sides  she heard of their reckless extravagance which made her forebode  the worst  all these disappointments much diminished my fathers pleasure and  interest in his inheritance  he had little heart to build and  improve when his eldest sons wife made no secret of her hatred to  the place or to begin undertakings only to be neglected by those  who came after and thus several favourite schemes were dropped or  prevented by griffiths applications for advances  at last there was a crisis  at the end of the second season after  their visit to us clarence sent a hasty note begging my father to  join him in averting an execution in griffiths house  i cannot  record the particulars for just at that time i had a long low  fever and did not touch my diary for many weeks nor indeed did i  know much about the circumstances since my good nurses withheld as  much as possible and would not let me talk about what they believed  to make me worse  nor can i find any letters about it  i believe  they were all made away with long ago and thus i only know that my  father hurried up to town remained for a fortnight and came back  looking ten years older  the house in london had been given up and  he had offered a vacant one of our own near home to griff to  retrench in but selina would not hear of it insisting on going  abroad  this was a great grief to him and to us all  there was only one  side of our lives that was not saddened  our old incumbent had died  about six months after the fordyces had gone and mr henderson had  gladly accepted the living where the parsonage had been built  the  lady to whom he had been so long engaged was a great acquisition   her home had been at oxford and she was as thoroughly imbued with  the spirit that there prevailed as was the hillside curate  she  talked to us of littlemore and of the sermons there and at st  marys and emily and i shared to the full her heroworship  it was  the nearest compensation my sister had had for the loss of ellen  with this difference that mrs henderson was older had read more  and had conversed thoughtfully with some of the leading spirits in  religious thought so that she opened a new world to us  people would hardly believe in our eagerness and enthusiasm over the  revelations of church doctrine how we debated consulted our books  and corresponded with clarence over what now seems so trite how we  viewed the british critic and tracts for the times as our oracles  and worried the poor wattlesea bookseller to get them for us at the  first possible moment  church restoration was setting in  henderson had always objected to  christening from a slopbasin on the altar and had routed out a  dilapidated font and now one which was termed by the country paper  chaste and elegant was by united efforts in which clarence had the  lions share presented in time for the christening of the first  child at the parsonage  it is that which was sent off to the  mission chapel as a blot on the rest of earlscombe church  yet what  an achievement it was deemed at the time  the same may be said of most of our doings at that era  we effected  them gradually and have ever since been undoing them as our  architectural and ecclesiastical perceptions have advanced  i  wonder how the next generation will deal with our alabaster reredos  and our stained windows with which we are all as well pleased as we  were fifty years ago with the plain red cross with a targetlike  arrangement above and below it in the east window or as poor  margaret may have been with her livery altarcloth  indeed it  seems to me that we got more delight out of our very imperfect work  designed by ourselves and sent to clarence to be executed by men in  back streets in london costing an immensity of trouble than can be  had now by simply choosing out of a book of figures of cut and dried  articles  what an enthusiastic description clarence sent of the illuminated  commandments in the new church of st katharine in the regents  park  how emily and i gloated over the imitation of them when we  replaced the hideous old tables and how exquisite we thought the  initial i which irreverent youngsters have likened with some  justice to an enormous overfed caterpillar enwreathed with red and  green cabbage leaves  my mother was startled at these innovations but my father who had  kept abreast with the thought of the day owned to the doctrines as  chiming in with his unbroken belief and transferred to the  improvements in the church the interest which he had lost in the  estate  the farmers had given up their distrust of him and  accepted him loyally as friend and landlord submitting to the  reseating of the church and only growling moderately at decorations  that cost them nothing  daily service began as soon as henderson  was his own master and was better attended than it is now for the  old people to whom it was a novelty took up the habit more freely  than their successors to whom the bell has been familiar through  their days of toil  we were too far off to be constant attendants  but evensong made an object for our airings and my fathers head  now quite white was often seen there  he felt it a great relief  amid the cares of his later years  perhaps it was with a view to him that mr castleford arranged that  clarence should become manager for the firm at bristol with a good  salary  the robsons would not take a fresh lodgerthey were  getting too old for fresh beginnings but they kept their rooms  ready for him whenever he had to be in town and gooch found him a  trustworthy widow as housekeeper  he took a little cottage at  clifton availing himself of the coach to spend his sundays with us  and it was an acknowledged joy to every one that i should drive to  meet him every saturday afternoon at the carpenters arms and bring  him home to be my fathers aid in all his business and a most  valuable help in sunday parish work in which he had an amount of  experience which astonished us  what would have become of the singing without him  the first hint  against the remarkable anthems had long ago alienated our tuneful  choir placed on high and they had deserted en masse  then emily  and the schoolmistress had toiled at the school children whose thin  little pipes and provincialisms were a painful infliction till mrs  henderson backed by clarence worked up a few promising mens  voices to support them  we thought everything but the new and old  versions smacked of dissent except the hymns at the end of the  prayerbook though we did not go as far as chapman who told emily  he understood as how all the tunes was tried over in doctors  commons afore they were sent out and it was not liable to change  them  one of clarences amusements in his lonely life had been the  acquisition of a knowledge of music and he had a really good voice  while his adherence to our choir encouraged other young men of the  farmer and artisan class to join us  choir however did not mean  surplices and cassocks but a collection of our best voices male  and female in the gallery  martyn began to be a great help when at home never having wavered  in his purpose of becoming a clergyman  on going to oxford he  became imbued with the influences that made alma mater the focus of  the religious life and progress of that generation which is now the  elder one  there might in some be unreality in others  extravagance in others mere imitation but there was a truly great  work on the minds of the young men of that eraa work which has  stood the test of time made saints and martyrs and sown the seed  whereof we have witnessed a goodly growth in spite of cruel shocks  and disappointments fightings within and fears without slanders  and follies to provoke them such as we can now afford to laugh  over  with martyn rubrical or extrarubrical observances were the  outlet of the exuberance of youth as chivalry and romance had been  to us and on frank fordyces visits it was delightful to find that  he too was in the full swing of these ideas and habits partly from  his own convictions partly from his parish needs and partly  carried along by curates fresh from oxford  in the first of his summer vacations martyn joined a reading party  with a tutor of the same calibre and assured them that if they took  up their quarters in a farmhouse not many miles by the map from  beachharbour they would have access to unlimited services with the  extraordinary luxury of a surpliced choir and intercourse with  congenial spirits which to him meant the fordyces  on arriving however the bay proved to be so rocky and dangerous  that there was no boating across it as he had confidently expected   the farm depended on a market town in the opposite direction and  though the lights of beachharbour could be seen at night there was  no way thither except by a sixmiles walk along a cliff path with a  considerable detour in order to reach a bridge and cross the rapid  river which was an element of danger in the bay on the north side  of the promontory which sheltered the harbour to the south  so when martyn started as pioneer on the morning before the others  arrived he descended into beachharbour later than he intended but  still he was in time to meet anne fordyce a tall brightfaced girl  of fourteen taking her afterlessons turn on the parade with a  governess who looked amazed as the two met holding out both hands  to one another with eager joy and welcome  it was not the same when anne flew into the vicarage with the  rapturous announcement heres martyn  the vicar was gone to a  clerical meeting and mrs fordyce said nothing about staying to see  him  the luncheon was a necessity but with quiet courtesy martyn  was made to understand that he was regarded as practically out of  reach and oh mamma he could come and sleep was nipped in the  utterance by martyn is busy with his studies we must not disturb  him  this was a sufficient intimation that mrs fordyce did not  intend to have the pupils dropping in on her continually and making  her house their resort and while martyn was digesting the rebuff  the governess carried anne off to prepare for a music lesson and  her mother gave no encouragement to lingering or repeating the  visit  still martyn on his way homewards based many hopes on the return  of mr fordyce but all that ensued was three weeks later a note  regretting the not having been able to call and inviting the whole  party to a great schoolfeast on the anniversary of the dedication  of the first of the numerous new churches of beachharbour  there  was no want of cordiality on that occasion but time was lacking for  anything beyond greetings and fleeting exchanges of words  parson  frank tried to talk to martyn bemoaned the not seeing more of him  declared his intentions of coming to the farm began an invitation  but was called off a hundred ways and anne was rushing about with  all the children of the place gentle and simple on her hands   whenever martyn tried to help her he was called off some other way  and engaged at last in the hopeless task of teaching cricket where  these fisher boys had never heard of it  that was all he saw of our old friends and he was much hurt by such  ingratitude  so were we all and though we soon acquitted the head  of the family of more than the forgetfulness of over occupation the  soreness at his wifes coldness was not so soon passed over  yet  from her own point of view poor woman she might be excused for a  panic lest her second daughter might go the way of the first    chapter xxxviioutward bound    as slow our ship her foamy track    against the wind was cleaving her trembling pennant still looked back    to the dear isle twas leaving so loath we part from all we love    from all the links that bind us so turn our hearts as on we rove    to those weve left behind us  t  moore  the first time i saw clarences menage was in that same summer of  poor martyns repulse  my father had come in for a small property  in his original county of shropshire and this led to his setting  forth with my mother to make necessary arrangements and then to pay  visits to old friends leaving emily and me to be guests to our  brother at clifton  we told them it was their harvest honeymoon and it was funny to see  how they enjoyed the scheme when they had once made up their minds  to it and our share in the project was equally new and charming  for emily and i though both some way on in our twenties were still  in many respects home children nor had i ever been out on a visit  on my own account  the yellow chariot began by conveying emily and  me to our destination  clifton has grown considerably since those days and terraces have  swallowed up the site of what the postoffice knew as prospect  cottage but we were apt to term the dolls house for as emily  said our visit there had something the same effect as a picnic or  tea drinking at little annes famous baby house  in like manner it  was tiny square with one sashwindow on each side of the door but  it was nearly covered with creepers odds and ends which clarence  brought from home and induced to flourish and take root better than  their parent stocks  in his nursery days his precision had given  him the name of the old bachelor and he had all a sailors  tidiness  even his black cat and brown spaniel each had its  peculiar basket and mat and had been taught never to transgress  their bounds or interfere with one another and the effect of his  parlour embellished as it was in our honour was delightful  the  outlook was across the beautiful ravine into the wooded slopes on  the further side and on the other side down the widening cleft to  that giddy marvel the suspension bridge with vessels passing under  it and the expanse beyond  most entirely we enjoyed ourselves making merry over clarences  housekeeping employing ourselves after our wonted semistudent  semiartist fashion in the morning and when our host came home  from business starting on country expeditions taking a carriage  whenever the distance exceeded emilys powers of walking beside my  chair sketching botanising or investigating church architecture  our newest hobby  i sketched and the other two rambled about  measuring and filling up archaeological papers with details of  orientation style and all the rest deploring barbarisms and  dilapidations making curious and delightful discoveries pitying  those who thought the dun cows rib and chattertons loft the most  interesting features of st marys redcliff and above all rubbing  brasses with heel ball and hanging up their grim effigies wherever  there was a vacant space on the walls of our dolls house  and though we grumbled when clarence was detained at the office  later than we expected this was qualified by pride at feeling his  importance there as a man in authority  it was however with much  dismay and some inhospitality that we learnt that a young man  belonging to the officein fact mr friths greatnephewwas  coming to sail for canton in one of the vessels belonging to the  firm and would have to be looked after  he could not be asked to  sleep at prospect cottage for emily had the only spare bedchamber  and clarence had squeezed himself into a queer little dressing  closet to give me his room but the housekeeper a treasure found by  gooch secured an apartment in the next house and we were to act  hosts much against our will  clarence had barely seen the youth  who had been employed in the office at liverpool living with his  mother who was in illhealth and had died in the last spring  the  only time of seeing him he had seemed to be a very shy raw lad  but poor fellow we can make the best of him was the sentiment  it is only for one night  however we were dismayed when as  emily was in the crisis of washingin a sky it was announced that a  gentleman was asking for mr winslow  churlishness bade us despatch  him to the office but humanity prevailed to invite him previously  to share our luncheon  yet we doubted whether it had not been a  cruel mercy when he entered evidently unprepared to stumble on a  young lady and a deformed man and stammering piteously as he hoped  there was no mistakemr winslowprospect etc  emily explained frustrating his desire to flee at once to the  office and pointing out his lodging close at hand whence he was  invited to return in a few minutes to the meal  we had time for some amiable exclamations the oaf  what a  bore  he has spoilt my sky  i shant finish this today   shall we order a carriage and take him to the office we cant have  him on our hands all the afternoon  and we might get the new  number of nicholas nickleby  nbperhaps it was oliver twist or the old curiosity shopi am  not certain which was the current excitement just then but i am  quite sure it was mrs nickleby who first disclosed to us that our  guest had a splendid pair of dark eyes  hitherto he had kept them  averted in the studious manner i have often noticed in persons who  did not wish to excite suspicion of staring at my peculiarities but  that ladys feelings when her neighbours legs came down her chimney  were too much for his selfconsciousness and he gave a glance that  disclosed dark liquid depths sparkling with mirth  he was one  number in advance of us and could enlighten us on the next stage in  the coming story and this went far to reconcile us to the invasion  and to restore him to the proper use of his legs and armsand very  shapely limbs they were for he was a slim wellmade fellow with a  dark gipsy complexion and intelligent honest face altogether  better than we expected  yet we could have groaned when in the evening clarence brought him  back with tidings that something had gone wrong with the ship  if i  tried to explain i might be twitted with   the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes   but of course clarence knew all about it and he thought it unlikely  that the vessel would be in sailing condition for a week at soonest   great was our dismay  getting through one evening by the help of  walking and then singing was one thing having the heart of our  visit consumed by an interloper was another though clarence  undertook to take him to the office and find some occupation for him  that might keep him out of our way  but it was clarences leisure  hours that we begrudged though truly no one could be meeker than  this unlucky lawrence frith nor more conscious of being an  insufferable burthen  i even detected a tear in his eye when  clarence and emily were singing sweet home  do you know said clarence on the second evening when his guest  had gone to dress for dinner i am very sorry for that poor lad   it is only six weeks since he lost his mother and he has not a soul  to care for him either here or where he is going  i had fancied  the family were under a cloud but i find it was only that old frith  quarrelled with the father for taking holy orders instead of going  into our house  probably there was some imprudence for the poor  man died a curate and left no provision for his family  the only  help the old man would give was to take the boy into the office at  liverpool stopping his education just as he was old enough to care  about it  there were a delicate mother and two sisters then but  they are all gone now scarlet fever carried off the daughters and  mrs frith never was well again  he seems to have spent his time in  waiting on her when off duty and to have made no friends except one  or two contemporaries of hers and his only belongings are old frith  and mrs stevens who are packing him off to canton without caring a  rap what becomes of him  i know what mrs stevens is at she comes  up to town much oftener now and has got her husbands nephew into  the office and is trying to get everything for him and thats the  reason she wants to keep up the old feud and send this poor  lawrence off to the ends of the earth  cant you do anything for him asked emily  i thought mr frith  did attend to you  clarence laughed  i know that mrs stevens hates me like poison  but that is the only reason i have for supposing i might have any  influence  and cant you speak to mr castleford  set him to interfere about old friths relations  he would know  better  besides the fellow is too old to get into any other line fourandtwenty he says though he does not look it and he is as  innocent as a baby indifferent just now to what becomes of him or  whither he goes it is all the same to him he says there is no one  to care for him anywhere and i think he is best pleased to go where  it is all new  and there you see the poor lad will be left to  drift to destructionmothers darling that he has beenjust for  want of some human being to care about him and hinder his getting  heartless and reckless  clarences voice trembled and emily had tears in her eyes as she  asked if absolutely nothing could be done for him  clarence meant  to write to mr castleford who would no doubt beg the chaplain at  the station to show the young man some kindness also perhaps to  the resident partner whom clarence had looked at once over his  desk but in his rawest and most depressed days  the only clerk out  there whom he knew would he thought be no element of safety and  would not like the youth the better either for bringing his  recommendation or bearing old friths name  we were considerably softened towards our guest though the next  time emily came on him he was standing in the hall transfixed in  contemplation of her greatest achievement in brassrubbing a severe  and sable knight with the most curly of nostrils the stiffest and  straightest of mouths hair straight on his brows pointed toes  joined together below and fingers touching over his breast  there  he hung in triumph just within the front door fluttering and  swaying a little on his pins whenever a draught came in and there  stood lawrence frith freshly aware of him and unable to repress  the exclamation i say isnt he a guy  sir guy de warrenne began emily composedly dont you see his  coat of arms chequy argent and azure  does your brother keep him there to scare away the tramps  emilys countenance was a study  the subject of brasses was unfolded to lawrence frith and before  the end of the week he had spent an entire day on his hands and  knees scrubbing away with the waxy black compound at a figure in  the cathedralthe officework as we declared which clarence gave  him to do  in fact he became so thoroughly infected that it was a  pity that he was going where there would be no exercise in  ecclesiologyrather the reverse  embarrassment on his side and  hostility on ours may be said to have vanished under the influence  of sir guy de warrennes austere countenance  the youth seemed to  regard mr winslow in the light of a father and to accept us as  kindly beings  he ceased to contort his limbs in our awful  presence looked at me like as an ordinary person and even ventured  on giving me an arm  he listened with unfeigned pleasure to our  music perilled his neck on st vincents rocks in search of plants  and by and by took to hanging back with emily while clarence walked  on with me to talk to her out of his full heart about his mother  and sisters  three weeks elapsed before the hoangho was ready to sail and by  that time lawrence knew that there were some who would rejoice in  his success or grieve if things went ill with him  clarence and i  had promised him long home letters and impressed on him that we  should welcome his intelligence of himself  for verily he had made  his way into our hearts as a thoroughly goodhearted affectionate  being yearning for something to cling to intelligent and refined  though his recent cultivation had been restricted soundly  principled and trained in religious feelings and habits but so  utterly inexperienced that there was no guessing how it might be  with him when cast adrift with no object save his own maintenance  and no one to take an interest in him  clarence talked to him paternally and took him to secondhand shops  to provide a cheap library of substantial reading engaging to cater  for him for the future not omitting dickens and emily worked at  providing him with the small conveniences and comforts for the  voyage that called for a womans hand  he was so grateful that it  was like fitting out a dear friend or younger brother  i wonder said clarence as he walked by my chair on one of the  last days whether it was altogether wise to have this young frith  here so much though it could hardly have been helped  to which i rejoined that it could hardly have displeased the uncle  and that if it did the youths welfare was worth annoying him for  i meant something nearer home said clarence and proceeded to ask  if i did not think lawrence frith a good deal smitten with emily  to me it seemed an idea not worth consideration  any youth  especially one who had lived so secluded a life would naturally be  taken by the first pleasing young woman who came in his way and  took a kindly interest in him but i did not think emily very  susceptible being entirely wrapped up in home and parish matters  and i reminded clarence that she had not been loverless  she had  rejected the curate of hillside and we all saw though she did not  that only her evident indifference kept sir george eastwoods second  son from making further advances  clarence was not convinced  he said he had never seen our sister  look at either of these as she did when lawrence came into the room  and there was no denying that there was a soft and embellishing  light on her whole countenance and a fresh sweetness in her voice   but then he seemed such a boy as to make the notion ridiculous and  yet on reckoning it proved that their years were equal  all that  could be hoped was that the sentiment if it existed would not  discover itself before they parted so as to open their eyes to the  dreariness of the prospect and cause our mother to think we had  betrayed our trust in the care of our sister  as we could do  nothing we were not sorry that this was the last day  clarence was  to go on board with frith see him out of the river and come back  with the pilot and we all drove down to the wharf together nobody  saying much by the way except the few jerky remarks we brothers  felt bound to originate and reply to  emily sat very still her head bent under her shading bonneti  think she was trying to keep back tears for the solitary exile and  lawrence opposite was unable to help watching her with wistful  eyes which would have revealed all if we had not guessed it  already  it might be presumptuous but it made us very sorry for  him  when the moment of parting came there was a wringing of hands and  thank you thank you in a low broken heartfelt voice and to  emily you have made life a new thing to me  i shall never  forget and the showing of a tiny book in his waistcoat pocket  when the two had disappeared emily no longer restraining her  tears told me that she had exchanged prayerbooks with him and  they were to read the psalms at the same time every day  i thought  it might be a help to him she said simply  nor was there any consciousness in her talk as she related to me  what he had told her about his mother and sisters and his dreary  sense of piteous loneliness till we had adopted him as a brother in which capacity i trusted that she viewed him  however clarence had been the recipient of all the poor lads  fervent feelings for miss winslow how she had been a new revelation  to his desolate spirit and was to be the guiding star of his life  etc etc all from the bottom of his heart though he durst not  dream of requital and was to live not on hope but on memory of  the angelic kindness of these three weeks  it was impossible not to be touched though we strove to be worldly  wise old bachelors and assured one another that the best and most  probable thing that could happen to lawrence frith would be to have  his dream blown away by the atlantic breezes and be left open to  the charms of some chinese merchants daughter    chapter xxxviiitoo late    thus esaulike our fathers blessing miss then wash with fruitless tears our faded crown  keble  after such a rebuff as martyn had experienced at beachharbour he no  longer haunted its neighbourhood but devoted the long vacation of  the ensuing year to a walking tour in germany with one or two  congenial spirits who shared his delight in scenery pictures and  architecture  by and by he wrote to clarence from baden baden   whom do you think i should find here but griffith and his bird  i  first spotted the old fellow smoking under a tree in the grand  platz but he looked so seedy and altered altogether that i was not  sure enough of him to speak especially as he showed no signs of  knowing me  he says it was my whiskers that stumped him  i made  inquiries and found that they figured as sir peacock and lady but  they were entered all right in the book  he is taking the kurhe  looks as if he wanted itand she is taking rouge et noir  i saw  her at the salon with her neck grown as long as her namesakes but  not as pretty claws to match thin and painted as if the ruling  passion was consuming her  poor old griff he was glad enough to  see me but he is wofully shaky and nearly came to tears when he  asked after ted and all at home  they had an upset of their  carriage in vienna last winter and he got some twist or other  damage which he thought nothing of but it has never righted  itself i am sure he is very ill and ought to be looked after  he  has had only foreign doctoring and you know he never was strong in  languages  i heard of the medico here inquiring what precise  symptom der englander meant by being down in zie mout  poor griff  is that whatever else he is and selina does not see it nor  anything else but her rouge et noir table  i am afraid he plays  too when he is up to it but he cant stand much of the stuffiness  of the place and he respects my innocence poor old beggar so he  has kept out of it since we have been here  he seems glad to have  me to look after him but afraid to let me stay for fear of my  falling a victim to the place  i cant well tell him that there is  a perpetual warning to youth in the persons of himself and his  peacock  his mind might be vastly relieved if i were out of it but  scarcely his body and i shall not leave him till i hear from home   thomson says i am right  i should like to bring the poor old man  home for advice especially if my lady could be left behind and by  all appearances she would not object  could not you come or mamma   speak to papa about it  it is all so disgusting that i really could  not write to him  it is enough to break ones heart to see griff  when he hears about home and edward and emily  i told him how  famously you were getting on and he said it has been all up up  with him all down down with me and then he wanted me to fix my  day for leaving baden as if it were a sink of infection  i fancy  he thinks me a mere infant still for he wont heed a word of advice  about taking care of himself and will do the most foolish things  imaginable for a man in his state though i cant make out what is  the matter with him  i tried both french and latin with his doctor  equally in vain  there was a great consultation over this letter  our parents would  fain have gone at once to baden but my father was far from well in  fact it was the beginning of the breakup of his constitution  he  had been ageing ever since his disappointment in griffith and  though he had so enjoyed his jaunt with my mother that he had seemed  revived for the time he had been visibly failing ever since the  winter and my mother durst not leave him  indeed she was only too  well aware that her presence was apt to inspire selina with the  spirit of contradiction and that clarence would have a better  chance alone  he was to go up to london by the mail train see mr  castleford and cross to ostend  a valise from the lumberroom was wanted and at bedtime he went in  quest of it  he came back white and shaken and i said   you have not seen her  yes i have  it is not her time of year  no i was not even thinking of her  there was none of the wailing  but when i looked up from my rummaging there was her face as if in  a window or mirror on the wall  dont dwell on it was all i could entreat for the apparition at  unusual times had been mentioned as a note of doom and not only did  it weigh on me but it might send clarence off in a desponding mood   tidings were less rapid when telegraphs were not and railways  incomplete  clarence did not reach baden till ten days after the  despatch of martyns letter and griffiths condition had in the  meantime become much more serious  low fever had set in and he was  confined to his dreary lodgings where martyn was doing his best for  him in an inexperienced helpless sort of way while lady peacock  was at the salle persisting in her belief that the ailment was a  temporary matter  martyn afterwards declared that he had never seen  anything more touching than poor griffs look of intense rest and  relief at clarences entrance  on the way through london by the assistance of mr castleford  clarence had ascertained how to procure the best medical advice  attainable and he was linguist enough to be an adequate  interpreter  alas all that was achieved was the discovery that  between difficulties of language griffs own indifference and his  wifes carelessness the injury had developed into fatal disease   an operation might yet save him if he could rally enough for it  but the fever was rapidly destroying his remaining strength  selina  ascribed it to excitement at meeting martyn and indeed he had been  subject to such attacks every autumn  any way he had no spirits  nor wish for improvement  if his brothers told him he was better  he smiled and said it was like a condemned criminal trying to  recover enough for the gallows  his only desire was to be let alone  and have clarence with him  he had ceased to be uneasy as to  martyns exposure to temptation but he said he could hardly bear to  watch that bright fresh young manhood and recollect how few years  had passed since he had been such another nor did he like to have  any nurse save clarence  his wife at first acquiesced holding fast  to the theory of the periodical autumnal fever and then that the  operation would restore him to health and as her presence fretted  him and he received her small attentions peevishly she persisted  in her usual habits and heard with petulance his brothers  assurances of his being in a critical condition declaring that it  was always thus with these fevershe was always cross and low spirited and no one could tell what she had undergone with him  then came days of positive pain and nights of delirious dreary  murmuring about home and all of us more especially ellen fordyce   clarence had no time for letters and martyns became a call for  mamma with the old childish trust in her healing and comforting  powers declaring that he would meet her at cologne and steer her  through the difficulties of foreign travel  hesitation was over now  my father was most anxious to send her  and she set forth secure that she could infuse life energy and  resolution into her son when those two poor boys had failed  it was not however martyn who met her but his friend thomson  with the tidings that the suffering had become so severe as to  prevent martyn from leaving baden not only on his brothers  account but because lady peacock had at last taken alarm and was  so uncontrollable in her distress that he was needed to keep her out  of the sickroom where her presence poor thing only did mischief  she evidently had a certain affection for her husband and it was  the more piteous that in his present state he only regarded her as  the tempter who had ruined his lifehis false duessa who had led  him away from una  on one unhappy evening he had been almost  maddened by her insisting on arguing with him he called her a hag  declared she had been the death of his children the death of that  dear onecould she not let him alone now she had been the death of  himself  when martyn took her away she wept bitterly and told enough to  make the misery of their life apparent when the gaiety was over  and regrets and recriminations set in  however there came a calmer interval when the suffering passed  off but in the manner which made the german doctor intimate that  hope was over  would life last till his mother came  his brothers had striven from the first to awaken thoughts of higher  things and turn remorse into repentance but every attempt resulted  in strange sad wanderings about esau the birthright and the  blessing  indeed these might not have been entirely wanderings  for once he said it is better this way bill  you dont know what  you wish in trying to bring me round  dont be hard on me  she  drove me to it  it is all right now  the jews will be  disappointed  for even at the crisis in london he had concealed that he had  raised money on post obits so that had he outlived my father  chantry house would have been lost  lady peacocks fortune had been  undermined when she married him extravagance and gambling had made  short work of the rest  why should i speak of such things here except to mourn over our  muchloved brother with all his fine qualities and powers wasted  and overthrown  he clung to clarences affection and submitted to  prayers and psalms but without response  he showed tender  recollection of us all but scarcely durst think of his father and  hardly appeared to wish to see his mother  clarences object soon  came to be to obtain forgiveness for the wife since bitterness  against her seemed the great obstacle to seeking pardon peace or  hope but each attempt only produced such bitterness against her  and such regrets and mourning for ellen as fearfully shook the  failing frame while he moaned forth complaints of the blandishments  and raillery with which his temptress had beguiled him  clarence  tried in vain to turn away this idea but nothing had any effect  till he bethought himself of ellens message that she knew even  this fatal act had been prompted by generosity of spirit  there was  truth enough in it to touch griff but only so far as to cry what  might i not have been with her  still there was no real softening  till my mother came  he knew her at once and all the old childish  relations were renewed between them  there was little time left  now but he was wholly hers  even clarence was almost set aside  save where strength was needed and the mother seemed to have equal  control of spirit and body  it was she who scarcely aware of what  had gone before caused him to admit selina  tell her not to talk he said  but we have each much to forgive  one another  she came in awed and silent and he let her kiss him sit near at  hand and wait on my mother whose coming had as it were  insensibly taken the bitterness away and made him as a little child  in her hands  he could follow prayers in which she led him as he  could not or did not seem to do with any one else for he was  never conscious of the presence of the clergyman whom thomson hunted  up and brought and who prayed aloud with martyn while the physical  agony claimed both my mother and clarence  once griff looked about him and called out for our father then  recollecting muttered nothe birthright goneno blessing  it grieved us much it grieves me now that this was his last  distinct utterance  he looked as if the comforting replies and the  appeals to the source of all redemption did awaken a response but  he never spoke articulately again and only thirtysix hours after  my mothers arrival all was over  poor selina went into passions of hysterics and transports of grief  needing all the firmness of so resolute a woman as my mother to deal  with her  she was wild in selfaccusation and became so ill that  the care of her was a not unwholesome occupation for my mother who  was one of those with whom sorrow has little immediate outlet and  is therefore the more enduring  she would not bring our brothers coffin home thinking the  agitation would be hurtful to my father and anxious to get back to  him as soon as possible  so griff was buried at baden and from  time to time some of us have visited his grave  of course she  proposed selinas return to chantry house with her but mr  clarkson the brother had come out to the funeral and took his  sister home with him certainly much to our relief though all the  sad party at baden had drawn much nearer together in these latter  days    chapter xxxixa purpose       it then draws near the season wherein the spirit held his wont to walk  hamlet  we had really lost our griffith long beforeour bright generous  warmhearted promising griff the brilliance of our home but his  actual death made the first breach in a hitherto unbroken family  and was a new and strange shock  it made my father absolutely an  old man and it also changed martyn  his first contact with  responsibility suffering and death had demolished the light hearted boyishness which had lasted in the youngest of the family  through all his high aspirations  till his return to oxford his  chief solace was in getting some one of us alone going through all  the scenes at baden discussing his new impressions of the trials  and perplexities of life and seeking out passages in the books that  were becoming our oracles  what he had admired externally before  he was grasping from within nor can i describe what the lyra  apostolica and the two first volumes of parochial sermons preached  at littlemore became to us  mr clarkson had been rather dry with my brothers at baden  evidently considering that poor griffith had been as fatal to his  sister as we thought selina had been to our brother  it was hardly  just for there had been much more to spoil in him than in her and  though she would hardly have trod a much higher path there is no  saying what he might have been but for her  griffith had said nothing about providing for her not having  forgiven her till he was past recollecting the need but her brother  had intimated that something was due from the family and clarence  had assentednot indeed as to her deserts poor woman but her  claims and her needswell knowing that my father would never suffer  griffs widow to be in want  he judged rightly  my father was nervously anxious to arrange for  giving her 500 pounds a year in the manner most likely to prevent  her from making away with it and leaving herself destitute  but  there had already been heavy pulls on his funded property and ways  and means had to be considered making clarence realise that he had  become the heir  somehow there still remained especially with my  mother and himself a sense of his being a failure and an inferior  substitute although my father had long come to lean upon him as  never had been the case with our poor griff  the first idea of raising the amount required was by selling an  outlying bit of the estate near the wattlesea station for which an  enterprising builder was making offers either to purchase or take  on a building lease  my father had received several letters on the  subject and only hesitated from a feeling against breaking up the  estate especially if this were part of the original chantry house  property and not a more recent acquisition of the winslows   moreover he would do nothing without clarences participation  the titledeeds were not in the house for my father had had too  much of the law to meddle more than he could help with his own  affairs and had left them in the hands of the family solicitor at  bristol where clarence was to go and look over them  he rejoiced  in the opportunity of being able to see whether anything would throw  light on the story of the mullion chamber and the certainty that  the wattlesea property had never been part of the old endowment of  the chantry did not seem nearly so interesting as a packet of yellow  letters tied with faded red tape  mr ryder made no difficulty in  entrusting these to him and we read them by our midnight lamp  clarence had seen poor margarets will bequeathing her entire  property to her husbands son philip winslow and had noted the  date 1705 also the copy of the decision in the court of probate  that there was no sufficient evidence of entail on the fordyce  family to bar her power of disposing of it  we eagerly opened the  letters but found them disappointing as they were mostly offerings  of felicitations to philip winslow on having established his just  claim and refuted the malicious accusations of calumny  they  only served to prove the fact that he had been accused of something  and likewise that he had powerful friends and was thought worth  being treated with adulation according to the fashion of his day   perhaps it was hardly to be expected that he should have preserved  evidence against himself but it was baffling to sift so little out  of such a mass of correspondence  if we could have had access to  the fordyce papers no doubt they would have given the other phase  of the transaction but they were unattainable  the only public  record that clarence could discover was much abbreviated and though  there was some allusion to intimidation the decision seemed to have  been fixed by the nonexistence of any entail  christmas was drawing on and gathering together what was left of  us  though griffith had spent only one christmas at home in nine  years it was wonderful how few we seemed even when martyn  returned  my father liked to have us about him and even spoke of  clarences giving up his post as manager at bristol and living  entirely at home to attend to the estate but my mother did not  encourage the idea  she could not quite bear to accept any one in  griffs place and rightly thought there was not occupation enough  to justify bringing clarence home  i was competent to assist my  father through all the landlords business that came to him within  doors and emily had ridden and walked about enough with him to be  an efficient inspector of crops and repairs besides that clarence  himself was within reach  indeed he said to me i cannot loose my hold on frith and  castleford till i see my way into the future  i did not know what he intended either then or when he gave his  voice against dismembering the property by selling the wattlesea  estate but arranged for raising selinas income otherwise  persuading my father to let him undertake the building of the  required cottages out of his own resources on principles much more  wholesome than were likely to be employed by the speculator  nor  did grasp what was in his mind when he made me look out my ghost  journal as we called my record of each apparition reported in the  mullion chamber or the lawn with marks to those about which we had  no reasonable doubt  separately there might be explanation but  conjointly and in connection with the date they had a remarkable  force  i am resolved said clarence to see whether that figure can have  a purpose  i have thought of it all those years  it has hitherto  had no fair play  i was too much upset by the sight and beaten by  the utter incredulity of everybody else but now i am determined to  look into it  there was both awe and resolution in his countenance and i only  stipulated that he should not be alone or with no more locomotive  companion than myself  martyn was as old as i had been at our  former vigil and a person to be relied on  a few months ago he would have treated the matter as a curious  adventurous enterprisea concession to superstition or imagination  but now he took it up with much grave earnestness  he had been  discussing the evidence for such phenomena with friends at oxford  and the conclusion had been that they were at times permitted  sometimes as warnings sometimes to accomplish the redress of a  wrong sometimes to teach us the reality of the spiritual world  about us and likewise that some constitutions were more  susceptible than others to these influences  of course he had  adduced all that he knew of his domestic haunted chamber but had  found himself uncertain as to the amount of direct or trustworthy  evidence  so he eagerly read our jottings and was very anxious to  keep watch with clarence though there were greater difficulties in  the way than when the outer chamber was griffiths sittingroom and  always had a fire lighted  to our disappointment likewise there came an invitation from the  eastwoods for the evening of the 27th of december the second of the  recurring days of the phantoms appearance  my father could not  and my mother would not go but they so much wanted my brothers and  sister to accept it that it could not well be declined  it was  partly a political affair and my father was anxious to put clarence  forward and make him take his place as the future squire and my  mother thought depression had lasted long enough with her children  and did not like to see martyn so grave and preoccupied  it was  quite right and very nice in him dear boy but it was not natural  at his age though he was to be a clergyman  as to emily her gentle cheerfulness had helped us all through our  time of sorrow and just now we had been gratified by the tidings of  young lawrence frith  that youth was doing extremely well  there  had been golden reports from manager and chaplain addressed to mr  castleford the latter adding that the young man evidently owed much  to mr winslows influence  moreover lawrence had turned out an  excellent correspondent  long letters worthy of forming a book of  travels came regularly to clarence and me indeed they were thought  worth being copied into that fat clasped ms book in the study   writing them must have been a real solace to the exile in his  island outside the town whither all the outer barbarians were  relegated  so no doubt was the packing of the gifts that were  gradually making prospect cottage into a chinese exhibition of  nodding mandarins ivory balls exquisite little cups and faggots  of tea  also a chinese walking doll was sent humbly as an offering  for the amusement of miss winslows school children whom indeed she  astonished beyond measure and though her wheels are out of order  and her movements uncertain she is still a stereotyped incident in  the christmas entertainments  there was no question but that these letters and remembrances gave  great pleasure to emily but i believe she was not in the least  conscious that though greater in degree it was not of the same  quality as that she felt when a runaway scholar who had gone to sea  presented her in token of gratitude with a couple of dried sea horses    chapter xlthe midnight chase    what human creature in the dead of night    had coursed like hunted hare that cruel distance had sought the door the window in her flight    striving for dear existence  hood  on the night of the 26th of december clarence and martyn well  wrapped in greatcoats stole into the outer mullion room but though  the usual sounds were heard and the mysterious light again  appeared martyn perceived nothing else and even clarence declared  that if there were anything besides it was far less distinct to him  than it had been previously  could it be that his spiritual  perceptions were growing dimmer as he became older and outgrew the  sensitiveness of nerves and imagination  we came to the conclusion that it would be best to watch the outside  of the house rather than within the chamber and the dinnerparty  facilitated this since it accounted for being up and about nearer  to the hour when the ghost might be expected  egress could be had  through the little garden door and i undertook to sit up and keep  up the fire  all three came to my room on their return home for emily had become  aware of our scheme and entreated to be allowed to watch with us   clarence had unfastened the alarum bell from my shutters and taken  down the bar after the curtains had been drawn by the housemaid and  he now opened them  it was a frosty moonlight night and the lawn  lay white and crisp marked with fantastic shadows  the others  looked grave and pale emily was in a thick white shawl and hood  with a swans down boa over her black dress a somewhat ghostly  figure herself but we were in far too serious a mood for light  observations  there was something of a shudder about clarence as he went to unbolt  the back door martyn kept close to him  we saw them outside and  then emily flew after them  from my window i could watch them  advancing on the central gravel walk emily standing still between  her brothers clasping an arm of each  i saw the light near the  ruin and caught some sounds as of shrieks and of threatening  voices the light flitted towards the gable of the mullion rooms  and then was the concluding scream  all was over and the three  came back much agitated emily sinking into an armchair panting  her hands over her face and a nervous trembling through her whole  frame martyns eyes looking wide and scared clarence with the  wellknown look of terror on his face  he hurried to fetch the tray  of wine and water that was always left on the table when anyone went  to a party at night but he shivered too much to prevent the glasses  from jingling and i had to pour out the sherry and administer it to  emily  oh poor poor thing she gasped out  you saw i exclaimed  they did said martyn i only saw the light and heard  that was  enough and he shuddered again  then emily did i began but clarence cut me short  dont ask  her tonight  oh let me tell cried emily i cant go away to bed till i have  had it out  then she gave the details which were the more notable because she  had not like martyn been studying our jottings and had heard  comparatively little of the apparition  when i joined the boys she said i looked toward the mullion  rooms i saw the windows lighted up and heard a sobbing and crying  inside  so did i put in martyn and clarence bent his head  then added emily by the moonlight i saw the gable end not  blank and covered by the magnolia as it is now but with stone  steps up to the brickedup doorway  the door opened the light  spread and there came out a lady in black with a lamp in one hand  and a kind of parcel in the other and oh when she turned her face  this way it was ellens  so you called out whispered martyn  dear ellen not as she used to be added emily but like what she  was when last i saw her no hardly that either for this was sad  sad scared terrified with eyes all tears as ellen never never  was  i saw added clarence i saw the shape but not the countenance  and expression as i used to do  she came down the steps continued emily looking about her as if  making her escape but just as she came opposite to us there was a  sound of tipsy laughing and singing from the gate up by the wood  i thought it real said martyn  then continued emily she wavered then turned and went under an  arch in the ruini fancied she was hiding somethingthen came out  and fled across to the steps but there were two dark men rushing  after her and at the stone steps there was a frightful shriek and  then it was all over the steps gone all quiet and the magnolia  leaves glistening in the moonshine  oh what can it all mean  went under the arch repeated clarence  is it what she hid there  that keeps her from resting  then you believe it really happened said emily that some  terrible scene is being acted over again  oh but can it be the  real spirits  that is one of the great mysteries answered martyn but i could  tell you of other instances  dont now i interposed emily has had quite enough  we reminded her that the ghastly tragedy was over and would not  recur again for another year but she was greatly shaken and we  were very sorry for her when the clock warned her to go to her own  room whither martyn escorted her  he lighted every candle he could  find and revived the fire but she was sadly overcome by what she  had witnessed she lay awake all the rest of the night and in the  morning looked so unwell and had so little to tell about the party  that my mother thought her spirits had been too much broken for  gaieties  the real cause could not be confessed for it would have been  ascribed to some kind of delirium and have made a commotion for  which my father was unfit  besides we had reached an age when  though we would not have disobeyed liberty of thought and action  had become needful  all our private confabulations were on this  extraordinary scene  we looked for the arch in the ruin but there  was as our morning senses told us nothing of the kind  she tried  to sketch her remembrance of both that and the gable of the mullion  chamber and martyn prowled about in search of some hidingplace   our antiquarian friend mr stafford had made a conjectural drawing  of the chapel restored and all the portfolios about the house were  searched for it disquieting mamma who suspected martyns oxford  notions of intending to rebuild it nor would he say that it ought  not to be done  however he with his more advanced ecclesiology  pronounced mr staffords reconstruction to be absolutely mistaken  and impossible and set to work on a fresh plan which by the bye  he derides at present  it afforded however an excuse for routing  under the ivy and among the stones but without much profit  from  the mouldings on the materials and in the stables and the front  porch it was evident that the chapel had been used as a quarry and  emilys arch was very probably that of the entrance door  in a dry  summer the foundations of the walls and piers could be traced on  the turf and the stumps of one or two columns remained but the  rest was only a confused heap of fragments within which no one could  have entered as in that strange vision  another thing became clear  there had once been a wall between the  beech wood and the lawn with a gate or door in it chapman could  just remember its being taken down in james winslows early married  life when landscape gardening was the fashion  it must have been  through this that the winslow brothers were returning when poor  margaret perhaps expected them to enter by the front  we wished we could have consulted dame dearlove but she had died a  few years before and her school was extinct    chapter xliwills old and new    and that tonight thou must watch with me    to win the treasure of the tomb  scott  some seasons seem to be peculiarly marked as if death did indeed  walk forth in them  old mr frith died in the spring of 1841 and it proved that he had  shown his gratitude to clarence by a legacy of shares in the firm  amounting to about 2000 pounds  the rest of his interest therein  went to lawrence frith and his funded property to his sister mrs  stevens a very fair and upright disposition of his wealth  only six weeks later my father had a sudden seizure and there was  only time to summon clarence from london and martyn from oxford  before a second attack closed his righteous and godly career upon  earth  my mother was very still and calm hardly shedding a tear but her  whole demeanour was as if life were over for her and she had  nothing to do save to wait  she seemed to care very little for  tendernesses or attentions on our part  no doubt she would have  been more desolate without them but we always had a baffled  feeling as though our affection were contrasted with her perfect  union with her husband  yet they had been a singularly  undemonstrative couple i never saw a kiss pass between them except  as greeting or farewell before or after a journey and if my mother  could not use the terms papa or your father she always said mr  winslow  there was a large gathering at the funeral including mr  fordyce but he slept at hillside and we scarcely saw himonly for  a few kind words and squeezes of the hand  holy week was begun and  he had to hurry back to beachharbour that very night  the will had been made on my fathers coming into the inheritance   it provided a jointure of 800 pounds per annum for my mother and  gave each of the younger children 3000 pounds  a codicil had been  added shortly after griffiths death written in my fathers hand  and witnessed by mr henderson and amos bell  this put clarence in  the position of heir secured 500 pounds a year to griffiths widow  charged on the estate and likewise an additional 200 pounds a year  to emily and to me hers till marriage mine for life 300 pounds a  year to martyn until earlscombe rectory should be voided when it  was to be offered to him  the executors had originally been mr  castleford and my mother but by this codicil clarence was  substituted for the former  the legacies did not come out of the chantry house property for my  father had of course means of his own besides and bequests had  accrued to both him and my mother but clarence was inheriting the  estate much more burthened than it had been in 1829 having 2000  pounds a year to raise out of its proceeds  my mother was quite equal to business with a sort of outside sense  which she applied to it when needful  clarence made it at once  evident to her that she was still mistress of chantry house and  that it was still to be our home and she immediately calculated  what each ought to contribute to the housekeeping  she looked  rather blank when she found that clarence did not mean to give up  business nor even to become a sleeping partner but when she  examined into ways and means she allowed that he was prudent and  that perhaps it was due to mr castleford not to deprive him of an  efficient helper under present circumstances  meantime she was  content to do her best for earlscombe for the present by which  she meant till her son brought home a wife but we knew that to him  the words bore a different meaning though he was still in doubt and  uncertainty how to act and what might be the wrong to be undone  he was anxious to persuade her to go from home for a short time and  prevailed on her at last to take emily and me to dawlish while the  repairs went on which had been deferred during my fathers  feebleness at least that was the excuse  we two going with great  regret knew that his real reason was to have an opportunity for a  search among the ruins  it was in june just as martyn came back from oxford eager to share  in the quest  those two brothers would trust no one to help them  but one by one in the long summer evenings they moved each of  those stones i believe the servants thought they were crazed but  they could explain with some truth that they wanted to clear up the  disputed points as to the architecture as indeed they succeeded in  doing  they had however nearly given up having reached the original  pavement and disinterred the piscina of the side altar also a  beautiful coffin lid with a floriated cross when in a kind of  hollow martyn lit upon the rotten remains of something silken  knotted together  it seemed to have enclosed a bundle  there were  some rags that might have been a change of clothing also a prayer book decayed completely except the leathern covering inside which  was the startling inscription margaret winslow her booke lord  have mercy on a miserable widow woman  there was also a thick  leathern roll containing needles pins and scissors entirely  corroded and within these a paper carefully folded but almost  destroyed by the action of damp and the rust of the steel so that  only thus much was visible  i margaret winslow being of sound  mind do hereby give and bequeath  then came stains that defaced every line till the extreme end  where a seal remained the date 1707 was legible and there were  some scrawls probably the poor ladys signature and perhaps that  of witnesses  clarence and martyn said very little to one another  but they set out for dawlish the next day  found was indicated to us but no more for they arrived late and  had to sleep at the hotel after an evening when we were delighted  to hear my mother ask so many questions about household and parish  affairs  in the morning she was pleased to send all the children  out on the beach then free from the railway  it was a beautiful  day with the intensely blue south devon sea dancing in golden  ripples and breaking on the shore with the sound clarence loved so  well as in the shade of the dark crimson cliffs emily sat at my  feet and my brothers unfolded their strange discoveries into her  lap  there was a kind of solemnity in the thing we scarcely spoke  except that emily said oh will she come again and as the tears  gathered at sight of the pathetic petition in the old book was  that granted  we reconstructed our theory  the poor lady must have repented of  the unjust will forced from her by her stepsons and contrived to  make another but she must have been kept a captive until during  their absence at some christmas convivialities she tried to escape  but hearing sounds betokening their return she had only time to  hide the bundle in the ruin before she was detected and in the  scuffle received a fatal blow  but why i objected did she not remain hidden till her enemies  were safe in the house  terrified beyond the use of her senses said clarence  by all accounts said martyn the poor creature must have been  rather a silly woman  for shame martyn cried emily how can you tell  they might  have seen her go in or she might have feared being missed  or if you watch next christmas you may see it all explained  to which emily replied with a shiver that nothing would induce her  to go through it again and indeed she hoped the spirit would rest  since the discovery had been made  and thenone of us said and there was a silence and another  futile attempt to read the will  i shall take it to london and see what an expert can do with it  said clarence  i have heard of wonderful decipherings in the  record office but you will remember that even if it can be made  out it will hardly invalidate our possession after a hundred and  thirty years  clarence cried emily in a horrified voice and i asked if the  date were not later than that by which we inherited  three years clarence said yes but as things stand it is  absolutely impossible for me to make restitution at present  on account of the burthens on the estate i said  oh but we could give up said emily  i dare say said clarence smiling but to say nothing of poor  selina my mother would hardly see it in the same light nor should  i deal rightly even if i could make any alterations i doubt  whether my father would have held himself boundcertainly not while  no one can read this document  it would simply outrage his legal mind said martyn  then what is to be done  is the injustice to be perpetual asked  emily  this is what i have thought of said clarence  we must leave  matters as they are till i can realise enough either to pay off all  these bequests or to offer mr fordyce the value of the estate  it is not the whole i said  not the wattlesea part  this means chantry house and the three  farms in the village  10000 pounds would cover it  is it possible asked emily  yes returned clarence god helping me  you know our concern is  bringing in good returns and mr castleford will put me in the way  of doing more with my available capital  we will save so as to help you added emily  at which he smiled    chapter xliion a spree    her eyes as stars of twilight fair like twilight too her dusky hair but all things else about her drawn from maytime and the cheerful dawn a dancing shape an image gay to haunt to startle and waylay  wordsworth  clarence went to london according to his determination and as he  had for some time been urgent that i should try some newlyinvented  mechanical appliances he took me with him this being the last  expedition of the ancient yellow chariot  one of his objects was  that i should see st pauls knightsbridge which was then the most  distinguished church of our school of thought and where there was  to be some special preaching  the castlefords had a seat there and  i was settled there in good time looking at the few bits of stained  glass then in the east window when as the clergy came in from the  vestry i beheld a familiar face and recognised the fine  countenance and bearing of our dear old friend frank fordyce  then looking at the row of ladies in front of me i beheld for a  moment an outline of a profile recalling many things  no doubt  anne fordyce was there though instead of barely emulating my  stunted stature she towered above her companions looking to my  mind most fresh and graceful in her pretty summer dress and i knew  that clarence saw her too  i had never heard mr fordyce preach before as in his flying visits  his ministrations were due at hillside and i certainly should have  been struck with the force and beauty of his sermon if i had never  known him before  it was curious that it was on the 49th psalm  meant perhaps for the fashionable congregation but remarkably  chiming in with the feelings of us who were conscious of an  inheritance of evil from one who had done well unto himself  though no doubt that was the last thing honest parson frank was  thinking of  when the service was over and anne turned she became aware of us  and her face beamed all over  it was a charming face with a  general likeness to dear ellens but without the fragile ethereal  look and all health bloom and enjoyment recalling her fathers   she was only moving to let her pewfellows pass out and was waiting  for him to come for her as he did in a few moments and he too was  all pleasure and cordiality  he told us when we were outside that  he had come up to preach and had brought miss anne up for a  spree  they were at a hotel mrs fordyce was at home and the  lesters were not in town this seasona matter of rejoicing to us   could we not come home and dine with them at once  we were too much  afraid of disappointing gooch to do so but they made an appointment  to meet us at the royal academy as soon as it was open the next  morning  there was a fortnight of enjoyment  parson frank was like a boy out  for a holiday  he had not spent more than a day or two in town for  many years anne had not been there since early childhood and they  adopted clarence as their lioniser going through such a country cousin course of delights as in that memorable time with ellen   they even went down to eton and windsor frank fordyce being an old  etonian  i doubt whether clarence ever had a more thoroughly happy  time not even in the north of devon for there was no horse on his  mind and he was not suppressed as in those days  indeed i  believe it is the experience of others besides ourselves that there  is often more unmixed pleasure on casual holidays like this than in  those of early youth for even if spirits are less high which is  not always the case anticipations are less eager there is more  readiness to accept whatever comes more matured appreciation and  less fret and friction at contretemps  i was not much of a drag for when i could not be with the others i  had old friends and the museum was as dear to me as ever in those  recesses that had been the paradise of my youth but there was a  good deal in which we could all share and as usual they were all  kind consideration  anne overflowed with minute remembrances of her old home and  clarence so basked in her sunshine that it began to strike me that  here might be the solution of all the perplexities especially after  the first evening when he had shown his strange discovery to mr  fordyce who simply laughed and said we need not trouble ourselves  about it  illegible was it  he was heartily glad to hear that it  was  even otherwise forty years possession was quite enough and  then he pointed to the grate and said that was the best place for  such things  there was no fire but clarence could hardly rescue  the paper from being torn up  as to the ghost he knew much less than his daughter ellen had done   he said his old aunt had some stories about chantry house being  haunted and had thought it incumbent on her to hate the winslows  but he had thought it all nonsense and such stories were much  better forgotten  would he not see if there were any letters  there might be perhaps in the solicitors office at bath but if he  ever got hold of them he should certainly burn them  what was the  use of being christians if such quarrels were to be remembered  anne knew nothing  aunt peggy had died before she could remember  and even martyn had been discreet  clarence said no more after that  one conversation and seemed to me engrossed between his necessary  business at the office and the pleasant expeditions with the  fordyces  only when they were on the point of returning home did  he tell me that the will had been pronounced utterly past  deciphering and that he thought he saw a way of setting all  straight  so do i was my rejoinder and there must have been a  foolishly sagacious expression about me that made him colour up and  say no such thing edward  dont put that into my head  isnt it there already  it ought not to be  it would be mere treachery in these sweet  fresh young innocent days of hers knowing too what her mother  would think of it and of me  didnt you observe in old franks  unguarded way of reading letters aloud and then trying to suppress  bits that mrs fordyce was not at all happy at our being so much  about with them poor woman  no wonder the child is too young he  added showing how much after all he was thinking of it  it  would be taking a base advantage of them now  but by and by  if she should be still free when the great end is achieved and the  evil repaired then i might dare  he broke off with a look of glad hope and i could see it was  forbearance rather than constitutional diffidence that withheld him  from awakening the maidens feelings  he was a very fine looking  man in his primetall strong and well made with a singularly  grave thoughtful expression and a rare but most winning smile and  anne was overflowing with affectionate gladness at intercourse with  one who belonged to the golden age of her childhood  i could  scarcely believe but that in the friction of the parting the spark  would be elicited and i should even have liked to kindle it for  them myself being tolerably certain that warmhearted unguarded  parson frank would forget all about his lady and blow it with all  his might  we dined with the fordyces at their hotel and sat in the twilight  with the windows open and we made anne and clarence sing as both  could do without notes but he would not undertake to remember  anything with an atom of sentiment in it and when anne did sing  auld lang syne with all her heart he went and got into a dark  corner and barely said thank you  not a definite answer could be extracted from him in reply to all  the warm invitations to beachharbour that were lavished on us by the  father while the daughter expatiated on its charms the rocks i  might sketch the waves and the delicious boating and above all the  fisher children and the church  nothing was wanting but to have us  all there  why had we not brought mrs winslow and emily and  martyn instead of going to dawlish  good creatures they little knew the chill that had been cast upon  martyn  they even bemoaned the having seen so little of him  and  we knew all the time that they were mice at play in the absence of  their excellent and cautious cat  now mind you do come said anne as we were in the act of taking  leave  it would be as good as hillside to have you by my lion  rock  he has a nose just like old chapmans and you must sketch it  before it crumbles off  yes and i want to show you all the dear  old things you made for my babyhouse after the fire your dear  little wardrobe and all  she was coming out with us oblivious that a london hotel was not  like her own free seaside house  her father was out at the  carriage door prepared to help me in clarence halted a moment   please pray go back anne he said and his voice trembled   this is not home you know  she started back but paused  youll not forget  oh no no fear of my forgetting  and when seated beside me he leant back with a sigh  how could you help i said  how  why the perfect innocent childish unconsciousness of the  thing he said and became silent except for one murmur on the way  consequences must be borne    chapter xliiithe price    with thee my bark ill swiftly go    athwart the foaming brine  lord byron  clarence would not tell me his purpose he said till he had  considered it more fully nor could we have much conversation on the  way home as my mother had arranged that we should bring an old  friend of hers back with us to pay her a visit  so i had to sit  inside and make myself agreeable to mrs wrightson while clarence  had plenty of leisure for meditation outside on the box seat  the  good lady said much on the desirableness of marriage for clarence  and the comfort it would be to my mother to see emily settled  we had heard much in town of railway shares and the fortunes of  hudson the railway king were under discussion  i suspected  clarence of cogitating the using his capital in this manner and  hoped that when he saw his way he might not think it dishonourable  to come into further contact with anne and reveal his hopes  he  allowed that he was considering of such investments but would not  say any more  my mother and emily had in the meantime been escorted home by  martyn  the first thing clarence did was to bespeak emilys company  in a turn in the garden  what passed then i never knew nor guessed  for years after  he consulted her whether in case he were absent  from england for five seven or ten years she would be equal to  the care of my mother and me  martyn when ordained would have  duties elsewhere and could only be reckoned upon in emergencies   my mother though vigorous and practical had shown symptoms of  gout and if she were ill i could hardly have done much for her  and on the other hand though my health and powers of moving were at  their best and i was capable of the headwork of the estate i was  scarcely fit to be the representative member of the family   moreover these good creatures took into consideration that poor  mamma and i would have been rather at a loss as each others sole  companions  i could sort shades for her berlin work and even solve  problems of intricate knitting and i could read to her in the  evening but i could not trot after her to her garden poultryyard  and cottages nor could she enter into the pursuits that emily had  shared with me for so many years  our connecting link that dear  sister knew how sorely she would be missed and she told clarence  that she felt fully competent to undertake conjointly with us all  that would be incumbent on chantry house if he really wanted to be  absent  for the rest clarence believed my mother would be the  happier for being left regent over the estate and his scheme broke  upon me that very forenoon when my mother and he were settling some  executors business together and he told her that mr castleford  wished him to go out to hong kong which was then newly ceded to the  english and where the firm wished to establish a house of business  you cant think of it she exclaimed and the sound fell like a  knell on my ears  i think i must was his answer  we shall be cut out if we do not  get a footing there and there is no one who can quite answer the  purpose  not that young frith  ten to one but he is on his way home  besides if not he has his  own work at canton  we see our way to very considerable advantages  if  advantages she interrupted  i hate speculation  i should have  thought you might be contented with your station but that is the  worst of merchantsthey never know when to stop  i suppose your  ambition is to make this a great overgrown mansion so that your  father would not know it again  certainly not that mamma said clarence smiling it is the last  thing i should think of but stopping would in this case mean going  backward  why cant mr castleford send one of his own sons  probably walter may come out by and by but he has not experience  enough for this  clarence had not in the least anticipated my mothers opposition  for he had come to underestimate her affection for and reliance on  him  he had us all against him for not only could we not bear to  part with him but the climate of hongkong was in evil repute and  i had become persuaded that with his knowledge of business railway  shares and scrip might be made to realise the amount needed but he  said that is what i call speculation  the other matter is trade  in which with heavens blessing i can hope to prosper  he explained that mr castleford had received him on his coming to  london with almost a request that he would undertake this  expedition but with fears whether in his new position he could or  would do so although his presence in china would be very important  to the firm at this juncture and there would be opportunities which  would probably result in very considerable profits after a few  years  if clarence had been as before a mere younger brother it  would have been thought an excellent chance and he would almost  have felt bound by his obligations to mr castleford to undertake  the first starting of the enterprise if it had not been for our  recent loss and the doubt whether he could he spared from home  he made light of the dangers of climate  he had never suffered in  that way in his naval days and scarcely knew what serious illness  meant  indeed he had outgrown much of that sensibility of nerve  which had made him so curiously open to spiritual or semispiritual  impressions  any way he said the thing is right to be done provided my  mother does not make an absolute point of my giving it up and  whether she does or not depends a good deal on how you others put it  to her  right on mr castlefords account i asked  that is one side of it  to refuse would put him in a serious  difficulty but i could perhaps come home sooner if it were not for  this other matter  i told him so far as that it was an object with  me to raise this sum in a few years and he showed me how there is  every likelihood of my being able to do so out there  so now i feel  in your hands  if you all and edward chiefly set to and persuade  my mother that this undertaking is a dangerous business and that i  can only be led to it by inordinate love of riches  no no  thats what she thinks pursued clarence and that i want to be a  grander man than my father  thats at the bottom of her mind i  see  well if you deplore this and let her think the place cant  do without me she will come out in her strength and make it my duty  to stay at home  it is very tempting said emily  we all undertook to give up something  we never thought it would come in this way  we never do said clarence  tell me said martyn is this to content that ghost poor thing   for it is very hard to believe in her except in the mullion room in  december  exactly so martyn he answered  impressions fade and the  intellect fails to accept them  but i do not think that is my  motive  we know that a wicked deed was done by our ancestor and we  hardly have the right to pray remember not the sins of our  forefathers unless now that we know the crime we attempt what  restitution in us lies  there was no resisting after this appeal and after the first shock  my mother was ready to admit that as clarence owed everything to mr  castleford he could not well desert the firm if it were really  needful for its welfare that he should go out  we got her to look  on mr castleford as captain of the ship and clarence as first  lieutenant and when she was once convinced that he did not want to  aggrandise the family but to do his duty she dropped her  objections and we soon saw that the occupations that his absence  would impose on her would be a fresh interest in life  just as the decision was thus ratified a packet from canton arrived  for clarence from bristol  it was the first reply of young frith to  the tidings of the bequest which had changed the poor clerk to a  wealthy man owning a large proportion of the shares of the  prosperous house  i asked if he were coming home and clarence briefly replied that he  did not knowit depended  is he going to wed a fair chinese with lily feet asked martyn to  which the reply was an unusually discourteous bosh as clarence  escaped with his letter  he was so reticent about it that i  required a solemn assurance that poor lawrences head had not been  turned by his fortune and that there was nothing wrong with him   indeed there was great stupidity in never guessing the purport of  that thick letter nor that it contained one for emily where  lawrence frith laid himself and all that he had at her feet  ascribing to her all the resolution with which he had kept from  evil and entreating permission to come home and endeavour to win  her heart  we lived so constantly together that it is surprising  that clarence contrived to give the letter to emily in private  she  implored him to say nothing to us and brought him the next day her  letter of uncompromising refusal  he asked whether it would have been the same if he had intended to  remain at home  as if you were a woman you conceited fellow was all the answer  she vouchsafed him  nor could he ascertain nor perhaps would she herself examine on  which side lay her heart of hearts  the proof had come whether she  would abide by her pledge to him to accept the care of us in his  absence  when he asked it it had not occurred to him that it might  be a renunciation of marriage  now he perceived that so it had  been but she kept her counsel and so did he  we others never  guessed at what was going on between those two    chapter xlivpaying the cost    but oh the difference to me  wordsworth  so clarence was gone and our new life begun in its changed aspect   emily showed an almost feverish eagerness to make it busy and  cheerful getting up a sewing class in the village resuming the  study of greek grappling with the natural system in botany all of  which had been fitfully proposed but hindered by interruptions and  my fathers feebleness  on a suggestion of mr staffords we set to work on that history of  letter writing which what with collecting materials and making  translations lasted us three years altogether and was a great  resource and pleasure besides ultimately bringing in a fraction  towards the great purpose  emily has confessed that she worked away  a good deal of vague weary depression and sense of monotony into  those greek choruses  but to us she was always a sunbeam with her  ever ready attention and the playfulness which resumed more of  genuine mirth after the first effort and strain of spirits were  over  then journalletters on either side began to bridge the gulf of  separationthose which minus all the specially interesting  portions are to be seen in the volume we culled from them and  which had considerable success in its day  martyn worked in the parish and read with mr henderson till he was  old enough for ordination and then took the curacy of st  wulstans under a hardworking london vicar and thenceforth his  holidays were our festivals  our old london friends pitied us for  what they viewed as a fearfully dull life and in the visits they  occasionally paid us thought they were doing us a great favour by  bringing us new ideas and shooting our partridges  we hardly deserved their compassion  our lives were full of  interest to ourselvesthat interest which comes of doing ever so  feeble a stroke of work in one great cause and there was much keen  participation in the general life of the church in the crisis  through which she was passing  we found that what with drawing  pictures writing little books preparing lessons for teachers and  much besides which is now ready done by the national society and  sunday school institute we could do a good deal to assist martyn in  his london work and our own grew upon us  for the first year of her widowhood my mother shrank from society  and afterwards had only spasmodic fits of doubt whether it were not  her duty to make my sister go out more  so that now and then emily  did go to a party or to make a visit of some days or weeks from  home and then we knew how valuable she was  it would be hard to  say whether my mother were relieved or disappointed when emily  refused james eastwood in spite of many persuasions not only from  himself but his family  i believe mamma thought it selfish to be  glad and that it was a failure in duty not to have performed that  weighty matter of marrying her daughter feeling in some way  inferior to ladies who had disposed of a whole flock under five and  twenty whereas she had not been able to get rid of a single one  of clarences doings in china i need not speak you have read of  them in the book for yourselves and you know how his work  prospered so that the results more than fulfilled his expectations  and raised the firm to the pitch of greatness and reputation which  it has ever since preserved and this without soiling his hands with  the miserable opium traffic  some of the subordinates were so set  on the gains to be thus obtained that he and lawrence frith had a  severe struggle with them to prevent it and were forced conjointly  to use all their authority as principals to make it impossible   those two were the greatest of friends  their chief relaxation was  one anothers company and their earnest aim was to support the  christian mission and to keep up the tone of their english  dependants a terribly difficult matter and one that made the time  of their return somewhat doubtful even when walter castleford was  gone out to relieve them  their health had kept up so well that we  had ceased to be anxious on that point and it was through the  castlefords that we received the first hint that clarence might not  be as well as his absence of complaint had led us to believe  in fact he had never been well since a terrible tempest when he had  worked hard and exposed himself to save life  i never could hear  the particulars for lawrence was away and clarence could not write  about it himself having been prostrated by one of those chills so  perilous in hot countries but from all i have heard no resident in  hongkong would have believed that mr winslows courage could ever  have been called in question  he ought to have come home  immediately after that attack of fever for the five years were  over and his work nearly done but there was need to consolidate  his achievements and a strong man is only too apt to trifle with  his health  we might have guessed something by the languor and  brevity of his letters but we thought the absence of detail owing  to his expectation of soon seeing us and had gone on for months  expecting the announcement of a speedy return when an unexpected  shock fell on us  our dear mother was still an active woman with  few signs of age about her when in her sixtyseventh year she was  almost suddenly taken from us by an attack of gout in the stomach  i feel as if i had not done her justice and as if she might seem  stern unsympathising and lacking in tenderness  yet nothing could  be further from the truth  she was an oldfashioned mother who  held it her duty to keep up her authority and counted over familiarity and indulgence as sins  to her the holy spirit of  discipline was the beginning of wisdom and to make her children  godly truthful and honourable was a much greater object than to  win their love  and their love she had and kept to a far higher  degree than seems to be the case with those who court affection by  caresses and indulgence  we knew that her approval was of a  generous kind we prized enthusiastically her rare betrayals of her  motherly tenderness and we depended on her in a manner we only  realised in the desolation dreariness and helplessness that fell  upon us when we knew that she was gone  she had not nor had any  of us understood that she was dying and she had uttered only a few  words that could imply any such thought  on hearing that there was  a letter from clarence she said poor clarence  i should like to  have seen him  he is a good boy after all  ive been hard on him  but it will all be right now  god almighty bless him  that was the only formal blessing she left among us  indeed the  last time i saw her was with an ordinary goodnight at the foot of  the stairs  emily said she was glad that i had not to carry with me  the remembrance of those paroxysms of suffering  my dear emily had  alone the whole force of that trialor shall i call it privilege   martyn did not reach home till some hours after all was over poor  boy  and in the midst of our desolateness just as we had let the  daylight in again upon our diminished numbers round the table came  a letter from hongkong addressed to me in lawrence friths  writing and the first thing i saw was a scrawl as follows   dearest tedall is in your hands  you can do it  god bless you  all  w c w   when i came to myself and could see and hear martyn was impressing  on me that where there is life there is hope though indeed  according to poor lawrences letter there was little of either  he  feared our hearing indirectly and therefore wrote to prepare us  he had been summoned to hongkong to find clarence lying desperately  ill for the most part semidelirious holding converse with  invisible forms or entreating some one to let him alonehe had  done his best  in one of his more lucid intervals he had made  lawrence find that note in a case that lay near him and promise to  send it and he had tried to send some messages but they had become  confused and he was too weak to speak further  the next mail was sure to bring the last tidings of one who had  given his life for right and justice  it was only a reprieve that  what it actually brought was the intelligence that he was still  alive and more sensible and had been able to take much pleasure in  seeing the friend of his youth captain coles who was there with  his ship the douro  then there had been a relapse  captain coles  had brought his doctor to see him and it had been pronounced that  the best chance of saving him was a seavoyage  the douro had just  received orders to return to england and coles had offered to take  home both the friends as guests though there was evidently little  hope that our brother would reach any earthly home  as we knew  afterwards he had smiled and said it was like rehabilitation to  have the chance of dying on board one of hm ships  and he was  held in such respect and was so entirely one of the leading men of  the little growing colony and had been known as such a friend to  the naval men and had so gallantly aided a queens ship in that  hurricane that his passage home in this manner only seemed a  natural tribute of respect  a few last words from lawrence told us  that he was safely on board all unconscious of the silent almost  weeping procession that had escorted his litter to the douros  boat only too much as if it were his bier  in fact captain coles  actually promised him that if he died at sea he should be buried  with the old flag  we could not hope to hear more for at least six weeks since our  letter had come by overland mail and the douro would take her time   it was a comfort in this waiting time that martyn could be with us   his rector had been promoted there was a general change of curates  and as martyn had been working up to the utmost limits of his  strength we had no scruple in inducing him to remain with us and  undertake nothing fresh till this crisis was past  though as to  rest not one sunday passed without requests for his assistance from  one or more of the neighbouring clergy    chapter xlvachieved    and hopes and fears that kindle hope an undistinguishable throng and gentle wishes long subdued  subdued and cherished long  s t coleridge  the first that we did hear of our brother was a letter with a  falmouth postmark which we scarcely dared to open  there was not  much in it but that was enough  d g i shall see you all again   we put in at portsmouth  there was no staying at home after that  we three lost no time in  starting for railways had become available and by the time we had  driven from the station at portsmouth the douro had been signalled  martyn took a boat and went on board alone for besides that emily  did not like to leave me her dress would have been a revelation  that all were no longer there to greet the arrival  the precaution  was however unnecessary  there stood clarence on deck and after  the first greeting he laid his hand on martyns arm and said my  mother is gone and on the wondering assent i was quite sure of  it  so they came ashore clarence lying in the manofwars boat in  which his friend insisted on sending him able now to give a smiling  response and salute to the three cheers with which the crew took  leave of him  he was carried up to our hotel on a stretcher by  halfadozen blue jackets  indeed he was grievously changed  looking so worn and weak so holloweyed and yellow and so  fearfully wasted that the very memory is painful and able to do  nothing but lie on the sofa holding emilys hand gazing at us with  a face full of ineffable peace and gladness  there was a misgiving  upon me that he had only come back to finish his work and bid us  farewell  kindly and considerately they had sent him on before with martyn   in a quarter of an hours time his good doctor came in with lawrence  frith a considerable contrast to our poor clarence for the slim  gypsy lad had developed into a strikingly handsome man still  slender and lithe but with a fine bearing and his bronzed  complexion suiting well with his dark shining hair and beautiful  eyes  they had brought some of the luggage and the doctor insisted  that his patient should go to bed directly and rest completely  before trying to talk  then we heard that his condition though still anxious was far from  being hopeless and that after the tropics had been passed he had  been gradually improving  the kind doctor had got leave to go up to  london with us and talk over the case with l and he hoped  clarence might be able to bear the journey by the next afternoon  presently after came captain coles whom we had not seen since the  short visit when we had idolised the big overgrown midshipman whom  clarence exhibited to our respectful and distant admiration nearly  twenty years ago  my mother used to call him a gentlemanly lad and  that was just what he was still with a singularly soft gentle  manner gallant officer and postcaptain as he was  he cheered me  much for he made no doubt of clarences ultimate recovery and he  added that he had found the dear fellow so valued and valuable so  useful in all good works and so much respected by all the english  residents that really said the captain i did not know whether  to deplore that the service should have lost such a man or whether  to think it had been a good thing for him though not for us that that he got into such a scrape  i said something of our thanks  to tell you the truth said coles i had my doubts whether it had  not been a cruel act for he had a terrible turn after we got him on  board and all the sounds of a queens ship revived the past  associations and always of a painful kind in his delirium till at  last just as i gave him up the whole character of his fancies  seemed to change and from that time he has been gaining every day  we kept the captain to dinner and gathered a good deal more  understanding of the important position to which clarence had risen  by force of character and rectitude of purpose in that strange  little anglochinese colony and afterwards i was allowed to make a  long visit to clarence who having eaten and slept was quite ready  to talk  it seemed that the great distress of his illness had been the  recurrencenay aggravationof the strange susceptibility of brain  and nerve that had belonged to his earlier days and with it either  imagination or perception of the spiritworld  much that had seemed  delirium had belonged to that double consciousness and he perfectly  recollected it  as coles had said the sights and sounds of the  ship had been a renewal of the saddest time in his life he could  not at night divest himself of the impression that he was under  arrest and the sins of his life gathered themselves in fearful and  oppressive array as if to stifle him and the phantom of poor  margaret with her lampwhich had haunted him from the beginning of  his illnessseemed to taunt him with having been too fainthearted  and tardy to be worthy to espouse her cause  the faith to which he  tried to cling would seem to fail him in those awful hours when he  could only cry out mechanical prayers for mercy  then there had  come a night when he had heard my mother say all right now god  almighty bless him  and therewith the clouds cleared from his  mind  the power of feeling as well as believing in the blotting  out of sin returned the sense of pardon and peace calmed him and  from that time he was fully himself again though he said i  knew i should not see my mother here  if she could only have seen him come home under the union jack  cheered by sailors and carried ashore by them it would have been  to her like restoration  perhaps clarence in his dreamy weakness  had so felt it for certainly no other mode of return to portsmouth  the very place of his degradation could so have soothed him and  effaced those memories  the english sounds were a perfect charm to  him as well as to lawrence the commonest street cry the very  slices of bread and butter anything that was not chinese was as  water to the thirsty  and wasted as was his face the quiet rest  and joy were ineffable  still portsmouth was not the best place for him and we were glad  that he was well enough to go up to london in the afternoon  intensely delighting in the may beauty of the green meadows and  white blossoming hedgerows and the church towers especially the  gray massiveness of winchester cathedral  christian tokens he  said instead of the gay gilded pagodas and quaint crumpled roofs  he had left  the soft haze seemed to be such a rest after the glare  of perpetual clearness  we were all born londoners and looked at the blue fog and the  broad misty river and the brooding smoke with the affection of  natives to the amazement of lawrence who had never been in town  without being browbeaten and miserable  that he hardly was now as  he sat beside emily all the way up though they did not say much to  one another  he told us it was quite a new sensation to walk into the office  without timidity and to have no fears of a biting crushing speech  about his parents or himself but to have the clerks getting up  deferentially as soon as he was known for mr frith  he had hardly  ever been allowed by his old uncle to come across mr castleford  who was of course cordial and delighted to receive him and without  loss of time set forth to see clarence  the consultation with the physician had taken place and it was not  concealed from us that clarences health was completely shattered  and his state still very precarious needing the utmost care to give  him any chance of recovering the effects of the last two years when  he had persevered in spite of warning in his eagerness to complete  his undertaking and then to secure what he had effected  the  upshot of the advice given him was to spend the summer by the  seaside and if he had by that time gathered strength and  surmounted the symptoms of disease to go abroad as he was not  likely to be able as yet to bear english cold  business and cares  were to be avoided and if he had anything necessary to be done it  had better be got over at once so as to be off his mind  martyn  and frith gathered that the case was thought doubtful and entirely  dependent on constitution and rallying power  clarence himself  seemed almost passive caring only for our presence and the  accomplishment of his task  we had a blessed thanksgiving for mercies received in the margaret  street chapel as we called what is now all saints but he and i  were unfit for crowds and on sunday morning availed ourselves of a  friends seat in our old church which felt so natural and homelike  to us elders that martyn was scandalised at our taste  but it was  the church of our confirmation and first communion and clarence  rejoiced that it was that of his first homecoming eucharist  what  a contrast was he now to the shrinking boy scarcely tolerated under  his stigmatised name  surely the angel had led him all his life  through  how happy we two were in the afternoon while the others conducted  lawrence to some more noteworthy church  now said clarence let us go down to beachharbour  it must be  done at once  i have been trying to write and i cant do it and  his face lighted with a quiet smile which i understood  so we wrote to the principal hotel to secure rooms and set forth on  tuesday leaving frith to finish with mr castleford what could not  be settled in the one business interview that had been held with  clarence on the monday    chapter xlvirestitution    ah well for us all some sweet hope lies deeply buried from human eyes  whittier  things always happen in unexpected ways  during the little  hesitation and difficulty that always attend my transits at a  station a voice was heard to say oh  papa isnt that edward  winslow  martyn gave a violent start and mr fordyce was  exclaiming clarence my dear fellow it isnt you  i beg your  pardon you have strength enough left nearly to wring ones hand  off  ii wanted very much to see you sir said clarence  could you  be so good as to appoint a time  see you  we must always be seeing you of course  let me think   ive got three weddings and a funeral tomorrow and simpson coming  about the meeting  come to luncheonall of you  mrs fordyce will  be delighted and so will somebody else  there was no doubt about the somebody else for annes feet were as  nearly dancing round emily as public propriety allowed and the  radiance of her face was something to rejoice in  say what people  will englishwomen in a quiet cheerful life are apt to gain rather  than lose in looks up to the borders of middle age  our emily at  twoandthirty was fair and pleasant to look on while as for anne  fordyce at twentythree words will hardly tell how lovely were her  delicate features brown eyes and carnation cheeks illuminated by  that sunshine brightness of her fathers which made one feel better  all day for having been beamed upon by either of them  clarence  certainly did when the good man turned back to say which hotel   eh  thats too far off  you must come nearer  i would see you in  but ive got a woman to see before church time and im short of a  curate so i must be sharp to the hour  can i be of any use eagerly asked martyn  ill follow you as  soon as i have got these fellows to their quarters  we had amos with us and were soon able to release martyn after a  few compliments on my not being as usual the invalid and by and by  he came back to take emily to inspect a lodging recommended by our  friends close to the beach and not a stones throw from the  rectory built by mr fordyce  as we two useless beings sat opposite  to each other looking over the roofs of houses at the blue expanse  and feeling the salt breeze it was no fancy that clarences cheek  looked less wan and his eyes clearer as a smile of content played  on his lips  years sit well on her he said gaily and i thought  of rewards in store for him  then he took this opportunity of consulting me on the chances for  frith telling of the original offer and the quiet constancy of his  friend and asking whether i thought emily would relent  and i  answered that i suspected that she wouldbut you must get well  first  i begin to think that more possible he answered and my heart  bounded as he added she would be satisfied since you would always  have a home with us  oh how much was implied in that monosyllable  he knew it for a  little faint colour came up as he shyly laughed and hesitated  that isif  if included mrs fordyces not being ungracious  nor was she   emily had found her as kind as in the old days at hillside and  perfectly ready to bring us into close vicinity  it was not caprice  that had made this change but all possible doubt and risk of  character were over the old wound was in some measure healed and  the friendship had been brought foremost by our recent sorrow and  our present anxiety  anne was in ecstasies over emily  it is so  odd she said to have grown as old as you whom i used to think  so very grown up and she had all her pet plans to display in the  future  moreover martyn had been permitted to relieve the rector  from the funerala privilege which seemed to gratify him as much as  if it had been the liveliest of services  we were to lunch at the rectory and the move of our goods was to be  effected while we were there  we found mrs fordyce looking much  older but far less of an invalid than in old times and there was  something more genial and less exclusive in her ways owing perhaps  to the difference of her life among the many classes with whom she  was called on to associate  somersetshire beachharbour and china occupied our tongues by  turns and we had to begin luncheon without the rector who had been  hindered by numerous calls in fact as anne warned us it was a  wonder if he got the length of the esplanade without being stopped  halfadozen times  his welcome was like himself but he needed a reminder of clarences  request for an interview  then we repaired to the study for  clarence begged that his brothers might be present and then the  beginning was made  do you remember my showing you a will that i  found in the ruins at chantry house  a horrid old scrap that you chose to call one  yes i told you to  burn it  sir we have proved that a great injustice was perpetrated by our  ancestor philip winslow and that the poor lady who made that will  was cruelly treated if not murdered  this is no fancy i have  known it for years past but it is only now that restitution has  become possible  restitution  what are you talking about  i never wanted the place  nor coveted it  no sir but the act was our forefathers  you cannot bid us sit  down under the consciousness of profiting by a crime  i could not  do so before but i now implore you to let me restore you either  chantry house and the three farms or their purchase money  according to the valuation made at my fathers death  i have it in  hand  frank fordyce walked about the room quite overcome  you foolish  fellow he said was it for this that you have been toiling and  throwing away your health in that pestiferous place  edward did  you know this  yes i answered  clarence has intended this ever since he found  the will  as if that was a will  you consented  we all thought it right  he made a gesture of dismay at such folly  i do not think you understand how it was mr fordyce said  clarence who by this time was quivering and trembling as in his  boyish days  no nor ever wish to do so  such matters ought to be forgotten  and you dont look fit to say another word  edward will tell you said clarence leaning back  i had the whole written out and was about to begin when the  person with whom there was an appointment was reported and we  knew that the rest of the day was mapped out  look here said mr fordyce leave that with me i cant give any  answer offhand except that don quixote is come alive again only  too like himself  which was true for clarence took long to rally from the effort and  had to be kept quiet for some time in the study where we were left   he examined me on the contents of my paper and was vexed to hear  that i had mentioned the ghost which he said would discredit the  whole  never was the dear fellow so much inclined to be fretful  and when martyn restlessly observed that if we did not want him he  might as well go back to the drawingroom the reply was quite  sharpoh yes by all means  no wonder there was pain in the tone for the next words after some  interval were when two happy voices came ringing in from the  garden behind you see edward  somehow i had never thought of martyn  he had simply seemed to me a  boy and i had decided that anne would be the crown of clarences  labours  i answered nonsense they are both children together  the nonsense was elsewhere he said  they always were devoted to  each other  i saw how it was the moment he came into the room  dont give up i said it is only the old habit  when she knows  all she must prefer  hush he said  an old scarecrow and that beautiful young  creature and he laughed  you wont be an old scarecrow long  no he said in an ominous way and cut short the discussion by  going back to mrs fordyce  he was worn out had a bad night and did not get up to breakfast i  was waiting for it in the sittingroom when mr fordyce came in  after matins with emily and martyn  i feel just like david when they brought him the water of  bethlehem he said  you know i think this all nonsense  especially thisthis ghost business and yet suchsuch doings as  your brothers cant go for nothing  his face worked and the tears were in his eyes then as he partook  of our breakfast he crossexamined us on my statement and even  tried to persuade us that the phantom in the ruin was emily and on  her observing that she could not have seen herself he talked of the  brocken spectre and fog mirages but we declared the night was  clear and i told him that all the rational theories i had ever  heard were far more improbable than the appearance herself at which  he laughed  then he scrupulously demanded whether thisthis he  failed to find a name for it would be an impoverishment of our  family and i showed how clarence had provided that we should be in  as easy circumstances as before  in the midst came in clarence  himself having hastened to dress on hearing that mr fordyce was  in the house and looking none the better for the exertion  look here my dear boy said frank taking his hot trembling hand  you have put me in a great fix  you have done the noblest deed at  a terrible cost and whatever i may think it ought not to be thrown  away nor you be hindered from freeing your soul from this sense of  family guilt  but here my forefathers had as little right to the  chantry as yours and ever since i began to think about such things  i have been thankful it was none of mine  let us join in giving it  or its value to some good work for godpour it out to the lord as  we may say  bless me what have i done now  for clarence muttering thank you sank out of his grasp on a  chair and as nearly as possible fainted but he was soon smiling  and saying it was all relief and he felt as if a load he had been  bearing had been suddenly removed  frank fordyce durst stay no longer but laid his hand on clarences  head and blessed him    chapter xlviithe fordyce story    for soon as once the genial plain has drunk the lifeblood of the slain indelible the spots remain and aye for vengeance call  euripidesanstice  still all was not over for by the next day our brother was as ill  or worse than ever  the doctor who came from london allowed that  he had expected something of the kind but thought we must have let  him exert himself perilously  poor innocent martyn and anne they  little suspected that their bright eyes and happy voices had  something to do with the struggle and disappointment which probably  was one cause of the collapse  as to poor frank fordyce i never  saw him so distressed he felt as if it were all his own fault or  that of his ancestors and whenever he was not required by his  duties was lingering about for news  i had little hope though  clarence seemed to me the very light of my eyes it was to me as  though his task being accomplished and the earthly reward denied  he must be on his way to the higher one  his complete quiescence confirmed me in the assurance that he  thought so himself  he was too ill for speech but lawrence who  could not stay away was struck with the difference from former  times  not only were there no delusions but there was no anxiety  or uneasiness as there had always been in the former attacks when  he was evidently eager to live and still more solicitous to be told  if he were in a hopeless state  now he had plainly resigned himself     content to live but not afraid to die   and perhaps dear fellow it was chiefly for my sake that he was  willing to live  at least i know that when the worst was over he  announced it by putting those wasted fingers into mine and saying   well dear old fellow i believe we shall jog on together after  all  that attack though the most severe of all brought either owing to  skilful treatment or to his own calm the removal of the mischief  and the beginning of real recovery  previously he had given himself  no time but had hurried on to exertions which retarded his cure so  as very nearly to be fatal but he was now perfectly submissive to  whatever physicians or nurses desired and did not seem to find his  slow convalescence in the least tedious since he was amongst us all  again  it was nearly a month before he was disposed to recur to the subject  of his old solicitude again and then he asked what mr fordyce had  said or done  just nothing at all but on the next visit paid to  the sickroom parson frank yielded to his earnest request to send  for any documents that might throw light on the subject and after a  few days he brought us a packet of letters from his deedbox  they  were written from hillside rectory to the son in the army in  flanders chiefly by his mother and were full of hot angry  invective against our family and pity for poor foolish madam or  cousin winslow as she was generally termed for having put  herself in their power  the one most to the purpose was an account of the examination of  molly cox the waitingwoman who had been in attendance on the  unfortunate margaret and whose story tallied fairly with aunt  peggys tradition  she declared that she was sure that her mistress  had met with foul play  she had left her as usual at ten oclock on  the fatal 27th of december 1707 in the inner one of the old  chambers and in the night had heard the tipsy return home of the  gentlemen followed by shrieks  in the morning she the maid who  usually was the first to go to her room was met by mistress betty  winslow and told that madam was ill and insensible  the old nurse  of the winslows was called in and molly was never left alone in the  sickroom scarcely permitted to approach the bed and never to  touch her lady  once when emptying out a cup at the gardendoor  she saw a mark of blood on the steps but mr philip came up and  swore at her for a prying fool  doctor tomkins was sent for but he  barely walked through the room and all know that he is a mere  creature of philip winslow wrote the mrs fordyce of that date to  her son  and presently after justice eastwood declared there is  no case for a grand jury but he is a known friend and sworn comrade  of the winslows and bound to suppress all evidence against them   nay james dearlove swears he saw edward winslow slip a golden  guinea into his clerks hand  but as sure as there is a heaven  above us francis poor cousin winslow was trying to escape to us of  her own kindred and met with cruel usage  her blood is on their  heads  there said frank fordyce  this francis challenged philip  winslows eldest son a mere boy three days after he joined the  army before lille and shot him like a dog  i turned over the  letter about it in searching for these  i cant boast of my  ancestors more than you can  but may god accept this work of yours  and take away the guilt of blood from both of us  and have you thought what is best to be done asked clarence  raising himself on his cushions  have you asked the vicar  oh yes i have had my dreams  they put their castles together and they turned out to be for an  orphanage or rather asylum not too much hampered with strict  rules combined with a convalescent home  the battle of sisterhoods  was not yet fought out and we were not quite prepared for them but  frank fordyce had as he said the two best women in the world in  his eye to make a beginning  there was full time to think and discuss the scheme for our patient  was in no condition to move for many weeks lying day after day on a  couch just within the window of our sittingroom which was as  nearly as possible in the sea so that he constantly had the  freshness of its breezes the music of its ripple and the sight of  its waves and seemed to find endless pleasure in watching the red  sails the puffs of steam and the frolics of the children simple  or gentle on the beach  something else was sometimes to be watched  martyn all this time  was doing the work of two curates and was to be seen walking home  with anne from church or school carrying her baskets and bags and  as we were given to understand discussing by turns ecclesiastical  questions visionary sisterhoods and naughty children  at first i  wished it were possible to remove clarence from the perpetual  spectacle but we had one last talk over the matter and this was  quite satisfactory  it does me no harm he said i like to see it  yes it is quite  true that i do  what was personal and selfish in my fancies seems  to have been worn out in the great lull of my senses under the  shadow of death and now i can revert with real joy and thankfulness  to the old delight of looking on our dear ellen as our sister and  watch those two children as we used when they talked of dolls  fenders instead of the surplice war  i have got you edward and  you know there is a love passing the love of women  a lively young couple passed by the window just then and with  untamed voices observed   there are those two poor miserable objects  it is enough to make  one melancholy only to look at them  whereat we simultaneously burst out laughing perhaps because a  choking very far from misery was in our throats  at any rate clarence was prepared to be the cordial fatherly  brother when martyn came headlong in upon us with the tidings that  utterly indescribable unimaginable joy had befallen him  a  revelation seemed simultaneously to have broken upon him and anne  while they were copying out the sunday school registers that what  they had felt for each other all their lives was lovereal true  love as anne said to emily that never could have cared for  anybody else  mrs fordyces sharp eyes had seen what was coming and accepted the  inevitable quite as soon as clarence had  she came and talked it  over with us saying she was perfectly satisfied and happy  martyn  was all that could be wished and she was sincerely glad of the  connection with her old friends  so in fact was dear old frank  but he had been running about with his head full and his eyes  closed so that it was quite a shock to him to find that his little  anne his boon companion and playfellow was actually grown up and  presuming to love and be loved and he could hardly believe that she  was really seven years older than her sister had been when the like  had begun with her  but if anne must be at those tricks he said  shaking his head at her he had rather it was with martyn than  anybody else  there was no difficulty as to money matters  in truth martyn was  not so good a match as an heiress such as was anne fordyce might  have aspired to and her lester kin were sure to be shocked but  even if clarence married the earlscombe living went for something  though by the bye he has never held it and the fordyces only  cared that there should be easy circumstances  the living of  hillside would be resigned in favour of martyn in the spring and  meantime he would gain more experience at beachharbour and this  would break the separation to the fordyces  after all however theirs was not to be our first wedding  i have  said little of emily  the fact was that after that week of  clarences danger we said she lived in a kind of dream  she  fulfilled all that was wanted of her nursing clarence waiting on  me ordering dinner making the tea and so forth but it was quite  evident that life began for her on the saturdays when lawrence came  down and ended on the mondays when he went away  if in the  meantime she sat down to work she went off into a trance if she  was sent out for fresh air she walked quarterdeck on the  esplanade neither seeing nor hearing anything we averred but some  imaginary lawrence frith  if she had any drawback good girl it was the idea of deserting me  but then as i could honestly tell her nobody need fear for my  happiness since clarence was given back to me  and she believed  and was ready to go to china with her lawrence    chapter xlviiithe last discovery    grief will be joy if on its edge fall soft that holiest ray joy will be grief if no faint pledge be there of heavenly day  keble  we did not move from beachharbour till september and by that time  it had been decided that chantry house itself should be given up to  the new scheme  it was too large for us and clarence had never  lived there enough to have any strong home feeling for it but he  rather connected it with disquiet and distress and had a longing to  make actual restitution thereof instead of only giving an  equivalent as he did in the case of the farms  our feelings about  the desecrated chapel were also considerably changed from the days  when we regarded it merely as a picturesque ruin and it was to be  at once restored both for the benefit of the orphanage and for that  of the neighbouring households  for ourselves a cottage was to be  built suited to our idiosyncrasies but that could wait till after  the yacht voyage which we were to make together for the winter  thus it came to pass that the last time we inhabited chantry house  was when we gave emily to lawrence frith  we would fain have made  it a double wedding but the fordyces wished to wait for easter  when martyn would have been inducted to hillside  they came  however that mrs fordyce might act lady of the house and anne be  bridesmaid as well as lay the first stone of st cecilys restored  chapel  it was on the day on which they were expected when the workmen were  digging foundations and clearing away rubbish that the foreman  begged mr winslow to come out to see something they had found   clarence came back very grave and awestruck  it was an old oak  chest and within lay a skeleton together with a few fragments of  female clothing a wedding ring and some coins of the later  stewarts in a rotten leathern purse  this was ghastly  confirmation though there was nothing else to connect the bones  with poor margaret  we had some curiosity as to the coffin in the  niche in the family vault which bore her name but both clarence and  mr fordyce shrank from investigations which could not be carried  out without publicity and might perhaps have disturbed other  remains  so on the ensuing night there was a strange quiet funeral service  at earlscombe church  mr henderson officiated and chapman acted  as clerk  these with amos bell alone knew the tradition or  understood what the discovery meant to the two fordyces and three  winslows who stood at the opening of the vault and prayed that  whatever guilt there might be should be put away from the families  so soon to be made one  the coins were placed with those of  victoria which the next day anne laid beneath the foundationstone  of st cecilys  i need not say that no one has ever again heard  the wailings nor seen the lady with the lamp  what more is there to tell  it was of this first half of our lives  that i intended to write and though many years have since passed  they have not had the same character of romance and would not  interest you  our honeymoon as mr fordyce called the expedition  we two brothers made in the mediterranean was a perfect success  and clarence regained health and better spirits than had ever been  his while contriving to show me all that i was capable of being  carried to see  it was complete enjoyment and he came home not as  strong as in old times but with fair comfort and capability for the  work of life so as to be able to take mr castlefords place when  our dear old friend retired from active direction of the firm  you all know how the two old bachelors have kept house together in  london and at earlscombe cottage and you are all proud of the  honoured name clarence winslow has made for himself foremost in  works for the glory of god and the good of menas one of those  merchant princes of england whose merchandise has indeed been  holiness unto the lord  thus you must all have felt a shock on finding that he always looked  on that name as blotted and that one of the last sayings i heard  from him was o remember not the sins and offences of my youth but  according to thy mercy think upon me o lord for thy goodness  then he almost smiled and said yes he has so looked on me and i  am thankful  thankful and so am i for those thirtyfour peaceful years we spent  together or rather for the seventy years of perfect brotherhood  that we have been granted and though he has left me behind him i  am content to wait  it cannot be for long  my brothers and  sisters their children and my faithful amos bell are very good to  me and in writing up to that mezzo termine of our lives i have  been living it over again with my brother of brothers through the  troubles that have become like joys   remarks   uncle edward has not said half enough about his dear old self  i  want to know if he never was unhappy when he was young about being  like that though mother says his face was always nearly as  beautiful as it is now  and it is not only goodness  it is  beautiful with his sweet smile and snowy white hair  ellen winslow  and i wonder though perhaps he could not have told what aunt anne  would have done if uncle clarence had not been so forbearing before  he went to china  clare frith  the others are highly impertinent questions but we ought to know  what became of lady peacock  ed g w   reply   poor woman she drifted back to london after about ten years with  an incurable disease  clarence put her into lodgings near us and  did his best for her as long as she lived  he had a hard task but  she ended by saying he was her only friend  to question no 2 i have nothing to say but as to no 1 with its  extravagant compliment nature or rather god blessed me with even  spirits a methodical nature that prefers monotony and very little  morbid shyness nor have i ever been devoid of tender care and love   so that i can only remember three severe fits of depression  one  when i had just begun to be taken out in the square gardens and  selina clarkson was heard to say i was a hideous little monster  it  was a revelation and must have given frightful pain for i remember  it acutely after sixtyfive years  the second fit was just after clarence was gone to sea and some  very painful experiments had been tried in vain for making me like  other people  for the first time i faced the fact that i was set  aside from all possible careers and should be as i remember  saying no better than a girl  i must have been a great trial to  all my friends  my father tried to reason on resignation and tell  me happiness could be in myself till he broke down  my mother  attempted bracing by reproof  miss newton endeavoured to make me  see that this was my cross  every word was true and came round  again but they only made me for the time more rebellious and  wretched  that attack was ended of all things in the world by  heraldry  my attention somehow was drawn that way and the study  filled up time and thought till my misfortunes passed into custom  and haunted me no more  my last was a more serious access after coming into the country  when improved health and vigour inspired cravings that made me fully  sensible of my blighted existence  i had gone the length of my  tether and overdone myself i missed london life and clarence and  the more i blamed myself and tried to rouse myself the more  despondent and discontented i grew  this time my physician was mr stafford i had deciphered a bit of  old french and latin for him and he was very much pleased  why  edward he said you are a very clever fellow you can be a  distinguishedor what is bettera useful man  somehow that saying restored the spring of hope and gave an  impulse  i have not been a distinguished man but i think in my  degree i have been a fairly useful one and i am sure i have been a  happy one  e w   useful that you have dear old fellow  even if you had done  nothing else and never been an unconscious backbone to clarence  your influence on me and mine has been unspeakably blest  but pray  mistress anne how about that question of naughty little clares   m w  dont you think you had better let alone that question reverend  sir  youngest pets are apt to be saucy especially in these days  but i didnt expect it of you  it might have been the worse for you  if w c w had not held his tongue in those days  just like  himself but i am heartily glad that so he did  a w
