94840424	the battery and the boiler by rm ballantyne    chapter one  in which the hero makes his first flash and explosion  somewhere about the middle of this nineteenth century a baby boy was born on the raging sea in the midst of a howling tempest  that boy was the hero of this tale  he was cradled in squalls and nourished in squalora week of dirty weather having converted the forecabin of the emigrant ship into something like a pigsty  appreciating the situation no doubt the baby boy began his career with a squall that harmonised with the weather and as the steward remarked to the ships cook continued for to squall straight on end all that day and night without so much as ever takin breath  it is but right to add that the steward was prone to exaggeration  stooard said the ships cook in reply as he raised his eyes from the contemplation of his bubbling coppers take my word for it that there babby what has just bin launched aint agoin to shovel off his mortal coilas the playactor saidwithout makin his mark someow an someweres  what makes you think so johnson asked the steward  what makes me think so stooard replied the cook who was a huge goodnatured young man  well ill tell ee  i was standin close to the fore hatch at the time atalkin to jim brag an the father o the babby poor feller he was standin by the foretopsl halyards holdin on to a belayinpin an lookin as white as a sheetfor i got a glance at im two or three times doorin the flashes o lightnin well stooard there was lightnin playin round the mizzen truck an the main truck an the fore truck an at the end o the flyin jibboom an the spanker boom then there came a flash that seemed to set afire the entire univarse then a burst o thunder like fifty great guns gone off all at once in a hurry  at that identical moment stooard there came up from the forecabin a yell that beatwell i cant rightly say what it beat but it minded me o that unfortnit pig as got his tail jammed in the capstan off cape horn  the father gave a gasp  its born says he  more likes if its basted growled jim brag  youre a unfeelin monster brag says i an though you are the ships carpenter i will say it you avent got no more sympathy than the fluke of an anchor  howsever the poor father didnt hear the remark for he went down below all of a heaphead legs and arms anyhow  then there came another yell an another an half a dozen more which was followed by another flash o lightnin an drownded in another roar o thunder but the yells from below kep on an came out strong between times makin no account whatever o the whistlin wind an rattlin ropes which they riz aboveeasynow stooard do you mean for to tell me that all that signifies nothink  do you suppose that that babby could go through life like an ornary babby  no it couldntnot even if it was to trywich it wont  having uttered this prophecy the cook resumed the contemplation of his bubbling coppers  well i suppose youre right john johnson said the steward  yes im right tom thomson returned the cook with the nod and air of a man who is never wrong  and the cook was right as the reader who continues to read shall find out in course of time  the gale in which little robin wright was thus launched upon the sea of time blew the sails of that emigrant shipthe seahorseto ribbons  it also blew the masts out of her leaving her a helpless wreck on the breast of the palpitating sea  then it blew a friendly sail in sight by which passengers and crew were rescued and carried safe back to old england  there they separatedsome to reembark in other emigrant ships some to renew the battle of life at homethenceforward and for ever after to vilify the sea in all its aspects except when viewed at a safe distance from the solid land  little robins parents were among the latter  his father a poor gentleman procured a situation as accountant in a mercantile house his mother busied herselfand she was a very busy little creaturewith the economics of home  she clothed robins body and stored his mind among other things she early taught him to read from the bible  as robin grew he waxed strong and bold and lively becoming a source of much anxiety mingled with delight to his mother and of considerable alarm mixed with admiration and surprise to his father  he possessed an inquisitive mind  he inquired into everythingincluding the antique barometer and the household clock both of which were heirlooms and were not improved by his inquiries  strange to say robins chief delight in those early days was a thunderstorm  the rolling of heavens artillery seemed to afford inexpressible satisfaction to his little heart but it was the lightning that affected him most  it filled him with a species of awful joy  no matter how it camewhether in the forked flashes of the storm or the lambent gleamings of the summer skyhe would sit and gaze at it in solemn wonder  even in his earliest years he began to make inquiries into that remarkable and mysterious agent  musser he said one day during a thunderstorm raising his large eyes to his mothers face with intense gravitymusser what is lightenin  mrs wright who was a soft little unscientific lady with gorgeous eyes sat before her son perplexed  well child it isitreally i dont know what it is  dont know echoed robin with surprise i sought you knowd everysing  no not everything dear replied mrs wright with a deprecatory smile but here comes your father who will tell you  does he know everysing asked the child  nno not exactly but he knows many thingsoh ever so many things answered the cautious wife and mother  the accountant had barely crossed his humble threshold and sat down when robin clambered on his knee and put the puzzling questionfasser what is lightenin  lightning my boywhy itsitslet me seeits fire of course of some sort that comes out o the clouds and goes slap into the earththere dont you see it  robin did see it and was so awestruck by the crash which followed the blinding flash that he forgot at the moment to push his inquiries further much to his fathers satisfaction who internally resolved to hunt up the encyclopaedia britannica that very eveningletter land study it  in process of time robin increased in size  as he expanded in body he developed in mind and in heart for his little mother although profoundly ignorant of electricity and its effects was deeply learned in the scriptures  but robin did not hunger in vain after scientific knowledge  by good fortune he had a cousincousin sam shiptonwho was fourteen years older than himself and a clerk at a neighbouring railway station where there was a telegraphic instrument  now sam being himself possessed of strongly scientific tendencies took a great fancy to little robin and sought to enlighten his young mind on many subjects where mussers knowledge failed  of course he could not explain all that he himself knew about electricitythe child was too young for thatbut he did what he could and introduced him one day to the interior of the station where he filled his youthful mind with amazement and admiration by his rapid and apparently meaningless manipulation of the telegraph instrument  cousin sam however did a good deal more for him than that in the course of time but before proceeding further we must turn aside for a few minutes to comment on that wonderful subject which is essentially connected with the development of this tale    chapter two  refers to a notable character  sparks as a rule are looked upon as a race of useless and disreputable fellows  their course is usually erratic  they fly upward downward forward and backwardhere there and everywhere  you never know when you have them or what will be their next flight  they often create a good deal of alarm sometimes much surprise they seldom do any good and frequently cause irreparable damage  only when caught and restrained or directed do sparks become harmless and helpful  but there is one spark in this worlda grand glowing gushing fellow who has not his equal anywhere  he is old as the hillsperhaps older and wide as the worldperchance wider  similar to ordinary sparks in some respects he differs from them in several important particulars like many he is fast but immeasurably faster than all other sparks put together  unlike them however he submits to be led by master minds  stronger than hercules he can rend the mountains  fleeter than mercury he can outstrip the light  gentler than zephyr he can assume the condition of a current and enter our very marrow without causing pain  his name is electricity  no one knows what he is  some philosophers have said that he is a fluid because he flows  as well might they call him a wild horse because he bolts or a thief because he lurks  we prefer to call him a spark because in that form only is he visibleat least when handled by man  talking of that it was not until the last century that master minds found out how to catch and handle our spark  in all the previous centuries he had been roaming gaily about the world in perfect freedom sometimes gliding silently to and fro like an angel of light sometimes leaping forth with frightful energy in the midst of raging tempest like a destructive demonripping rending shattering all that attempted to arrest his course  men have feared and shunned him since the beginning of time and with good reason for he has killed many of the human race  but although uncaught and untamed by them our spark was not altogether unknown to the ancients  so far back as the year 600 before the christian era thales one of the greek sages discovered that he hid himself in amber a substance which in greek is named electronhence his name electricity but the ancients knew little about his character though thales found that he could draw him from his hidingplace by rubbing him with silk and some other substances  when thus rubbed he became attractive and drew light creatures towards himnot unlike human sparks  he also showed himself to be fickle for after holding these light creatures tight for a brief space he let them go and repelled them  it was not till the days of good queen bess towards the end of the sixteenth century that a dr gilbert discovered that the wild fellow lay lurking in other substances besides ambersuch as sulphur wax glass etcetera  it is now known that electricity permeates all substances more or less and only waits to be roused in order to exhibit his amazing powers  he is fond of shocking peoples feelings and has surprised his pursuers rather frequently in that way  some of them indeed he has actually shocked to death  it would take a huge volume to give a detailed account of all the qualities powers and peculiarities of this wild spark  we will just touch on a few facts which are necessary to the elucidation of our tale  a great event in the worlds history happened in the year 1745  it was nothing less than the capture and imprisonment of wild daring dashing electricity  to the dutch philosophers belongs the honour of catching him  they caught himthey even bottled him like ordinary spirits and called his prison a leyden jar  from that date our spark became the useful and obedient slave of man yet is he ever ready when the smallest conceivable door hole or chink is left open to dash out of the prisonhouse man has made for him and escape into his native earth  he has no hope now however of escaping altogether for he cannot resist the allurement of rubbing by which as well as by chemical action and other means we can summon him like the genii of aladdins lamp at any moment from the vasty deep and compel him to do our work  and what sort of work it may be asked can this volatile fellow perform  we cannot tell allthe list is too long  let us consider a few of them  if we fabricate teapots sugarbasins spoons or anything else of base metal he can and will at our bidding cover the same with silver or yellow gold  if we grow dissatisfied with our candles and gas he will on being summoned and properly directed by the master minds to whom he owns allegiance kindle our lamps and fill our streets and mansions with a blaze of noonday splendour  if we grow weary of steam and give him orders he will drive our tramcars and locomotives with railway speed minus railway smoke and fuss  he is a very giant in the chemists laboratory and above all a swift messenger to carry the worlds news  even when out and raging to and fro in a wild state more than halfdisposed to rend our mansions and split our steeples and wreck our ships we have only to provide him with a tiny metal staircase down which he will instantly glide from the upper regions to the earth without noise or damage  shakespeare never imagined and mercury never accomplished the speed at which he travels and he will not only carry our news or express our sentiments and wishes far and wide over the land but he will rush with them over rock sand mud and ooze along the bottom of the deep deep sea  and this brings us to a point  some of the master minds before mentioned having conceived the idea that telegraphic communication might be carried on under water set about experimenting  between the years 1839 and 1851 enterprising men in the old world and the new suggested pondered planned and placed wires under water along which our spark ran more or less successfully  one of the difficulties of these experiments consisted in this that while the spark runs readily along one class of substances he cannot or will not run along others  substances of the first class comprising the metals are called conductors those of the second class embracing among other things all resinous substances are styled nonconductors  now water is a good conductor  so that although the spark will stick to his wires when insulated on telegraphposts on land he will bolt from them at once and take to flight the moment he gets under water  this difficulty was overcome by coating the wires with guttapercha which being a nonconductor imprisoned the spark and kept him as it were on the line  a copper wire covered in this manner was successfully laid between england and france in 1850  when tested this cable did not work well minute imperfections in the form of airholes in the guttapercha afforded our spark an opportunity to bolt and he did bolt as a matter of coursefor electricity has no sense of honour and cannot be trusted near the smallest loophole  the imperfections were remedied the door was effectually locked after which the first submarine cable of importance was actually laid down and worked well  french and english believers turned up hands and eyes in delighted amazement as they held converse across the sea while unbelievers were silenced and confounded  this happy state of things however lasted for only a few hours suddenly the intercourse ceased  the telegraphists at both ends energised with their handles and needles but without any result  the cable was dumb  our spark had evidently escaped  there is no effect without a cause  the cause of that interruption was soon discovered  early that morning a french fisherman had sauntered down to the port of boulogne and embarked in his boat  a british seaman having nothing to do but smoke and meditate was seated on a coil of rope at the time enjoying himself and the smells with which that port is not unfamiliar he chanced to be a friend of that french fisherman  youre early afloat mounseer he said  oui monsieur  vill you com  i go for feesh  well wee i go for fun  they went accordingly and bore away to the northward along the coast before a light breezepast the ruined towers which france had built to guard her port in days gone by past the steep cliffs beyond boulogne past the lovely beach of wimereux with its cottages nestled among the sandhills and its siltedup harbour whence napoleon the first had intended to issue forth and descend on perfidious albionbut didnt past cliffs and bays and villages further on until they brought up off cape grisnez  here the frenchman let down his trawl and fished up among other curiosities of the deep the submarine cable  behold fat is dis he exclaimed with glaring eyes uplifted brows shoulders shrugged hands spread out and fingers expanded  the seasarpint growd thin suggested the englishman  non cest seaveedveed de most strordinair in de vorld  oui donnezmoi de hache de hax mon ami  his friend handed him the axe wherewith lie cut off a small portion of the cable and let the end go  little did that fisherman know that he had also let our spark go free and cruelly dashed for a time at least the budding hopes of two nationsbut so it was  he bore his prize in triumph to boulogne where he exhibited it as a specimen of rare seaweed with its centre filled with gold while the telegraph clerks at both ends sat gazing in dismay at their useless instruments  thus was the first submarine electric cable destroyed  and with the details of its destruction little robin was intimately acquainted for cousin sam had been a member of the staff that had worked that telegraphat least he had been a boy in the officeand in after years he so filled his cousins mind with the importance of that cable and the grandeur and difficulty of the enterprise that robin became powerfully sympatheticso much so that when sam in telling the story came to the point where the frenchman accomplished its destruction robin used to grieve over it as though he had lost a brother or a kitten or his latest toy  we need scarcely add that submarine cable telegraphy had not received its deathblow on that occasion  its possibility had been demonstrated the very next year 1851 mr tr crampton with messrs wollaston kuper and others made and laid an improved cable between dover and calais and ere long many other parts of the world were connected by means of snaky submarine electric cables    chapter three  early aspirations  one pleasant summer afternoon mr wright coming in from the office seated himself beside his composed little wife who was patching a pair of miniature pantaloons  nan said the husband with a perplexed look what are we to do with our robin when he grows up  george answered the composed wife dont you think it is rather soon to trouble ourselves with that question  robin is a mere child yet  we must first give him a good education  of course i know that returned the perplexed husband still i cant help thinking about what is to be done after he has had the good education  you know i have no relation in the world except brother richard who is as poor as myself  we have no influential friends to help him into the army or the navy or the indian civil service and the church you know is not suitable for an imp  just look at him now  mrs wright looked through the window over one of those sunny landscapes which are usually described as smiling across a winding rivulet and at last fixed her gorgeous eyes on a tall post up which a small black object was seen to be struggling  what can he be up to said the father  he seems to be up the telegraphpost said the mother investigating the wires no doubt  i heard him talking about telegraphy to madge this morningretailing what cousin sam tries to teach himand i shouldnt wonder if he were now endeavouring to make sure that what he told her was correct for you know he is a thorough investigator  yes i know it murmured the father with a grim pursing of his lips he investigated the inside of my watch last week to find out as he said what made the noise in its stummick and it has had intermittent fever ever since  two days ago he investigated my razorit is now equal to a crosscut saw and as to my drawers and papers excepting those which i lock up there is but one word which fully describes the result of his investigations and that ischaos  there was in truth some ground for that fathers emotions for master robin displayed investigative not to say destructive capacities far in advance of his years  never mind george said mrs wright soothingly we must put up with his little ways as best we may consoling ourselves with the reflection that robin has genius and perseverance with which qualities he is sure to make his way in the world  he has at all events made his way up the telegraphpost said mr wright his smile expanding and the grimness of it departing see the rascal is actually stretching out his hand to grasp one of the wires ha hallo  the composed wife became suddenly discomposed and gave vent to a scream for at that moment the small black object which they had been watching with so much interest was seen to fall backward make a wild grasp at nothing with both hands and fall promptly to the ground  his father threw up the window leaped out dashed across the fourfeetwide lawn cleared the winding rivulet and cut like a hunted hare over the smiling landscape towards the telegraphpost at the foot of which he picked up his unconscious though not much injured son  what made you climb the post robin asked his cousin madge that evening as she nursed the adventurous boy on her kneeand madge was a very motherly nurse although a full year younger than robin  i kimed it to see if i could hear the trissity replied the injured one  the lektrissity said madge correcting  you must learn to ponounce your words popperly dear  youll never be a great man if you are so careless  i dont want to be a geat man retorted robin  i ony want tunderstand things whats puzzlesum  well does the telegraph puzzle you  oh mos awfully returned robin with a solemn gaze of his earnest eyes one of which was rendered fantastic by a yellowgreen ring round it and a swelling underneath  is kite sure is stood for hours beside dat post listin to it hummin an hummin like our olianarp  now robin do be careful  you know mamma calls it an olian harp  yes well like our olian harp only a deal louder an far nicer an is often said to myself is that the trissity  lek robin lek  well yes lektrissity  so i thought id kime up an see for you know papa says the trissitylek i meanruns along the wires  but papa also says interrupted madge that the sounds you want to know about are made by the vithe vi  bratin suggested the invalid  yes vibratin of the wires  i wonder what vibratin means murmured robin turning his lustrous though damaged eyes meditatively on the landscape  donno for sure said madge but i think it means tremblin  it will be seen from the above conversation that robert wright and his precocious cousin marjory were of a decidedly philosophical turn of mind    chapter four  extraordinary result of an attempt at amateur cablelaying  time continued to roll additional years off his reel and rolled out robin and madge in length and breadth though we cannot say much for thickness  time also developed their minds and robin gradually began to understand a little more of the nature of that subtle fluidif we may venture so to call itunder the influence of which he had been born  come madge he said one day throwing on his cap let us go and play at cables  madge ever ready to play at anything put on her sunbonnet and followed her ambitious leader  is it to be landtelegraphs today or submarine cables inquired madge with as much gravity and earnestness as if the worlds welfare depended on the decision  cables of course answered robin why madge i have done with landtelegraphs now  theres nothing more to learn about them  cousin sam has put me up to everything you know  besides theres no mystery about landlines  why youve only got to stick up a lot o posts with insulators screwed to em fix wires to the insulators clap on an electric battery and a telegraph instrument and fire away  robin what are insulators asked madge with a puzzled look  madge replied robin with a selfsatisfied expression on his pert face this is the threehundredthousandth time i have explained that to you  explain it the threehundredthousandandfirst time then dear robin and perhaps ill take it in  well began robin with a hypocritical sigh of despair you must know that everything in nature is more or less a conductor of electricity but some things conduct it so wellsuch as copper and ironthat they are called conductors and some thingssuch as glass and earthenwareconduct it so very badly that they scarcely conduct it at all and are called nonconductors  dee see  oh yes i see robin so does a bat but he doesnt see well  however go on  well if i were to run my wire through the posts that support it my electricity would escape down these posts into the earth especially if the posts were wet with rain for water is a good conductor and mister electricity has an irresistible desire to bolt into the earth like a mole  naughty fellow murmured madge  but continued robin impressively if i fix little lumps of glass with a hole in them to the posts and fix my wires to these electricity cannot bolt because the glass lumps are nonconductors and wont let him pass  how good of them said madge  yes isnt it  so you see continued robin the glass lumps are insulators for they cut the electricity off from the earth as an island is or at all events appears to be cut off from it by water and mister electricity must go along the wires and do what i tell him  of course you know i must make my electricity first in a battery which as i have often and often told you is a trough containing a mixture of acid and water with plates or slices of zinc and copper in it placed one after the other but not touching each other  now if i fix a piece of wire to my first copper slice or plate and the other end of it to my last zinc slice or plate immediately electricity will begin to be made and will fly from the copper to the zinc and so round and round until the plates are worn out or the wire broken  dee see  no robin i dont see im blinder than the blindest mole  oh madge what a wonderful mind you must have said robin laughing it is so simple  of course said madge i understand what you mean by troughs and plates and all that but what i want to know is why that arrangement is necessary  why would it not do just as well to tempt electricity out of its hidinghole with plates or slices of cheese and bread placed one after the other in a trough filled with a mixture of glue and melted butter  what stuff you do talk madge  as well might you ask why it would not do to make a plumpudding out of nutmegs and coaltar  there are some things that no fellow can understand and of course i dont know everything  the astounding modesty of this latter remark seemed to have furnished madge with food for reflection for she did not reply to it  after a few minutes walk the amateur electricians reached the scene of their intended gamea sequestered dell in a plantation through which brawled a rather turbulent stream  at one part where a willow overhung the water there was a deep broad pool  the stream entered the pool with a headlong plunge and issued from it with a riotous upheaval of wavelets and foam among jagged rocks as if rejoicing in and rather boastful about the previous leap  the game was extremely simple  the pool was to be the german ocean and a piece of stout cord was to serve as a submarine cable  the boy and girl were wellmatched playmates for madge was ignorant and receptivein reference to sciencerobin learned and communicative while both were intensely earnest  now this is the battery said robin when he had dug a deep hole close to the pool with a spade brought for the purpose  yes and the muddy water in it will do for the mixture of acid and water said madge  as she spoke robins toe caught on a root and he went headlong into the battery out of which he emerged scarcely recognisable  it was a severe though not an electric shock and at first robin seemed inclined to whimper but his manhood triumphed and he burst into a compound laugh and yell to the intense relief of madge who thought at first that he had been seriously injured  never mind madge said robin as he cleansed his muddy head cousin sam has often told me that nothing great was ever done except in the face of difficulties and dangers  i wonder whether this should be counted a difficulty or a danger  at first i thought it a danger said madge with a laugh but the trouble you now have with the mud in your hair looks like a difficulty doesnt it  why then its both cried robin  come thats a good beginning now madge you get away round to the opposite side of the pool and mind you dont slip in its rather steep there  this is england cried robin preparing to throw the line over to his assistant who stood eager to aid on the other side and you are standing ononwhats on the other side of the german ocean  im not sure robin  holland i think or denmark  well well say denmark  lookout now and be ready to catch  im going to connect england and denmark with a submarine cable  stay cried madge is that the way submarine cables are laid by throwing them over the sea  nno not exactly  they had a steamboat you know to carry over the telegraph from england to france but we havent got a steamernot even a plank to makebelieve one  cousin sam says that a good workman can do his work with almost any tools that come to hand  as we have no tools at all we will improve on that and go to work without them  now catch  robin made a splendid heaveso splendid indeed that it caused him to stagger backward and again he stumbled into his own battery  this time however only one leg was immersed  another danger shouted madge in great glee but ive caught the cable  all right  now make fast the shoreend to a bush and well commence telegraphing  the first must be a message from the queen to the king of denmarkor is it the president  king i think robin but im not sure  well it wont matter  buti say  whats wrong now  why the cable wont sink  it is floating about on the top of the pool and it cant be a submarine cable you know unless it sinks  another difficulty robin  we will face and overcome it madge  cast off the shoreend and ill soon settle that  having fastened a number of small stones to the cable this persevering electrician would certainly have overcome the difficulty if the line had not when thrown unfortunately caught on a branch of the willow where it hung suspended just out of madges reach  how provoking she said stretching out her hand to the utmost  take careyoullha  the warning came too late  the edge of the bank gave way and madge went headlong into the pool with a wild shriek and a fearful plunge  robin stood rooted to the spotheart breath blood brain paralysed for the momentgazing at the spot where his playmate had disappeared  another moment and her head and hands appeared  she struggled bravely for life while the circling current carried her quickly to the lower end of the pool  robins energies returned as he afterwards said like an electric shock but accompanied with a terrible sinking of the heart for he knew that he could not swim  his education in this important particular had been neglected  he sprang round to the lower end of the pool just in time to hold out his hand to the drowning girl  he almost touched her outstretched hand as she swept towards the turbulent waters below but failed to grasp it  for the first time in his life our little hero was called on to face death voluntarily  another moment and madge would have been caught in the boiling stream that rushed towards the fall below  he was equal to the occasion  he sprang right upon madge and caught her in his arms there was no need to hold on to her  in the agony of fear the poor child clasped the boy in a deadly embrace  they were whirled violently round and hurled against a rock  robin caught it with one hand but it was instantly torn from his grasp  the waters overwhelmed them and again sent them violently towards the bank  this time robin caught a rock with both hands and held on  slowly while almost choked with the water that splashed up into his face he worked his right knee into a crevice then made a wild grasp with the left hand at a higher projection of the rock  at the same moment his left foot struck the bottom  another effort and he was out of danger but it was several minutes ere he succeeded in dragging madge from the hissing water of the shallows to the green sward above and after this was accomplished he found it almost impossible to tear himself from the grasp of the now unconscious girl  at first poor robin thought that his companion was dead but by degrees consciousness returned and at last she was able to rise and walk  drenched dishevelled and depressed these unfortunate electricians returned home  of course they were received with mingled joy and reproof  of course also they were forbidden to go near the pool againthough this prohibition was afterwards removed and our hero ultimately became a firstrate swimmer and diver  thus was frustrated the laying of the first submarine cable between england and denmark    chapter five  prospects of real cablelayingrobin meets with his first electrical acquaintances  circumstances require that we should shift the scene and the date pretty frequently in this tale  we solicit the readers attendance at an office in london  the office is dingy  many offices are so  two clerks are sitting in it making faces at each other across their desk  they are not lunatics they are not imbeciles or idlers  on the contrary they have frequent spells of work that might throw the toils of an arab ass into the shade they are fine strapping young fellows with pentup energies equal to anything but afflicted with occasional periods of having nothing particular to do  these two have been sitting all morning in busy idleness  their muscular and nervous systems rebelling have induced much fidgeting and many wry faces  being original they have turned their sorrows into a game and their little game at present is to see which can make a face so hideous that the other shall be compelled to laugh  we have deep sympathy with clerks  we have been a clerk and know what it is to have the fires of vesuvius raging within while under the necessity of exhibiting the cool aspect of spitzbergen without  but these clerks were not utterly miserable  on the contrary they were to use one of their own familiar phrases rather jolly than otherwise  evening was before them in faroff but attainable perspective  home lawntennis in connection with bright eyes and pretty faces would compensate for the labours of the day and let off the steam  they were deep in their game when a rap at the door brought their faces suddenly to a state of nature  come in said the first clerk  and wipe your feet murmured the second in a low tone  a gentleman with an earnest countenance entered  is mr lowstoft in his office  he is sir said the first clerk descending from his perch with an air of goodwill and requesting the visitors name and business  the visitor handed his card on which the name cyrus field was written and the clerk observing it admitted the owner at once to the inner sanctum where mr lowstoft transacted business  theres something up murmured the clerk with a mysterious look at his comrade on resuming his perch  times up or nearly so replied the comrade with an anxious look at the clock    the witching hour which sets us free   to saunter home and have our tea  approaches  dyou know that that is cyrus field said the first clerk  and who is cyrus field demanded the second clerk  o ignoramus  thy name is bob and thou art not worth a bob miserable snob  dont you know that cyrus field is the man who brought about the laying of the great atlantic cable in 1858  no most learned fred i did not know that but i am very glad to know it now  moreover i know nothing whatever about cablesatlantic or otherwise  i am as blind as a bat as ignorant as a bigot as empty as a soapbubble and as wise as solomon because im willing to be taught  what a delicious subject to work upon said fred  well then work away returned bob suppose you give me a discourse on cables  but i saybe merciful  dont overdo it frederick remember that my capacity is feeble  ill be careful bobwell then you must know that from the year 1840 submarine cables had been tried and laid and worked with more or less success in various parts of the world  sir w oshaughnessy i believe began it  irishmen are frequently at the root of mischief anyhow he being superintendent of electric telegraphs in india in 1839 hauled an insulated wire across the hooghly at calcutta and produced what they call electrical phenomena at the other side of the river  in 1840 mr wheatstone brought before the house of commons the project of a cable from dover to calais  in 1842 professor morse of america laid a cable in new york harbour and another across the canal at washington  he also suggested the possibility of laying a cable across the atlantic ocean  in 1846 colonel colt of revolver notoriety and mr robinson laid a wire from new york to brooklyn and from long island to correy island  in 1849  i say fred interrupted bob with an anxious look you are a walking dictionary of dates  haydn was nothing to you  butcouldnt you give it me without dates  ive got no head for dates never could stomach themexcept when fresh off the palmtree  dont you think that a lecture without dates would be pleasantly original as well as instructive  no bob i dont and i wont be guilty of any such gross innovation on timehonoured custom  you must swallow my dates whether you like them or not  in 1849 i say a mr walker  any relation to hookey  no sir none whateverhe laid a wire from folkestone to a steamer two miles off the shore and sent messages to it  at last in 1851  mr brett laid down and successfully wrought the cable between dover and calais which had been suggested by wheatstone eleven years before  it is true it did not work long but this may be said to have been the beginning of submarine telegraphy which you see like your own education bob has been a thing of slow growth  have you done with dates now my learned friend asked bob attempting to balance a ruler on the point of his nose  not quite my ignorant chum but nearly  that same year1851 remembera mr frederick n gisborne an english electrician made the first attempt to connect newfoundland with the american continent by cable  he also started a company to facilitate intercourse between america and ireland by means of steamers and telegraphcables  gisborne was very energetic and successful but got into pecuniary difficulties and went to new york to raise the wind  there he met with cyrus field who took the matter up with tremendous enthusiasm  he expanded gisbornes idea and resolved to get up a company to connect newfoundland with ireland by electric cable  field was rich and influential and ultimately successful  ah would that you and i were rich fred interrupted bob as he let fall the ruler with a crash on the redink bottle and overturned it but go on fred im getting interested pardon the interruption and never mind the ink ill swab it uphe was successful was he  yes he was eminently so  he first of all roused his friends in the states and got up in 1856 the new york newfoundland and london telegraph company which carried a line of telegraph through the british provinces and across the gulf of saint lawrence to saint johns newfoundlandmore than 1000 milesat a cost of about 500000 pounds  then he came over to england and roused the british lion with whose aid he started the atlantic telegraph company and fairly began the work backed by such men as brett bidden stephenson brunel glass eliot morse bright whitehouse and a host of others  but all this was not done in a day  cyrus field laboured for years among preliminaries and it was not until 1857 that a regular attempt was made to lay an atlantic cable  it failed because the cable broke and was lost  a second attempt was made in 1858 and was successful  in that year my boy ireland and newfoundland were married and on the 5th of august the first electric message passed between the old world and the new through a small wire over a distance of above 2000 miles  but the triumph of field and his friends was shortlived for soon after something went wrong with the cable and on the 6th september it ceased to work  what a pity exclaimed bob so it all went off in smoke  not quite that bob  before the cable struck work about 400 messages had been sent which proved its value in a financial point of view and one of these messagessent from london in the morning and reaching halifax the same daydirected that the 62nd regiment was not to return to england and it is said that this timely warning saved the country an expenditure of 50000 pounds  but the failure instead of damping has evidently stimulated the energies of mr field who has been going about between america and england ever since stirring people up far and near to raise the funds necessary for another attempt  he gives himself no rest has embarked his own fortune in the affair and now at this moment in this year of grace 1865 is doing his best i have no doubt to induce our governor mr lowstoft to embark in the same boat with himself  it would seem as if fred had been suddenly endowed with the gift of secondsight for at that moment the door of his employers room opened and mr lowstoft came out saying to his visitor in the most friendly tones that he had the deepest sympathy with his selfsacrificing efforts and with the noble work to which he had devoted himself  bob in a burst of sudden enthusiasm leaped off his stool opened the officedoor and muttered something as the distinguished visitor passed him  i beg pardon said mr field checking himself what did you say  ii wish you good luck sir withwith the new cable stammered the clerk blushing deeply  thank you ladthank you said mr field with a pleasant smile and nod as he went away  mr sime said mr lowstoft to bob turning at the door of his room send young wright to me  yes sir replied the obedient bob going to a corner of the room and applying his lips to a speakingtube  now young wright was none other than our hero robin grown up to the mature age of fifteen  he was perched on the top of a threelegged stool and from the slow and intensely earnest manner in which his head turned from side to side as he wrote it was quite evident that he dotted all his is and stroked all his ts with conscientious care  as he sat therea sturdy little broadshouldered fellow so deeply engrossed with his work that he was oblivious of all aroundhe seemed the very beauideal of a painstaking hardworking clerk  so deeply was he engrossed in his subjectthe copying of an invoicethat he failed to hear the voice of his fellowclerk although the end of the speakingtube was not far from where he sat  after listening a few seconds at the other end of the tube bob sime repeated the summons with such vigour that robin leaped from his stool as though he had received one of his favourite electric shocks  a minute later he stood in the presence of the head of the house  robert wright said the head pushing his spectacles up on his brow i shall be sorry to lose your services but  he paused and turned over the papers before him as if searching for something and robins heart sank  was he going to be dismissed  had he done anything wrong or had he unwittingly neglected some duty  ah here it is resumed mr lowstoft a letter from a friend who has come by a slight injury to his right hand and wants a smart amanuensis and general assistant  now i think of sending you to him if you have no objection  as the head again paused while glancing over the letter robin ventured timidly to state that he had very strong objections that he was very much satisfied with his situation and work and had no desire to change  mr lowstoft did not appear to listen to his remarks but said suddenlyyouve studied the science of electricity i believe  yes sirto some extent answered the lad with a look of surprise  i know you have  your father has told me about your tastes and studies  youve heard of mr cyrus field i presume  indeed i have said robin brightening up it was through his efforts that the atlantic cable was laid in 1858which unfortunately went wrong  well my boy it is through his efforts that another cable is to be laid in this year 1865 which we all hope sincerely wont go wrong and my friend who wants an assistant is one of the electricians connected with the new expedition  would you like to go  robins eyes blazed and he could scarcely find breath or words to express his willingnessif his father did not object  go home at once then and ask leave for the great eastern is almost ready for sea and you have to hasten your preparations  robin stroked no more ts and dotted no more is that day  we fear indeed that he even left the invoice on his desk unfinished with the last i imperfect  bursting into his fathers house he found madgenow become a pretty little slip of feminine threadpaperseated at the piano agonising over a chord which her hand was too small to compass  madge madge cousin madge he shouted seizing both the extended little hands and kissing the musical wrinkles from her brow why am i like a magnet  youll never guess  because you attract everybody to you said madge promptly  pooh not at all  a magnet doesnt attract every body  it has two poles dont you know and repels some bodies  no madge its because i have been electrified  indeed and what has electrified you robin  the atlantic cable madge  well that ought to be able to do it powerfully returned madge with a laugh but tell me all about it and dont make more bad conundrums im sure something has happened  what is it  mrs wright entering at the moment her son calmed himself as well as he could and sat down to tell his tale and talk the matter over  now what think you mother  will father consent  i think he will robin but before going into the matter further i will lay it before our father in heaven  he must show us the way if we are to go right  according to invariable custom robins mother retired to her own room to consider the proposal  thereafter she had a long talk with her husband and the result was that on the following day our hero found himself in a train with a small new portmanteau by his side a new billycock hat on his head a very small new purse in his pocket with a remarkably small sum of money therein and a light yet full heart in his breast  he was on his way to the nore where the great eastern lay like an antediluvian macaronieater gorging itself with innumerable miles of atlantic cable  to say truth robins breastcapacious though it was for his size could hardly contain his heart that day  the dream of his childhood was about to be realised  he had thirsted for knowledge  he had acquired all that was possible in his fathers limited circumstances  he had moreover with the valuable assistance of sam shipton become deeply learned in electrical science  he had longed with all his heart to become an electricianquite ready if need were to commence as sweeper of a telegraphoffice but he had come to regard his desires as too ambitious and accepting his lot in life with the quiet contentment taught him by his mother had entered on a clerkship in a mercantile house and had perched himself with a little sigh no doubt yet cheerfully on the top of a threelegged stool  to this stool he had been so long attachedphysicallythat he had begun to regard it almost as part and parcel of himself and had made up his mind that he would have to stick to it through life  he even sometimes took a quaint view of the matter and tried to imagine that through long habit it would stick to him at last and oblige him to carry it about sticking straight out behind him perhaps even require him to take it to bed with him in which case he sometimes tried to imagine what would be the precise effect on the bedclothes if he were to turn from one side to the other thus had his life been projected in grey perspective to his mental eye  but nowhe actually was an electricianelect on his way to join the biggest ship in the world to aid in laying the greatest telegraph cable in the world in company with some of the greatest men in the universe it was almost too much for him  he thirsted for sympathy  he wanted to let off his feelings in a cheer but life in a lunatic asylum presented itself and he refrained  there was a roughlooking sailor lad about his own age but much bigger on the seat opposite it was a third class  he thought of pouring out his feelings on himbut prudence prevented  there is no saying what might have been the result figuratively speaking to his boiler if the sailor lad had not of his own accord opened a safetyvalve  you seems pretty bobbish this morning young feller he said after contemplating his visavis for a long time in critical silence bin an took too much eh  i beg your pardon said robin somewhat puzzled  youre pritty considerable jolly i say returned the lad who had an honest ugly face and was somewhat blunt and gruff in manner  i am indeed very jolly said robin with a bland smile for im going to help to lay the great atlantic cable  wots that you say demanded the lad with sudden animation  robin repeated his remark  well now that is a go  why im goin to help lay the great atlantic cable too  im one the stooards boys  what may you be young feller  me  oh  imiwhy im on the electrical staffim he thought of the word secretary but a feeling of modesty induced him to sayassistant to one of the electricians  which un demanded the lad curtly  mr smith  mr smith eh  wellit aint an unusual namesmith aint  praps youll condescend on his first name for theres no less than three smiths among the electricians  ebenezer smith i believe said robin  ebbysneezer smitheh well upon my word thats a smithmixtur that ive never heerd on before  i dont know im but hes all right i dessay  theyre a rum lot altogether  whether this compliment was meant for the great smith family in general or the electrical branch in particular robin could not guess and did not like to ask  having thus far opened his heart however he began to pour out its contents and found that the ugly sailor lad was a much more sympathetic soul than he had been led to expect from his looks having told his own name he asked that of his companion in return  my nameoh its slaggjim slagg james when you wants to be respeckfulslagg when familiar  im the son o jim slagg senior  who he was the son of is best known to them as understands the science of jinnylology  but it dont much matter for we all runs back to adam an eve somehow  they called me after father of course but to make a distinction they calls him jimmybein more respeckfullikeand me jim  it aint a name much to boast of but i wouldnt change it with you young feller though robert aint a bad name neither  its pretty wellknown you see an thats somethin  then its bin bore by great men  let me thinkwasnt there a robert the great once  i fear not said robin he is yet in the womb of time  ah well no matter but there should have bin a robert the great before now  anyhow there was robert the brucehe was a king warnt he an a skullcracker  then there was robert stephenson the great engineerhes livin yet an there was robert thethe devil but i raither fear he must have bin a bad un he must so we wont count him  of course they gave you another name for short ah robin  i thought so  well that aint a bad name neither  there was robin hood you know what drawd the longbow a deal better than the worst pennyaliner as ever mended a quill  an there was a robin goodfellow though i dont rightly remember who he was exactly  one of shakespeares characters interposed robin  jus sowell he couldnt have bin a bad fellow you know  then as to your other name wrightthats all right you know and might have bin writer if youd taken to the quill or the law  anyhow as long as youre wright of course you cant be wrongeh young feller  jim slagg was so tickled with this sudden sally that he laughed and in so doing shut his little eyes and opened an enormous mouth fully furnished with an unbroken set of splendid teeth  thus pleasantly did robin while away the time with his future shipmate until he arrived at the end of his journey when he parted from jim slagg and was met by ebenezer smith  that energetic electrician instead of at once taking him on board the great eastern took him to a small inn where he gave him his tea and put him through a rather severe electrical examination out of which our anxious hero emerged with credit  youll do robin said his examiner who was a freeandeasy yet kindly electrician but you want instruction in many things  indeed i do sir said robin for i have had no regular education in the science but i hope if you direct me what to study that i shall improve  no doubt you will my boy  meanwhile as the big ship wont be ready to start for some time i want you to go to the works of the telegraph construction and maintenance company see the making of the cable learn all you can and write me a careful account of all that you see and all that you think about it  robin could not repress a smile  why boy what are you laughing at demanded mr smith somewhat sternly  robin blushed deep scarlet as he replied  pardon me sir but you said i am to write down all that i think about it  well what then  iim afraid sir stammered robin that if i write down all i think about the atlantic cable as well as all that i see i shall require a very long time indeed and a pretty large volume  mr smith gazed at our hero for some time with uplifted brows then he shook his head slowly and frowned then he nodded it slightly and smiled  after that he laughed or rather chuckled and said  well you may go now and do what i have told youonly omitting most of what you think  a small portion of that will suffice  dont hurry back  go home and make a fair copy of your observations and thoughts ill write when i require you  stayyour address  ah  i have it in my notebook  whats your first name mister wright  robin grew two inches taller or more on the spot he had never been called mister before except in jest  robert sir he replied  robertha hm  ill call you bob  i never could stand ceremony so youll accustom yourself to the new name as quickly as you canbut perhaps its not new to you  please sir ive been used to robin if you have no objection i should  no objectionof course not interrupted mr smith robin will do quite as well though a little longer but thats no matter  goodbye robin andanddont think too hard  it sometimes hurts digestion goodbye  well what dee think of ebbysneezer smith my electrical toolip asked jim slagg whom robin encountered again at the station  hes a wiry subject i spose like the rest of em  hes a very pleasant gentleman answered robin warmly  oh of coorse he is  all the smiths are somore or less  theyre a glorious family  i knows at least half a dozen of em in what superfine people call the slums of london  and i know more than half a dozen of em retorted robin somewhat sharply in what unrefined people call the haristocracy of london  whew whistled mister slagg gazing at robin in silent surprise  what the whistle implied was not explained at that time because the locomotive whistle took up the tune with intense violence causing a rush to the train in which the two ladslike many other friendswere abruptly parted for a season    chapter six  tells of our heros visit to the great cable  robin wright returned home with a bounding heart  since his electrical appointment he had become figuratively speaking an indiarubber balla sort of human squash  his heart bounded his feet bounded if his head had fallen off it also would have bounded no doubt  on arriving he found his fathers elder brothera retired seacaptain of the merchant serviceon a visit to the family  there was not a more favourite uncle in the kingdom than uncle rikthus had his name of richard been abbreviated by the wright family  uncle rik was an old bachelor and as bald as a babymore so than many babies he was goodhumoured and liberalhearted but a settled unbeliever in the worlds progress  he idolised the good old times and quite pleasantly scorned the present  so so robin he said grasping our hero by both hands and uncle riks grasp was no joke youre goin in for batteriesgalvanic batteries an wires are you  well lad i always thought you more or less of a fool but i never thought you such a born idiot as that comes to  yes uncle said robin with a pleasant laugh for he was used to the old captains plain language im going to be an electrician  bah poohan electrician exclaimed uncle rik with vehemence as well set up for a magician at once  indeed he wont be far short of that said mrs wright who was seated at the teatable with her husband and madgeat least she added if all be true that we hear of this wonderful science  if only half of it be true interjected mr wright  but it aint true said captain rik firmly  they talk a deal of stuff about it more than ninetenths of which is liespure fable  i dont believe in electricity more than that i dont believe in steam batteries and boilers are both bosh  but uncle you cant deny that they exist said robin  of course not replied the captain  i know as well as you domaybe betterthat theres a heap o telegraphwires rove about the world like great spiders webs and that there are steamboats hummin an buzzin ay an bustin tooall over the ocean like huge wasps an a pretty mess they make of it too among them  why there was a poor old lady the other day that was indooced by a young nephy to send a telegraphic message to her husband in manchestershe bein in london  she was very unwillin to do it bein half inclined to regard the telegraph as a plant from the lower regions  the message sent was your lovin wife hopes youll be home tomorrow  it reached the husband your lowerin wife hopes youll be hung tomorrow  bad writin and a useless flourish at the e turned home into hung  the puzzled husband telegraphs in reply mistake somewhereall rightshall be back three oclocktomorrowkind love  and how dye think this reached the old ladymistake somewhereall nightstabbed in backthrough cloak two more rowskilled love  now dyou call that successful telegraphing  not very admitted robin with a laugh but of the thousands of messages that pass to and fro daily there cannot be many like these i should think  but what did the poor wife do asked madge anxiously  do repeated rik indignantly as though the misfortune were his own for he was a very sympathetic captaindo  why she gave a yell that nigh knocked the young nephy out of his reason and fell flat on the floor  when she came to she bounced up bore away for the railway station under full sail an shipped for manchester where she found her husband alive and hearty pitchin into a huge beefsteak which he very properly said after recovering from his first surprise was big enough for two  but what objection have you to steamers uncle rik asked mrs wright im sure they are very comfortable and fastgoing  comfortable and fastgoin repeated the old sailor with a look of supreme contempt yes theyre comfortable enough when your berth aint near the paddles or the boilers an theyre fastgoin no doubt specially when they bust  but aint the nasty things made of iron like kitchen kettles and wont that rust an if you knock a hole in em wont they go down at once an if you clap too much on the safetyvalves wont they go up at once  bah poohtheres nothin like the wooden walls of old england  you may take the word of an old salt for itthem wooden walls will float and plough the ocean when all these newfangled iron pots are sunk or blowed to atoms  why look at the great eastern herself the biggest kettle of em all what a precious mess she made of herself  at first she wouldnt move at all when they tried to launch her then they had to shove her off sidewise like a crab then she lost her rudder in a gale an smashed all her cabin furniture like a bad boy with his toys  bah  i only hope i may be there when she busts for itll be a grand explosion  im sorry you have so bad an opinion of her uncle for i am appointed to serve in the great eastern while layin the atlantic cable  sorry to hear it lad very sorry to hear it  of course i hope for your sake that she wont blow up on this voyage though its nothin more or less than an absurd ship goin on a wildgoose chase  but uncle submarine cables have now passed the period of experiment said robin coming warmly to the defence of his favourite subject just consider from the time the first one was laid in 1851 between dover and calais till now about fifteen years many thousands of miles of conductingwire have been laid along the bottom of the sea to many parts of the world and they are in full and successful operation at this moment  why even in 1858 when the first atlantic cable was laid the guttapercha company had made fortyfour submarine cables  i know it lad but it wont last  its all sure to bust up in course of time  then though the attempt to lay the last atlantic cable proved a failure continued robin the first one the 1858 one was a success at the beginning no one can deny that  ay but how long did it last demanded the skipper hitting the table with his fist  oh please have pity on the teacups uncle rik cried the hostess  beg pardon sister but i cant help getting riled when i hear younkers talkin stuff  why do you really suppose said the captain turning again to robin that because they managed in 58 to lay a cable across the atlantic and exchange a few messages which refused to travel after a few days that theyll succeed in layin down a permanent speakin trumpet between old england and noofnland2000 miles more or lessin spite o gales an currents an ships anchors an insects an icebergs an whales to say nothing o great seasarpints an such like  uncle rik i do said robin with intensely earnest eyes and glowing cheeks  bravo  robin youll do it i do believe if it is to be done at all give us your hand lad  the old sailors red countenance beamed with a huge smile of kindness as he shook his enthusiastic nephews hand  there he added ill not say another word against iron kettles or atlantic cables  if you succeed ill give batteries and boilers full credit but if you fail ill not forget to remind you that i said it would all bust up in course of time  with notebook and pencil in hand robin went down the very next day to the works of the telegraph construction and maintenance company where the great cable was being made  presenting his letter of introduction from mr smith robin was conducted over the premises by a clerk who under the impression that he was a very youthful and therefore unusually clever newspaper correspondent treated him with marked respect  this was a severe trial to robins modesty nevertheless he bore up manfully and pulling out his notebook prepared for action  the reader need not fear that we intend to inflict on him robins treatise on what he styled the great atlantic cable but it would be wrong to leave the subject without recording a few of those points which made a deep impression on him  the cable when completed sir said the clerk as he conducted his visitor to the factory will be 2300 nautical miles in length  indeed said robin recording the statement with solemn gravity and great accuracy but i thought he added that the exact distance from ireland to newfoundland was only 1600 miles  you are right sir but we allow 700 miles of slack for the inequalities of the bottom  its cost will be 700000 pounds and the whole when finished will weigh 7000 tons  poor robins mind had of course been informed about tonweights at school but he had not felt that he realised what they actually signified until the thought suddenly occurred that a cartload of coals weighed one ton whereupon 7000 carts of coals leaped suddenly into the field of his bewildered fancy  a slightly humorous tendency inherited from his mother induced 7000 drivers with 7000 whips and a like number of smockfrocks to mount the carts and drive in into the capacious hold of the great eastern  they turned however and drove instantly off his brain when he came into the august presence of the cable itself  the central core of the cablethat part by which the electric force or fluid was to pass from the old world to the new and vice versa was made of copper  it was not a solid single wire but a strand composed of seven fine wires each about the thickness of a small pin  six of these wires were wound spirally round the seventh  this was in order to prevent what is termed a breach of continuity for it will be at once perceived that while a single wire of the core might easily break in the process of laying the cable and thereby prevent the flow of electricity the probability of the seven small wires all breaking at the same spot was so remote as to be almost impossible and if even one wire out of the seven held the continuity would remain  nay even all the seven might break but so long as they did not all break at the same place continuity would not be lost because copper would still continue to touch copper all throughout the cables length  in the process of construction the central wire of the copper core was first covered with a semiliquid coating of guttapercha mixed with tarknown as chattertons compound  this was laid on so thick that when the other wires were wound round it all air was excluded  then a coating of the same compound was laid over the finished conductor and thus the core was solidified  next the core was surrounded with a coating of the purest guttaperchaa splendid nonconductor impervious to waterwhich when pressed to it while in a plastic state formed the first insulator or tube to the core  over this tube was laid a thin coat of chattertons compound for the purpose of closing up any small flaws or minute holes that might have escaped detection  then came a second coating of guttapercha followed by another coating of compound and so on alternately until four coats of compound and four of guttapercha had been laid on  this core when completed was wound in lengths on large reels and was then submerged in water and subjected to a variety of severe electrical tests so as to bring it as near as possible to a state of perfection after which every inch of it was examined by hand while being unwound from the reels and rewound on the large drums on which it was to be forwarded to the covering works at east greenwich there to receive its external protecting sheath  all this and much more besides did robin wright carefully note down and that same evening went home and delivered a long and luminous lecture over which his mother wondered madge rejoiced his father gloried and uncle rik fell asleep  next day he hastened to the covering works and presenting his credentials was admitted  here he saw the important and delicate core again carefully tested as to its electrical condition after which it received a new jacket of tanned jute yarn to protect it from the iron top coat yet to come  its jute jacket on it was then coiled away in tanks full of water where it was constantly kept submerged and continuously tested for insulation  last of all the top coat was put on  this consisted of ten wires of peculiarly fine and strong iron  each of these ten wires had put on it a special coat of its own made of tarred manilla yarn to protect it from rust as well as to lighten its specific gravity  the core being brought from its tank and passed round several sheaves which carried it below the factory floor was drawn up through a hole in the centre of a circular table around the circumference of which were ten drums of the manillacovered wire  a stout iron rod fastened to the circumference of the table rose from between each drum to the ceiling converging in a cone which passed through to the floor above  our core rose in the middle of all and went through the hollow of the cone when all was put in noisy and bewildering motion the core which rose from the turningtable and whirling drums as a thin juteclad line came out in the floor above a stout ironclad cable with a manilla topdressing possessing strength sufficient to bear eleven miles of its own length perpendicularly suspended in wateror a margin of strength more than four and a half times that requiredand with a breaking strain of seven tons fifteen hundredweight  when thoroughly charged and primed robin went off home to write his treatise  then he received the expected summons to repair on board the great eastern and bade adieu to his early home  it was of no use that robin tried to say goodbye in a facetious way and told madge and his mother not to cry saying that he was only going across the atlantic a mere fishpond and that he would be home again in a month or two  ah these little efforts at deception never avail himself broke down while urging madge to behave herself and when his mother gave him a small bible and said she required no promise for she knew he would treasure and read it he was obliged hastily to give her a last fervent hug and rush from the house without saying goodbye at all    chapter seven  the big shipfirst night aboard  when our hero at last reached the great eastern he soon found himself in what may be termed a lost condition  at first he was disappointed for he saw her at a distance and it is wellknown that distance lends deception as well as enchantment to the view  arrived alongside however he felt as if he had suddenly come under the walls of a great fortress or city  presently he stood on the deck of the big ship as its familiars called it and from that moment for several days was as we have said in a lost condition  he was lost in wonder to begin with as he gazed at the interminable length and breadth of planking styled the deck and the forest of funnels masts and rigging and the amazing perspective which caused men at the further end from where he stood to look like dolls  then he was lost in reality when he went below and had to ask his way as though he were wandering in the labyrinths of a great city  he feltor thought he feltlike a mere mite in the mighty vessel  soon he lost his old familiar powers of comparison and contrast and ere long he lost his understanding altogether for he fell down one of the hatchways into a dark abyss where he would probably have ended his career with electric speed if he had not happily fallen into the arms of a human being with whom he rolled and bumped affectionately though painfully to the bottom of the stair  the human being growled intense disapprobation during the process and robin fancied that the voice was familiar  come i say said the being remonstratively this is altogether too loving you know  dont squeeze quite so tight young un whoever you be  oh i beg your pardon gasped robin relaxing his grasp when they stopped rolling im so sorry  i hope i havent hurt you  hurt me laughed jim slagg for it was he no you small electrician you avent got batterypower enough to do me much damage but what dye mean by it  is this the way to meet an old friend  is it right for a wright to go wrong at the wery beginnin of his career  but come i forgive you  have you been introdooced to capting anderson yet  no  who is he  who is he you ignorant crokidile why hes the capting of the great eastern the commander o the big ship the great mogul o the quarterdeck the king o the expedition  but of course you avent bin introdooced to him  he dont associate much with small fry like usmores the pity for it might do im good  but come ill take you under my wing for the present because your partikler owner ebbysneezer smith aint come aboard yetashore dissipatin i supposean everybodys so busy gettin ready to start that nobody will care to be bothered with you so come along  there was same truth in this eccentric youths remarks for in the bustle of preparation for an early start every one on board seemed to be so thoroughly engrossed with his own duty that he had no time to attend to anything else and robin had begun to experience in the absence of his partikler owner an uneasy sensation of being very much in peoples way  as he felt strangely attracted by the offhand goodhumoured impudence of his new friend he consented to follow him and was led to a small apartment somewhere in the depths of the mighty ship in which several youths not unlike slagg were romping  they had indeed duties to perform like the rest but the moment chanced to be with them a brief period of relaxation which they devoted to skylarking  hallo who have you got here demanded a large clumsy youth knocking off slaggs cap as he asked the question  come stumps dont you be cheeky said slagg quietly picking up his cap and putting it on this is a friend o mineone o the electriciansso you neednt try to shock his feelins for he can give better than he gets  hes got no berth yet so i brought im here to show him hospitality  oh indeed said mr stumps bowing with mock respect then turning to the comrade with whom he had been skylarking here jeff supply this gentleman with food  jeff entering into stumps humour immediately brought a plate of broken shipbiscuit with a can of water and set them on the table before robin  our hero who had never been accustomed to much jesting took the gift in earnest thanked jeff heartily and being hungry set to work with a will upon the simple fare while stumps and jeff looked at each other and winked  come i can add something to improve that feast said slagg drawing a piece of cheese from his pocket and setting it before his friend  robin thanked him and was about to take the cheese when stumps snatched it up and ran out of the room with it laughing coarsely as he went  the big bully growled slagg its quite obvious to me that feller will have to be brought to his marrowbones afore long  never mind said jeff who was of a more amiable spirit than stumps heres more o the same sort  he took another piece of cheese from a shelf as he spoke and gave it to robin  now my young toolip said slagg havin finished your feed praps youd like to see over the big ship  with great delight robin said that he should like nothing better and being led forth was soon lost a second time in wonderment  of what use was it that slagg told him the great eastern was 692 feet long by 83 feet broad and 70 feet deep  if he had said yards instead of feet it would have been equally instructive to robin in his then mentally lost condition  neither was it of the slightest use to be told that the weight of the big ships cargo including cable tanks and coals was 21000 tons  but reason began to glimmer again when slagg told him that the two largest vessels afloat could not contain in a convenient position for passing out the 2700 miles then coiled in the three tanks of the great eastern  this is the main tank said slagg leading his friend to a small platform that hung over a black and apparently unfathomable gulf  i see nothing at all said robin stretching his head cautiously forward and gazing down into darkness profound while he held on tight to a rail  how curiouswhen i look down everything in this wonderful ship seems to have no bottom and when i look up nothing appears to have any top while if i look backward or forward things seem to have no end  ah  i see something now  coming in from the light prevented me at first  why its like a huge circus  yes it ony wants hosses an clowns to make it all complete said slagg  now that tank is 58 feet 6 inches in diameter and 20 feet 6 inches deep an holds close upon 900 miles of cable  there are two other tanks not much smaller all chokefull  an the queer thing is that they can telegraph through all its length now at this moment as it lies therean they are doing so continually to make sure that alls right  oh  i understand that said robin quickly i have read all about the laying of the first cable in 1858  it is the appearance of things in this great ship that confounds me  come along then and ill confound you a little more said slagg  he accordingly led his friend from one part of the ship to another explaining and commenting as he went and certainly robins wonder did not decrease  from the grand saloonwhich was like a palatial drawingroom in size as well as in gorgeous furnitureto the mighty cranks and boilers of its engines everything in and about the ship was calculated to amaze as slagg justly remarked it was stunnin  when our hero was saturated with the big ship till he could hold no more his friend took him back to his berth and left him there for a time to his meditations  returning soon after he sat down on a looker  i say robin wright he began thrusting his hands into his trouserspockets it looks amost as if i had smuggled you aboard of this ship like a stowaway  nobody seems to know you are here an whats more nobody seems to care  your partikler owner aint turned up yet an its my opinion he wont turn up tonight so ive spoke to the stooardhes my owner you knowan he says youd better just turn into my berth tonight an youll get showed into your own tomorrow  but where will you sleep asked robin with some hesitation  never you mind that my young electrician  thats my business  what youve got to do is to turn in  jeff and another lad who were preparing to retire for the night at the time laughed at this but robin paid no attention thanked his friend and said that as he was rather tired he would accept his kind offer  thereafter pulling out the small bible which he had kept in his pocket since leaving home he went into a corner read a few verses and then knelt down to pray  the surprise of the other lads was expressed in their eyes but they said nothing  just then the door opened and the lad named stumps entered  catching sight of robin on his knees he opened his eyes wide pursed his mouth and gave a low whistle  then he went up to robin and gave him a slight kick  supposing that it was an accident robin did not move but on receiving another and much more decided kick he rose and turned round at the same moment stumps received a resounding and totally unexpected slap on the cheek from jim slagg who planted himself before him with clenched fists and flashing eyes  what dye mean by interferin wi my friend at his dewotions you monkeyfaced polypus he demanded fiercely  the monkeyfaced polypus replied not a word but delivered a righthander that might have felled a small horse  jim slagg however was prepared for that  he turned his head neatly to one side so as to let the blow pass and at the same moment planted his knuckles on the bridge of his opponents nose and sent him headlong into jeffs bunk which lay conveniently behind  jumping furiously out of that and skinning his shins in the act stumps rushed at slagg who leaping lightly aside tripped him up and gave him a smack on the left ear as he passed by way of keeping him lively  unsubdued by this stumps gathered himself up and made a blind rush at his adversary but was abruptly stopped by what jeff called a dab on the nose  repeating the rush stumps was staggered by a plunging blow on the forehead and he paused to breathe gazing the while at his foe who though a smaller youth than himself was quite as strong  if youve had enough monkeyface said slagg with a bland smile dont hesitate to say so an ill shake hands but if youd prefer a little more before goin to bed just let me know and  slagg here performed some neat and highly suggestive motions with his fists by way of finishing the sentence  evidently stumps wanted more for after a brief pause he again rushed at slagg who stepping aside like a spanish matador allowed his foe to expend his wrath on the bulkhead of the cabin  youll go through it next time stumps if you plunge like that said jeff who had watched the fight with lively interest and had encouraged the combatants with sundry marks of applause besides giving them much gratuitous advice  regardless alike of encouragement and advice the angry youth turned round once more and received a buffet that sent him sprawling on the table off which he fell and rolled under it  there he lay and panted  now my sweet polypus said the victor going down on one knee and patting the vanquished on his shoulder next time you feels tempted to kick a gentlemanspecially a electricianat his dewotions think of jim slagg an restrain yourself  i bear you no illwill howeverso goodnight  saying this robins champion left the room and stumps retired to his berth growling  before passing from the subject we may add that the next night robinwhose owner was still absentwas again hospitably invited to share the cabin of his friend and protector  when about to retire to rest he considered whether it was advisable to risk the repetition of the scene of the previous night and although not quite easy in his conscience about it came to the conclusion that it would be well to say his prayers in bed  accordingly he crept quietly into his berth and lay down but jim slagg who was present no sooner saw what he was about than he jumped up with a roar of indignation  what are you about he cried aint you goin to say your prayers you whitelivered electrician  come git up  if im to fight you must pray  dye hear  turn out i say  with that he seized robin dragged him out of bed thrust him on his knees and bade him do his dooty  at first robins spirit rose in rebellion but a sense of shame at his moral cowardice and a perception of the justice of his friends remark subdued him  he did pray forthwith though what the nature of his prayer was we have never been able to ascertain and do not care to guess  the lesson however was not lost  from that date forward robin wright was no longer ashamed or afraid to be seen in the attitude of prayer    chapter eight  laying the cablefaults and faultfindinganxieties accidents and other matters  come with us now good reader to another and very different sceneout upon the boundless sea  the great atlantic is asleep but his breast heaves gently and slowly like that of a profound sleeper  the great eastern looks like an island on the watersteady as a rock obedient only to the rise and fall of the ocean swell as she glides along at the rate of six knots an hour  all is going well  the complicatedlooking payingout machinery revolves smoothly the threadlike cable passes over the stern and down into the deep with the utmost regularity  the shoreend of the cabletwentyseven miles in length and much thicker than the deepsea portionhad been laid at valentia on the 22nd of july amid prayer and praise speechmaking and much enthusiasm on the part of operators and spectators  on the 23rd the end of the shore cable was spliced to that of the main cable and the voyage had begun  the first night had passed quietly and upwards of eighty miles of the cable had gone out of the aftertank over the big ships stern and down to its oceanbed when robin wrightunable to sleepquietly slipped into his clothes and went on deck  it was drawing near to dawn  a knot of electricians and others were chatting in subdued tones about the one subject that filled the minds of all in the ship  what unable to sleep like the rest of us said ebenezer smith accosting robin as he reached the deck  yes sir said robin with a sleepy smile ive been thinking of the cable so much that i took to dreaming about it when i fell asleep and it suddenly turned into the great seaserpent and choked me to such an extent that i awoke and then thought it better to get up and have a look at it  ah my boy you are not the only one whom the cable wont let sleep it will be well looked after during the voyage for there are two sets of electricians aboardall of them uncommonly wide awakeone set representing the telegraph construction and maintenance company under monsieur de sauty the other set representing the atlantic telegraph company under mr varley and professor thomson  the former are to test the electrical state of the cable and to keep up signals with the shore every hour night and day during the voyage while the latter are to watch and report as to whether the cable fulfils her conditions as specified in the contract  so you see the smallest fault or hitch will be observed at once  do you mean sir asked robin in surprise that telegraphing with the shore is to be kept up continually all the voyage  yes my boy i do answered smith  the lengths of the cable in the three tanks are joined up into one length and telegraphingfor the purpose of testing ithas been kept up with the shore without intermission from the moment we left ireland and began to pay out  it will be continued if all goes well until we land the other and in newfoundland  the tests are threefoldfirst for insulation which as you know means the soundness and perfection of the guttapercha covering that prevents the electricity from escaping from the wires through the sea into the earth secondly for continuity or the unbroken condition of the conductor or copper core throughout its whole length and thirdly to determine the resistance of the conductor by which is meant its objection to carry our messages without vigorous application of the spur in the form of increased electrical power in our batteries  you see robin every message sent to us from the shore as well as every message sent by us in reply has to travel through the entire length of the cable namely about 2400 miles and as every mile of distance increases this unwillingness or resistance we have to increase the electrical power in the batteries in proportion to the distance to which we want to send our message  dyou understand  i think i do sir but how is the exact amount of resistance tested  mr smith smiled as he looked at the earnest face of his young questioner  my boy said he you would require a more fully educated mind to understand the answer to that question  the subtleties of electrical science cannot be explained in a brief conversation  youll have to study and apply to books for full light on that subject  nevertheless although i cannot carry you into the subject just now i can tell you something about it  you remember the testingroom which i showed you yesterdaythe darkened room between the captains stateroom and the entrance to the grand saloon  yes sir i remember it well responded robinthe room into which the conductingwires from the ends of the cable are led to the testingtables on which are the curiouslooking galvanometers and other testing machines  just so returned smith pleased with his pupils aptitude  well on that table stands professor thomsons delicate and wonderful galvanometer  on that instrument a ray of light reflected from a tiny mirror suspended to a magnet travels along a scale and indicates the resistance to the passage of the current along the cable by the deflection of the magnet which is marked by the course of this speck of light  now dyou understand that robin  iim afraid not quite sir  well no matter rejoined smith with a laugh  at all events you can understand that if that speck of light keeps within boundson its indexall is going well but if it travels beyond the indexbolts out of boundsan escape of the electric current is taking place somewhere in the cable or what we call a fault has occurred  ah indeed exclaimed robin casting a serious look at the cable as it rose from the aftertank ran smoothly over its line of conducting wheels dropped over the stern of the ship and glided into the sea like an an endless snake of stealthy habits  and what he added with a sudden look of awe if the cable should break  why it would go to the bottom of course replied smith and several hearts would break along with it  you see these two gentlemen conversing near the companionhatch  yes  one is the chief of the electricians the other the chief of the engineers  their hearts would probably break for their position is awfully responsible  then my heart would break i know for i feel it swelling at the horrible suggestion and your heart would break robin i think for you are a sympathetic donkey and couldnt help yourself then you see that stout man on the bridgethats captain anderson well his heart wouldnoperhaps it wouldnt for hes a sailor and you know a sailors heart is too tough to break but it would get a pretty stiff wrench  and you see that gentleman looking at the payingout gear so earnestly  whatcyrus field said robin  yes well his heart and the atlantic cable are united so as a matter of course the two would snap together  now while smith and his young assistant were conversing thus facetioscientifically the electricians on duty in the testingroom were watching with silent intensity the indications on their instruments  suddenly at 315 am when exactly eightyfour miles of cable had been laid out he who observed the galvanometer saw the speck of light glide to the end of the scale and vanish  if a speck of fire had been seen to glide through the keyhole of the powdermagazine it could scarcely have created greater consternation than did the disappearance of that light  the commotion in the testingroom spread instantly to every part of the ship the whole staff of electricians was at once roused and soon afterwards the engines of the great eastern were slowed and stopped while with bated breath and anxious looks men whispered to each other that there was a fault in the cable  a fault  if the cable had committed a mortal sin they could scarcely have looked more horrified  nevertheless there was ground for anxiety for this fault as in moral faults indicated something that might end in destruction  after testing the cable for some time by signalling to the shore monsieur de sauty concluded that the fault was of a serious character and orders were at once given to prepare the pickingup apparatus at the bow for the purpose of drawing the cable back into the ship until the defective portion should be reached and cut out  o what a pity sighed robin when he understood what was going to be done and the feeling if not the words was shared by every one on board with more or less intelligence and intensity but there were veterans of submarine telegraphy who spoke encouragingly and treated the incident as a comparatively small matter  two menofwar the terrible and the sphinx had been appointed to accompany and aid the great eastern on her important mission  a gun was fired and signals were made to acquaint these with what had occurred while the fires were being got up in the boilers of the pickingup machinery  electricians as well as doctors differ it would seem among themselves for despite their skill and experience there was great difference of opinion in the minds of those on board the big ship as to the place where the fault lay  some thought it was near the shore and probably at the splice of the shoreend with the main cable  others calculated from the indications given by the tests that it was perhaps twenty or forty or sixty miles astern  one of the scientific gentlemen held that it was not very far from the ship while another gentleman who was said to be much experienced in faultfinding asserted that it was not more than nine or ten miles astern  while the doctors were thus differing the practical engineers were busy making the needful preparations for pickingupan operation involving great risk of breaking the cable and requiring the utmost delicacy of treatment as may be easily understood for while the cable is being payed out the strain on it is comparatively small whereas when it is being picked up there is not only the extra strain caused by stoppage and afterwards by hauling in but there is the risk of sudden risings of the ships stern on the ocean swell which might at any moment snap the thin line like a piece of packthread  the first difficulty and the great danger was to pass the cable from the stern to the bow and to turn the ship round so as to enable them to steam up to the cable while hauling it in  iron chains were lashed firmly to the cable at the stern and secured to a wirerope carried round the outside of the ship to the pickingup apparatus at the bows the cable was down in 400 fathoms of water when the payingout ceased and nice management was required to keep the ship steady as she had now no steerageway and oh with what intense interest and curiosity and wonder did robin wright regard the varied and wonderful mechanical appliances with which the whole affair was accomplished  then the cable was cut and with its shackles and chains allowed to go plump into the sea  robins heart and soul seemed to go along with it for not expecting the event he fancied it was lost for ever  gone he exclaimed with a look of horror  not quite said jim slagg who stood at robins elbow regarding the operations with a quiet look of intelligence  dont you see robin that a wirerope fit amost to hold the big ship herself is holdin on to it  of course how stupid i am said robin with a great sigh of relief i see it now going round to the bows  at first the rope was let run to ease the strain while the ship swung round then it was brought in over the pulley at the bow the paddles moved and the return towards ireland was begun  the strain although great was far from the breakingpoint but the speed was very slownot more than a mile an hour being considered safe in the process of pickingup  patience robin observed mr smith as he passed on his way to the cabin is a virtue much needed in the laying of cables  we have now commenced a voyage at the rate of one mile an hour which will not terminate till we get back to owld ireland unless we find the fault  patience however was not destined to be so severely tried  all that day and all night the slow process went on  meanwhileas the cable was not absolutely unworkable despite the faultthe chief engineer mr canning sent a message to mr glass in ireland asking him to send out the hawk steamer in order that he might return in her to search for the defect in the shoreend of the cable for if that were found he purposed sacrificing the eighty odd miles already laid down making a new splice with the shoreend and starting afresh  a reply was received from mr glass saying that the hawk would be sent out immediately  accordingly about daybreak of the 25th the hawk appeared but her services were not required for about nine that morning when the cable was coming slowly in and being carefully examined foot by footnay inch by inchthe fault was discovered and joy took the place of anxiety  ten and a quarter miles of cable had been picked up when the fault came inboard and a strange unaccountable fault it turned out to benamely a small piece of wire which had been forced through the covering of the cable into the guttapercha so as to injure but not quite to destroy the insulation  how such a piece of wire could have got into the tank was a mystery but the general impression was that it had been carried there by accident and forced into the coil by the pressure of the payingout machinery as the cable flew through the jockeywheels  signals were at once made to the fleet that the enemy had been discovered  congratulatory signals were returned  the fault was cut out and a new splice made  the hawk was sent home again  the big ships bow was turned once more to the west and the rattling of the machinery as the restored and revived cable passed over the stern went merrily as a marriage bell  the detention had been only about twelve hours the great work was going on again as favourably as before the mishap occurred and about half a mile had been payed out whenblackness of despairthe electric current suddenly ceased and communication with the shore was ended altogether    chapter nine  in which joys hopes alarms ghosts and leviathans take part  that man who can appreciate the feelings of one who has become suddenly bankrupt may understand the mental condition of those on board the great eastern when they were thus tossed from the pinnacle of joyous hope to the depths of dark despair  it was not however absolute despair  the cable was utterly useless indeedinsensatebut it was not broken there was still the blessed possibility of picking it up and bringing it to life again  that however was scarcely an appreciable comfort at the moment and little could be seen or heard on board the great eastern save elongated faces and gloomy forebodings  ebenezer smith and his confreres worked in the testingroom like trojans  they connected and disconnected they put in stops and took them out they intensified currents to the extent of their anxieties they reduced them to the measure of their despairnothing would do the cable was apparently dead  in these circumstances pickingup was the only resource and the apparatus for that purpose was again rigged up in the bows  in the meantime the splice which had been made to connect the tanks was cut and examined and the portions coiled in the fore and main tanks were found to be perfectalive and wellbut the part between ship and shore was speechless  so was poor robin wright  after mr fieldwhose lifehope seemed to be doomed to disappointmentthe blow was probably felt most severely by robin  but fortune seemed to be playfully testing the endurance of these cablelayers at that time for when the despair was at its worst the telltale light reappeared on the index of the galvanometer without rhyme or reason calling forth a shout of joyful surprise and putting an abrupt stoppage to the labours of the pickersup  they never found out what was the cause of that fault but that was a small matter for with restored sensation in the cablenerve renewed communication with the shore and resumed progress of the ship towards her goal they could afford to smile at former troubles  joy and sorrow shower and sunshine fair weather and foul was at first the alternating portion of the cablelayers  i cant believe my eyes said robin to jim slagg as they stood next day during a leisure hour close to the whirling wheels and neverending cable about 160 miles of which had been laid by that time just look at the terrible and sphinx the sea is now so heavy that they are thumping into the waves burying their bows in foam while we are slipping along as steadily as a thames steamer  thats true sir answered slagg whose admiration for our heros enthusiastic and simple character increased as their intimacy was prolonged and whose manner of address became proportionally more respectful shes a steady little duck is the great eastern she has got the advantage of length you see over other ships an rides on two waves at a time instead of wobblin in between em but i raither think shed roll a bit if she was to go along in the trough of the seas dont the cable go out beautiful toojust like a longdrawn eel with the consumption  did you hear how deep the captain said it was hereabouts  yes i heard him say it was a little short of two miles deep so it has got a long way to sink before it reaches its oozy bed  how dee know what sort o bed its got to lie on asked slagg  because said robin the whole atlantic where the cable is to lie has been carefully sounded long ago and it is found that the oceanbed here which looks so like mud is composed of millions of beautiful shells so small that they cannot be distinguished by the naked eye  of course they have no creatures in them  it would seem that these shellfish go about the ocean till they die and then fall to the bottom like rain  see note one  you dont say so returned slagg who being utterly uneducated received suchlike information with charming surprise and regarded robin as a very mine of knowledge  well now that beats cockfighting  but i say how is it that the electricity works through the cable  i heerd one o your electrical fellers explaining to a landlubber tother evenin that electricity could only run along wires when the circuit was closed by which he meant to say that it would fly from a battery and travel along a wire ever so far if only that wire was to turn right round and run back to the same battery again  now if thats so seems to me that when youve got your cable to newfoundland youll have to run another one back again to ireland before itll work  ah slagg that would indeed be the case returned robin were it not that we have discovered the important fact that the earththe round globe on which we standitself acts the part of a grand conductor  so we have only to send down earthwires at the two endsone into the earth of ireland the other into the earth of newfoundland and straightway the circuit is closed and the electricity generated in our batteries passes through the cable from earth to earth  robin said slagg doubtingly dyou expect me for to believe that  indeed i do said robin simply  then youre greener than i took you for  no offence meant but its my opinion some o these cute electricians has bin tryin the width of your swallow  no you are mistaken returned robin earnestly i have read the fact in many books  the books differ in their opinions as to the causes and nature of the fact but not as to the fact itself  it was evident that robin looked upon this as an unanswerable argument and his friend seemed perplexed  well i don know how it is he said after a pause but i do believe that this here wonderful electricity is fit for amost anything an that well have it revoloosionising everything afore longi do indeed  the intelligent reader who has noted the gigantic strides which we have recently made in electric lighting of late will observe that slagg unwittingly had become almost prophetic at this time  were going along splendidly now said mr smith coming up to robin that evening while he was conversing with slagg who immediately retiredwho is that youth  he seems very fond of you ive observed that he makes up to you whenever you chance to be on deck together  he is one of the stewards lads sir i met him accidentally in the train but i suspect the fondness is chiefly on my side  he was very kind to me when i first came on board and i really think he is an intelligent good fellowa strange mixture of selfconfidence and humility  sometimes to hear him speak you would think he knew everything but at the same time he is always willingindeed anxious to listen and learn  he is a capital fighter too  here robin related the battle in the boys berth when slagg thrashed stumps whereat mr smith was much amused  so he seems a peculiar ladmodest impudent teachable kindly and warlike  come below now robin i have some work for you  did you make the calculations i gave you yesterday  yes sir and they corresponded exactly with your own  good  go fetch my little notebook i left it in the grand saloon on the furthest aft seat port side  robin found the magnificent saloon of the big ship ringing with music and conversation  joy over the recent restoration to health of the ailing cable the comfortable stability of the ship in rough weather and the satisfactory progress then being made all contributed to raise the spirits of every one connected with the great work so that while some were amusing themselves at the piano others were scattered about in little groups discussing the profounder mysteries of electric science or prophesying the speedy completion of the enterprise while a few were speculating on the probability of sport in newfoundland or planning out journeys through the united states  theres lots of game im told in newfoundland said one of the youthful electricians whose ruling passionnext to the subtle fluid was the gun  so ive been told replied an elder and graver comrade  polar bears are quite common in the woods and it is said that walrus are fond of roosting in the trees  yes i have heard so returned the youthful sportsman who although young was not to be caught with chaff and the fishing i hear is also splendid  salmon and cod are found swarming in the rivers by those who care for mild occupation while really exciting sport is to be had in the great lakes of the interior where there are plenty of freshwater whales that take the fly  the swan you mean said another comrade  the fly that is most killing among newfoundland whales is a swan fastened whole to a shark hookthough a small boats anchor will do if you havent the right tackle  come dont talk nonsense but lets have a song said a brother electrician to the sporting youth  i never sing he replied except when hurt and then i sing out  but see our best musician has just seated himself at the instrument  i dont talk shop nimrod call it the piano  most of those present drew towards the musical corner where ebenezer smith having just entered the saloon in search of robin had been prevailed on to sit down and enliven the company  robin who had been delayed by difficulty in finding the notebook stopped to listen  smith had a fair average voice and a vigorous manner  you wouldnt object to hear the cooks last asked smith running his fingers lightly over the keys  of course notgo on chorused several voices  i had no idea lisped a simple youth who was one of a small party of young gentlemen interested in engineering and science who had been accommodated with a passagei had no idea that our cook was a poet as well as an admirable chef de cuisine  oh its not our cook he means explained the sporting electrician mr smith refers to a certain seacookor his son im not sure whichwho is chef des horsemarines  is there a chorus asked one  of course there is replied smith a seasong without a chorus is like a kite without a tailit is sure to fall flat but the chorus is an old and wellknown oneit is only the song that is new  now then clear your throats gentlemen    songthe loss of the nancy lee    i    twas on a friday morning that i went off   an shipped in the nancy lee   but that ship caught a cold and with one tremendous cough   went slap to the bottom of the sea the sea the sea   went slap to the bottom of the sea    chorusthen the raging sea may roar   an the stormy winds may blow   while we jolly sailor boys rattle up aloft   and the landlubbers lie down below below below   and the landlubbers lie down below    ii    for wery nigh a century i lived with the crabs   an danced wi the mermaids too   an drove about the ocean in mother

derstand   and as everybody well may understand   chorusthen the raging sea etcetera  the plaudits with which this song was received were it need scarcely be remarked due more to the vigour of the chorus and the enthusiasm of the audience than to intrinsic merit  even robin wright was carried off his legs for the moment and modest though he was broke in at the chorus with such effecthis voice being shrill and clearthat he unintentionally outyelled all the rest and would have fled in consternation from the saloon if he had not been caught and forcibly detained by the sporting electrician who demanded what right he had to raise his steamwhistle in that fashion  but i say young wright he added in a lower tone leading our hero aside whats this rumour i hear about a ghost in the stewards cabin  oh it is nothing to speak of replied robin with a laugh  the lad they call stumps got a frightthats all  but thats enough  let us hear about it  well i suppose you know said robin that theres a ghost in the great eastern  no i dont know it from personal experience but i have heard a report to that effect  well i was down in jim slaggs berth having a chat with him about the nature of electric currentsfor he has a very inquiring mindand somehow we diverged to ghosts and began to talk of the ghost of the great eastern  i dont believe in the great eastern ghostno nor in ghosts of any kind said stumps who was sitting near us eating a bit of cheese  but i believe in em said the boy jeff who was seated on the other side of the table and looked at us so earnestly that we could scarce help smilingthough we didnt feel in a smiling humour at the time for it was getting dark and we had got to talking in low tones and looking anxiously over our shoulders you know  oh yes i know replied the sportsman with a laugh i have shuddered and grueooed many a time over ghoststories  well  i dont believe in em jeff  why do you asked stumps in a scoffing tone  because i hear one every night amost when i go down into the dark places below to fetch things  theres one particular spot where the ghost goes taptaptapping continually  fiddlededee said stumps  come down and you shall hear it for yourself said jeff  now they say that stumps is a coward though he boasts a good deal  you may say interrupted the sportsman that stumps is a coward because he boasts a good deal  boasting is often a sign of cowardicethough not always  well continued robin being ashamed to draw back i suppose he agreed to accompany jeff  wont you come too slagg said stumps  no i dont care a button for ghosts  besides im too busy but wright will go  there dont bother me said jim  i noticed as i went last out of the room that slagg rose quickly and pulled a sheet off one of the beds  afterwards looking back i saw him slip out and run down the passage in the opposite direction  i suspected he was about some mischief but said nothing  it was getting dark as i have said though not dark enough for lighting the lamps and in some corners below it was as dark as midnight  to one of these places jeff led us  mind how you go now whispered jeff its here somewhere and theres a hole toolookoutthere it is  what the ghost whispered stumps beginning to feel uneasy  to say truth i began to feel uneasy myself without well knowing why  at that moment i fell over something and came down with a crash that shook stumpss nerves completely out of order  i say lets go back he muttered in a tremulous voice  no no whispered jeff seizing stumps by the arm with a sudden grip that made him give a short yelp we are at the place now  its in this dark passage  listen  we all held our breath and listened  for a few seconds we heard nothing but presently a slight tapping was heard  ive heard whispered jeff in a low tone that when the big ship was buildin one o the plateriveters disappeared in some hole between the two skins o the ship hereabouts and his comrades not bein able to find him were obliged at last to rivet him in which they did so tight that even his ghost could not get out so it goes on tappin as you hear an is likely to go on tappin for ever  bosh whispered stumps thus politely intimating his disbelief but i felt him trembling all over notwithstanding  at that moment we saw a dim shadowy whitish object at the other end of the dark passage  whawhawhats that said i  stumps gasped  i heard his teeth chattering and i think his knees were knocking together  jeff made no sound and it was too dark to see his face  suddenly the object rushed at us  there was no noise of footstepsonly a muffled sound and a faint hissing  i stood still unable to move  so did jeff  i felt the hair of my head rising stumps gasped againthen turned and fled  the creature whatever it was brushed past us with a hideous laugh  i guessed at once that it was jim slagg but evidently stumps didnt for he uttered an awful yell that would have roused the whole ship if she had been of an ordinary size at the same moment he tripped and fell on the thing that had upset me and the ghost leaping over him vanished from our sight  to my surprise on returning to our cabin we found slagg as we had left him with both hands on his forehead poring over his book  i was almost as much surprised to see jeff sit down and laugh heartilynow what do you think it could have been  it was slagg of course answered the sporting electrician  yes but what causes the tapping  oh that is no doubt some little triflea chip of wood or bit of wire left hanging loose which shakes about when the ship heaves  a sudden tramping of feet overhead brought this ghostly discussion to an abrupt close and caused every man in the saloon to rush on deck with a terrible feeling in his heart that something had gone wrong  not broken asked an electrician with a pale face on reaching the deck  oh no sir replied an engineer with an anxious look not quite so bad as that but a whale has taken a fancy to inspect us and he is almost too attentive  so it was  a large greenland whale was playing about the big ship apparently under the impression that she was a giant of his own species and it had passed perilously close to the cable  a second time it came up rolling high above the waves  it went close past the sternrose again and dived with a gentle flop of its great tail which if it had touched the cable would have cut it like a thread  at that trying moment as they saw its huge back glittering in the moonlight the hearts of the helpless spectators appeared absolutely to stand still  when the monster dived its side even touched the cable but did not damage it  being apparently satisfied by that time that the ship was not a friend the whale finally disappeared in the depths of its ocean home    those who visited the crystal palace at sydenham during the recent electrical exhibition had an opportunity of seeing the shells here referred to under a powerful microscope    chapter ten  tells of great efforts and failures and grand success  thus happily and smoothly all things went with little bursts of anxiety and little touches of alarm just sufficient as it were to keep up the spirits of all till the morning of the 30th july  but on that morning an appearance of excitement in the testingroom told that something had again gone wrong  soon the order was given to slow the engines then to stop them  the bursting of a thunderclap the explosion of a powdermagazine could not have more effectually awakened the slumberers than this abrupt stoppage of the ships engines  instantly all the hatchways poured forth anxious inquirers  another fault was the reply to such  o dear said some  horrible said others  not so bad as a break sighed the hopeful spirits  it is bad enough said the chief electrician for we have found dead earth  by this the chief meant to say that insulation had been completely destroyed and that the whole current of electricity was escaping into the sea  about 716 miles had been payed out at the time and as signals had till then been regularly received from the shore it was naturally concluded that the fault lay near to the ship  now then get along said an engineer to one of the cablemen youll have to cut and splice and test while we are getting ready the tackle to pick up  i dont like that cuttin o the cable bill said one of the sailors as he went forward it seems dangerous it do  no more do i dick replied his mate i feel as if it never could be rightly spliced again  why bless you boys said a cableman near them cables is used to that now like eels to bein skinned and so are we for that matter we think nothin of it  clearly the cableman was right for while the pickingup apparatus was being got ready the cable was cut in no fewer than three places in order to test the coils that lay in the tanks  these being found all right the pickingup was begun with anxious care  the moment of greatest danger was when the big ship was swinging round  for a few but apparently endless moments the cable had to bear the strain and became rigid like a bar of steel  then it was got in over the bows where all was bustle and noise and smoke as the pickingup machinery panted and rattled  all day the work went on  night descended but still the cable was coming in slowly unwillinglynow jerkily as if half inclined to yield anon painfully as if changing its mind until the strain was equal to two and a half tons  a row of lanterns lighted it and the men employed watched and handled it carefully to detect the fault while the clattering wheels played harsh music  well never find it growled an impatient young electrician  as if to rebuke him for his want of faith the fault came in then and thereat 950 pm ships time  ah said mr field whose chief characteristic was an unwavering faith in ultimate success i knew we should find it are long  i have often known cables to stop working for two hours no one knew why and then begin again  well now mr wright it floors me altogether does this here talkin by electricity  the man who made this remark to our hero was one who could not have been easily floored by any other means than electricity  he was a huge blacksmitha stalwart fellow who had just been heaving the sledgehammer with the seeming powers of vulcan himself and who chanced to be near robin when he paused to rest and mop the streaming perspiration from his brow while a wellmatched brother took his place at the anvil  you see he continued i cant make out nohow what the electricity does when it gits through the cable from ireland to noofunland  of course it dont actooally speak you knowno more does it whistle i suppose an even if it did i dont see as wed be much the wiser  what do it do mr wright  you seem to be well up in these matters an not above explainin of em to the likes o us as hant got much edication  few things pleased robin more than being asked to impart what knowledge he possessed or to make plain subjects that were slightly complex  he was not always successful in his attempts at elucidation partly because some subjects were too complex to simplify and partly because some intellects were obtuse but he never failed to try  you must know he replied with that earnest look which was apt to overspread his face when about to explain a difficulty that a piece of common iron can be converted into a magnet by electrifying it and it can be unconverted just as fast by removing the electricity  well suppose i have a bit of iron in america with an electric battery in ireland or vice versa  wots wicey wersa mr wright  oh it means the terms being changedturned the other way you know back to the front as it werein short i mean the battery being in america and the bit of iron in ireland  well well whod a thought there was so much in wicey wersa but go on mr wright  now you must suppose continued robin that a needle like the mariners compass needle hangs beside my bit of iron close to it and that a wire or conductor of electricity connects the iron with my electric battery in ireland  well that makes a magnet of it and the suspended needle being attracted sticks to it  then i disconnect the wire from my battery by touching a handle the bit of iron ceases to be a magnet and the needle was free  again i connect the battery and the needle flies to the remagnetised bit of iron  thus as fast as i choose i can make the needle wag and by a simple arrangement we can make it wag right or left so many beats right or left or alternately representing letters  by varying the beats we vary the letters and thus spell out our messages  now do you understand it  i aint quite sure that i does replied vulcan ive got a hazy notion that by touchin and removin the touch from a conductor connecting and disconnecting wires and batteries you can make electricity flow just as you let on or stop water by turnin a stopcock  not exactly interrupted robin because you see electricity does not really flow not being a substance  not a substance sir wy wot is it then  like light and sound it is merely an effect an influence a result answered robin  we only use the word flow and talk of electricity as a fluid for convenience sake  well wotever it is or isnt continued the puzzled vulcan gazing at vacancy for a few seconds when youve set it agoinor set agoin the things as sets it agoinyou make a suspended needle wag and when you stop it you make the needle stop waggin and by the way in which that there needle wags you can spell out the letters o the alphabitso many wags to the right bein one letter so many wags to the left bein another letter an so onso that what between the number o wags an the direction o the waggins youyou come for tothere im lost again an i must go in for another spell wi the sledge so well have to tackle the subject another time mr wright  thus speaking vulcan seized the ponderous hammer in his powerful grasp and proceeded to beat form into a mass of glowing metal with much greater ease than he had been able to thump telegraphy into his own brain  in the discovery of the fault and the cutting out of the injured part of the cable twentysix hours were lost  during all the time captain anderson was obliged to remain on deck while the minds and bodies of the engineers and electricians were subjected to a severe strain for the same period  they had scarcely begun to breathe freely again and to congratulate each other on being able to continue the voyage when they received another shock of alarm by the cable suddenly flying off the drum while it was being transferred from the pickingup machinery in the bow to the payingout arrangements in the stern  before the machinery could be stopped some fathoms of cable had become entangled among the wheels and destroyed  this part having been cut out however and new splices made the payingout process was resumed  ill turn in now and have a snooze robin said ebenezer smith and you had better do the same you look tired  this was indeed true for not a man or boy in the ship took a more anxious interest in the cable than did our little hero he had begun to regard it as a living creature and to watch over it and dream about it as if it were a dear friend in extreme danger  the enthusiastic boy was actually becoming careworn and thin for he not only performed all the duties required of him with zealous application but spent his leisure and much of the time that should have been devoted to rest in the careful study of his idolintensely watching it and all that was in the remotest way connected with it  youre a goose said stumps in passing when he heard robin decline to retire as smith had advised him  it may be so and if so stumps i shall continue to cackle a little longer on deck while they are examining the fault  that examination when finished produced a considerable sensation  the process was conducted in private  the condemned portion was cut in junks and tested until the faulty junk was discovered  this was untwisted until the core was laid bare and when about a foot of it had been so treated the cause of evil was discovered drawing from the onlookers an exclamation of horror rather than surprise as they stood aghast for treachery seemed to have been at work  an enemy in the ship murmured one  what ship without an enemy thought another  that mischief had been intended was obvious for a piece of iron wire bright as if cut with nippers at one end and broken off short at the other had been driven right through the centre of the cable so as to touch the inner wiresthus forming a leak or conductor into the sea there could be no doubt that it had not got there by accident neither had it been driven there during the making or shipping of the cable for in that case the testings for continuity would have betrayed its presence before the starting of the expedition  the piece of wire too was the same size as that which formed the protecting cover and it was of the exact diameter of the cable  there was also the mark of a cut on the manilla hemp where the wire had entered  it could have been done only by one of the men who were at work in the tank at the time the portion went over and strange to say this was the same gang which had been at work there when the previous fault occurred  call all the men aft was the order that quickly followed this discovery  the piece of cable was handed to them and they were allowed to examine it in silence  they did so in great surprise mingled with indignation  its bin done apurpose an driven in by a skilful hand said one  youre right joe said another  i knows whispered a third that one of the men expressed satisfaction when the last fault occurred an ive heard say that weve got enemies to the makers o the cable aboard  the man thus darkly referred to whoever he was of course looked as innocent and as indignant as the most virtuous among them the guilt therefore could not be brought home to him  woe betide him if it had been for there was a serious talk of lynching some one among the wrathful men each of whom was now subject to suspicion  in these trying circumstances the chief engineer accepted an offer made by the gentlemen in the ship to take turn about in superintending the men at work in the tank payingout the cable  its not pleasant of course replied one of the men speaking for the rest but we feel it to be justifiable as well as necessary and are very glad the plan has been adopted  once more the big ship went merrily on her way and the great cable went down to its oceanbed so smoothly and regularly that men began to talk of speedy arrival at hearts contenttheir destination in newfoundlandwhich was now only about 600 miles distant but their greatest troubles still lay before them  about eight oclock in the morning of 2nd august another bad fault was reported and they had once again to resort to the wearisome process of pickingup  at first all seemed about to go well  a gale was indeed blowing at the time but that did not much affect the colossal ship  the cable was cut fastened to its iron rope passed to the bow and got in over the pulleys  then and very slowly it was drawn on board  when a mile or so had been recovered the gearing of one of the engines got a little out of order and the process had to be temporarily stopped then something went wrong with the boilers but soon these difficulties were removed  immediately after the great eastern drifted so that it was impossible to prevent the cable from chafing against her bows  equally impossible was it to go astern lest the strain should be too great then the wind suddenly shifted making matters worse  suddenly the chain shackle and wirerope attached to the cable came in over the wheel at the bows with considerable violence  another moment and the cable parted flew through the stoppers and with one bound flashed into the sea and disappeared  now at last the fatal climax so much dreaded had arrived  the days and nights of anxious labour had been spent in vain  the cable was lost and with it went not only hundreds of thousands of pounds but the hopes of hundreds of thousands of people whose sanguine expectations of success were thus rudely dispelled  need it be said that something very like despair reigned for the moment on board the great eastern  most of the gentlemen on boardnever dreaming of catastrophewere at luncheon when mr canning entered the saloon with a look that caused every one to start  it is all overit is gone he said and hastened to his cabin  mr field with the composure of faith and courage though very pale entered the saloon immediately after and confirmed the chief engineers statement  the cable has parted he said and has gone overboard  from the chiefs down even to stumps and his fraternity all was blank dismay  as for our hero robin wright he retired to his cabin flung himself on his bed and sobbed as though his heart would break  but such a state of things could not last  mens spirits may be stunned and crushed but they are seldom utterly overwhelmed so long as life endures  recovering from the shock mr canning set about the process of grappling for the lost cable with persistent energy  but fishing in water two and a half miles deep is no easy matter  nevertheless it was done  again and again and over again were two monster hooks in the shape of grapnels let down to the bottom of the sea with an iron rope for a line and the great eastern for a float  the plan of course was to go back a few miles on their course and then drag across the known position of the lost treasure  we say known because good observations had fortunately been obtained by captain anderson just before the accident  two hours did the grapnels descend before they reached the bottom of the sea  all night did the cablelayers fish with the characteristic patience of fishermen but did not get a nibble  towards morning however there was a decided bite and the line became taut  got him exclaimed an enthusiast eagerly  dont be too sure replied a philosopher cautiously  it may be a bit of wreck suggested ebenezer smith who was a natural doubter  or a whale or the great seaserpent said the sporting electrician who was everything by turns and nothing long  we shall very soon know remarked a matteroffact engineer  if it is a loose object the strain will decrease as it nears the surface but if it be the cable the strain will certainly increase because its weight will be greater the more of it we lift off the bottom  earnestly did every one regard the dynamometer which told the exact amount of strain on the iron fishingline and to their joy the strain increased until the object caught had been raised threequarters of a mile from the bottom  then a swivel gave way and the cable went back to its oceanbed  but those plucky engineers were not to be overcome by a first failure having started with five miles of fishingline they proceed at once to make a second attempt  oh i do hope they will hook it again said robin wright  and so they will said ebenezer smith  and so they did  late in the afternoon of the monday following their fish was again hooked and raised a full mile from the bottom when another swivel gave way and down it went a second time  the fishingline was now getting short  it behoved them to act with more caution  new bolts were put in each shackle and swivel and the capstan was increased in diameter being belted with thick plates of iron  to effect these alterations the forges had to be erected on deck and at night these cast a lurid glare on the busy workers bringing out every near object in vivid relief against the ebony background of space behind while they made preparations for a third cast of the fishingline  the cast was made successfully it was thought but one of the grapnels had caught the line with one of its flukes so that it could not catch anything else and the result wasnothing  a fourth attempt was then made  it was to be the last  the fishingline seemed too weak and its frequent breakings had reduced it so much that other chains had to be attached to it  with this thing of shreds and patches the cable was once more hooked and brought up nearly eight hundred fathoms when the line gave way once more and the cable went down for the last time  nothing more could be done  the great eastern turned her large bows to the east and steered grandly though sadly away for old england  but dont imagine good reader that these cablelayers were beaten they were baffled indeed for that year 1865 but not conquered cyrus field had resolved that the thing should be doneand done it was the following year for the laying of the cable had been so nearly a success that great capitalists such as brassey gooch barclay campbell pender and others at once came forward  among these were the contractors glass and elliot who agreed not only to make and lay a new cable but to pick up and complete the old one  cyrus field himself besides energising like hercules to push the matter on was one of ten subscribers who each contributed 10000 pounds  thus 230500 pounds were privately subscribed before a prospectus was issued  our little hero was at the laying of that 1866 cable when the same great ship with the same captain and most of the engineers and electricians who had gone out on the previous voyage landed the end of the 1820mile rope on the shores of newfoundland on friday 27th july he cheered with the rest in wild enthusiasm when the great eastern dropped anchor in hearts content  he accompanied captain anderson and the officers of the fleet when they went in a body to the little church there to thank god for the successful completion of the great enterprise  he was present when the big ship having received from other ships 8000 tons of coal and some six hundred miles of the old cable went back to midocean to grapple for the lost cable of 1865  he assisted and watched with the deepest interest the amazing efforts of scientific and mechanical power put forth in the mere matter of dragging for the cable from the bottom and observed with reverence amounting almost to awe the great moving spirit of the whole affair the indomitable mr field as he went to the bow and sat on the rope to feel the quiver which told him it was dragging the bottom of the sea two miles below  he was present with blazing cheeks and eyes and bated breath when on the 17th of august the cable was caught dragged to the surface and actually seen and broke and sank again as deep as everthough not so deep as the hearts of those who saw it go  he shared in the weary delays that followed and in the final triumph when the cable was fairly caught and at last brought on board and carried to the testingroom amid intense excitement lest it should prove to have been damaged by its rough treatment and his voice helped to swell the roar of enthusiastic cheering that greeted the announcement that the old cable was still alive  but all this we must leave and carry the reader back to old england faster than the great eastern could have rusheday faster than the message on the flashing cable itself could have sped for mind is more subtle than matter and thought is swifter than even the atlantic telegraph    chapter eleven  home  at last exclaimed robin bursting into his old home and seizing his mother in his arms  robin had just returned home after the laying of the 1866 atlantic cable as briefly narrated in the last chapter  it may be said with some truth that the old home became during the next few days a private lunatic asylum for its inmates went mildly mad with joy  chief among the lunatics was uncle rik the retired seacaptain  that madmans case however was not temporary derangement like the others it was confirmed insanity somewhat intensified just then by the nephews return  so young man he said one evening at supper when the family traveller was dilating to openeyedandmouthed listeners you actually believe that these cables are goin to work  of course i do uncle  they are working now and have been working for many years  well now the gullibility o some people is stupendous returned rik dont you know robin that everything amost works for a time and then sooner or laterusually soonerthe ridiculous thing bursts up  but uncle you beg the question in classing submarine cables among ridiculous things  besides have not dozens of cables been working satisfactorily for many years without showing signs of bursting up as yet  pooh bah boh replied uncle rik by which he meant to say that though convinced against his will he was of the same opinion still  at that moment cousin sam shipton entered with an eager excited look  its all settled he said taking robin by the hand  what is settled asked mrs wright somewhat anxiously  mother dont be angry said robin laying his hand on his mothers shoulder and speaking tenderly i meant to have told you the moment i came in today but uncle rik with his argumentative spirit drove it and everything else except cables out of my head  well but what is it interrupted madge impatiently why do you keep us in suspense  i have some prospect mother of being appointed to go with a telegraphlaying party to the east but sam is wrong when he says it is all settled  whatever he may have to tell us it is by no means settled until i have your and fathers opinion  well you horribly good but ungrateful boy returned sam it is at least settled as far as i have do with it  i have made application at headquarters and they are willing to take you on my recommendation moreover i am myself going  youre joking sam exclaimed robin with a flush of joy i thought you had neither intention nor desire to go far from home  you thought wrong robin  i always had desire and now have intentionand i go as second in command  so miss mayland he continued turning to madge i shant be able to continue those electrical lectures which you were so fond of once but have lately seemed to grow tired of  madge was at that tender age of budding womanhood when sensitive girls are apt to misunderstand a jest  she blushed stammered something then forced a laugh and turned to speak to robin but sam perceived that tears rose to her eyes and he instantly sank in his own estimation to the condition of a loathsome reptile  well now that is good news cried robin applying himself to the viands on the table with renewed zest  you cannot have the smallest objection or anxiety mother i should think when you know i shall be under so able a guide  i have not yet thought it over robin  and you father  go my boy and my blessing go with you said mr wright all but choking the blessing with a huge oyster  are any labourers to go with us asked robin  one or two picked ones  then you must allow me to pick one sam  my friend jim slagg is at present cast adrift with a considerable part of the great easterns crew  he will be delighted to go i know and is a firstrate hardworking willing conscientious youth  he ought to be proud of having so warm a friend and advocate said sam but i have no power to choose the men  o yes you have sam  if you could get me appointed you can get him appointed and you must for if you dont i wont go  you are hard on me robin but ill try  but you have not yet told us where it is that they are going to send you said mrs wright  ah thats not fixed replied sam they are laying down lines in turkey and egypt is talked of and telegraph to india itself is even hinted at  all i know is that we shall be sent to the east somewhere  bah boo  why does nobody ask for my opinion on the matter said uncle rik as he gazed at the company over a goose drumstick which was obviously not tender  your opinion brother said mr wright is so valuable that no doubt your nephew has been keeping it to the last as a sort of titbiteh robin  well uncle come let us have it said robin  you dont deserve it returned rik with a wrench at the drumstick but you shall have it all the same free gratis  was this bird fed on guttapercha shavings sister nan  perhapsor on violin strings im not sure which replied mrs wright blandly  well continued the captain you youngsters will go off i see right or wrong and youll get halfdrowned in the sea roasted in the east smothered in the desert eaten alive by cannibals usedup by the plague poisoned by serpents and teetotally ruined altogether  then youll come home with the skin of your teeth onnothing more  i sincerely hope it will be summer at the time said sam laughing but we are grateful to you for prophesying that we shall return even though in such light clothing  thats whatll happen continued the captain regarding the other drumstick with some hesitation you may take the word of an old salt for it  ive lived in the good old times lads and i know that all these newfangled notions are goin to burst upand thats whatll come of it  whether that was what came of it remains to be seen    chapter twelve  a great dynamoelectric seafight  a few weeks after the utterance of captain riks famous prophecy robin sam stumps and slagg found themselves on board of a large submarine cable steamship named the triton ploughing the billows of the southern ocean  a few weeks later and they were drawing near to that great concourse of islands known as the malay archipelago where nature is exceptionally beautiful but man is rather vile  at all events that region of the ocean lying to the south of china has been long infamous for the number and ferocity of its pirates who among the numerous islands with their various channels creeks and rivers have found a suitable field for their bloody and remorseless game  dyou know i dont believe in pirates said robin to sam as they stood at the bow of the cableship conversing about these searobbers  they believe in you nevertheless as youd find out to your cost if we came across one just now  the voice that replied was not sams but that of the captain who had come forward to get a clearer sweep of the horizon ahead with his glass  do you think it likely sir that we may meet with any of the rascals asked sam  not at all unlikely replied the captain fixing his glass and putting it to his eye though i dont think it likely that we shall be attacked as we are large and dont look like a richly freighted merchantman  however there is no saying  these scoundrels fear nothing and when hard up will attack anything but a manofwar i half suspect that i am looking at one of them now  this latter announcement calmly uttered threw all who heard it into quite a flutter of excitement  the captain was a big darkskinned bearded man with a quiet halfhumorous halfsarcastic expression of countenance  do you really think it is a pirate asked robin eagerly  i really do replied the captain and i fear we may have to run out of our course to avoid her  you see i am a man of peace and abhor bloodshed therefore i wont fight if i can help it  saying this he gave orders to have the course of the steamer changed  just then there occurred one of those contretemps which dont often happen but which when they do are often prolific of disaster an important part of the machinery broke down and the engine for the moment was rendered useless  it was most unfortunate for the suspicious craft lay to windward and a light breeze was blowing carried it steadily towards them although all the sail the steamer possessed was crowded on her  come aft here mr shipton and tell your chief to come with you  i want to hold a council of war said the captain  summoning the first mate and chief engineer as well as the electricians the captain went to the after part of the quarterdeck where seated on the taffrail he deliberated with the extemporised council measures for repelling an expected attack  what these deliberations tended to those not of the council could not tell but from the energy of the members and an occasional burst of laughter from the group it was obvious as jim slagg remarked that mischief o some sort was in the wind  presently the council broke up and the members went actively below as men do who have a purpose to carry out promptly  meanwhile the pirate vessel came within range and fired a shot which missed them  the fire was not repeated  evidently they meant to get within easy range before trying another shot  in a few minutes the electricians came on deck with several large coils of copper wire which they uncoiled and distributed mysteriously about the sides of the vessel  at the same time several lengths of leathern pump hose were laid along the deck and firebranches or nozzles attached to them  run out our sternguns now said the captain with a grim smile and give it em hot  it wont do to seem to give in too easy  run up the union jack  dont take aim  i want more noise and smoke than mischiefdye understand  the officer to whom this was addressed said ay ay sir in the usual tone of ready obedience adding however in an undertoned growl but i dont understand for all that  he obeyed the orders literally being well disciplined and the result was a sudden and most furious cannonade for the pirate replied with vigour using all the guns he could bring to bear but no damage was done on either side for some time until at last a ball from the enemy went crash through the smoke funnel of the triton with a most sonorous bang  thatll do now cried the captain cease firing and haul down the colours  if the captain had said cut away the rudder and heave the boilers overboard he could scarcely have caused more surprise in his crew who by his orders had assembled on deck every man being armed with musket cutlass and revolver  his orders were strictly and promptly obeyed however  by this time the light breeze had fallen and a dead calm prevailed so that the sails of the pirate flapped idly against her masts and her crew were seen busily lowering her boats  we could have soon got out of her way if our engines had not broke down growled the captain as he went toward the front of the quarterdeck and looked down on the armed men in the waist  my lads he said the blackguards are malay pirates  they are lowering their boats and will be alongside in less than half an hour  i dont need to tell you what youll have to expect if they take us  we must beat em off or die for its better to die sword in hand than to be tortured or strangled  those of you however who prefer the latter modes of going under may show the white feather and enjoy yourselves in your own way  now lads you know me  i expect obedience to orders to the letter  i hate fighting and bloodshedso dont kill unless you cant help it  also take care that you dont touch these copper wires on the sides with either finger or foot  if you do youll repent it for electricians dont like their gear handled  turning abruptly round for the oars of the approaching boats could now be distinctly heard the captain asked sam if his batteries were well charged  chockfull sir replied sam with a broad grin theres not a bit of iron all round the ship that a man could lay hold of without receiving his due  good said the captain turning to the chief engineer are the hose attached and the boilers hot  bubblin up fit to burst sir  ive weighted the safetyvalves to give it force  without another word the captain stepped to the port gangway and took off his hat to the advancing pirates  the pirate captain not to be outdone in civility took off his fez and bowed as the boat ranged alongside  the captain carefully held out one of the manropes to his enemy  he grasped it and seized the other  an instantaneous yell of the most appalling nature issued from his mouth and never before since shipbuilding began were a couple of manropes thrown off with greater violence  the pirate captain fell back into his boat and the captain of the steamer stepped promptly back to avoid the storm of bullets that were let fly at his devoted head  at the starboard gangway the chief mate performed the same ceremony to another boat with a like result  the pirates were amazed and enraged but not cowed  with a wild cheer they made a simultaneous dash at the ships sides all round  with a wilder yell they fell back into their boatsshocked beyond expression a few of them however chanced to lay hold of ropes or parts of the vessel that were not electrified  these gained the bulwarks  shove in some more acid said the chief electrician in suppressed excitement to sam shipton who stood beside the batteries below  stir up the fires lads cried the chief engineer to his men at the boilers beneath as he stood holding a firenozzle ready  intensified yells all round told that chemical action had not been applied in vain while the pirates who had gained the bulwarks were met with streams of boiling water in their faces  heroes may and do face shot and shell coolly without flinching but no hero ever faced boiling water coolly  the pirates turned simultaneously and received the streams in rear  light cotton is but a poor defence in such circumstances  they sloped over the sides like eels and sought refuge in the sea  blazing with discomfiture and amazement but not yet dismayed these ferocious creatures tried the assault a second time their fury became greater so did the numbers that gained a footing on the bulwarks but not one reached the deck  the battery and the boiler played a part that day which it had never before entered into the brain of the wildest scientist to conceive  the hissing of the hot shower and the vigour of the cold shock were only equalled by the unearthly yelling of the foe whose miraculous bounds and plunges formed a scene that is altogether indescribable  the crew of the steamer stood spellbound unable to fight even if there had been occasion for so doing  the darkskinned captain became indianred in the face from suppressed laughter  suddenly a tremor ran through the steamer as if she too were unable to restrain her feelings  during the fightif we may so call itthe engineers had been toiling might and main in the buried depths of their engineroom the broken parts of the engine had been repaired or refitted and a throb of life had returned to the machinery  in its first revolution the screw touched the stern of a pirateboat and turned it upside down  another boat at the bow was run over  the crews of both swam away like ducks with their long knives between their teeth the other boats hauled off  now captain cried robin wright who during the whole time had stood as if transfixed with a cutlass in one hand a pistol in the other and his mouth not to mention his eyes wide open now captain we shall get away without shedding a drop of blood  yes replied the captain but not without inflicting punishment port your helmhard a port  port it is sirhard over replied the man at the wheel and away went the steamer with a grand circular sweep which speedily brought her bowon close to the pirate vessel  steadyso said the captain at the same time signalling full steam to the engineroom  the space between the two vessels quickly decreased  the part of the pirate crew which had been left on board saw and understood  with a howl of consternation every man sprang into the sea  next moment their vessel was cut almost in two and sent fathoms down into the deep whence it rose a limp and miserable remnant flattened out upon the waves  now observed the captain with a pleasant nod well leave them to get home the best way they can  a boat voyage in such fine weather in these latitudes will do them good  saying which he resumed his course and steamed away into the regions of the far east    chapter thirteen  tells of a sudden and unlookedfor event  how often it has been said good for man that he does not know what lies before him  if he did we fear he would face his duty with very different feelings from those which usually animate him  certain it is that if robin wright and sam shipton had known what was before them when they stood one breezy afternoon on the ships deck casting glances of admiration up at the mountain waves of the southern seas or taking birdseye views of the valleys between themtheir eyes would not have glistened with such flashes of delight for the fair prospects they dreamed of were not destined to be realised  what these prospects were was made plain by their conversation  wont it be a splendid opportunity sam to become acquainted with all the outs and ins of telegraphy this laying of lines from island to island in the china seas  it will indeed robina sort of compound or alternating landandsubmarine line  at one time we shall be using palmtrees for posts and carrying wires through the habitations of parrots and monkeys at another we shall be laying them down among the sharks and coral groves  by the way said robin is it true that monkeys may prove to be more troublesome to us in these regions than sparrows and crows are at home  of course it is my boy  have you never heard that on some of our indian lines baboons vultures and other heavy creatures have sometimes almost broken down the telegraphs by taking exercise and roosting on the wires  indeed i hope it wont be so with us  at all events sharks wont be much tempted i should fancy by submarine cables  theres no saying robin  they are not particular when hungry  by the way i saw you talking with unusual earnestness this morning to jim slagg what was the matter with him  poor fellow youd scarcely believe it to look at him replied robin but the lad is actually homesick  homesick  why hows that  if we were only a few days out from port or even a week or two i could understand it but seeing that we are now drawing near to the china seas i should have thought  oh thats easily explained interrupted robin  this is his mothers birthday it seems a day that has always been kept with much rejoicing he tells me by his family and it has brought back home and homelife with unusual force to him  with all his rough offhandedness slagg is a tenderhearted affectionate fellow  somehow he has taken it into his head that this voyage will be disastrous and that he will never see his mother again  i had great difficulty in showing him the unreasonableness of such a belief  no doubt you had  it is unreasonable beliefs that people usually hold with greatest tenacity replied sam with a touch of sarcasm  but tell me have he and stumps never once quarrelled since leaving england  never  im amazedthey are so unlike in every way  you would not be surprised if you knew them as i do returned robin ever since slagg gave him that thrashing on board the great eastern in 1865 stumps has been a changed man  it saved him from himself and he has taken such a liking to slagg that nothing will part them  it was that made me plead so hard for stumps to be taken with us because i felt sure slagg would not go without him and although we might easily have done without stumps we could not have got on so well without slagg  im not so sure of that my boy  your opinion of him is too high though i admit him to be a firstrate youth  indeed if it were not so he should not be herewas that a sharks fin alongside  yes i think so  cook has been throwing scraps overboard i suppose see there goes an empty meattin  as he spoke the article named rose into the air and fell with a splash in the water  at the same time jim slagg was seen to clamber on the bulwarks and look over  come herelook alive stumps he shouted  stumps whose proper name it is but fair to state was john shanks clambered clumsily to his friends side just in time to see a shark open its horrid jaws and swallow the meattin  well now i never exclaimed slagg  he didnt even smell it to see if it was to his taste  praps hes swallowed so many before suggested stumps that he takes for granted its all right  well its ony flavour and he has caught a tartar this time returned the other unless maybe tin acts like piecrust does on human vitals  the low deep voice of the captain was heard at this moment ordering a reef to be taken in the topsails and then it began to strike robin and sam that the breeze was freshening into something like a gale and that there were some ominouslooking clouds rising on the windward horizon gazing at this cloudbank for a few minutes the captain turned and ordered the topsails to be closereefed and most of the other sails either furled or reduced to their smallest size  he was in good time and the vessel was ready for the gale when it rushed down on them hissing like a stormfiend  the good ship bent before the blast like a willow but rose again and under the influence of able seamanship went bravely on her course spurning the billows from her swelling bows  what a thing it is to know that there is a good hand at the helm in times of danger remarked sam as he and our hero stood under the shelter of the starboard bulwarks holding on with both hands to the rigging while the rushing waves tossed them on high or let them drop in the troughs of the seas i should feel safe with our captain in any circumstances  so should i said robin with enthusiasm his eyes glistening with delight as he gazed on the angry ocean  there was no thought of danger in the mind of any one at that moment  a good ship ably commanded well manned and with plenty of searoom what more could be desired  nevertheless deadly peril was close at hand  that marvellous little creaturewhich in the southern seas builds its little cell works its little day and dies leaving to succeeding generations of its kind to build their little cells and die each using its predecessors mansion as a foundation for its own until pile on pile forms a mass and mass on mass makes a mountainthe coral insect had reared one of its submarine edifices just where the cableship triton had to pass that day  for ages man had traversed that sea without passing exactly over that mountain and even if he had it would not have mattered for the mountain had been always many fathoms below the surface  but now the decree had gone forth  the conjunction of events predestined had come about  the distance between the mountain summit and the ocean surface had been reduced to feet  the triton rose on the top of a mighty billow as she reached the fated spot  the coral peak rose near the bottom of the waterhollow beyond and down on it the doomed ship went with an awful crash  her speed was checked only an instant for the top of the rock was knocked off by the force of the blow and the ship passed swiftly on but there could be no mistaking the significance of that shock  an involuntary shout of alarm from somea gasp halt of surprise half of horror from othersthen a rush of active effort when the captain gave orders to man the pumps  there was urgent need for haste  the mass of coral rock had stuck in the hole it had made else had they gone down in a few minutes  as it was the water rushed in furiously so much so that the captain detailed a party of men to construct a raft while the rest relieved each other at the pumps  no doubt he was partly urged to this course by the consideration that a vessel weighted with telegraphcables and other heavy material connected therewith could not float long in a leaky condition  keep close to me robin we must sink or swim together  it was sam who spoke  he was very pale but his firmlycompressed lips showed no sign of unmanly fear  robin on the contrary taken by surprise and too inexperienced to correctly estimate sudden danger was flushed with the feeling that now was the time to do and dare whatever should be required of him  they went to the pumps together where stumps and slagg were already at work with many others  it is surprising how fast and hard men will toil when life depends on the result  there was a catlike activity about the carpenter and his mates as they cut sawed lashed and bolted together the various spars and planks which formed the raft  in a marvellously short space of time it was ready and launched over the side and towed astern by the strongest cable on board for the danger of parting from it in such weather was very great  knowing this they had lashed some casks of pork and other provisions to it before launching  still they laboured with unflagging resolution at the pumps for many of those on board were picked men whose sense of honour urged them to strive to the uttermost to save the ship for it was no ordinary merchantman freighted with an ordinary cargo which could easily be replaced as well as insured but a vessel freighted with those magic wires which couple continents and unite humanity whose loss might delay though it could not ultimately arrest the benign and rapid intercourse of man with man in all parts of the globe  keep your eye on sam and me whispered robin to jim slagg finding himself alongside that worthy during a spell of rest  let us keep together whatever happens  robin did not quite believe that anything serious was going to happen some spirits find it as difficult to believe in impending disaster as others find it to believe in continued safety  it seemed so impossible to robin in his inexperience that the strong and still buoyant vessel which had borne them so long and bravely should sink  nevertheless like the rest he laboured with a will  slagg took the opportunity to give a similar caution to his friend stumps  shes sinking sir said the carpenter who had been sounding the well to the captain about an hour later  i know it stand by to have the raft hauled alongside  knock off now lads theres no use in pumping any more  the men ceased with a deep sigh and by that act the deathwarrant of the cableship was signed  during the next quarter of an hour the crew were busy slipping down the cable that held the raft  a few ran below to fetch small articles that they valued but by that time the vessel was so low in the water that there was little time to spare and the captain began to urge haste  now then lads over the side with you he said chancing to look at sam shipton as he spoke  that spirit of heroism which induces men to resolve to be the last to quit a sinking ship came over sam just then and he shrank back  he and his chief were in charge of the telegraph apparatus  it would be disgraceful to quit until all on board had left  he laid his hand on the strong cable that held the raft and said ill stay to the last sir and cast off the rope if youll allow me  we dont cast off ropes in such circumstances replied the captain we cut em  sam was silenced but not the less resolved to hold to his point if possible  he still held back while the captain being busy with the others some of whom were rather too eager to go paid no further attention to him  robin slagg and stumps recognising sam as their leader fell behind him and kept close  at last all were on the raft except the captain and the four friends  now then come along said the former somewhat impatiently  after you sir said sam with a polite bow  overboard sir shouted the captain in a voice that would brook no denial and sam at once stepped on the bulwark for he was not naturally rebellious  just as he spoke the rope broke and the raft fell astern  jump jump its your only chance cried the captain at the same moment springing into the sea  sam was on the point of following when an exclamation from slagg checked him  looking quickly back he saw that robin was not there  our hero while modestly standing behind his comrades had suddenly remembered that the small bible given him by his mother was lying on the shelf at the side of his berth  he would have lost anything rather than that  there was yet time to fetch it so without a word he turned and sprang below supposing that he had ample time  robin  robin shouted sam and slagg together at the top of their voices  coming coming reached them faintly from below but robin did not come  the hasty summons induced him to leap over a chest in returning he struck his head violently against a beam and fell back stunned  with another wild shout his friends rushed down the companionhatch to hasten his movements by force  they found him almost insensible lifting him quickly they carried him on deck and bore him to the stern of the vessel  robin  robin cried sam in an agony of impatiencefor the raft was by that time far astern besides which the shades of evening were beginning to descenddo try to rally  we must swim  were almost too late  can you do it  yes yes i can swim like a duck cried robin rising and staggering towards the bulwarks  but i cant swim at all cried stumps in a voice of horror  sam stopped as if suddenly paralysed  then laying hold of robin held him back  he felt as he looked at the dark heaving sea and the now distant raft that it was not possible for him and slagg to save both their injured and their helpless comrade  too late he said in a voice of despair as he sat down and for a moment covered his face with his hands  slagg looked at him with a bewildered rather than a despairing expression  so well have to sink together since we cant swim together he said at last with a touch of reckless vexation as he gazed at the naturally stupid and by that time imbecile face of his friend stumps  come only cowards give way to despair cried sam starting up  we have one chance yet god be praised but lets work with a will boys for the time is short    chapter fourteen  the raft  sam shiptons one chance did not seem a bright one but with characteristic energy he proceeded to avail himself of it at once  when the raft was launched over the side as described the carpenters had embarked upon it with the rest of the ships crew dropping their tools on the deck beside the mass of unused material of ropes spars planks etcetera as they left  four of the spars were pretty equal in length  sam selected them hastily and laid them on the deck in the form of a square or oblong frame  then he seized an axe  unravel some of the ropes robin he cried  you two select some planks as near ten feet long as possible  quickask no questions but do what i tell you  sam shipton was one of those who hold the opinion that every man born into the world whether gentle or simple should learn a trade  he had acted on his belief and taught himself that of a carpenter so that he wielded the axe with skill and gave his orders with the precision of one who knows what he is about  his comrades although not trained to any special trade were active handy fellows with the exception indeed of john shanks whose fingers were usually described as thumbs and whose general movements were clumsy but stumps had a redeeming quality to set against defectshe was willing  with a few powerful welldirected blows sam cut four deep notches into the two longest of the selected spars near their ends at equal distances from each other  into these he laid the ends of the two shorter spars thus forming a framework  twelve feet by ten not a bad raft he muttered as if to himself while he snatched a rope from the bundle of those disentangled by robin take a rope of same size you two and lash the opposite corners as you see me doing  stumps will go on selecting the planks  sam jerked out his words with as much rapidity and force as he applied to the labour of his hands  there was something quite tremendous in his energy and little wonderfor as he glanced now and then along the deck he saw that the ship was rapidly settling down to her final dive and that the closing scene would be sudden  powerfully impressed by his example the others worked in total silence and with all their might for sams conduct far more than the appearance of things convinced them of their danger  the planks now stumps  drive in as many of these clamps as you can find slaggso he set the exampleweve no time to bore holes for bolts  a plank now thats it  hand some nailsno the biggest nails and the big hammer  mind your fingers  down came the heavy hammer on a fourinch nail which went half through the thick plank  two more such blows and the iron head was buried in the wood  six planks sufficed to cover the frame  they were laid lengthwise with nails just sufficient to hold them  a piece of thick rope passed four times round the entire fabric still further secured them in position  tie a lot of these nails in a bit of sailcloth slagg and fix em to the raftto one of the spars not the planks  do the same with a saw hammer axe and cask of biscuitwater too dont forget water  make a belt of a bit of rope robin and stick that small axe in it  have it handy  while he spoke sam did not look up but gave all his attention to the tightening with a handspike of the knot on the thick rope that bound the raft together for we may as well inform those who dont know it that the tying of a knot on a cable is not managed in the same way or with the same ease that a similar operation is performed on a piece of twine  but how shall we lift it over the side asked stumps becoming suddenly alive to a difficulty  help me to haul on this rope and you shall see said sam  he ran to the side lifted a coil of rope off its belayingpin threw it on the deck cut the rope clear and hauled it to the raft to one end of which he made it fast  it was the strong rope by means of which one of the mizzen yards was braced and was rove through a block attached to the outward end of the yard  hoist away nowwith a will  hold on cried slagg stuffing a mass of sailcloth violently by means of a handspike underneath the binding rope of the raft  there nowyo ho heave hoo  up went the end of the little ark of safety and when one end was raised very little force was required to push it over  hold on hold on hold ooon yelled stumps straining to prevent the raft from leaving the ship  no nolet go let go let gooo roared sam  stumps did let go and almost fell from the combined effect of his efforts and despair as the raft swung off splashed into the sea far out of reach and hung half suspended from the yardarm  its all up with us gasped stumps  not yet but it will be all up with us in two minutes returned sam unable to repress a smile even at that moment  what dye mean said stumps in amazement  how can we ever git at it now  why stoopid said slagg dont you see that weve only to go up the mast out on the yardarm and slip down the rope  while he was speaking robin by sams orders was performing the feat referred to  look sharp he cried turning to the others  a heavy lurch of the ship caused their breasts to leap almost as fast as their bodies for they were all more or less aware of the danger of the ship sinking before they could get clear of her  the darkness too was as we have said increasing by that time though it was still light enough to enable them to see what they were about  in a few minutes they all had gained the end of the yardarm slipped down the rope and got upon the raft but it was difficult to hold on because at each heave of the ship the foreend of the raft was raised quite out of the sea and then let fall with considerable violence  as soon as sam reached it he bade robin cut adrift with his axe so great was the heave but at the moment the raft hung almost perpendicularly in the air and robin could do nothing but cling to the rope that bound it next instant it again fell flat on the sea  nowcut cried sam  the rope was severed with one blow almost at the same instant the stern of the triton flew up with a degree of violence that no wave could account for  it was her last fling  instantly after she went down head foremost  the masts by good fortune leaned away from the raft at the time else they would have been struck by the yards or involved in the rigging  as it was they did not escape  the vast whirlpool caused by the sinking ship drew them in with irresistible power  for one moment the horrified youths saw a dark green vortex towards which they rushed another moment and they beheld a green funnel whirling round them as they sank into midnight darkness while an ocean of roaring water filled their ears  who shall attempt to describe the feelings or sensations of that moment  the one absorbing idea of selfpreservation was of course dominant coupled with an intolerable feeling that the upper air could never be regained  it was reached however by all of them  first by sam shipton who shot waisthigh above the sea with a loud gasp and struck out wildly  then recovering presence of mind he swam more gently and looked eagerly round  he was immediately followed by robin and slagg  last of all by stumps who came up legs foremost and on turning other end up saluted them with a roar that would not have shamed a monster of the deep  but the roar was cut short by a gurgle as in his frantic struggles he sank himself again  observing this and seeing that the others were comparatively selfpossessed sam made towards his drowning comrade  the poor fellow catching sight of him as he came near made a clutch at him but sam was well aware of the danger of being grasped by a drowning man  he swerved aside and stumps sank with a gurgle of despair  twice again did he rise and sink  once more he rose  with a rapid stroke sam swam behind him and caught him under the armpits  violently did the poor fellow strive to turn round and clasp his preserver but sam treading water held him easily at armslength with his head just above the surface as long as he struggled nothing more could be done for him sam therefore put his mouth as near to his ear as possible and shouted  stop strugglingelse ill let you go  it was probably as much the tone of sams voice as the sense of these words that calmed stumps  at all events he instantly lay or rather hung perfectly limp and still  now continued sam you are quite safe if you do what i tell you  if you dont youre a dead man  dyou understand  yes gasped stumps  let your hands and arms lie flat on the water  dont try to raise your head farther than i let you  keep your feet still  let yourself hang helpless while i hold you and look round for the raft  it was obvious that stumps had regained selfcommand for as each of these orders was shouted in his ear in the tones of a sergeantmajor he obeyed with eager almost ludicrous promptitude  the raft is here close at hand said a voice close to sams ear  it was robin who had discovered him at that moment  is slagg safe asked sam  here he is all right said the worthy referred to puffing and choking as he swam up  keep offdont get in front of him said sam in a warning voice he maynt have recovered selfrestraint enough yet to refrain from grasping you  guide me to the raft robin while i swim on my back and see that you dont let it hit me on the head when i come close  you and slagg help each other on and then help me with stumps  nothing could have calmed stumps more than the cool firm way in which these orders were given so that he allowed himself to lie like a log while his deliverer drew him gently backwards until the back of his head rested on his bosom  sam then struck out gently with his legs robin turned him with a push in the right direction and thus swimming on his back he reached the raft  slagg and robin having already helped each other upon it grasped his hair  at once he freed one hand and caught the rope that bound the raft  stumps naturally slewed round so that his mouth and nose went for a moment under water  fancying that he was forsaken he caught sam round the neck drew himself up and gave a terrific yell  ha you may choke me now if you can muttered sam as he grasped the rope with both hands only the longer you hold on to me the longer you will be of getting out of the water  the terrified lad still retained sufficient sense to appreciate the force of the remark  looking up as well as he could through his dishevelled hair he held out one hand to slagg who grasped it firmly releasing sam with some hesitation he made a convulsive grasp at robin with the other hand  robin met him halfway  a loud heave ho and a mighty pull brought him out of the sea and sent him with a squash on the boards of the raft where he lay gripping the ropes with his hands as with a vice  before his rescuers could turn to aid sam he stood panting beside them  thank god said sam for this deliverance  amen was the earnest and prompt response from the others  yet it seemed but a temporary deliverance for when these castaways looked around them they saw nothing but a heaving ocean and a darkening sky with the tiny raft as the only visible solid speck in all the watery waste  compared however with the extremity of danger though which they had just passed the little platform on which they stood seemed to them an ample refugeso greatly do circumstances alter our estimate of facts  but they had not time to think much as may be easily understood for a great deal still remained to be done  their little ark was by no means secure  we have said that only enough of nails had been driven into it to hold the planks to the framework but not to withstand rough treatment  indeed during the plunge two of the planks had been torn off but the binding rope held them to their places as sam had foreseen  very little daylight now remained so that not a moment was to be lost  no sign of the big raft said sam stooping to unfasten the hammer and packet of nails after taking one quick anxious glance round the horizon  but it may be not faroff after all said slagg kneeling down to aid his comrade while stumps by that time recovered assisted robin to tighten the ropes that held the porkbarrel  with such poor light it ud be hard to make out a flat thing like that akickin in the hollows of the seas  but you forget returned sam that it must be akickin on the top o the sea as well as in the hollows  another nailthanks  however i dont expect to see it again  well now i expects to see it in the mornin not faroff said slagg is the watercask fast robin  all rightand the pork too  and the sail  just give it an extra shove under the ropes robin wed be badly off if we lost it  i dont see what good a sail can do us said stumps who had now quite recovered  not as a sail stumpy replied slagg whose spirit soon recovered elasticity though even in that way it may help us but as a blanket we shall appreciate it before long  slagg was right  after the planking had been secured and the rope refastened those unfortunates found themselves in an unenviable position  the gale had indeed abated somewhat though the heaving of the great waves was little less tremendous but the night had settled down into a state of pitchy darkness so that they could barely see each others faces while the seas continually washed over them obliging them to hold on to the ropes for fear of being washed away  in such circumstances sleep was out of the question yet they stood sorely in need of rest  now well see whats to be done wi the sail said slagg after they had been seated some time doing nothing  sleep i want an sleep ill have so lend a hand boys  he drew out the sail with some trouble so well had it been stuffed in and bade the others hold and prevent it from flapping while he fastened the corners down  he did not arrange it like a tent but spread it as flat as possible doubling the superfluous edges inward so that it presented little or no obstruction to the free passage of wind or water over them  this done they all crept underneath and found it to be a much snugger den than they had expected for the two casks prevented their heads from being pressed down when a few tons of water rolled over themas occasionally happened  still they did not dare to sleep until each had fastened a rope round his waist and bound himself to the flooring  having done so each laid himself alongside of a turn of the bindingcable and embracing that affectionately with both arms laid his head on the planks and shut his eyes  many and varied are the conditions under which healthy members of the human family seek and find repose but we venture to think that few conditions have ever been found which were more unfavourable to sleep than that which has just been described  nevertheless they were met promptly by slumber most profound as they lay wet and weary on the little raft that disastrous night on the dark and surging breast of the southern sea    chapter fifteen  life on the raft  to awake all at seain other words ignorant of ones localityis a rather common experience but to awaken both at and in the sea in a similar state of oblivion is not so common  it was the fortune of robin wright to do so on the first morning after the day of the wreck  at first when he opened his eyes he fancied from the sound of water in his ears that it must have come on to rain very heavily but being regardless of rain he tried to fall asleep again  then he felt as if there must be a leak in his berth somewhere he was so wet but being sleepy he shut his eyes and tried to shut his senses against moisture not succeeding he resolved to turn on his other side but experienced a strange resistance to that effort  waxing testy he wrenched himself round and in so doing kicked out somewhat impatiently  this of course woke him up to the real state of the case  it also awoke slagg who received the kick on his shins  he delivering a cry of pain straight into sam shiptons ear caused that youth to fling out his fist which fell on stumpss nose and thus in rapid succession were the sleepers roused effectually to a full sense of their condition  its cold remarked stumps with chattering teeth  you should be thankful that youre alive to feel the cold you ungrateful creetur said slagg  i am thankful jim returned the other humbly as he sought to undo the rope that held him fast but you know a feller can scarcely express thanks ororotherwise half asleep an his teeth goin like a pair o nutcrackers  the wind is evidently down remarked sam who had already undone his lashings  here robin help me to untie this corner of the sail  i had no idea that sleeping with ones side in a pool of water would make one so cold and stiff  if it had bin a pool mr shipton said slagg it wouldnt have made you cold cause why youd have made it warm  but it was the sea washin out and in fresh that kep the temperater lowdee see  what a cargo o rheumatiz weve been alayin in this night for old age said stumps ruefully as he rubbed his left shoulder  throwing off the sail sam stood up and looked round while an exclamation of surprise and pleasure broke from him  the contrast between the night and morning was more than usually striking  not only had darkness vanished and the wind gone down but there was a dead calm which had changed the sea into a sheet of undulating glass and the sun had just risen flooding the sky with rosy light and tipping the summit of each swell with gleaming gold  the gentle noiseless heaving of the long swell so far from breaking the rest of nature rather deepened it by suggesting the soft breathings of slumber  there were a few gulls floating each on its own image as if asleep and one great albatross soared slowly in the bright sky as if acting the part of sentinel over the resting sea  how glorious exclaimed robin as with flashing eyes he gazed round the scarce perceptible horizon  how hard to believe said sam in a low voice that we may have been brought here to die  but surely you do not think our case so desperate said robin  i hope it is not but it may be so  god forbid responded robin earnestly  as he spoke his arm pressed the little bible which he had rescued from the wreck  thrusting his hand into his bosom he drew it out  darling mother he said when she gave me this she told me to consult it daily but especially in times of trouble or danger  ill look into it now sam  he opened the book and selecting the verse that first met his eye read in all their affliction he was afflicted and the angel of his presence saved them in his love and in his pity he redeemed them and he bare them and carried them all the days of old  thats a grand word for us isnt itfrom isaiah said robin  well what do you make of it asked sam whose religious education had not been attended to as well as that of his friend  that our god is full of love and pity and sympathy so that we have nothing to fear said robin  but surely you cant regard that as a message to us when you know that you turned to it by mere chance said sam  i do regard it as a special message to us returned robin with decision  and what if you had turned up an entirely unsuitable or inapplicable verse said sam  then i should have concluded that god had no special message for us just now but left us to that general comfort and instruction contained throughout the whole word  when however special comfort is sought and found it seems to me ungrateful to refuse it  but i dont refuse it robin returned sam i merely doubt whether it is sent to us or not  why sam all the bible was sent to us for comfort and instruction  truetrue  i have not thought much on that subject robin but ill try to believe at present that you are right for we stand much in need of strong hope at all events  here we are none of us knows how far from the nearest land with little food and less water on a thing that the first stiff breeze may knock to pieces without shelter and without compass  without shelter and compass mr shipton said jim slagg who had hitherto listened in silence to the conversation why what dye call this  taking hold of the sail  aint that shelter enough and wont the sun guide us by day and the stars by night  it seems to me that you are too despondin mr shipton  dont mister me any more slagg  it was all very well aboard ship where we had our relative positions but now we are comrades in distress and must be on an equal footing  very good replied slagg looking round in his comrades faces and raising his voice as if making a speech  bein equal as you say i takes the liberty o callin a general meetin o this free andif i may be allowed the expressioneasy republic  moreover i move myself into the chair and second the motion which nobody objectin is carried unanimously  gentlemen the business of this here meetin is to appoint a commander to this here ship an what could be more in accordance with the rule o threenot to mention the rules o four and common sensethan a shipton takin command  whos goin to make the first reslootion  entering into the spirit of the thing robin moved that samuel shipton be appointed to command the ship and the party with the title of captain  and without pay suggested slagg  and i move said stumps who was just beginning to understand the joke though a little puzzled by the fact that it was done in earnest i move that robin wright be first leftenant  brayvo stumps cried slagg your intellec is growin  it ony remains to appoint you ships monkey and maidofallworkspecially dirty workand then with a hearty vote o thanks to myself for my conduct in the chair to vacate the same an dissolve the meetin  these matters having been satisfactorily settled the castaways proceeded to prepare breakfast and while this was being done the recently appointed captain looked once more anxiously round in the hope of seeing the large raft with their late shipmates on it but it was not to be seen  neither raft ship nor any other sign of man wos visible on all the glittering sea  breakfast was not a tempting meal  the biscuits were indeed as good as ships biscuits ever are and when moistened with sea water formed a comparatively pleasant as well as strengthening food but the barrel of pork was raw they had no means of cooking it and had not yet experienced those pangs of hunger which induce men to luxuriate in anything that will allay the craving  they therefore breakfasted chiefly on biscuit merely making an attempt with wry faces to swallow a little pork  observing this sam said in a halfjocular manner  now my lads it is quite clear to me that in taking command of this ship my first duty is to point out the evils that will flow from unrestrained appetite for biscuitalso to insist on the cultivation of a love for raw pork  you have no notion how good it is when fairly believed in  anyhow youll have to try for it wont do to eat up all the biscuit and have to feed at last on pure pork  i calls it impure pork said slagg howsever capting youve ony to give the word and we obey  praps the best wayll be to put us on allowance  this suggestion was at once acted on and a considerable part of that bright day was spent by sam and robin in calculating how much pork should go to a biscuit so that they should diminish in an equal ratio and how much of both it would be safe to allow to each man per diem seeing that they might be many days perhaps even weeks at sea  while the officers were thus engaged slagg and his friend stumps busied themselves in making a mast and yard out of one of the plankssplit in two for the purposeand fitting part of their sail to the same  evening found them with the work done a small sail hoisted on the rude mast the remaining part of the canvas fitted more securely as a covering and the apportioned meal before them  but the sail hung idly from its yard and flapped gently to and fro as the little ark rose and sank on the swell for the calm still prevailed and the gorgeous sunset with its golden clouds and bright blue sky was so faithfully reflected in the sea that they seemed to be floating in the centre of a crystal ball which had been dipped in the rainbow  when night descended the scene was if possible still more impressive for although the bright colours had vanished the castaways still floated in the centre of a dark crystal universe whose unutterable depths were radiant with stars of varied size and hue  long they sat and gazed in solemn admiration at the scene talking in subdued tones of past present and future until their eyes refused to do their office and the heavy lids began to droop  then reluctantly they crept beneath the sailcloth covering and lay down to rest  the planks were hard no doubt but our castaways were hardy besides a few folds of the superfluous portions of the large sail helped to soften the planks here and there  now boys said slagg as he settled himself with a longdrawn sigh the ony thing we wants to make us perfectly happy is a submarine telegraph cable tween this an england to let us say goodnight to our friend ashore an hope they wont be long in sending out to search for us  it is sad to be obliged to record that slaggs companions being already asleep this tremendous and original piece of pleasantry was literally cast upon the waters where it probably made no impression whatever on the inhabitants of the slumbering sea    chapter sixteen  in which will be found more surprises than one  events of the most singular description are often prefaced by incidents of the most commonplace character  who is so inexperienced in the vicissitudes of life as not to know this  early in the morning that succeeded their second night on the raft robin wright awoke with a very commonplace indeed a vulgar snore we might almost call it a snort  such as it was however it proved to be a most important link in the chain of events which it is our province to narrate  to explain it must be understood that john shanks or stumps among other eccentricities practised sprawling in his sleep spreading himself abroad in inconceivable attitudes shooting out an arm here or a leg there to the alarm or indignation of bedfellows insomuch that when known bedfellows refused to remain with him  aware of stumpss propensity slagg had so arranged that his friend should lie at the stern of the raft with two strands of the bindingcable between him and robin who lay next to him  during the first part of the night stumps either overcome by weariness or subdued by his friends discourses on the stellar world behaved pretty well only once did he fling out and bestow an unmerited blow on the porkbarrel  but about daybreak he began to sprawl gradually working his way to the extreme edge of the raft where a piece of wood nailed there on purpose prevented him from rolling off altogether  it did not however prevent his tossing one of his long legs over the edge which he accordingly did  the leg and foot were naked  he preferred to sleep so even when bedless having been brought up in shoeandstockingless society  with his foot dipping lightly in the wave he prolonged his repose  they were slipping quietly along at the time under the influence of a steady though gentle breeze which had sprung up and filled their sail soon after they lay down to rest  an early shark intent on picking up seaworms observed stumpss foot and licked his lips no doubt  he sank immediately for much the same reason that little boys retire to take a race before a leap  turning on his back according to custom he went at the foot like a submarine thunderbolt  now it was at that precise moment that robin wright snored as aforesaid  the snore awoke stumps who had another sprawl and drew up his leg gentlyoh how gently compared with what he would have done had he known what you know reader  nevertheless the action was in time else would he have had for the rest of his life a better title than heretofore to his nickname  as it was the nose and lips of the slimy monster struck the youths foot and slid up the side of his leg  hideous was the yell with which stumps received the salute  acrobatic was the tumble with which he rolled over his comrades and dire was the alarm created in all their hearts as they bounced from under the respective corners of their covering and stood up aghast  you twopenny turnip said slagg why did you screech like  he stopped  there was no need to finish the question for the fin of the disappointed shark describing angry zigzags in the water close by furnished a sufficient answer  he has only grazed me said stumps feeling his leg anxiously  only grazed you rather say crazed you returned sam for a cry like that could only come from a madman  what were you doingwashing your feet in the sea  no not exactly replied stumps somewhat abashed but one of my legs got over the end of the raft somehow and was trailing in the water  hallo  i say look there sam said robin with sudden animation pointing to the horizon straight ahead of them is that the big raft or a ship  neither robin replied sam after a prolonged and earnest gaze it must be an island  what do you think slagg  the incident of the shark was almost totally forgotten in the excitement caused by this new discovery  for some time slagg and all the others gazed intently without uttering a word  then slagg looked round with a deep sigh  yes its a island he said no doubt about that  what a blessing exclaimed robin with heartfelt emotion  well that depends said sam with a shake of the head  islands in the china seas are not always places of refugeat least for honest people  by no means added slagg ive heard say that the pirates there are about the wust set o cutthroats gointhough i dont myself believe theres much difference atween one set and another  the light wind which had carried the raft slowly over the sea while they were asleep now freshened into a stiff breeze and tested the qualities of their craft severely but with a little strengtheningan extra turn of a rope or an additional nailhere and there it held pretty well together  at breakfast which was served according to regulation they discussed their situation  you see said sam this may turn out to be a small barren island in which case we shall have to leave it and trust to falling in with some vessel or it may be inhabited by savages or pirates in which case we shall have to leave it from prudential motives if they will allow us to do so  in any case we wont begin by being extravagant with the provisions today  as they drew near to the island the probability of its being inhabited became greater because although solitary and according to sams amateur calculations far remote from other lands it presented a bold and fertile aspect  it was not indeed large in circumference but it rose to a considerable height and was covered with rich vegetation above which waved numerous groups of the cocoanut palm  a band of light yellow sand fringed the shore on which the waves roiled in a still lighter fringe of foam while two or three indentations seemed to indicate the existence of creeks or openings into the interior  with eager gaze the castaways watched this island as they slowly approached itthe minuter beauties of rock and dell and leafy copse brightening into view as the sun mounted the clear blue sky  what i have thought or dreamed of sometimes when dear mother used to speak of heaven murmured robin as if communing with himself  well i have not thought much of heaven said sam but i shouldnt wonder if its something like the paradise from which adam and eve were driven  theres no sign o natives as yet said slagg who regardless of these remarks had been gazing at the island with eyes shaded by his hand  yes there is yonder is one sitting on the rocks said stumps dont you see him move  thats not a native returned slagg its too long in the back for a human being  its a big monkeya gorilla maybe  did you ever hear tell of gorillas being in them regions  i rather think not said sam and to my mind it looks more like a rock than anything else  a rock it proved to be to the discomfiture of slagg and stumps but the rock was not without interest for it was soon seen that a rope was attached to it and that the rope stretching across the entrance to a creek was lost in the foliage on the side opposite to the rock  why i do believe said sam suddenly in an impressive whisper that there is a vessel of some sort at the other end of that rope behind the point partly hid by the trees  dont you see the top of her masts  after long and earnest gazing and much whispered conversationthough there was no occasion for caution at such a distance from the landthey came to the conclusion that a vessel lay concealed just within the mouth of the creek towards which the wind was driving them and that as they apparently had not been discovered by those who owned the vessel their wisest course would be to land if possible without attracting attention somewhat farther along the coast  but how is that to be done asked robin as we have neither oar nor rudder  nothing easier returned slagg seizing the axe and wrenching up the plank that had prevented stumps from finding a watery grave ive ony got to cut a handle at one end an weve got an oar at once  in a few minutes the handy youth converted the piece of plank into a rude oar with which he steered the raft so that it gradually drew to the southward of the creek where the strange vessel lay and finally took the land in another inlet not far distant  it was evident from the silence around that no one was stirring in the vessel and that their approach had not been perceived  congratulating themselves on this piece of good fortune they lowered their sail drew the raft under the bushes which in some parts of the inlet came close down to the sea and then hurried stealthily through a palmgrove towards the vessel  they reached the margin of the grove in a few minutes and there discovered that the stranger was apparently a chinese craft but whether a tradingvessel or smuggler or pirate they had no means of knowing  as they lay flat on their faces in the rank grass peeping through the luxuriant undergrowth they could see that two men paced the deck with musket on shoulder as if on guard but no other human beings were visible  shall we go forward and trust them as honest traders asked sam in a whisper  i think not replied slagg if alls true that one hears there is not much honesty afloat in them seas  my advice is to stay where we are and see what turns up  what think you robin  robin was of opinion that they should trust the strangers and go forward  stumps agreed with him but sam thought with slagg  their indecision however was cut short by a most startling occurrence  while they were yet whispering together the sound of voices was heard in the distance  our castaways at once sank flatter into the grass and became mute  in a few minutes the voices drew gradually nearer until they were quite close to the alarmed watchers  suddenly from among the bushes on the other side of an open space just in front of them there issued a band of men walking in single file  their appearance might have aroused grave anxiety in the most unsuspecting breast for besides possessing faces in which the effects of dissipation and evil passions were plainly stamped they were armedas the saying isto the teeth with short swords cavalry pistols and carbines  they were dressed in varied eastern costume and appeared to be of malay origin though some bore closer resemblance to the chinese  the man who marched in advanceevidently the leader of the bandwas unusually tall and powerful with a remarkably stern but not altogether forbidding countenance  pirates whispered slagg  looks like them but may be smugglers replied sam in the same cautious tone  even robins unsuspecting and inexperienced nature would not permit him to believe that they were honest traders  had any doubts on the subject lingered in their minds these would have been effectually cleared away by the scenes which immediately followed  while the pirates were still at some distance from the shore sudden shouts and yells came from the vessel which had up to that time been lying so peacefully at anchor and it was at once clear that a furious handtohand fight was taking place upon her deck  it must be the poor slaves who have risen whispered sam  the pirates had drawn their swords and pistols at the first sound of the fight and rushed to the rescue  they well knew that while they had been on shore the unfortunate captives chained in the vessels hold had succeeded in freeing themselves and were endeavouring to overcome the few men left to guard them  slaves captured at various times by the scoundrels who infest those seas are sometimes made to work at the oarswhich are much used during calm weatheruntil they die or become so worn out as to be useless when they are mercilessly thrown overboard  that the slaves referred to on this occasion animated probably by despair had effected their release and plucked up heart to assault the armed guard was a matter of some surprise to the pirates not so however to our adventurers when they saw foremost among the mutineers a man clad in the garb of a european sailor  thats the boy as has put em up to it said jim slagg in a suppressed but eager voice theyd never have had the pluck to do it of themselves  wed better go an help em said stumps whose usually stupid face was lighted up with excitement  right lad exclaimed slagg starting up but sam laid his hand firmly on his arm  too late he said dont you see that the guard have prevailed besides the pirate crew are in their boatsalmost at the vessel  see they swarm up the side  poor poor sailor said robin wright in a voice of the deepest pity  you may well say that no doubt he is killed by this time said slagg but nohe is fightin still  this was indeed true  some of the slaves rendered desperate no doubt were still maintaining the hopeless fight with handspikes and such arms as they had succeeded in wresting from the guard at the first onset and the stalwart figure of the european sailor was seen swaying aloft a clubbed musket and felling a pirate at every blow  animated by his example the other slaves fought with resolute bravery but when the rest of the pirate crew joined the guard and surrounded them they were instantly overpowered  then those who had not been already slain were led hastily to the side a sword was drawn across their throats or thrust through them and the bodies were tossed into the sea  among those led thus to the side was the brave sailor  although his features could not be distinguished at such a distance by those in ambush it could be clearly seen that he came boldly forward resolved no doubt to meet his fate like a man  oh god spare him burst in a voice of agony from robin who sprang up as if with the intention of rushing to the rescue regardless of consequences but a second time sam shiptons restraining hand was ready  what could we do with the sea between us and the ship  even if we were on the deck could we four deliver him from a hundred  robin sank down again with a groan but his fascinated eyes still gazed at the pirate vessel  to his great surprise the sailor at that moment uttered a long and ringing cheer  the act seemed to overawe even the bloodstained pirates for they hesitated an instant  then one of them pointed his sword at the sailors back but at the same moment the leader of the band was seen to strike up the sword and give some hurried directions  a rope was instantly brought with which the arms and legs of the seaman were secured and he was carried below  our prayer has been answered exclaimed robin with renewed excitement they are going to spare him  sam shook his head  i fear not robin at least if i may judge from what i have read of these villains they have only spared him for a time for the purpose of torturing him  robin shuddered  well i dont know he said whatever they may do god has answered our prayer for they have spared him and if god could deliver him thus at the last moment surely he can deliver him altogether  but was it not remarkable that he should give such a cheer whenas he must have thoughtat the point of death for it sounded more like a cheer of triumph than defiance  it was strange indeed  the effect of strong excitement i fancy  while they were conversing the pirates were busily engaged in getting up the anchor and hoisting the sails of their craft  at the same time the long oars or sweeps were manned by such of the slaves as remained alive and the vessel slowly glided out of the creek and put to sea fortunately the fight had engrossed the attention of those on board so much that they had failed to observe the little raft which although partially concealed by bushes might not otherwise have escaped detection  our voyagers were still congratulating themselves on their good fortune in this respect when the pirateship was observed to change her course turn completely round and return towards the land  theyve seen us ejaculated robin in consternation  our doom is fixed said sam in a tone of bitter despair  slagg and his friend were so much overwhelmed that they could not speak  on came the vesselunder oarsstraight for the creek where the raft lay  there could be no doubt now that they had been seen  while they gazed in blank dismay utterly unable to decide on any course of action an event occurred which totally altered the aspect of affairs  suddenly as if by magic the pirateship was converted into a great blackandwhite cloud from out of which there shot an indescribable mass of broken spars and wreckage which fell in all directions in a heavy shower into the sea  two seconds later and there came a roar as if a crash of the loudest thunder had rent the sky  the powdermagazine had been fired and the pirateship had been blown literally to atoms  when the last of the terrible shower had fallen nothing whatever of the vessel was to be seen save the floating morsels of the wreck  it was we might say a tremendous instance of almost absolute annihilation  recovering from the shock of horror and surprise sam shipton ran swiftly down to the spot where the raft lay followed by his companions  there may be some left alive he cried  quickshove her off yonders a pole robin fetch it  another minute and they were afloat  pushing with the pole sculling with the rude oar and paddling with a plank torn off they made for the scene of the explosion  i see something moving said stumps who having no implement to work with stood up in front and directed their course  soon they were in the midst of the debris  it was an awful sight for there mingled with riven spars and planks and cabin furniture and entangled in ravelled cordage lay the torn lifeless remains of the pirates  sharks were already swimming about in anticipation of a feast  did you not see symptoms of life somewhere asked sam as he stood beside stumps and looked earnestly round  yes i did but i dont nowo yes there it is again  give way slagg give way  there  the raft was soon alongside of the moving object  it was the body of the gallant sailor who had fought so well that day  his limbs were still fast bound excepting one arm with which now and then he struck out feebly as if trying to swim  lying on his back his mouth and nose were above water  gently gently boys said robin as they lifted the head out of the water and slowly drew the shoulders up now a good heave andthats it  the body slid heavily on the raft and the motion seemed to rouse the seamans spirit for he uttered a faint cheer while they knelt round him and tried in various ways to restore him to consciousness  hurrah for old england he cried presently in an imbecile manner making an abortive effort to lift his loose arm never say die slongs theresa shok in th lotter  well done old saltwater cried slagg unable to restrain a laugh youll live to fight yet or im mistaken  there was indeed some prospect that the poor fellow would recover for after a short time he was able to gaze at his rescuers with an intensity of surprise that betokened the return not only of consciousness but of reason  well well he said after gazing around for some time in silence as he lay with his head supported on the sail i spose its all right and ill wake up all square in the mornin but its out o sight the most comical dream ive had since i was a babby  i only hope itll take a pleasanter turn if its agoin to continue  with this philosophical reflection the sailor shut his eyes and disposed himself to sleep until the period of real waking should arrive  thinking this the best thing he could do in the circumstances his rescuers turned to examine whether any of the others had survived the explosion but finding that all were dead or had sunk they returned to the land  here after securing the raft they made a sort of litter with the sail spread on the oar and a plank on which they carried the sailor to the sheltered spot whence they had witnessed the fight  as the poor man had by that time fallen into a genuine slumberwhich appeared to be dreamlesshe was left under the care of stumps and slagg while sam and robin went off to ascertain whether or not the island was inhabited  we will go straight up to the highest point at once so as to get a birdseye view of it said sam  i cant help thinking that it must be inhabited for these scoundrels would not care to land i should fancy unless there was some one to rob  it may be so sam  but if they had come to rob dont you think they would not have returned to their ship without captives or booty  there is something in that robin  come we shall see    chapter seventeen  strange discoveries on pirate island  on reaching the first risingground that lay before them robin and his friend received a great disappointment for instead of a richly wooded country which the coast scenery where they landed had led them to expect they found an exceedingly barren region as far at least as the next ridge in advance  no use to go further said sam despondingly nothing but barren rocks and a few scrubby bushes here  evidently there are no inhabitants for it would be almost impossible to live on such a place  but it may be better further inland said robin  i cant think that the pirates would come here for nothing  at all events let us go to the next ridge  without replying sam followed robin but the next ridge revealed nothing more hopeful  indeed the prospect thence was if possible more depressing for it was seen that the island was small that its sides were so steep all round as far as the eye could reach that there was apparently no landingplace except at the spot where they had been driven on shore  the elevated interior seemed as barren as the circumference and no neighbouring island was to be seen in all the wide field of vision  the only living creatures visible were innumerable seabirds which circled round the cliffs and which on espying the intruders came clamouring overhead as if to order them angrily away  having come thus far we may as well go to the top and have a look all round said robin and seehere is something like a track worn on the rock  sams drooping spirits revived at once  he examined the track carefully and pronounced it a human track  the seagulls could not make it robin  goats sheep and cows cannot live without grass therefore it was not made by them  a track is not usually worn on hard rock by the passage of pirates only once or twice over them  there is mystery here robin  come on  it will be observed that robins spirit was more hopeful than that of his friend nevertheless sam being physically more energetic was when not depressed prone to take the lead  he walked smartly forward therefore followed humbly by his friend and they soon reached what proved to be the summit of the island  here supreme astonishment was the chief ingredient in their feelings for they stood on the edge of a slope at the foot of which as in a basin lay what seemed to be a small cultivated garden in the midst of a miniature valley covered with trees and shrubs through which a tiny rivulet ran  this verdant little gem was so hemmed in by hills that it could not be seen from the sea or any low part of the island  but what surprised the discoverers most was the sight of an old woman bent nearly double who was busily at work in the garden  not far from her was an old man who from his motions while at work appeared to be blind  their costume being nondescript besides ragged did not betoken their nationality  sam and robin glanced at each other in silence then turned to have another gaze at the scene  weve found said sam slowly and impressively a robbers nest  dyou think so sam  think so  im sure of it  just think  there is nothing on such an island as this to attract any one at allmuch less robbers or pirates except the fact that it is unattractive and apparently far removed from the haunts of honest men  depend upon it robin that the pirates whom we saw have made this their headquarters and place of deposit for their bootytheir bank as it were for its too small for their home besides if it were such we should see a colony of women and children nothis is the great pirate bank of the southern seas and yonder we behold the secretary and cashier  and what said robin with a laugh if there should be a few clerks in the bank  we might perhaps find them troublesome fellows to deal with  we might robin  would it not be wise to return and let slagg and stumps know what we have discovered and take counsel together before we act  agreed said robin  isnt it strange though he added as they turned to retrace their steps that there are no buildings of any kindonly a little garden  it is somewhat puzzling i confess but we shall  he stopped abruptly and stood rooted to the ground for there on a rock in front of him with her light graceful figure and flowing golden hair pictured against the blue sky stood a little girl apparently about six or seven years of agean angel as it seemed to the amazed youths  she had caught sight of the strangers at the very moment they had observed her and stood gazing at them with a half eager half terrified look in her large lustrous eyes  with a sudden and irresistible impulse robin extended his arms towards her  she made a little run towards him then stopped and the look of fear again came over her beautiful face  robin was afraid to advance lest he should frighten her  so with an earnest look and smile he said come here little one  she answered the invitation by bounding towards our hero and clasping him round the neck causing him to sit down rather abruptly on a rock which lay conveniently behind  oh  im so glad youve come at last said the child in english so good that there could be no question as to her nationality  i was quite sure mamma would send to fetch me away from this tiresome place but youve been so long of comingso very very long  the thought of this and perhaps the joy of being sent for at last caused her to sob and bury her face in robins sympathetic bosom  cheer up little one and dont cry said robin passing his hand over her sunny hair your father at all events has sent for you if not your mother  i have no father said the child looking up quickly  yes you have little one god is your father  did he send you to fetch me she asked in surprise  i have not the smallest doubt answered robin that he sent us to take care of you and take you to your mother if that be possible  but tell me little one what is your name  letta  and your surname  my what exclaimed letta opening her large eyes to their widest causing both sam and robin to laugh  your other name dear said sam  i have no other name  mamma always called me lettanothing else  and what was mammas name asked robin  it was mamma of course replied letta with a look of wonder that so silly a question should be asked  sam and robin exchanged looks and the former shook his head  youll not get much information out of her i fear  ask her about the pirates he whispered  letta said robin settling the child more comfortably on his kneean attention which she received with a sigh of deep contentmentare the people here kind to you  yes very kind  old meerta is as kind to me almost as mamma used to be but i dont love her so muchnot nearly so muchand blind bungo is a dear old man  thats nice  and the othersare they kind to you  what others  oh i suppose you mean the men who come and stay for a time and then go off again  o no  they are not kind  they are bad menvery naughty they often fight and i think call each other bad names but i dont understand their language very well  they never hurt me but they are very rough and i dont like them at all  they all went away this morning  i was so glad for they wont be back again for a good long while and meerta and bungo wont get any more hard knocks and whippings till they come back  ha they wont come back in a hurrynot these ones at least said sam in a voice that frightened letta inducing her to cling closer to robin  dont be afraid little one said the latter hes only angry with the bad men that went away this morning  are there any of them still remaining here  what in the caves  ay in the cavesor anywhere  no theyre all away  nobody left but me and meerta and blind bungo  is it a long time since you came here  o yes very very long replied the child with a sad weary look so long thatthat you cant think  come dear tell us all about it said robin in a coaxing toneall about mamma and how you came here  very well said letta quite pleased with the request  clearing her little throat with the emphasis of one who has a long story to tell she began with the statement that mamma was a darling  from this as a startingpoint she gave an amazing and rambling account of the joys and toys of infancy which period of life seemed to have been spent in a most beautiful garden full of delicious fruits and sunshine where the presiding and ever present angel was mamma  then she told of a dark night and a sudden awaking in the midst of flames and smoke and piercing cries when fierce men seized her and carried her away put her into a ship where she was dreadfully sick for a long long time until they landed on a rocky island and suddenly she found herself therepointing as she spoke to the little garden below them while she was yet describing her feelings on arrival a voice shouting letta was heard and she instantly struggled from robins knee  o let me go she cried  its meerta calling me and i never let her call twice  why  would she be angry  no but she would be sorry  do let me go  but wont you let us go too asked sam  o yes if you want to come  this is the road she added as she took robin by the hand and you must be very careful how you go else youll fall and hurt yourselves  great was the amazement and not slight the alarm of meerta when she beheld her little charge thus piloting two strangers down the hill  she spoke hurriedly to her blind companion and at first seemed disposed to hide herself but the man evidently dissuaded her from such a course and when letta ran forward seized her hard old hands and said that god had sent people to take her back to mamma she dismissed her fears and took to laughing immoderately  it soon became evident to our adventurers that the woman was in her dotage while the old man was so frail that only a few of the sands of life remained to run  they both understood a little english but spoke in such a remarkably broken manner that there was little prospect of much additional information being obtained from them  you hungryhungry asked the old woman with a sudden gleam of hospitality  comecomeme gif you for heat  she took robin by the hand and led him towards a cavern the mouth of which had not been visible higher up the mountain  sam followed led by letta  the interior of the cavern was lofty and the floor level  besides this it was sumptuously furnished in a fashion singularly out of keeping with the spot and its surroundings  pictures hung on the walls persian rugs lay on the floors  ottomans covered with silk and velvet were strewn about here and there among easychairs of various kinds some formed of wickerworkin the fantastic shapes peculiar to the eastothers of wood and cane having the ungainly and unreasonable shapes esteemed by western taste  silver lamps and drinkingcups and plates of the finest porcelain were also scattered about for there was no order in the cavern either as to its arrangement or the character of its decoration in the centre stood several large tables of polished wood on which were the remains of what must have been a substantial feastthe dishes being as varied as the furniturefrom the rice and egg messes of eastern origin to the preserved sardines of the west  ha ha laughed the weird old creature who ushered the astonished youths into this strange banqueting hall the rubbertsrubbersyou calls dem  robbers she means thats the naughty men explained letta who seemed to enjoy the old womans blunders in the english tongue  yis dats soroberts an pyritsha ha dems feed here dis mornin you feed dis afternoons  me keeps house for dem  dey tinks me alone wid bungo an letta ho ho but mes got cumpiny dis day  sit down an grub wat yous can  doo you good  doo letta and bungo good  doos all good  fire away  ha haa  keep yous nose out o dat pie bungo you brute  vous git sik eff you heat more  regardless of this admonition the poor old man broke off a huge mass of piecrust which he began to mouth with his toothless gums a quiet smile indicating at once his indifference to meerta and consequences while he mumbled something about its not being every day he got so good a chance  das true remarked the old woman with another hilarious laugh  dey go hoff awful quick dis day  while sam and robin sat down to enjoy a good dinner or rather breakfast of which they stood much in need letta explained in a disjointed rambling fashion that after a feed of this kind the naughty men usually had a fight after which they took a long sleep and then had the dishes cleaned up and the silver things locked away before taking their departure from the cave for a long long time by which no doubt she indicated the period spent on a pilfering expedition  but on this particular occasion she added while the naughty men were seated at the feast one of their number from their ship came hastily in and said something she could not tell what which caused them at once to leap up and rush out of the cave and they had not come back since  and theyre not likely to come back little one said robin through a mouthful of rice  ha haa laughed sam through a mouthful of piecrust  ho ho cried the old woman with a look of surprise yous bery brav boy i dessay but if dem roberts doos kum back you soon laugh on wrong side ob de mout for dey screw yous limbses off an ho skrunch yous teeth hout an roast you live so you better heat wat yous can an go hoffast as you couldnt  i say robin said sam unable to restrain a smile at the expression of lettas face as she listened to this catalogue of horrors that speech might have taken away our appetites did we not know that the roberts are all dead  dead exclaimed the old woman with a start and a gleam of serious intelligence such as had not before appeared on her wrinkled visage are de roberts all dead  all replied sam who thereupon gave the old pair a full account of what had been witnessed on the shore  strange to say the old man and woman were much depressed by the news although from what they afterwards related they had been very cruelly treated by the pirates by whom they had been enslaved for many years nay old meerta even dropped a tear or two quietly to their memory for as she remarked by way of explanation or excuse dey wasnt all so bad as each oder  however she soon recovered her composure and while sam shipton returned to the shore to fetch their comrades to the cave she told robin among other things that the pirates had brought letta to the island two years before along with a large quantity of booty but that she did not know where she came from or to whom she belonged  sam shipton resolved to give his comrades the full benefit of the surprise in store therefore on returning to them he merely said that he had left robin in a rather curious place in the interior where they had discovered both food and drink in abundance and that he had come to conduct them to it  by that time the seaman whom they had rescued had recovered considerably and was able to walk with assistance though still rather confused in his mind and disposed to be silent  at first he expressed a desire to be left to sleep where he was but on being told that the place they were going to was not faroff and that he would be able to rest longer and much more comfortably there than where he was he braced himself up and accompanied them leaning on sam and jim slagg as he staggered along  need it be said that both slagg and stumps shouted with surprise when they came suddenly in sight of the garden that they lost the power of utterance on beholding robin holding familiar converse with an old hag a blind man and a small angel and that they all but fell down on entering the pirates cave  no it need not be said let us pass therefore to the next scene in this amazing drama  of course robin had prepared the inhabitants of the garden for the arrival of his friends  he had also learned that the pirates in the hurry of departure had not only left everything lying about but had left the key of their treasurecave in the lock  old meerta offered to show him the contents but robin determined to await the arrival of his friends before examining the place  when slagg and stumps had breakfasted and the sailor had been laid on a comfortable couch where he immediately fell fast asleep robin pulled the key of the treasurecave out of his pocket and asked his comrades to follow him  wondering at the request they did so  the cave referred to lay at the inner extremity of the banqueting cavern and was guarded by a massive door of wood  opening this robin allowed the old woman to enter first and lead the way  she did so with one of her wild ho hos being obviously much excited at the opportunity of showing to the visitors the contents of a cavern which she had never before been permitted to enter save in the company of the pirates  entering the small doorway through which only a subdued light penetrated she went to a ledge or natural shelf of rock and took down a silver lamp of beautiful workmanship which had probably belonged to a church or temple  lighting it she ushered them through a natural archway into an inner cavern round the walls of which were heaped in piles merchandise and wealth of all kinds in great profusion and variety  there were bales of broadcloth and other fabrics from the looms of tuscany tweeds from the factories of scotland silks satins and velvets in great rolls mingled with lace linen and more delicate fabrics  close beside these piles but not mixed with them were boxes of cutlery and other hardware and further on chests of drawers containing spices from the east chests of tea and coffee barrels of sugar and groceries of all kinds  these things were not thrown together in confusion but arranged in systematic order as if under the management of an expert storekeeper and a desk with businessbooks on it seemed to indicate that a careful record was kept of the whole  among the miscellaneous merchandise stood several large and massive chests of ancient material and antique form  taking a bunch of small keys from a nail on the wall the old woman proceeded to open these and exhibit their contents with much of the interest and simple delight exhibited by a child in displaying her treasures to new companions  handing the silver lamp to robin who with his comrades looked on in silent surprise she opened the first chest  it was loaded to the lid with jewellery of all kinds which sparkled in the light with dazzling brilliancy for even to the inexperienced eyes of the observers many of the gems were obviously of the finest quality and almost priceless in value  there was no order in the arrangement of thesebracelets earrings watches etcetera of european manufacture lying side by side with the costly golden wreaths and tiaras of india and the more massive and gorgeous brooches noserings neckrings and anklets peculiar to semibarbaric lands  the next chest was filled with gold silver and bronze drinkingcups and goblets lamps vases and urns that had been gathered from the ships of many countries  then there were chests which contained little barrels full of gold and silver coin of every realm from the huge golden doubloon of spain to the little silver groschen of germany besides all this varied wealth there were piles of arms of all nationsrichly chased scimitars of eastern manufacture the clumsy cutlasses of england long silverhandled pistols of oriental form bluff little bulldog revolvers cavalry sabres breechloading rifles flintlock muskets shields spears bows and arrowsin short a miscellaneous armoury much too extensive to be described  it was interesting to observe the monkeylike countenance of old meerta as she watched the effect produced on her visitors her little black eyes sparkling in the lamplight more brightly than the finest gems there and not less interesting was it to note the halfamused more than halfamazed and partially imbecile gaze of the still silent visitors  little letta enjoyed their looks quite as much as meerta  havent we got lots of pretty things here she said looking up into robins face  yes little onewonderful  robin revived sufficiently to make this reply and to glance at sam slagg and stumps who returned the glance  then he relapsed  snatching the lamp from his hand old meerta now led the party to a remote corner of the cave where a number of large casks were ranged at one end and covered with a sheet of leather  ha ha laughed their wild guide in a sort of screech here be de grandest jools de finest dimunds of all what buys all de rest  she lifted a corner of the skin removed the loose head of a cask and holding the lamp close over the opening bade them look in  they did so and the effect was powerful as well as instantaneous for there only a few inches below the flaring light lay an open barrel of gunpowder  the senses of sam shipton returned like a flash of lightninginterest surprise admiration vanished like smoke as he uttered a shout and with one hand seizing the wrist of the withered arm that held the lamp with the other he hastily drew the leathern cover over the exposed powder and held it down  you old curmudgeon he cried here robin take the lamp from her and away with it into the outer cave  our hero promptly obeyed while the other two under an instinct of selfpreservation had already fled in the same direction followed by a shrill and halffiendish laugh from the old woman  well i never had such a narrow escape said sam as he issued from the cave still holding meerta firmly though not roughly by the wrist  why theres enough powder there i do believe said jim slagg to split the whole island in two  there its all safe now said sam as he locked the heavy door and thrust the key in his pocket and i will take care of your treasures for you in future old lady  wass you frighted asked the old woman with a low laugh in which even letta joined  frighted you reckless old thing replied sam seizing a tankard of water and draining it of course i was if a spark had gone down into that cask you would have been considerably frighted too  im not so sure of that said stumps she wouldnt have had time to get a fright  o no said meerta is niver frighted  many time me stan by dat keg tinkin tinkin tinkin if me stuff de light in it and blow de pyrits vid all dere tings to warsl smash but nome tinks dat some of dem wasnt all so bad as each oder  this thought seemed to have the effect of quieting the roused spirit of the poor old woman for thereafter a softened expression overspread her wrinkled face as she went silently about clearing away the debris of the recent feast    chapter eighteen  the pirates islandcontinued  next morning sam shipton awoke from a sound and dreamless slumber raising himself on the soft ottoman or eastern couch on which he had spent the night he looked round in a state of sleepy wonder unable at first to remember where he was  gradually he recalled the circumstances and events of the preceding day  the forms of his companions lay on couches similar to his own in attitudes of repose and the seaman still slept profoundly in the position in which he had been laid down when brought in  through the mouth of the cavern sam could see the little garden glowing like an emerald in the beams of the rising sun and amongst the bushes he observed the old couple stooping quietly over their labour of gathering weeds  the warm air the bright sunshine and the soft cries of distant seabirds induced sam to slip into such of his garments as he had put off and go out quietly without rousing his companions  in a few minutes he stood on the summit of the islet and saw the wide ocean surrounding him like a vast sparkling plain its myriad wavelets reflecting now the dazzling sun now the azure vault the commingling yellow and blue of which resulted in a lovely transparent green save where a few puffs of wind swept over the great expanse and streaked it with lines of darkest blue  truly murmured sam as he gazed in admiration at the glorious expanse of sea and sky robin is right when he says that we are not half sufficiently impressed with the goodness of the almighty in placing us in the midst of such a splendid world with capacity to appreciate and enjoy it to the full  i begin to fear that i am a more ungrateful fellow than ive been used to think  for some time he continued to gaze in silence as if that thought were working  from his elevated position he could now see that the islet was not quite so barren as at first he had been led to suppose  several little valleys and cuplike hollows lay nestling among the otherwise barren hills like lovely gems in a rough setting  those he now perceived must have been invisible from the sea and the rugged almost perpendicular cliffs in their neighbourhood had apparently prevented men from landing and discovering their existence  one of the valleys in particular was not only larger than the others but exceptionally rich in vegetation besides having a miniature lake like a diamond in its bosom  descending the hill and returning to the cave sam found his comrades still asleep  letta was assisting old meerta in the preparation of a substantial breakfast that would not have done discredit to a firstclass hotel  oh im so glad youve come said letta running up to him and giving him both hands to shake and a ready little mouth to kiss for i didnt like to awaken your friends and the sailor one looks so still that i fear he may be dying  i saw one of the naughty men die here and he looked just like that  somewhat alarmed by this sam went at once to the sailor and looked earnestly at him  no fear letta he said the poor fellow is not dying he is only in a very profound sleep having been much exhausted and nearly killed yesterday  hallo robin awake at last  robin who had been roused by the voices rubbed his eyes yawned vociferously and looked vacantly round  well now thats most extraordinary it isnt a dream after all  its an uncommon pleasant dream if it is one remarked jim slagg with a grave stare at robin as he sat up on his couch  i never in all my born days dreamt such a sweet smell of coffee and fried sausages why the old oomans abringin of em in i do declare  pinch me stumps to see if im awake  as stumps was still asleep slagg himself resorted to the method referred to and roused his comrade  in a few minutes they were all seated at breakfast with the exception of the sailor whom it was thought best to leave to his repose until nature should whisper in his ear  well now said slagg pausing to rest for a few seconds if we had a submarine cable tween this and england and we was to give em an account of all weve seen an bin doin theyd never believe it  cernly not  theyd say it wos all a passel o lies remarked stumps but i say mr sam  come now stumps dont mister me any more  well i wont do it any more though taint easy to change ones abits  but how is it sir that that there electricity works  thats what i wants to know  does the words run along the cableor ow  of course they do stumpy interrupted slagg they run along the cable like a lot o little tightrope dancers an when they come to the end ot they jumps off an ranges temselves in a row  sometimes in coorse they spells wrong like bad schoolboys and then theyve to be walloped an set right  hold your noise slagg an let your betters speak returned stumps  well if they dont exactly do that said sam shipton there are people who think they can do things even more difficult  i remember once when i was clerk at a country railroad station and had to work the telegraph an old woman came into the ticket office in a state of wild despair  she was about the size and shape of meerta there but with about an inch and a half more nose and two or three ounces less brain  whats wrong madam  i asked feeling quite sorry for the poor old thing  oh sir said she clasping her hands ive bin an left my passela brown paper one it wason the seat at the last station an there was a babbys muffler in itthe sweetest thing as ever wasan ffi pun tten ony one shshillin was bbadboohoo  she broke down entirely at this point so said i madam make your mind quite easy sit down and ill telegraph at once so i telegraphed and got a reply back immediately that the parcel had been found all right and would be sent on as soon as possible  i told this to the old lady who seemed quite pleased and went on to the platform to wait  i was pretty busy for the next quarter of an hour for it was market day at the next town but i noticed through the window that the old lady was standing on the platform gazing steadily up at the sky  broxleythird class said a big farmer at that moment with a head like one of his own turnips  i gave him his ticket and for five minutes more i was kept pretty busy when up came the train in got the struggling crowd whew went the whistle and away went the whole affair leaving no one on the platform but the porter and the old woman still staring up at the sky  whats the matter madam  i asked  matter she exclaimed a pretty telegraph yours is to be sure wuss than the old carrier by a long way  here ave i bin standin for full alfanhour with my neck nigh broke and theres no sign of it yet  no sign of what madam  of my brown paper passel to be sure  didnt you tell me young man that they said theyd send it by telegraph as soon as possible  no madam i replied i told you they had telegraphed to say they would send it on as soon as possiblemeaning of course by rail for we have not yet discovered the method of sending parcels by telegraph though no doubt we shall in course of time  if youll give me your address ill send the parcel to you  thank you young man  do she said giving me an old envelope with her name on it  be sure you do  i dont mind the money much but i couldnt abear to lose that muffler  it was such a sweet thing turned up with yaller and a present too which it isnt many of em comes my way  so you see stumps some people have queer notions about the powers of the telegraph  but did the old lady get the parcel all right asked stumps who was a sympathetic soul  of course she did and came over to the station next day to thank me and offer me the bad shilling by way of reward  of course i declined it with many expressions of gratitude  while they were thus adding intellectual sauce to the material feast of breakfast the rescued sailor awoke from his prolonged sleep and stretched himself  he was a huge thickset man with a benign expression of countenance but that phase of his character was somewhat concealed at the time by two black eyes a swollen nose a cut lip and a torn cheek  poor fellow he had suffered severely at the hands of the pirates and suddenly checked the stretch in which he was indulging with a sharp groan or growl as he sat up and pressed his hand to his side  why whats the matter with me an where am i he exclaimed gazing round the cave while a look of wonder gradually displaced the expression of pain  youre all rightrescued from the pirates at all events answered sam shipton rising from table and sitting down beside the seamans couch  thank god for that said the man earnestly though with a troubled look but how did i escapewhere are the rascalswhat  there now dont excite yourself my man youre not quite yourself in body  come let me feel your pulse  ah slightly feverishno wonder ill tell you all about it soon but at present you must be content merely to know that you are safe in the hands of friends that you are in the pirates cave and that the pirates and their vessel are now at the bottom of the sea  thats hardly crect mr shipton murmured slagg i would have said they was blowd to hatoms  the seaman turned and looked at the speaker with what would have been a twinkle if his swelled visage would have permitted but the effort produced another spasm of pain  i must examine you friend said sam you have been severely handled help me to strip him robin  the poor man at once submitted  youre a doctor sir i suppose he asked  no said sam only an amateur nevertheless i know what im about you see i think that every man in the world whatever his station or profession should be at least slightly acquainted with every subject under the sun in connection with which he may be called on to act  in other words he should know at least a little about surgery and physic and law and carpentering blacksmithing building cooking riding swimming andhallo why two of your ribs are broken my man  sorry to hear it sir but not surprised for i feels as if two or three o my spines was broken also and five or six o my lungs busted you wont be able to mend em i fear  oh yes i shall said sam cheerily  ah thats well  id thowt that praps you wouldnt have the tools andy in these parts for splicin of em  fortunately no tools are required returned sam  ill soon put you right but youll have to lie still for some time  here robin go into the storecave and fetch me a few yards of that white cotton you remember near the door  and i say mind you keep well clear of the powder  when the cotton was brought sam tore it up into long strips which he wound somewhat tightly round the sailors huge chest  you see he observed as he applied the bandages broken ribs are not necessarily displaced but the action of breathing separates the ends of them continually so that they cant get a chance of reuniting  all we have to do therefore is to prevent your taking a full breath and this is accomplished by tying you up tightso  now you cant breathe fully even if you would and id recommend you not to try  by the waywhats your name  johnson sirjohn johnson  well johnson ill give you something to eat and drink now after which youll have another sleep  tomorrow well have a chat on things in general  i say asked robin that night as he and sam stood stargazing together beside a small fire which had been kindled outside the cavernmouth for cooking purposes is it true that you have studied all the subjects you mentioned to johnson this morning  quite true  i have not indeed studied them long or profoundly but i have acquired sufficient knowledge of each to enable me to take intelligent action as i did this morning instead of standing helplessly by or what might be worse making a blind attempt to do something on the chance that it might be the right thing as once happened to myself when a bungling ignoramus gave me a glass of brandy to cure what he called mulligrumps but what in truth turned out to be inflammation  but what think you of the saying that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing sam  i think that like most of the worlds maxims it is only partially or relatively true  if little knowledge claims the position and attempts to act the part of great knowledge it becomes dangerous indeed but if little knowledge walks modestly and only takes action when none but ignorance stands by it is in my opinion neither dangerous nor liable to be destructive  while they were speaking little letta came out of the cavern and ran towards them  it is like a dream of the arabian nights to meet such a little angel here murmured robin what a dreadful blow the loss of her must have been to her poor mother  o come to johnson please she said taking sam by the hand with a very trustful look and manner  why hes not worse is he  o no he has just awakened and says he is very much better and so peckish  what does he mean by that  peckish my dear is hungry explained robin as they went into the cave together  they found that johnson was not only peckish but curious and thirsting for information as well as meat and drink  as his pulse was pronounced by dr shipton to be all right he was gratified with a hearty supper a long pull at the tankard of sparkling water and a good deal of information and smalltalk about the pirates the wreck of the triton and the science of electricity  but you have not told us yet said sam how it was that you came to fail into the hands of the pirates  i can soon tell ee that said the seaman turning slowly on his couch  lie still now you must not move said sam remonstratively  but that not movin doctor is wuss than downright pain by a long way  howsever i spose i must obey ordersanyhow youve got the whip hand o me just now  well as i was sayin the yarn aint a long un i sailed from the port o lunon in a teaclipper of which i was the cook got out to hongkong all right shipped a cargo and off again for old england  we hadnt got far when a most horrible gale blew us far out of our course  when it fell calm soon arter we was boarded by a pirate  our captain fought like a hero but it warnt of no use  they was too many for us most of my shipmates was killed and i was knocked flat on the deck from behind with a handspike  on recoverin i found myself in the ships hold bound hand and futt among a lot of unfortunits like myself most of em bein chinese and malays  the reptiles untied my hands and set me to an oar  they thrashed us all unmercifully to make us work hard and killed the weak ones to be rid of em  at last we came to an anchor as i knew by the rattlin o the cables though bein below i couldnt see where we was  then i heard the boats got out an all the crew went ashore as i guessed except the guard left to watch us  that night i dreamed a deal about bein free an about former voyagesspecially one when i was wrecked in the atlantic an our good ship the seahorse went down in latitude  the seahorse echoed robin with an earnest look at the sailor was she an emigrant ship  ay thats just what she was  was she lost in the year 1850 continued robin with increasing excitement  jus so my lad  and you were cook  youve hit the nail fair on the head replied the sailor with a look of surprise  well now that is most remarkable said robin for i was born on board of that very ship  you dont mean it said johnson looking eagerly at our hero  was you really the babby as was born to that poor miserable seasick gentleman mr wrightyoull excuse my sayin soin the middle of a thunderclap an a flash o lightnin as would have split our mainmast an sent us to the bottom along wi the ship if it hadnt bin for the noo lightnin conductor that mr harris the inventor indooced our skipper to put up  yes i am that very baby said robin and although of course i remember nothing about the thunder and lightning or anything else  my father and mother have often told me all about it and the wonderful deliverance which god mercifully sent when all hope had been given up and many a time did they speak of you johnson as a right good fellow and a splendid cook  much obleedged to em said johnson an are they both alive  they were both alive and well when i left england  come now this is pleasant to meet an old shipmate in such pecooliar circumstances said the sailor extending his hand which robin shook warmly quite as good as a play aint it  ay observed jim slagg who with the others had witnessed this meeting with deep interest an the babby has kep the lighten goin ever since though hes dropped the thunder for hes an electrician no lessa manufacturer of lightnin an a director of it too  the sailor wass good deal puzzled by this remark but when its purport was explained to him he gave vent to a vigorous chuckle notwithstanding sams stern order to lie still  didnt i say so he exclaimed  didnt i say distinctly that night to the stooardthomson was his namestooard said i that there babby what has just bin born will make his mark someow an someweres  well but i have not made my mark yet said robin laughing so youre not a true prophet at least time has not yet proved your title  not yet proved it cried johnson with vehemence why how much proof do you want  here you are not much more than a babby yetanyow hardly a manand besides havin bin born in thunder lightnin wind an rain youve laid the atlantic cable youve took up lightnin as a professionor a playthingyouve helped to save the life of john johnson an youve got comfortably located in a pirates island  if you ony go on as youve begun youll make your mark so deep that itll never be rubbed out to the end of time  a prophet indeed  why im shuperior to mahomet an beat nebuchadnezzar all to sticks  but you havent finished your story johnson said jim slagg  thats truewhere was i  ah dreamin in the hold of the pirateship well i woke up with a start all of a suddent bent on doin suthin i scarce knew what but i wriggled away at the rope that bound me till i got my hands free then i freed my legs then i loosed some o the boldest fellows among the slaves and got handspikes and bits o wood to arm em with  they was clever enough to understand signs an i couldnt speak to em not knowin their lingo but i signed to em to keep quiet as mice  then i crep to the powdermagazine which the reckless reptiles fastened very carelessly and got a bit paper and made a slow match by rubbin some wet powder on it and laid it all handy for i was determined to escape and put an end to their doins all at once  my plan was to attack and overpower the guard free and arm all the slaves blow up the ship escape on shore an have a pitched battle with the pirate crew  unfortunately there was a whitelivered traitor among usa sort o halfanhalf slavevery likely he was a spy anyhow when he saw what i was about he slipped over the side and swam quietly ashore  why he didnt alarm the guards i dont knowpraps he thought we might be too many for em and that if we conquered he stood but a small chance  anyhow he escaped the sharks and warned the crew in good time for we was in the very middle of the scrimmage when they suddintly turned up as you saw an got the better of us  howsever i managed to bolt below and fire the slow match before they saw what i was after  then i turned and fought my way on deck again so that they didnt find out  and when they was about to throw me overboard the thought of the surprise in store for em indooced me to give vent to a hearty cheer  it warnt a right state o mind i confess and i was properly punished for instead o killin me off quick an comfortable they tied me hand and futt took me below an laid me not two yards from the slowly burnin match  i felt raither unhappy i assure you an the reptiles never noticed the match because o the smoke o the scrimmage  i do believe it was being so near it as saved me for when the crash came i was lifted bodily wi the planks on which i lay and comin down from the sky as it appeared to me i went clean into the sea without damage except the breakin o one o the ropes which fortunately set my right arm free  come now johnson you must go to sleep after that said sam  youre exciting yourself too much remember that i am your doctor and obedience is the first law of naturewhen one is out of health  very good sir returned the seaman but before i turn over mr wright must read me a few verses out o that bible his mother gave him  why how do you know that my mother gave me a bible asked robin in great surprise  didnt i know your mother replied the sailor with a flush of enthusiasm an dont i know that she would sooner have let you go to sea without her blessing than without the word of god  she was the first human bein as ever spoke to me about my miserable soul and the love of god in sendin his son to save it  many a one has asked me about my health and warned me to fly from drink and offered to help me on in life but she was the first that ever asked after my soul or tried to impress on me that eternity and its affairs were of more importance than time  i didnt say much at the time but the seed that your mother planted nigh twenty years ago has bin watered thank god an kep alive ever since  there was a tone of seriousness and gratitude in this offhand seamans manner while speaking of his mother which touched robin deeply without a moments hesitation he pulled out his bible and read a chapter in the gospel of john  now youll pray said the sailor to robins surprise and embarrassment for he had never prayed in public before though accustomed from a child to make known his wants to god night and morning  but our hero was morally as well as physically courageousas every hero should be  he knelt at once by the sailors couch while the others followed his example and in a few simple sentences asked for pardon blessing help and guidance in the name of jesus christ  thus peculiarly was biblereading and family worship established on the pirates island in the year eighteen hundred and sixtyeight    chapter nineteen  an exploration and an accident  for the first few days of their stay on what they styled pirate island our castaways were too much taken up with the wondrous and varied contents of the robbers cave and the information meerta and letta had to give to pay much regard to the island itself or the prospect they had of quitting it  but when their interest and curiosity began to abate and the excitement to decrease they naturally bethought them of the nature and resources of their now home  of course they did not for a moment regard it in the light of home it was merely a restingplacea refuge where after their escape from the sea they should spend a few weeks perhaps months until a passing vessel should take them off  they did not know at that time that the islet was far removed from the usual track of ships and that like the pitcairn islanders they might be doomed to spend many years perchance a lifetime on it  indeed a considerable time elapsed before they would admit to themselves that there was a possibility of such a fate although they knew both from meerta and letta that no ship of any kind save that of the pirates had been seen for the last eighteen months and the few sails that did chance to appear were merely seen for a few hours like seagulls on the horizon from which they arose and into which they vanished  having then as we have said bethought them of examining the resources and nature of the island they one morning organised an expedition  by that time the sailor although by no means fit for it insisted that he was sufficiently restored to accompany them  letta who was active and strong like a small gazelle besides being acquainted with the whole region agreed to act as guide  stumps having sprained his ankle slightly remained at the cave for the purpose as he said of helping meerta with the garden but jim slagg gave him credit for laziness  you see said sam shipton as letta led them down the rugged mountainside we may as well make ourselves comfortable while we remain here and im inclined to think that a hut however rough down in one of these charming valleys will be more agreeable than the gloomy cavern on the mountaintop  not so sure o that doctor said johnson the cave is at all events dry and a good stronghold in case of a visit from pirates  but pirates what have bin blowd to atoms said slagg aint likely to turn up again are they  thats so lad but some of their friends might pay us a visit you know  i think not rejoined sam there is honour among thieves here no doubt as elsewhere  i daresay it is wellknown among the fraternity that the island belongs to a certain set and the rest will therefore let it alone  what think you robin  im inclined to agree with you sam but perhaps letta is the best authority on that point  did you ever see any other set of pirates land here little one except youryour own set  only once answered the child another set came but they only stayed one day  they looked at everything looked at me an meerta an laughed very much  an they ate and drank a good deal and fought a little but they took nothing away and never came back  i thought so rejoined sam now all weve got to do is to hoist a flag on the highest peak of the mountain and when a vessel comes to take us off load her with as much of the booty as she can carryand then hurrah for old england  hooray echoed jim slagg thems exactly my sentiments  but the booty is not ours to take objected robin  whose is it then asked sam the rightful owners we dont know and the wrongful owners are defunct  i tell ee what it is mates said johnson the whole o the booty is mine cause why it was me as blowed up the owners so im entitled to it by conquest an you neednt go to fightin over it  if you behave yourselves ill divide it equally among us share an share alike  it seems to me johnson said robin that in strict justice the booty belongs to letta meerta and blind bungo as the natural heirs o the pirates  but theyre not the heirs they are part of the booty said the seaman and as sitch falls to be divided among us  if thats so said slagg then i claim letta for my share and you johnson can have your pick of meerta and blind bungo  nay letta is mine because i was the first to discover her said robin  whom will you go with letta  with you of course replied the child quite earnestly  havent you promised to take me back to mamma  indeed i have little one and if i ever get the chance assuredly i will said robin with equal earnestness  i say doctor said johnson to sam sitting down on a mossy bank ill stop here and wait for you  that rib aint all square yet  wilful man said sam didnt i advise you not to come  there lie down and take it easy  well bring you some fruit on our return  by this time the party had reached the valley in which the lakelet lay and beautiful indeed was the scene which presented itself as they passed under the grateful shade of the palmtrees  everywhere rich tropical vegetation met their gaze through the openings in which the sunshine poured like streams of fire  on the little lake numerous flocks of ducks and other fowl were seen swimming in sportive mood while an occasional splash told of fish of some sort below the surface  leaving the sailor in a position whence he could observe them for a long distance the rest of the party pushed on  during their rambles they found the valley to be much richer in vegetation and more beautiful than the distant view from the mountaintop had led them to expect small though the valley was it contained among other trees the cocoanut palm the breadfruit banana and sandalwood  there were also pineapples wild rice and custardapples some of which latter delicious fruit being ripe was gathered and carried back to johnson whom they found sound asleep and much refreshed on their return  the expedition proved that barren though the island appeared from the sea it contained quite enough of the good things of this life to render it a desirable abode for man  on the coast too where the raft had been cast ashore were discovered a variety of shellfish some of which especially the oysters were found to be excellent food  and some of the seafowl turned out to be very good eating though a little fishy while their eggs were as good as those of the domestic fowl  it seems to me said robin to letta one day when they were out on a ramble together that this is quite a little paradise  i dont know what paradise is like said the child  well no more do i returned robin with a laugh but of course everybody understands that it is the place where everything is perfect and where happiness is complete  it cannot be like paradise without mamma said letta shaking her pretty head sadly  i would not go to heaven unless mamma was there  robin was silent for some time as he thought of his own mother and the talks he used to have with her on this same subject  letta he said at length earnestly jesus will be in heaven  it was his spirit who taught you to love mammaas you do so you are sure to meet her there with him  nobody taught me to love mamma returned the child quietly i couldnt help it  true little one but it was god who made you tocouldnt help it  letta was puzzled by this reply  she raised her bright eyes inquiringly into robins honest face and said but youve promised to take me to her you know  yes dear little one but you must not misunderstand me replied the youth somewhat sadly  i promise that god helping me i will do the best i can to find out where your mother is but you must remember that i have very little to go on  i dont even know your mothers name or the place where you were taken from  by the way an idea has just occurred to me  have you any clothes at the cave  of course i have answered letta with a merry laugh  yes but i mean the clothes that you had on when you first came here  i dont know meerta knows  why  because your name may be marked on them  come let us go back at once and see  besides we are wasting time for you know i was sent out to shoot some ducks for dinner  rising as he spoke robin shouldered the shotgun which had been supplied from the robbers armoury and descending with his little companion towards the lake soon began to stalk the birds as carefully as if he had been trained to the work by a red indian  stooping low he glided swiftly through the bushes until he came within a hundred yards of the margin of the lakelet where a group of some thirty or forty fat ducks were feeding  letta had fallen behind and sat down to watch  the distance being too great for a shot and the bushes beyond the spot which he had reached being too thin to conceal him robin lay flat down and began to advance through the long grass after the fashion of a snake pushing his gun before him  it was a slow and tedious process but robins spirit was patient and persevering  he screwed himself as it were to within sixty yards of the flock and then fired both barrels almost simultaneously  seven dead birds remained behind when the affrighted flock took wing  it is not very scientific shooting said robin apologetically to his fair companion as she assisted him to tie their legs together but our object just now is food not sport  on the way back to the cavern they had to pass over a narrow ledge on one side of which a precipice descended towards the valley while the other side rose upwards like a wall  it was not necessarily a dangerous place  they had passed it often before in safety none of the party being troubled with giddiness but at this time robin had unfortunately hung his bundle of ducks on the side which had to brush past the rocky wall  as he passed the bunch struck a projection and threw him off his balance  in the effort to recover himself he dislodged a piece of rock under his left foot and without even a cry went headlong over the precipice  poor letta stood rooted to the spot too horrified to scream  she saw her friend on whom all her hopes were built go crashing through the foliage immediately below the precipice edge and disappear  it was the first terrible shock she had ever received  with a convulsive shudder she ran by a dangerously steep route towards the foot of the precipice  but robin had not yet met his doom although he had descended full sixty feet  his fall was broken by several leafy trees through which he went like an avalanche and a thick solid bush receiving him at the foot checked his descent entirely and slid him quietly off its boughs on to the grass where he lay stunned indeed but otherwise uninjured  poor letta of course was horrified on reaching the spot to find that robin could not speak and was to all appearance dead  in an agony of terror she shrieked and shook him and called him by nameto awaken him as she afterwards said but robins sleep was too deep at that moment to be dispelled by such measures  letta therefore sprang up and ran as fast as she could to the cavern to tell the terrible news and fetch assistance  robin however was not left entirely alone in his extremity  it so chanced that a remarkably small monkey was seated among the boughs of a neighbouring tree eating a morsel of fruit when lettas first scream sounded through the grove  cocking up one ear it arrested its little hand on the way to its lesser mouth and listened  its little black face was corrugated with the wrinkles of careit might be of fun we cannot tell  the only large features of the creature were its eyes and these seemed to blaze while the brows rose high as if in surprise  on hearing the second scream the small monkey laid hold of a bough with its tail swung itself off and caught another with its feet sprang twenty feet more or less to the ground which it reached on its hands tumbled a somersault inadvertently and went skipping over the ground at a great rate in the direction of the cries  when it reached the spot however letta had fled but robin still lay motionless on his back  it was evident that the small monkey looked on the prostrate youth with alarm and suspicion yet with an intense curiosity that no sense of danger could restrain  it walked slowly and inquiringly round him several times each time drawing closer while its crouched back and trailing tail betokened abject humility  then it ventured to put out a small black hand and touch him drawing it back again as if it had got an electric shock  then it ventured to touch him again with less alarm  after that it went close up and gazed in his face  familiarity says the proverb breeds contempt  the truth of proverbs can be verified by monkeys as well as men  seeing that nothing came of its advances that small monkey finally leaped on robins chest sat down thereon and stared into his open mouth  still the youth moved not whereupon the monkey advanced a little and laid its paw upon his nose  either the touch was more effective than lettas shaking or time was bringing robin round for he felt his nose tickled and gave way to a tremendous sneeze  it blew the monkey clean off its legs and sent it shrieking into a neighbouring tree  as robin still lay quiet the monkey soon recovered and returned to its former position where regardless of consequences it again laid hold of the nose  this time consciousness returned  robin opened his eyes with a stare of dreamy astonishment  the monkey replied with a stare of indignant surprise  robins eyebrows rose still higher  so did those of the monkey as it leaped back a foot and formed its mouth into a little o of remonstrance  robins mouth expanded he burst into an uncontrollable fit of laughter and the monkey was again on the eve of flight when voices were heard approaching and next instant letta came running forward followed at some distance by sam and the others  oh my dear sweet exquisite darling exclaimed letta  it did much for the poor youths recovery the hearing himself addressed in such endearing terms but he experienced a relapse when the monkey responding to the endearments ran with obvious joy into the childs bosom and submitted to a warm embrace  oh you darling repeated letta where have you been why did you go away  i thought you were dead  naughty thing  recollecting robin with a shock of selfreproach she dropped the monkey and ran to him  it is an old friend i see he said with a languid smile as she came up  yes yes an old pet  i had lost him for a long time  but youre not killed  oh  im so glad  killed repeated sam who was down on his knees carefully examining the patient i should think not  hes not even bruisedonly stunned a little  where did you fall from robinthe tree top  no from the edge of the precipice  what from the ledge sixty or seventy feet up there  impossible  you would certainly have been killed if you had fallen from that  so i certainly should returned robin if god had not in his mercy grown trees and shrubs there expressly among other purposes to save me  in this reply robins mind was running on previous conversations which he had had with his friend on predestination  the idea of shrubs and trees having been expressly grown on an island of the southern seas to save an english boy seemed doubtful to sam  he did not however express his doubts at the time but reserved the subject for a future theological discussion  meanwhile slagg stumps and johnson having spread some palm branches on a couple of stout poles laid our hero thereon and bore him in safety to the pirates cave where for several days he lay on one of the luxurious couches tenderly nursed by letta and the old woman who although she still pathetically maintained that the roberts an pyrits wasnt all so bad as each oder was quite willing to admit that her present visitors were preferable and that upon the whole she was rather fond of them    chapter twenty  various subjects treated of and a great fight detailed  it was the habit of robin and his friends at this time the weather being extremely fine and cool to sit at the mouth of their cavern of an evening chatting about the events of the day or the prospects of the future or the experiences of the past while old meerta busied herself preparing supper over a fire kindled on the ground  no subject was avoided on these occasions because the friends were harmoniously minded in addition to which the sweet influences of mingled starlight and firelight soft air and lovely prospect of land and seato say nothing of the prospect of supperall tended to induce a peaceful and forbearing spirit  well now said robin continuing a subject which often engaged their intellectual powers it seems to me simple enough  simple exclaimed johnson with a halfsarcastic laugh wy now you an the doctor ave tried to worrit that electricity into my brain for many months off an on and i do believe as im more muddled about it tonight than i was at the beginnin  praps its because you haint got no brains to work upon suggested slagg  praps it is humbly admitted the seaman  but look here now doctor he added turning to sam with his brow knotted up into an agony of mental endeavour and the forefinger of one hand thrust into the palm of the otherlook here  you tells me that electricity aint a substance at all  yes thats so assented sam with a nod  wery good  now then if it aint a substance at all its nothin an if its nothin how can you go an talk of it as somethin an give it a name an tell me it works the telegraph an does all manner of wonderful things  but it does not follow that a thing must be nothing because it isnt a substance  dont you see man that an idea is something yet it is not a substance  thought which is so potent a factor in this world is not a substance yet it cannot be called nothing  it is a conditionit is the result of brainatoms in action  electricity is sometimes described as an invisible imponderable fluid but that is not quite correct because a fluid is a substance  it is a better definition to say that electricity is a manifestation of energya result of substance in action  there im muddled again said johnson with a look of hopeless incapacity  small blame to you johnson murmured slagg who had done his best to understand while stumps sat gazing at the speakers with an expression of blank complacency  look here johnson said sam youve often seen men shaking a carpet havent you  in coorse i have  well have you not observed the waves of the carpet that roll along it when shaken  yes i have  what are these waves  well sir i should say they was the carpet replied johnson  no the waves are not the carpet  when the waves reach the end of the carpet they disappear  if the waves were the carpet the carpet would disappear  the same waves in a whip soft and undulating though they be result in a loud crack as you know  muddled again said johnson  ditto said slagg  why im not muddled a bit suddenly exclaimed stumps with a halfcontemptuous laugh  of coorse youre not retorted slagg  brainless things never git into that state  you never heard of a turnip bein muddled did you  stumps became vacant and sam went on  well you see the waves are not substance  they are a conditiona result of atoms in motion  now when the atoms of a substance are disturbed by friction or by chemical action they get into a state of violent commotion and try wildly to fly from or to each other  this effort to fly about is energy  when the atoms get into a very intense state of commotion they have a tendency to induce explosion unless a way of escape is foundescape for the energy not for the atoms  now when you cause chemical disturbance in an electric battery the energy thus evolved is called electricity and we provide a conductor of escape for it in the shape of a copper or other metal wire which we may carry to any distance we please and the energy runs along it as the wave runs along the carpet as long as you keep up the commotion in the battery among the excited atoms of copper and zinc  mudno not quite  i have got a glimmer o suthin said johnson  ditto said slagg  supper said old meerta  ha thats the battery for me cried stumps jumping up  not a bad one either said robin as they entered the cave alternate plates of beef and greens steeped in some such acid as lemonade cause a wonderful commotion in the atoms of the human body  true robin and the energy thereby evolved said sam sometimes bursts forth in brilliant sparks of witto say nothing of flashes of absurdity  an thunderin stoopidity added slagg  further converse on the subject was checked at that time by what sam termed the charging of the human batteries  the evening meal went on in silence and very pleasantly for some time but before its close it was interrupted in an alarming manner by the sudden entrance of letta with wild excitement in her eyes  oh she cried pointing back to the entrance of the cave a ship pirateship coming  a bombshell could scarcely have produced greater effect  each individual leaped up and darted out flushing deep red or turning pale according to temperament  they were not long in verifying the statement  a ledge of rocks concealed the entrance to the cavern from the sea  over its edge could be seen the harbour in which they had found the vessel whose total destruction has been described and there sure enough they beheld a similar vessel though considerably smaller in the act of furling her sails and dropping anchor  there could be no doubt as to her character for although too distant to admit of her crew being distinguished by starlight her rig and general appearance betrayed her  not a moment to be lost robin said sam shipton hurriedly as he led the way back to the tavern where old meerta and blind bungo aided by letta had already cleared away all evidence of the late feast leaving only three tin cups and three pewter plates on the table with viands appropriate thereto  ha youre a knowing old lady exclaimed sam you understand how to help us i see  me tink so replied meerta with an intelligent nod  ony us tree here  all de pyrits gone away  dem sinners ony come here for a feed praps for leetil poodre  soon go away  just so said sam meanwhile we will hide and return after they are gone or better still if you letta and bungo will come and hide with us ill engage to lay a train of powder from the barrels inside to somewhere outside and blow the reptiles and the whole mountain into the sea  theres powder enough to do it  you tink me one divl demanded the old woman indignantly  no some o dem pyrits not so bad as each oder  you let em alone me let you alone  this gentle intimation that meerta had their lives in her hand induced sam to ask modestly what she would have him do  go she replied promptly take rifles swords an poodre  hide till pyrits go way  if de finds youfight  better fight dan be skin alive  unquestionably said sam with a mingled laugh and shudder in which his companions joinedas regards the shudder at least if not the laugh  acting promptly on the suggestion sam armed himself and his comrades each with a good breechloading rifle as much ammunition as he could conveniently carry and an english sword  then descending the mountain on the side opposite to the harbour they disappeared in the dark and tangled underwood of the palmgrove  letta went a short distance with them  they wont kill meerta or blind bungo she said on the way down theyre too useful though they often treat them badly  meerta sent me away to hide here the last time the strange bad men came  she thinks i go hide tonight but i wont so goodnight  but surely you dont mean to put yourself in the power of the pirates said robin  no never fear returned the child with a laugh  i know how to see them without they see me  before further remonstrance could be made the active child had bounded up the pathway and disappeared  not long after sam and his comrades had taken their departure the pirates came up to the cavern in a bodyabout forty of themwell armed and ready to fight if need be  they were as rascally a set of cutthroats as one could desire to seeor rather not to seeof various nationality with ugly countenances and powerful frames which were clothed in more or less fantastic eastern garb  their language like themselves was mixed and we need scarcely add unrefined  the little that was interchanged between them and meerta we must however translate  what alive still cried the ruffian who appeared to be the leader of the band flinging himself down on a couch with the air of a man who knew the place well while his men made themselves at home  meerta merely smiled to the salutation that in to say she grinned  where are they demanded the piratechief referring of course to those who the reader is aware were blown up  gone away answered meerta  far away asked the pirate  yes very far away  goin to be long away  ho yes very long  wheres the little girl they took from sarawak  gone away  where away  dont know  now look here you old hag said the pirate drawing a pistol from his belt and levelling it tell the truth about that girl else ill scatter your brains on the floor  where has she gone to  dont know repeated meerta with a look of calm indifference as she took up a tankard and wiped it out with a cloth  the man steadied the pistol and pressed the trigger  you better wait till she has given us our grub quietly suggested one of the men  the leader replaced the weapon in the shawl which formed his girdle and said get it ready quickthe best you have and bring us some wine to begin with  soon after that our friends while conversing in low tones in the grove heard the unmistakeable sounds of revelry issue from the cave  what think you boys said sam suddenly shall we go round to the harbour surprise and kill the guard seize the pirateship up anchor and leave these villains to enjoy themselves as best they may  what and leave letta not to mention meerta and bungo behind us never  i forgot them for the moment said sam  no we cant do that  as he spoke the noise of revelry became louder and degenerated into sounds of angry disputation  then several shots were heard followed by the clashing of steel and loud yells  surely that was a female voice said robin rising and rushing up the steep path that led to the cavern closely followed by his comrades  they had not gone a hundred yards when they were arrested by hearing a rustling in the bushes and the sound of hasty footsteps  next instant letta was seen running towards them with glaring eyes and streaming hair  she sprang into robins arms with a convulsive sob and hid her white face on his breast  speak letta dear child  are you hurt  no o no but meerta darling meerta she is dead  they have shot her and bungo  she burst again into convulsive sobbing  dead  but are you surequite sure said sam  quite  i saw their brains scattered on the walloh meerta  she ended in a low wail as though her heart were broken  now boys said johnson who had hitherto maintained silence we must go to work an try to cut out the pirateship  its a good chance and its our only one  yes theres nothing to prevent us trying it now said robin sadly and the sooner the better  lucky that we made up the parcels last night warnt it said jim slagg as they made hasty arrangements for carrying out their plan  jim referred to parcels of rare and costly jewels which each of them had selected from the pirate store put into separate bags and hid away in the woods to be ready in case of any sudden occasion arisingsuch as had now actually arisento quit the island  going to the place where these bags were concealed they slung them over their shoulders and set off at a steady run or trot for the harbour each taking his turn in carrying letta for the poor child was not fit to walk much less to run  stealthy though their movements were however they did not altogether escape detection  two bright eyes had been watching letta during all her wanderings that night and two nimble feet had followed her when she ran affrighted from the pirates stronghold  the party was overtaken before half the distance to the harbour had been gained and at length with a cry of satisfaction  lettas favouritethe small monkeysprang upon her shoulder  in this position refusing to move he was carried to the coast  as had been anticipated the pirate vessel was found lying in the pool where the former ship had anchored  being considerably smaller however it had been drawn close to the rocks so that a landing had been effected by means of a broad plank or gangway instead of a boat fortunately for our friends this plank had not been removed after the pirates had left probably because they deemed themselves in a place of absolute security  as far as they could see only one sentinel paced the deck  i shouldnt wonder if the guard is a very small one whispered sam to robin as they crept to the edge of the shrubs which lined the harbour and surveyed their intended prize  no doubt they expected to meet only with friends hereor with nobody at all as it has turned outand have left just enough to guard their poor slaves  we shall soon find out returned sam  now boys he said on rejoining the others in the bush see that your revolvers are charged and handy but dont use them if you can avoid it  a cut over the head with cold steel will be sufficiently effective for we have no desire to kill  nevertheless dont be particular  we cant afford to measure our blows with such scoundrels only if we fire we shall alarm those in the cave and have less time to get under weigh  what is to be done with letta while we attack asked robin  ill wait here till you come for me said letta with a sad little smile on her tearbedewed face im quite used to see fighting  good keep close and dont move from this spot till we come for you my little heroine said sam  now boys follow me in single file tread like micedont hurry  theres nothing like keeping cool  not much use o saying that to a feller thats redhot growled slagg as he stood with a flushed face a revolver in one hand and a cutlass in the other  sam armed similarly glided to the extreme verge of the bushes between which and the water there was a space of about thirty yards  with a quiet catlike run he crossed this space rushed up the plank gangway and leaped upon the deck with his comrades close at his heels  the sentinel was taken completely by surprise but drew his sword nevertheless and sprang at sam with a shout  the latter although not a professional warrior had been taught singlestick at school and was an expert swordsman  he parried the pirates furious thrust and gave him what is technically termed cut number 1 which clove his turban to the skull and stretched him on the deck  it was a fortunate cut for the shout had brought up seven pirates five from below and two from the forepart of the vessel where they had been asleep between two guns  with these his comrades were now engaged in mortal combatthree of them having simultaneously attacked johnson while two had assailed jim slagg  when sam turned round the stout sailor had cut down one of his foes but the other two would probably have proved too much for him if sam had not instantly engaged one of them  he was a powerful active man so that for nearly a minute they cut and thrust at each other without advantage to either until sam tried a feint thrust which he followed up with a tremendous slash at the head  it took effect and set him free to aid slagg who was at the moment in deadly peril for poor slagg was no swordsman and had hitherto foiled his two antagonists by sheer activity and the fury of his assaults  he was quite collected however for even in the extremity of his danger he had refrained from using his revolver lest he should thereby give the alarm to the pirates on land with one stroke sam disposed of one of the scoundrels and slagg succeeded in cutting down the other  meanwhile our hero robin and stumps had attacked the two pirates who chanced to be nearest to them  the former thought of letta and her wretched fate if this assault should fail  the thought filled his little body with such a gush of what seemed to him like electric fire that he leaped on his opponent with the fury of a wild cat and bore him backward so that he stumbled over the combings of a hatchway and was thrown flat on the deckhors de combat  but stumps was not so fortunate  slow in all his movements and not too courageous in spirit he gave way before the villain who assailed him it was not indeed much to his discredit for the man was much larger as well as more active and fierce than himself  a cut from the pirates sword quickly laid him low and his antagonist instantly turned on robin  he was so near at the moment that neither of them could effectively use his weapon  robin therefore dashed the hilt of his sword into the mans face and grappled with him  it was a most unequal struggle for the pirate was as we have said a huge fellow while robin was small and slight  but there were several things in our heros favour  he was exceedingly tough and wonderfully strong for his size besides being active as a kitten and brave as a lion  the way that robin wright wriggled in that big mans embrace hammered his nose and eyes with the iron hilt of his cutlass stuck his knees into the pit of his stomach and assaulted his shins with the toes of boots besides twisting his left hand into his hair like a vice was wonderful to behold  it was all lettas doing  the more hopeless the struggle felt the more hapless did lettas fate appear to robin and the more furious did the spirit within rise above its disadvantages  in the whirl of the fight the pirates head chanced for one moment to be in proximity to a large iron block  robin observed it threw all his soul and body into one supreme effort and launched his foe and himself against the block both heads met it at the same moment and the combatants rolled from each others grasp  the pirate was rendered insensible but robin probably because of being lighter was only a little stunned  recovering in a moment he sprang up glanced round observed that the pirates were almost if not quite overpowered and leaped over the bulwarks  a few moments later and he had letta in his arms  just then a pistol shot rang in the night air  the last of the pirates who was overpowered chanced to use his firearm though without success  it was fortunate the fight was over for now that the alarm had been given they knew that their chance of escaping was greatly lessened  cut the cable slagg  out with a boathook johnson ready to shove off  ill fetch letta cried sam springing to the side  he was almost run down as he spoke by robin with the child in his arms  ha  robinwell done my boy  here letta you understand the language tell the slaves below to out oars and pull for their lives its their only chance  the poor creatures who were bound to the thwarts below deck had been listening with dull surprise to the fighting on decknot that fighting was by any means unusual in that vessel but they must have known that they were in harbour and that the main body of the pirates were on shore  still greater was their surprise when they received the above order in the sweet gentle tones of a childs voice  whether they deemed her an angel or not we cannot tell but their belief in her right to command was evinced by their shoving the oars out with alacrity  a few seconds sufficed to cut the cable and the gangway fell into the sea with a loud splash as the vessel moved slowly from the land while johnson robin and slagg thrust with might and main at the boathooks the oars could not be dipped or used until the vessel had been separated a few yards from the land and it was during the delay caused by this operation that their greatest danger lay for already the pirates were heard calling to each other among the cliffs  pull pull now for life boys shouted sam as he seized the helm  pull pull now for life boys echoed the faithful translator in her silvery tones  the oars dipped and gurgled through the water  there was no question as to the energy of the poor captives but the vessel was heavy and sluggish at starting  she had barely got a couple of hundred yards from the shore when the pirates from the cavern came running tumultuously out of the woods  perceiving at once that their vessel had been captured they rushed into the water and swam off each man with his sword between his teeth  they were resolute villains and swam vigorously and fast  sam knew that if such a swarm should gain the side of the vessel no amount of personal valour could prevent recapture  he therefore encouraged the slaves to redoubled effort  these responded to the silvery echo but so short had been the distance gained that the issue seemed doubtful  give em a few shots boys cried sam drawing his own revolver and firing back over the stern  the others followed his example and discharged all their revolvers but without apparent effect for the pirates still came on  one of the sails had fortunately been left unfurled  at this moment a light puff of air from the land bulged it out and sensibly increased their speed  hurrah shouted johnson lend a hand boys to haul taut  the sail was trimmed and in a few minutes the vessel glided quickly away from her pursuers  a loud british cheer announced the fact alike to pirates and slaves so that the latter were heartened to greater exertion while the former were discouraged  in a few minutes they gave up the chase with a yell of rage and turned to swim for the shore  about a hundred yards from the mouth of the harbour there lay a small isleta mere rock  here sam resolved to leave the pirate guard none of whom had been quite killedindeed two of them had tried unsuccessfully to rise during the fight  you see said sam as he steered for the rock we dont want to have either the doctoring or the killing of such scoundrels  they will be much better with their friends who will be sure to swim off for them perhaps use our raft for the purpose which they will likely find sooner or later  they soon ranged up alongside of the island and in a few minutes the bodies of the pirates were landed and laid there side by side  while they were being laid down the man who had fought with robin made a sudden and furious grasp at johnsons throat with one hand and at his knife with the other but the seaman was too quick for him  he felled him with a blow of his fist  the others although still alive were unable to show fight  then hoisting the mainsail and directing their course to the northward our adventurers slipped quietly over the sea and soon left pirate island far out of sight behind them    chapter twenty one  departure from pirate island and hopeful news at sarawak  the vessel of which robin and his friends had thus become possessed was one of those numerous native pirateships which did and we believe still do infest some parts of the malay archipelagoships which can assume the form and do the work of simple tradingvessels when convenience requires or can hoist the black flag when circumstances favour  it was not laden with anything valuable at the time of its capture  the slaves who wrought at the oars when wind failed were wretched creatures who had been captured among the various islands and many of them were in the last stage of exhaustion having been worked almost to death by their inhuman captors though a good many were still robust and fresh  these latter it was resolved to keep still in fetters as it was just possible that some of them if freed might take a fancy to seize the ship and become pirates on their own account  they were treated as well as circumstances would admit of however and given to understand that they should be landed and set free as soon as possible  meanwhile no more work would be required of them than was absolutely necessary those of them who were ill were freed at once from toil carefully nursed by letta and doctored by sam  at first robin and his comrades sailed away without any definite purpose in view but after things had been got into order a council was held and plans were discussed  it was then that letta mentioned what the pirates in the cavern had said about her having been taken from sarawak  sarawak exclaimed robin why thats the place that has been owned and governed for many years by an englishman named brookesir james brooke if i remember rightly and they call him rajah brooke  perhaps your mother lives there letta  where is sarawak asked stumps whose injuries in the recent fight were not so severe as had at first been supposed  its in the island of borneo replied sam youre right robin  no hes robin wright interrupted slagg  be quiet jim  i think it is highly probable that your parents are there letta and as we have no particular reason for going anywhere else and cant hope to make for england in a tub like this we will just lay her head for sarawak  this was accordingly done their new course being noreast and by east  it would extend our tale to undue proportions were we to give in detail all the adventures they experienced dangers they encountered and hairbreadth escapes they made between that point on the wide southern ocean and the malay archipelago  the reader must be content to skip over the voyage and to know that they ultimately arrived at the port of sarawak where they were kindly treated by a deputy the rajah himself being absent at the time  during the voyage the subject of finding lettas parents became one of engrossing and increasing interestso much so indeed that even electricity and telegraphcables sank into secondary importance  they planned over and over again the way in which they would set about making inquiries and the various methods which they would adopt in pursuit of their end  they even took to guessing who lettas parents would turn out to be and sam went so far as to invent and relate romantic stories in which the father and mother of letta played a conspicuous part  he called them colonel and mrs montmorenci for convenience which slagg reduced to colonel and mrs monty for short  in all this letta took great delight chiefly because it held the conversation on that source of undying interest mamma and partly because she entered into the fun and enjoyed the romance of the thing while poor child her hopeful spirit never for a moment doubted that in some form or other the romance would become a reality through robin on whom she had bestowed her highest affectionsnext of course to mamma  on landing at sarawak sam shipton went direct to the government offices to report the capture of the pirate vessel and to make inquiries as to lettas parents leaving robin and the others to watch the vessel  isnt it strange said john johnson to robin as they leaned over the side and looked down into the clear water that a englishman should become a rajah and get possession o this here country  i can give you only a slight reply to that question replied robin but sam will enlighten you more than i can he seems to be acquainted with the rajahs strange career  all i know is that he is said to govern the country well  coorious said johnson i shouldnt like to settle down in sitch a nest o pirates  howsever every man to his taste as jack said when the shark swallowed his souwester  dee think its likely sir that well find out who the parents o poor miss letta is  robin shook his head  im not very hopeful  we have so little information to go uponjust one wordsarawak  nevertheless i dont despair and ill certainly not be beat without trying hard  but here comes sam he looks pleased  i thinki hope he has good news for us  ive got something but not much replied sam to the eager inquiries with which he was assailed  the gentleman whom i saw knew nothing about a little girl having been kidnapped from this region within the last two or three years but an old clerk or secretary who heard us talking about it came up scratching his nose with the feather of his quill and humbly said that he had heard something about a girl disappearing at a fire somewhere though he couldnt recollect the name of the place as he was ill at the time besides being new to the country but he thought there was a malay a drunken old fellow living some five miles inland who used to talk about something of the sort and who had he fancied been in the service of the people whose house had been burned  but altogether he was very hazy on the subject  then we must go and ferret out this old man instantly said robin buttoning up his coat as if about to commence the journey at once  too late tonight robin said sam restrain your impatience my boy you forget that it sometimes gets dark in these latitudes and that there are no street lamps on the country roads  true true sam  and what said they about our capture  that we must leave it in their hands at present that they did not know exactly what the rajah might have to say about it but that he would be there himself in a few weeks and decide the matter  pon my word thats cool said slagg who came up at the moment an suppose we wants to continue our voyage to england or indy or chiny  if we do we must continue it by swimming returned sam but it matters little for there is a steamer expected to touch here in a few days on her way to india so we can take passage in her having plenty of fundsthanks to the pirates  its all very well for you to boast of bein rich growled stumps but i wont be able to afford it  oh yes you will returned robin with a laugh  the jews will advance you enough on your jewellery to pay your passage  sarves you right for bein so greedy said slagg  the greed which slagg referred to had been displayed by stumps at the time the parcels of coin and precious stones were made up in the cavern for sudden emergency as before mentioned  on that occasion each man had made up his own parcel selecting such gems trinkets and coin from the pirate horde as suited his fancy  unfortunately the sight of so much wealth had roused in the heart of stumps feelings of avarice which heretofore had lain dormant and he stuffed many glittering and superb pieces of jewellery into his bag in a secretive manner as if half ashamed of his new sensations and half afraid that his right to them might be disputed  afterwards on the voyage to borneo when the bags were emptied and their costly contents examined it was discovered that many of stumpss most glittering gems were mere pastealmost worthlessalthough some of them of course were valuable  stumps was much laughed at and in a private confabulation of his comrades it was agreed that they would punish him by contrasting their own riches with his glittering trash but that at last they would give him a share which would make all the bags equal  this deceptive treatment however wrought more severely on stumps than they had expected and roused not only jealous but revengeful feelings in his breast  next morning sam and robin set off with letta to search for the old malay leaving their comrades in charge of the vessel  there is something inexpressibly delightful to the feelings in passing through the glades and thickets of tropical forests and plantations after a long sea voyage  the nostrils seem to have been specially prepared by long abstinence from sweet smells to appreciate the scents and odours of aromatic plants and flowers  the soft shade of foliage the refreshing green and the gay colours everywhere fill the eye with pleasure not less exquisite than that which fills the ears from the warblings and chatterings of birds the gentle tones of domestic animals and the tinkling of rills  the mere solidity of the land under foot forms an element of pleasure after the tossings of the restless sea and all the sweet influences put together tend to rouse in the heart a shout of joy and deep gratitude for a world so beautiful and for powers so sensitively capable of enjoying it  especially powerful were the surrounding influences on our three friends as they proceeded mile after mile into the country and little wonder for eyes and nostrils and ears which had of late drunk only of the blue heavens and salt sea and the music of the wind naturally gloated over a land which produces sandalwood cinnamon turmeric ginger benzoin camphor nutmeg and a host of other gums and spices a land whose shades are created by cocoanut palms ebony banana breadfruit guttapercha upas sesamum and a vast variety of other trees and shrubs the branches of which are laden with fruits and flowers and paroquets and monkeys  little lettas heart was full to overflowing so much so that she could scarcely speak while walking along holding robins hand  but there was more than mere emotion in her bosommemory was strangely busy in her brain puzzling her with dreamy recognitions both as to sights and sounds  its so like home she murmured once looking eagerly round  is it said robin with intense interest  look hard at it little one do you recognise any object that used to be in your old home  the child shook her head sadly  no not exactlyeverything is so like andand yet not like somehow  they came just then upon a clearing among sugarcane in the midst of which stood a halfruined hut quite open in front and thatched with broad leaves  on a bench near the entrance was seated an old greyhaired malay man with a bottle beside him  nearer to the visitors a young girl was digging in the ground  thats the old malay for certain said sam see the old rascal has gone pretty deep already into the bottle  ask the girl letta what his name is  sam did not at first observe that the child was trembling very much and gazing eagerly at the old man  he had to repeat the question twice before she understood him and then she asked the girl without taking her eyes off the old man  who is he responded the girl in the malay tongue why thats old georgiedrunken georgie  she had scarcely uttered the words when letta uttered a wild cry ran to the old man leaped into his arms and hugged him violently  the man was not only surprised but agitated  he loosened the childs hold so as to be able to look at her face  oh georgie georgie she cried almost hysterically dont you know medont you know letta  georgie replied by uttering a great shout of mingled astonishment and joy as he clasped the child in his arms  then setting her down and holding her at armslength he cried in remarkably broken english  know you  wat  vous hold nusshold georgienot know miss letty ho  miss letty my hold arts abusted amost  but yous come back tank do lor  look ere miss letty  he started up put the child down and with sudden energy seized the bottle of ruin by the neck look ere yous oftin say to me afore you hoed away geogie do do give up dinkinyou members  no i dont remember said letta smiling through her tears  ho yes but you said itbery often an me was used to say yes miss lettyde hold hippercritbut i didnt gib im up  i dink away wuss dan ebber  but nowbut nowbut now he danced round each time whirling the bottle above his head me dink no morenebber nebbernebber more  with a mighty swing the old man sent the rumbottle like a rocket up among the branches of an ebonytree where it was shattered to atoms and threw an eavesdropping monkey almost into fits by raining rum and broken glass upon its inquisitive head  when the excitement of the meeting had somewhat subsided letta suddenly said but where is mamma  oh take me to mamma georgie  the old mans joy instantly vanished and letta stood pale and trembling before him pressing her little hands to her breast and not daring apparently to ask another question  not dead she said at length in a low whisper  nonomiss letty replied the man hastily ho no not dead but goed away nigh broked her heart when she losted you git berry sick tought she was go for die but she no die  she jis turn de corner and come round an when she git bedder she hoed away  where did she go to asked robin anxiously  to bumby said old george  to where  bumby  i suppose you mean bombay said sam  yes yesan me say bumby  is she alive and well asked robin  don know replied old george shaking his head she no write to hold geogie  nigh two years since she goed away  when the excitement of this meeting began to subside sam shipton took the old malay aside and after prolonged conversation learned from him the story of which the following is the substance  mrs langley was the widow of a gentleman who had died in the service of rajah brooke  several years beforehe could not say exactly how many the widow had retired with her only child letta to a little bungalow on a somewhat outoftheway part of the coast which mr langley used to be fond of going to and called his shootingbox  this had been attacked one night by labuan pirates who after taking all that was valuable set fire to the house  mrs langley had escaped by a back door into the woods with her old manservant george  she had rushed at the first alarm to lettas bed but the child was not there  letta had been awake had heard the advance of the pirate crew and had gone into a front room to see who was coming  supposing that old george must have taken charge of the child and hearing him calling to her to come away quickly the widow ran out at the back door as the pirates entered by the front  too late she found that george had not the child and she would have returned to the house regardless of consequences if george had not forcibly restrained her  when george returned at daybreak he found the house a smouldering ruin the pirates gone and letta nowhere to be found  the shock threw mrs langley into a violent fever  she even lost her reason for a time and when at last she was restored to some degree of health she went away to bombay without saying to any one what were her intentions  she could never entirely forgive old george for having prevented her returning to the house to share the fate of her child and left sarawak without bidding him farewell though as old george himself pathetically remarked me couldnt elp it you knows  de scoundrils kill missis if she goed back an dat doos no good to miss letty  this was all the information that could be obtained about mrs langley and on the strength of it sam and robin resolved to proceed to bombay by the first opportunity  but their patience was severely tried for many months elapsed ere they obtained berths in a vessel bound direct to bombay  of course jim slagg determined to go with them and so did stumps though a slight feeling of coldness had begun to manifest itself in that worthys manner ever since the episode of the division of jewels  john johnson however made up his mind to take service with the rajah and help to exterminate the nests of pirates with which those seas were infested  depend upon it sir said johnson to robin at parting that youll turn out somethin or other afore long  as i said to our stooard on the night that you was born stooard says i take my word for it that there babby what has just been launched aint agoin under hatches without makin his mark somehow an somewheres an youve begun to make it sir aready an youll go on to make it as sure as my names john johnson  im gratified by your good opinion replied robin with a laugh  all i can say is that whatever mark i make i hope may be a good one  poor robin had little ambition at that time to make any kind of mark for himself on the world  his one desirewhich had grown into a sort of passionwas to find lettas mother  nearly all his thoughts were concentrated on that point and so great was his personal influence on his comrades that sam and slagg had become almost as enthusiastic about it as himself though stumps remained comparatively indifferent    chapter twenty two  bombaywhere stumps comes to grief  once again we must beg the patient reader to skip with us over time and space until we find ourselves in the great city of bombay  it is a great day for bombay  natives and europeans alike are unusually excited  something of an unwonted nature is evidently astir  down at the sea the cause of the excitement is explained for the great eastern steamship has just arrived laden with the telegraph cable which is to connect england with her possessions in the east  the streets and quays are crowded with the men of many nations and various creeds to say nothing of varied costume  turbans and chimneypots salaam to each other and fezzes nod to straw hats and wideawakes  every one is more than usually sympathetic for all have their minds eyes and hopes more or less centred on the big ship with her unique and precious cargo  but it is with neither the great eastern nor the peoplenot even with the cablethat we have to do just now  removing our eyes from such we fix them and our attention on a very small steamer which lies alongside one of the wharves and shows evidence of having been severely handled by winds and waves  at the time we direct attention to her a few passengers were landing from this vessel and among them were our friends sam shipton robin wright jim slagg john shanks alias stumps and letta langley  most of the passengers had luggage of some sort but our friends possessed only a small bag each slung over their shoulders  a letter from the authorities of sarawak certified that they were honest men  now robin said sam as they pushed through the crowds there seems to me something auspicious in our arriving about the same time with the great eastern and i hope something may come of it but our first business is to make inquiries for mrs langley  we will therefore go and find the hotel to which we have been recommended and make that our headquarters while we are engaged in our search  can i lend you a hand mr shipton asked slagg who had become as it were irresistibly more respectful to robin and sam since coming among civilised people  no slagg our mission is too delicate to admit of numbers  if we require your services well let you know  ah  i seetoo many cooks apt to spoil the broth  well my mission will be to loaf about and see bombay  you and i will pull together stumps  no said stumps to the surprise of his companions ive got a private mission of my ownat least for this evening  well please yourself stumpy said slagg with a goodhumoured laugh you never was the best o company so i wont break my heart  at the hotel to which they had been recommended two rooms were engageda small single room for letta and one with two beds and a sofa for themselves  having breakfasted and commended letta to the landladys care sam and robin sallied forth together while slagg and stumps went their separate ways having appointed to meet again in the evening for supper  we will follow the fortunes of mr john shanks  that rather vacant and somewhat degenerate youth having his precious bag slung from his shoulders and his left arm round it for further security sauntered forth and began to view the town  his viewing it consisted chiefly in looking long and steadily at the shop windows of the principal streets there was a slight touch of cunning however in his expression for he had rid himself cleverly as he imagined of his comrades and meant to dispose of some of the contents of his bag to the best advantage without letting them know the result  in the prosecution of his deeplaid plans stumps attracted the attention of a gentleman with exceedingly black eyes and hair a hook nose and rather seedy garments  this gentleman followed stumps with great care for a considerable time watched him attentively seemed to make up his mind about him and finally ran violently against him  oh  i do beg your pardon sir  i am so sorry he said in a slightly foreign accent with an expression of earnest distress on his not overclean countenance so very very sorry it was a piece of orange peel  i almost fell but for your kind assistance i should have been down and perhaps broke my legs  thank you sir i do hope i have not hurt you against the wall  allow me to dust your sleeve  oh youve done me no damage old genlman said stumps rather flattered by the mans attention and urbanity  im all right i aint so easy hurt  you neednt take on so  but i cannot help take on so returned the seedy man with an irresistibly bland smile it is so good of you to make light of it yet i might almost say you saved my life for a fall to an elderly man is always very dangerous  will you not allow me to give my benefactor a drink  see here is a shop  stumps chanced to be very hot and thirsty at the time indeed he had been meditating some such indulgence and fell into the trap at once accepting the offer with a well i dont mind if i do he entered the drinking saloon and sat down while his new friend called for brandy and water  you have come from a long voyage i see said the seedy man pulling out a small case and offering stumps a cigar  how dee know that asked stumps bluntly  because i see it in your bronzed face and excuse me somewhat threadbare garments  oh as to that old man ive got tin enough to buy a noo rig out but im in no hurry  he glanced unintentionally at his bag as he spoke and the seedy man glanced at it toointentionally  of course stumpss glance let the cat out of the bag  come said the stranger when the brandy was put before them drink drink toto the girls we left behind us  i left no girl behind me said stumps  well then cried the seedy man with irresistible good humour let us drink success to absent friends and confusion to our foes  this seemed to meet the youths views for without a word of comment he drained his glass nearly to the bottom  ha thats good  nothin like brandy and water on a hot day  except brandy and water on a cold day my dear returned the jewfor such he was there is not much to choose between them  had you not better take off your bag it incommodes you in so narrow a seat  let me helpno  you let alone my hag growled stumps angrily with a sudden clutch at it  waiter bring a light  my cigar is out said the jew affecting not to observe stumpss tone or manner  it is strange he went on how sometimes you find a bad cigara very bad cigarin the midst of good ones  yours is going well i think  well enough answered stumps taking another pull at the brandy and water  the seedy man now launched out into a pleasant light discourse about bombay and its ways which highly interested his poor victim  he made no further allusion to the bag stumpss behaviour having betrayed all he required to know namely that its contents were valuable  soon the brandy began to take effect on stumps and as he was unaccustomed to such potent drink besides being unused to selfrestraint he would speedily have made himself a fit subject for the care of the police which would not have suited his new friend at all  when therefore stumps put out his hand to grasp his tumbler for another draught his anxious friend inadvertently knocked it over and then begged his pardon profusely  before stumps could decide whether to call for another glass at the risk of having to pay for it himself the jew pointed to a tall sallowfaced man who sat in a corner smoking and reading a newspaper  do you see him he asked in a low mysterious whisper  yes who is he what about him asked the youth in a similar whisper  hes an opiumsmoker  is he said stumps with a vacant stare  whats that  upon this text the seedy man delivered a discourse on the pleasures of opiumsmoking which quite roused the interest and curiosity of his hearer  but is it so very nice to smoke opium he asked after listening for some time  nice my dear  i should think it isvery nice but very wrongoh very wrong  perhaps we ought not even to speak about it  nonsense said the now halftipsy lad with an air of determination i should like to try it  come you know where i could have a pipe lets go  not for worlds said the man with a look of remonstrance  oh yes you will returned stumps rising  well you are a wilful man and if you will i suppose you must said the jew  he rose with apparent reluctance paid the reckoning and led his miserable victim into one of the numerous dens of iniquity which exist in the lowest parts of that city  there he furnished the lad with a pipe of opium and while he was in the state of semistupor resulting therefrom removed his bag of treasure which he found to his delight contained a far richer prize than he had anticipated despite the quantity of trash with which it was partly filled  having secured this he waited until stumps had partially recovered and then led him into one of the most crowded thoroughfares  now my boy he said affectionately i think you are much better you can walk alone  i should think i could he replied indignantly shaking off the mans grasp  whwhat dee take me for  he drew his hand across his eyes as if to clear away the cloud that still oppressed him and stared sternly before him then he stared less sternly on either side then he wheeled round and stared anxiously behind him  then clapping his left hand quickly to his side he became conscious that his bag was gone and that his late friend had taken an abrupt departure without bidding him farewell    chapter twenty three  stumps in despairand bombay in raptures  when mr john shanks realised the full extent of his loss his first impulse was to seize hold of the nearest passerby and strangle him his next to dash down a narrow street close beside him in pursuit of some one his next to howl stop thief and murder and his next to stare into a shop window in blank dismay and meditate  of these various impulses he gave way only to the last  his meditations however were confused and unsatisfactory  turning from them abruptly he hurried along the street at a furious walk muttering ill go an tell slagg  then pausing abruptly no i wont ill go an inform the pleece  under this new impulse he hurried forward again jostling people as he went and receiving a good deal of roughhandling in return  presently he came to a dead halt and with knitted brows and set teeth hissed ill go and drown myself  full of this intention he broke into a run but not being acquainted with the place found it necessary to ask his way to the port  this somewhat sobered him but did not quite change his mind so that when he eventually reached the neighbourhood of the shipping he was still going at a quick excited walk  he was stopped by a big and obviously eccentric seacaptain or mate who asked him if he happened to know of any active stout young fellow who wanted to ship in a tight little craft about to sail for old england  no i dont said stumps angrily  come now think again said the skipper in no degree abashed and putting on a nautical grin which was meant for a winning smile  im rather shorthanded give good wages have an amiable temper a good craft and a splendid cook  youre just the active spirited fellow that i want  youll ship now eh  no i wont said stumps sulkily endeavouring to push past  well well no offence  keep an easy mind and if you should chance to change it just come and see me captain bounce of the swordfish there she lies in all her beauty quite a picture  goodday  the eccentric skipper passed on but stumps did not move  he stood there with his eyes riveted on the pavement and his lips tightly compressed  evidently the drowning plan had been abandoned for something elsesomething that caused him to frown then to smile then to grow slightly pale and then to laugh somewhat theatrically  while in this mood he was suddenly pushed to one side by some one who said  the tracks made for walkin on not standin younghallo  it was slagg who had thus roughly encountered his mate  why stumps whats the matter with yon  nothing  where ave you bin to  nowhere  whos bin afrightenin of you  nobody  nothin nowhere an nobody repeated his friend thats what i calls a coorious combination for a man whos as white as a sheet one moment and as red as a turkeycock the next  well slagg said stumps recovering himself a little the fact is ive been taken in and robbed  hereupon he related all the circumstances of his late adventure to his astonished and disgusted comrade who asserted roundly that he was a big booby quite unfit to take care of himself  howsever we must do the best we can for you he continued so come along to the policeoffice  information of the robbery was given and inquiries instituted without delay but without avail  indeed the chief officer held out little hope of ultimate success nevertheless slagg endeavoured to buoy up his friend with assurances that they must surely get hold of the thief in the longrun  and if we dont he said to robin and sam during a private conversation on the subject that same night we must just give him each a portion of what we have for the poor stoopid has shared our trials and ought to share our luck  while stumps was being thus fleeced in the lower part of the city robin and sam had gone to make inquiries about mrs langley and at the government house they discovered a clerk who had formerly been at sarawak and had heard of the fire the abduction of the little girl and of mrs langley having afterwards gone to bombay but he also told them to their great regret that she had left for england six months before their arrival and he did not know her address or even the part of england to which she had gone  but continued the clerk who was a very friendly fellow ill make inquiries and let you know the result if you leave me your address meanwhile you can amuse yourself by paying a visit to that wonderful ship the great eastern which has come to lay a submarine telegraph cable between this and aden  of course you have heard of her arrival perhaps seen her  o yes replied robin  we intend to visit her at once  she is an old acquaintance of mine as i was in her when she laid the atlantic cable in 1865  does captain anderson still command her  no answered the clerk who seemed much interested in what robin said she is now commanded by captain halpin  that evening robin tried to console poor letta in her disappointment at not finding her mother and sam sought to comfort stumps for the loss of his treasure  neither comforter was very successful  letta wept in spite of robin and stumps absolutely refused to be comforted  next day however the tears were dried and letta became cheery again in the prospect of a visit to the great eastern  but stumps was no better  indeed he seemed worse and flatly refused to accompany them on their trip although all the world of bombay was expected to go    stumps stumps   down in the dumps   down in the dumps so lowo  sang jim slagg as he waved his hand in farewell on quitting the hotel goodbye my boy and get your spirits up before we return if you can  ill try replied stumps with a grim smile  the event which stirred the city of bombay to its centre at this time was indeed a memorable one  the connecting of india with england direct by a deepsea cable was a matter of the greatest importance because the land telegraph which existed at the time was wretchedly worked passing as it did through several countries which involved translation and retranslation besides subjecting messages to needless delay on the part of unbusinesslike peoples  in addition to the brighter prospects which the proposed cable was opening up the presence of the largest ship that had ever yet been constructed was a point of overwhelming attraction and so great were the crowds that went on board to see the marine wonder that it was found somewhat difficult to carry on the necessary work of coaling and making preparations for the voyage  robin said sam an they walked along with letta between them ive just discovered that the agent of the telegraph construction and maintenance company is an old friend of mine  he has been busy erecting a cable landinghouse on the shores of back bay so well go there first and get him to accompany us to the big ship  good said robin if it is not too far for letta to walk  the landinghouse which they soon reached stood near to the green where the bombay and baroda railway tumbled out its stream of cotton until the region became a very sea of bales  it was a little edifice with a thatched roof and venetian blinds commanding a fine view of the whole of back bay with malabar point to the right and the governors house imbedded in trees  long lines of surf marked the position of ugly rocks which were visible at low water but among these there was a pathway of soft sand marked off by stakes along which the shoreend of the cable was to lie  for the reception of the extreme end of the cable there was provided in the cablehouse a testing table of solid masonry with a wooden top on which the testing instruments were to stand the great delicacy of these instruments rendering a fixed table indispensable  when our friends reached the cablehouse native labourers in picturesque oriental costume were busy thatching its roof or painting it blue while some were screwing its parts together for the house with a view to future telegraphic requirements was built so as to come to pieces for shipment to still more distant quarters of the globe  sams friend could not go with him he said but he would introduce him to a young acquaintance among the working engineers who was going on with a party in half an hour or so  accordingly in a short time they were gliding over the bay and ere long stood on the deck of the big ship  oh letta said robin with a glitter of enthusiasm in his eyes as he gazed round on the wellremembered deck it feels like meeting an old friend after a long separation  how nice said letta  this how nice of the child was so to speak a point of great attraction to our hero  she always accompanied it with a smile so full of sympathy interest and urbanity that it became doubly significant on her lips  letta was precocious  she had grown so rapidly in sympathetic capacity and intelligence since becoming acquainted with her new friends that robin had gradually come to speak to her about his thoughts and feelings very much as he used to speak to cousin madge when he was a boy  yes he continued i had forgotten how big she was and she seems to me actually to have grown bigger  there never was a ship like her in the world  such huge proportions such a vast sweep of graceful lines the chief difference that i observe is the coat of white paint they have given her  she seems to have been whitewashed from stem to stern  it was for the heat i fancy  yes sir it wor said a bluff cableman who chanced to overhear the remark an if you wor in the tanks youd ave blessed captn halpin for wot he done  wy sir that coat o whitewash made a difference o no less than eight degrees in the cabletanks the moment it was putt on before that we was nigh stooed alive  arter that weve ony bin baked  indeed said robin but before he could say more the bluff cableman had returned to his bakery  just look here he continued turning again to letta the great ships around us seem like little ones by contrast and the little ones like boatsdont they  yes and the boats like toys said letta and the people in them like dolls  true little one and yonder comes a toy steamer said sam who had been contemplating the payingout gear in silent admiration with some rather curious dolls on it  oh exclaimed letta with great surprise look robin look at the horsesjust as if we were on shore  among the many surprising things on board of the big ship few were more striking for incongruity than the pair of grey carriagehorses to which letta referred taking their morning exercise composedly up and down one side of the deck with a groom at their heads  the steamer referred to by sam was one which contained a large party of hindu and parsee ladies and children who had come off to see the ship these streamed into her in a bright procession and were soon scattered about making the decks and saloons like eastern flowerbeds with their manycoloured costumesof red pink white and yellow silks and embroideries and bracelets brooches noserings anklets and other gold and silver ornaments  the interest taken by the natives in the great eastern was naturally great and was unexpectedly illustrated in the following manner captain halpin anticipating difficulties in the matter of coaling and otherwise carrying on the work of the expedition had resolved to specify particular days for sightseers and to admit them by ticket on which a small fee was chargedthe sum thus raised to be distributed among the crew at the end of the voyage  in order to meet the convenience of the upper ten of english at bombay the charge at first was two rupees about 4 shillings and it was advertised that the ship would afterwards be thrown open at lower rates but to the surprise of all from an early hour on the tworupee day the ship was beset by parsees hindus and mohammedans so that eventually on all sideson the decks the bridge the paddleboxes down in the saloon outside the cabletanks mixed up with the machinery clustering round the huge red buoys and at the door of the testingroomthe snowy robes and strange headdresses bright costumes brighter eyes brown faces and turbans far outnumbered the stiff and sombre europeans  these people evidently regarded the great eastern as one of the wonders of the world  the largest vessel ever seen in bombay said an enthusiastic parsee used to be the bates family of liverpool and now there she lies alongside of us looking like a mere jollyboat  while sam and his friends were thus standing absorbed by the contemplation of the curious sights and sounds around them one of the engineer staff who had served on board during the laying of the 1866 atlantic cable chanced to pass and recognising robin as an old friend grasped and shook his hand warmly  robin was not slow to return the greeting  frank hedley he exclaimed why i thought you had gone to california  robin wright replied the young engineer i thought you were dead  not yet returned robin im thankful to report myself alive and well  but you ought to be dead persisted frank for youve been mourned as such for nigh a couple of years  at least the vessel in which you sailed has never been heard of and the last time i saw your family not four months since they had all gone into mourning for you  poor mother murmured robin his eyes filling with tears but please god we shall meet again before long  comecome down with me to the engineroom and have a talk about it said frank and let your friends come too  just as he spoke one of the little brownfaced mohammedan boys fixed his glittering eyes on an opening in the bulwarks of the ship through which the water could be seen glancing brightly  that innate spirit of curiosity peculiar to small boys all the world over induced him to creep partly through the opening and glance down at the sparkling fluid that imperfect notion of balance not infrequent in small boys caused him to tip over and cleave the water with his head  his mohammedan relatives greeted the incident with shrieks of alarm  robin who had seen him tip over being a good swimmer and prompt to act went through the same hole like a fishtorpedo and caught the brown boy by the hair as he rose to the surface with staring eyes outspread fingers and a bursting cry  ropeends lifebuoys and other things were flung over the side oars were plunged boats darted forward fifty efforts at rescue were made in as many seconds for there was wealth of aid at hand and in a wonderfully brief space of time the brown boy was restored to his grateful friends while robin enveloped in a suit of dry clothes much too large for him was seated with his friend the engineer down among the great cranks and wheels and levers of the regions below  its well the sharks werent on the outlook said frank hedley as he brought forward a small bench for letta sam and jim slagg  you wont mind the oily smell my dear he said to letta  o no  i rather like it replied the accommodating child  its said to be fattening remarked slagg even when taken through the nose  come now let me hear all about my dear mother and the rest of them frank said robin  frank began at once and for a considerable time conversed about the sayings and doings of the wright family and of the world at large and about the loss of the cableship but gradually and slowly yet surely the minds and converse of the little party came round to the allabsorbing topic like the needle to the pole  so youre actually going to begin to coal tomorrow said sam  yes and we hope to be ready in a few days to lay the shoreend of the cable answered the young engineer  but have they not got landlines of telegraph which work well enough asked robin  landlines exclaimed frank with a look of contempt  yes they have and no doubt the lines are all right enough but the people through whose countries they pass are all wrong  why the government lines are so frequently out of order just now that their daily condition is reported on as if they were noble invalids  just listen to this he caught up a very much soiled and oiled newspapertelegraph line reports kurrachee 2nd february 6 pm cable communication perfect to fao turkish line is interrupted beyond semawali persian line interrupted beyond shiraz  and it is constantly like thatthe telegraphic disease though intermittent is chronic one can never be sure when the line may be unfit for duty  sometimes from storms sometimes from the assassination of the operators in wild districts through which the land wires pass and sometimes from the destruction of lines out of pure mischief the telegraph is often beaten by the mail  there seems indeed much need for a cable direct said sam which will make us independent of turks persians arabs and all the rest of them  by the way how long is your cable  the cable now in our tanks is 2375 nautical miles long but our companion ships the hibernia chiltern and hawk carry among them 1225 miles more making a total of 3600 nautical miles which is equal as you know to 4050 statute miles  this is to suffice for the communication between bombay and aden and for the connecting of the malta and alexandria lines  they are now laying a cable between england gibraltar and malta so that when all is completed there will be one line of direct submarine telegraph unbroken except at suez  magnificent exclaimed robin why it wont be long before we shall be able to send a message to india and get a reply in the same day  in the same day cried sam slapping his thigh mark my words as uncle rik used to say youll be able to do that my boy within the same hour before long  come sam dont indulge in prophecy  it does not become you said robin  by the way frank what about uncle rik  you have scarcely mentioned him  oh hes the same hearty old selfopinionated fellow as ever  poor fellow he was terribly cut up about your supposed death  i really believe that he finds it hard even to smile now much less to laugh  as for madge she wont believe that you are lostat least she wont admit it though it is easy to see that anxiety has told upon her  i wonder how my poor old mother has took it said slagg pathetically but shes tough an cant be got to believe things easy  shell hold out till i turn up i dessay and when i present myself shell say i knowd it  but to return to the cable said sam with an apologetic smile  is there any great difference between it and the old ones  not very much  we have found however that a little marine wretch called the teredo attacks hemp so greedily that weve had to invent a new compound wherewith to coat it namely ground flint or silica pitch and tar which gives the teredo the toothache i suppose for it turns him off effectually  we have also got an intermediate piece of cable to affix between the heavy shoreend and the light deepsea portion  there are of course several improvements in the details of construction but essentially it is the same as the cables you have already seen with its seven copper wires covered with guttapercha and other insulating and protecting substances  its what i calls a tremendious undertakin said slagg  it is indeed assented frank heartily for like all the rest of the crew from the captain downwards he was quite enthusiastic about the ship and her work  why when you come to think of it its unbelievable  i sometimes half expect to waken up and find it is all a dream  just fancy  we left england with a freight of 21000 tons  the day is not long past when i thought a ship of 1000 tons a big one what a mite that is to our leviathan as she used to be called  we had 5512 tons of cable 3824 tons of fuel 6499 tons of coal and electric apparatus and appliances when we started the whole concern ship included being valued at somewhere about two millions sterling  it may increase your idea of the size and needs of our little household when i tell you that the average quantity of coal burned on the voyage out has been 200 tons a day  its a positive romance in facts and figures said sam  a great reality you should have said remarked robin  and so romancing on this reality of facts and figures in many a matteroffact statement and figurative rejoinder they sat there among the great cranks and valves and pistons and levers until the declining day warned them that it was time to go ashore    chapter twenty four  shows the dreadful depravity of man and the amazing effects of electrical treatment on man and beast  meanwhile stumps went back to the hotel to brood over his misfortunes and hatch out the plan which his rather unfertile brain had devised  seated on a chair with his elbows on his knees his chin in his hands and his nails between his teeth he stared at a corner of the room nibbled and meditated  there was nothing peculiar about the corner of the room at which he stared save that there stood in it a portmanteau which sam had bought the day before and in which were locked his and robins bags of treasure  if i could only manage to get away by rail totoanywhere id do it he muttered  almost simultaneously he leaped from his chair reddened and went to lookout at the window for some one had tapped at the door  come in he said with some hesitation  genlman wants you sir said a waiter ushering in the identical captain who had stopped stumps on the street that day  excuse me young man he said taking a chair without invitation i saw you enter this hotel and followed you  well and what business had you to follow me demanded stumps feeling uneasy  oh nonenone at all ony i find i must sail this afternoon an ive took a fancy to you an hope youve made up your mind to ship with me  stumps hesitated a moment  well yes i have he said with sudden resolution  when must i be on board  at four sharp said the captain rising  i like promptitude  all right  dont fail me  i wont said stumps with emphasis  when the captain was gone stumps went nervously to the door and peeped out  nothing was visible save the tail of a waiters retiring coat cautiously shutting and bolting the door he took up a strong walkingcane and after some difficulty forced the lock of the portmanteau therewith  abstracting from it the two bags containing the treasures of his mates robin and sam he wrapped them in a handkerchief and put them into a canvas bag which he had purchased for the reception of his own wardrobe  taking this under his arm he went quietly out of the hotel into the street and disappeared  he was closely followed by a waiter who had taken the liberty of peeping through the keyhole when he committed the robbery and who never lost sight of him till he had seen him embark in a vessel in the harbour named the fairy queen and heard him give his name as james gibson then he returned to the hotel giving vent to his sentiments in the following soliloquyof course it is no business of yours john ribbon whether men choose to open their comrades portmantys with keys or walkinsticks but it is well for you to note the facts that came under your observation and to reveal them to them as they concernfor a consideration  but the waiter did not at that time obtain an opportunity to reveal his facts to those whom they concerned for sam robin slagg and letta did not return to the hotel but sent a pencil note to stumps instead to the effect that they had received an invitation from a telegraph official to pay him a visit at his residence up country that as he was to carry them off in his boat to the other side of the bay they would not have an opportunity of calling to bid him stumps a temporary farewell that he was to make himself as happy as he could in bombay during their absence keep on the rooms at the hotel and settle the bills and that all expenses would be paid by them on their return  as the youth by whom this message was sent knew nothing about the senders or whither they had gone and as stumps did not again make his appearance the landlord seized the few things that had been left by the supposed runaways  the invitation that had thus suddenly been given and accepted was received from a gentleman named redpath an official in the indian telegraph service  they had been introduced to him on board of the great eastern by sams friend frank hedley and he became so interested in their adventurous career that he begged them to visit his bungalow in a rather outoftheway part of the country even if only for a few days  it wont take us long to get there he said for the railway passes within thirty miles of it and ill drive you over as pretty a piece of country as you could wish to see  i have a boat alongside and must be off at once  do come  but there are so many of us objected sam shipton  pooh  i could take a dozen more of you returned the hospitable electrician and my wife rejoicesabsolutely rejoiceswhen i bring home unexpected company  what a pattern she must be said slagg but excuse me sir since you are so good as to invite us all may i make so bold as to ax if youve got a servantsall  well ive not got exactly that replied redpath with an amused look but ive got something of the same sort for my servants  why do you ask  because sir i never did sail under false colours and i aint agoin to begin now  i dont set up for a gentleman and though circumstances has throwed me along wi two of em so that weve bin hailfellerwellmet for a time i aint agoin to condescend to consort wi them always  if youve got a servantsall ill come and thank ee if not ill go an keep company wi stumps till mr shipton comes back  very well my good fellow then you shall come and well find you a berth in the servantshall said redpath laughing  but what about stumps said robin he will wonder what has come over us  could we not return to the hotel first  impossible said the electrician i have not time to wait  my leave has expired  besides you can write him a note  so the note was written as we have shown and the party set out on their inland journey  before starting however frank hedley the engineer took sam and robin aside  now think over what i have mentioned he said and make up your minds  you see i have some influence at headquarters and am quite sure i can get you both a berth on board to replace the men who have left us  i think i can even manage to find a corner for slagg if he is not particular  we shall only be too happy to go if you can manage it replied robin but stumps what about him  we cant leave stumps behind you know  well  ill try to get stumps smuggled aboard as a stoker or something if possible but to say truth i dont feel quite so sure about that matter replied frank  but shall we have time for this trip if you should prove successful asked sam  plenty of time returned his friend coaling is a slow as well as a dirty process and to ship thousands of tons is not a trifle  i daresay we shall be more than a week here before the shoreend is fixed and all ready to start  well then frank said sam adieu till we meet as shipmates  the railway soon conveyed our adventurers a considerable distance into the interior of the country  at the station where redpath and his guests got out a vehicle was procured sufficiently large to hold them all and the road over which they rapidly passed bore out the character which the electrician had given to it  every species of beautiful scenery presented itselffrom the low scrubby plain with clumps of tropical plants here and there to undulating uplands and hills  you must have some difficulties in your telegraph operations here said robin to redpath with which we have not to contend in europe  a few replied his friend especially in the wilder parts of the east  would you believe it he added addressing himself to letta that wild animals frequently give us great trouble  whenever a wild pig a tiger or a buffalo takes it into his head to scratch himself he uses one of our telegraphposts if he finds it handy  elephants sometimes butt them down with their thick heads by way of pastime i suppose for they are not usually fond of posts and wire as food  then bandicoots and porcupines burrow under them and bring them to the ground while kites and crows sit on the wires and weigh them down monkeys as usual are most mischievous for they lay hold of the wires with tails and paws swinging from one to another and thus form living conductors which tend to mix and confuse the messages  but does not the electricity hurt the monkeys asked letta  o no  it does them no injury and birds sitting on the wires are never killed by it as many people suppose  the electricity passes them unharmed and keeps faithfully to the wire  if a monkey indeed had a tail long enough to reach from the wire to the ground and were to wet itself thoroughly it might perhaps draw off some of the current but fortunately the tails of monkeys are limited  we often find rows of birds lying dead below our telegraph lines but these have been killed by flying against them the wires being scarcely visible among trees  and what about savages sir asked jim slagg who had become deeply interested in the telegraphists discourse dont they bother you sometimes  of course they do replied redpath with a laugh and do us damage at times though we bother them too occasionally  how do you manage that sir asked jim  well you must know we have been much hindered in our work by the corruptness and stupidity of eastern officials in many places and by the destructive propensities and rapacity of kurds and wandering arabs and semisavages who have found our posts in the desert good for firewood and our wires for arrowheads or some such implements  some of our pioneers in wild regions have been killed by robbers when laying the lines while others have escaped only by fighting for their lives superstition too has interfered with us sadly though sometimes it has come to our aid  there was one eccentric irishmanone of the best servants i ever had continued redpath who once made a sort of torpedo arrangement which achieved wonderful success  the fellow is with me still and it is a treat to hear flinn thats his name tell the story but the fun of it mostly lies in the expressive animation of his own face and the richness of his brogue as he tells it  i was away in the dissert somewheres he is wont to say i dont rightly remimber where for my brains no better than a sive at geagraphy but it was a wild place anyhowbad luck to it  well we had sot up a line o telegraph in it an wan the posts was stuck in the ground not far from a pool o wather where the wild bastes was used to dhrink of a night an they tuk a mighty likin to this post which they scrubbed an scraped at till they broke it agin an agin  och its me heart was broke intirely wi them  at last i putt me brains in steep an got up an invintion  it wouldnt be aisy to explain it specially to onscientific people  no matter it was an electrical arrangement which i fixed to the post an bein curious to know how it would work i wint down to the pool an hid mesilf in a hole of a rock wid a big stone over me an ferns all round about  i tuk me rifle av coorse just for company you know but not to shoot for im not bloodthirsty by no means  well i hadnt bin long down whin a rustle in the laves towld me that somethin was comin an sure enough down trotted a little deer as purty a thing as you could wish to see  it took a dhrink tremblin all the time an there was good cause for another rustlin was heard off wint the deer just as a panther o some sort jumped out o the jungle an followed it  bad luck go wid ye says i but id scarce said it whin a loud crashing in the jungle towld me a buffalo or an elephant was comin  it was an elephant  he wint an took a long pull at the pool  after that he goes straight to the post  ha says i its an owld friend o yours i see  when he putt his great side agin it for the purpose of scratchin he got a shock from my electrical contrivance that caused his tail to stand upon end and the hairs at its point to quiver  wid a grunt he stood back an gave the post a look o surprise as much as to say did ye do that apurpose ye spalpeen  then he tried it again an got another shock that sot up his dander for he twisted his long nose round the post goin to pull it down no doubt but he got another shock on the nose that made him squeal an draw back  then he lowered his great head for a charge  its all over wid ye now me post says i but the baste changed its mind and wint off wid its tail an trunk in the air trumpetin as if it had got the toothache  well after that nothin came for some time and i think i must have gone off to slape for i was awoke by a most tremendious roar  lookin up i saw a tiger sprawlin on his back beside the post  av coorse the shock wasnt enough to have knocked the baste over  i suppose it had tripped in the surprise  anyhow it jumped up and seized the post with claws an teeth whin av coorse it got another shock that caused it to jump back about six yards with its tail curled its hair all on end all its claws out an its eyes blazin  you seem to feel it says iinto meself for fear hed hear me  he didnt try it again but wint away into the bush like a warrocket  after that five or six little wild pigs came down an the smallest wan wint straight up to the post an putt his nose to it  he drew back wid a jerk an gave a scream that seemed to rend all his vitals  you dont like it thinks i but faix it looked as if i was wrong for he tried it again  another shock he got burst himself amost wid a most fearful yell an bolted  his brothers didnt seem to understand it quite  they looked after him in surprise  then the biggest wan gave a wriggle of his curly tail an wint to the post as if to inquire what was the matter  when he got it on the nose the effect was surprisin  the curl of his tail came straight out an it quivered for a minute all over wid its mouth wide open  the screech had stuck in his throat but it came out at last so fierce that the other pigs had to join in selfdefence  i stuck my fingers in my ears and shut me eyes  when i opened them again the pigs were gone  its my opinion they were all dissolved like the zinc plates in a usedup battery but i cant prove that  well while i was cogitatin on the result of my little invintion what should walk out o the woods but a man  at first i tuk him for a big monkey for the light wasnt very good but he had a gun on his shoulder an some bits o clothes on so i knew him for a human  like the rest o them he wint up to the post an looked at it but didnt touch it  then he came to the pool an tuk a dhrink an spread out his blanket an began to arrange matters for spendin the rest o the night there  av coorse he pulled out his axe for he couldnt do widout fire to kape the wild bastes off  an what does he do but go straight up to my post an lift his axe for a good cut  hallo says i pretty loud for i was amost too late  whew  what a jump he gavesix futt if it was an inch  whin he came down he staggered with his back agin the post  that was enough the jump he tuk before was nothin to what he did after  i all but lost sight of him among the branches  when he returned to the ground it was flat on his face he fell an rowlin over his head came up on his knees with a roar that putt the tigers and pigs to shame  sarves you right says i steppin out of my hole  av coorse he thought i was a divil of some sort for he turned as white in the face as a brown man could an bolted without so much as sayin farewell  the way that nigger laid his legs along the ground was a caution  ostriches are a joke to it  i picked up his blanket an fetched it home as a keepsake an from that day to this the telegraphposts have been held sacred by man an baste all over that part of the country  id like to meet wi the feller that told that yarn said jim slagg  so should i said letta laughing  you shall both have your wish for there he stands said redpath as they dashed round the corner of a bit of jungle on the other side of which lay as pretty a bungalow as one could wish to see  a manservant who had heard the wheels was ready at the gate to receive the reins while under the verandah stood a pretty little woman to receive the visitors  beside her was a black nurse with a white baby  here we are flinn said redpath leaping to the ground  all well eh  sure were niver anything else here sor replied flinn with a modest smile  ive just been relating your electrical experiences to my friends said the master  ah now its drawin the long bow youve been returned the man i see it in their face  i have rather diluted the dose than otherwise returned redpath  let me introduce mr slagg  he wishes to see indian life in the servantshall  let him see it and treat him well  yours to command said flinn with a nod as he led the horses away this way mr slug  slagg if you please mr flinn said jim  the difference between a a an a u aint much but the results is powerful sometimes  while slagg was led away to the region of the bungalow appropriated to the domestics his friends were introduced to pretty little mrs redpath and immediately found themselves thoroughly at home under the powerful influence of indian hospitality  although being in the immediate neighbourhood of a veritable indian jungle it was natural that both sam and robin should wish to see a little sport among large game their professional enthusiasm rose superior to their sporting tendencies and they decided next day to accompany their host on a short trip of inspection to a neighbouring telegraph station  letta being made over to the care of the hostess was forthwith installed as assistant nurse to the white baby whom she already regarded as a delicious dollso readily does female nature adapt itself to its appropriate channels  not less readily did jim slagg adapt himself to one of the peculiar channels of mans nature  sport was one of slaggs weaknesses though he had enjoyed very little of it poor fellow in the course of his life  to shoot a lion a tiger or an elephant was in slaggs estimation the highest possible summit of earthly felicity  he was young you see at that time and moderately foolish  but although he had often dreamed of such bliss he had never before expected to be within reach of it  his knowledge of sport moreover was entirely theoretic  he knew indeed how to load a rifle and pull the trigger but nothing more  you havent got many tigers in these parts i suppose he said to flinn as they sauntered towards the house after seeing the electrical party off  he asked the question with hesitation being impressed with a strange disbelief in tigers except in a menagerie and feeling nearly as much ashamed as if he had asked whether they kept elephants in the sugarbasin  to his relief flinn did not laugh but replied quite gravelyoch yes weve got a few but they dont often come nigh the house  we have to thravel a bit into the jungle and camp out whin we wants wan  i heard master say hed have a try at em tomorrow so youll see the fun for weve all got to turn out whin we go after tigers  if youre fond o sport in a small way howiver i can give ye a turn among the birds an small game today  theres nothing id like better said slagg jumping at the offer like a hungry trout at a fly  come along then returned the groom heartily well take shotguns an a spalpeen of a black boy to carry a spare rifle an the bag  in a few minutes the two men with fowlingpieces on their shoulders and a remarkably attenuated black boy at their heels carrying a large bore rifle entered the jungle behind the electricians bungalow    chapter twenty five  a great fieldday in which slagg distinguishes himself  now although we have said that jim slagg knew how to pull a trigger it does not follow that he knew how to avoid pulling that important little piece of metal  he was aware of course that the keeping of his forefinger off the trigger was a point of importance but how to keep it off when in a state of nervous expectation he knew not because his memory and the forefinger of his right hand appeared to get disconnected at such times and it did not occur to him just at first that there was such an arrangement in gunlocks as halfcock  flinn reminded him of the fact however when soon after entering the jungle his straw hat was blown off his head by an accidental discharge of slaggs gun  niver mention it said flinn picking up his riven headpiece while poor slagg overwhelmed him with protestations and apologies and the black boy stood behind exposing his teeth and gums and the whites of his eyes freely niver mention it mr slagg accidents will happen you know in the best regulated families  as for me beaver its better riddled than whole in this warm weather  maybe youd as well carry your gun at what sodgers call the showlder wid the muzzle pintin at the moonso thats it  dont blame yoursilf mr slagg  sure its worse than that i was when i begood for the nasty thing i carried wint off somehow of its own accord an i shot me mothers finest pigwan barrel into the tail an the other into the hid  you see they both wint off amost at the same moment  we must learn by exparience av coorse youve not had much shootin yet i suppose  poor selfcondemned slagg admitted that he had not and humbly attended to flinns instructions after which they proceeded on their way but it might have been observed that flinn kept a corner of his eye steadily on his new friend during the remainder of that day while the attenuated black kept so close to slaggs elbow as to render the pointing of the muzzle of his gun at him an impossibility  presently there was heard among the bushes a whirring of wings and up flew a covey of large birds of the turkey species  flinn stepped briskly aside saying now thin let drive while the attenuated black fell cautiously in rear  bang bang went slaggs gun  oh he cried consciencestricken there if i havent done it again  done it av coorse ye have cried flinn picking up an enormous bird it cudnt have bin nater done by a sportin lord  then it aint a tame one asked slagg eagerly  no more a tame wan than yoursilf an the best of aitin too said flinn  jim slagg went on quietly loading his gun and did not think it necessary to explain that he had supposed the birds to be tame turkeys that his piece had a second time gone off by accident and that he had taken no aim at all  after that however he managed to subdue his feelings a little and accidentally bagged a few more birds of strange form and beautiful plumage by the simple process of shutting his eyes and firing into the middle of flocks to the immense satisfaction of flinn who applauded all his successes and explained away all his failures in the most amiable manner  if the frequent expanding of the mouth from ear to ear the exposure of white teeth and red gums and the shutting up of glittering eyes indicated enjoyment the attenuated boy must have been in a blissful condition that day  why dont ye shoot yerself mister flinn asked slagg on one occasion while reloading  bekaise it shuits me better to look on answered the selfdenying man you see im used to it besides im a marciful man and dont care to shoot only for divarshion  whats that cried slagg suddenly pointing his gun straight upwards at two brilliant black eyes which were gazing straight down at him  howld onoch dont  flinn thrust the gun aside but he was too late to prevent the explosion which was followed by a lamentable cry as a huge monkey fell into slaggs arms knocked him over with the shock and bounded off his breast into its native woods shrieking  arrah hes niver a bit the worse cried flinn laughing in spite of his native politeness it was the fright knocked him off the branch if youd only given him wan shot he might have stud it but two was too much for him  but plaise mister slagg dont fire at monkeys again  i niver do it mesilf an cant stand by to see it  its so like murther an the only wan i iver shot in me life was so like me own owld granmother that ive niver quite got over it  slagg willingly promised never again to fire at monkeys and they proceeded on their way  they had not gone far when another whirring of wings was heard but this time the noise was greater than on other occasions  what is it asked slagg eagerly preparing for action  sure its a paycock said flinn  a whatcock asked slagg who afterwards described the noise to be like the flapping of a mainsail  a paycock  splendid aitin  fire avic  what fire at that cried slagg as a creature of enormous size and gorgeous plumage rose above the bushes  ye must be jokin  i couldnt fire at that  faix an ye naidnt fire at it now returned flinn with a quiet smile for its a mile out o range by this time  better luckoch if there isnt another  now thin dont be in a hurry  be aisy whatever ye do be aisy  while he spoke another huge bird appeared and as slagg beheld its size and spreading wings and tail he took aim with the feelings of a coldblooded murderer  that is to say he shut both eyes and pulled both triggers  this double action had become a confirmed habit by that time and flinn commended it on the principle that there was nothin like makin cocksure of everything  reopening his eyes and lowering his gun slagg beheld the peacock sailing away in the far distance  sure yeve missed it but after all its a most awkward bird to hit specially when ye dont pint the gun quite straight  an the tail too is apt to throw even a crackshot outso it is  niver mind theres plenty more where that wan came from  thus encouraged our sportsman reloaded and continued his progress  it is said that fortune favours the brave and on that occasion the proverb was verified  there can be no question that our friend jim slagg was brave  all irishmen are courageous therefore it is equally certain that flinn was brave and the attenuated black could not have been otherwise than brave else he would not have continued to enjoy himself in the dangerous neighbourhood of slaggs gun  as a consequence therefore fortune did favour the sportsmen that day for it brought them unexpectedly into the presence of the king of indias forestsa royal bengal tigertawny skin round face glaring eyes and black stripes complete from nose to tail  there was no doubt in flinns mind about it as his actions proved but there were considerable doubts in slaggs mind as was evinced by his immediate petrifactionnot with fear of course but with something or other remarkably similar  slagg chanced to be walking in advance at the time making his way with some trouble through a rather dense bit of jungle  he had by that time recovered his selfpossession so much that he was able to let his mind wander to other subjects besides sport  at the moment when the rencontre occurred he chanced to be wandering in spirit among the groves of pirate island  on turning sharp round a bend in the track he found himself face to face with the tiger which crouched instantly for a spring  as we have said the sportsman was instantly petrified  he could not believe his eyes  he must have believed something however else he would not have gazed with such dreadful intensity  yes there a few feet before him crouched the tenant of the menagerie without the cagethe creature of picture storybooks endued with life  had slaggs life depended on his putting his gun to his shoulder he would have lost it for he could not move  his fingers however were gifted with independent action  they gave a spasmodic jerk and both barrels chancing to be levelled correctly sent their charges full into the tigers face  small shot may tickle a tiger but it cannot kill  with a roar like thunder the brute sprang on its audacious enemy  fortunately slagg made an involuntary step to the rear at the moment and fell on his back so that the animal halfblinded by shot and smoke went over him and alighted almost at the feet of flinn  that worthy was equal to the occasion  at the sound of his friends double shot he had seized the large rifle and leaped forward in time to meet the baffled tiger  quick as light his practised hand discharged the heavy bullet which passing over the animals head went into its spine near the haunches so that when it tried a second spring its hind legs refused their office and it rolled over fuming and struggling in an agony of pain and rage  flinn ran a few paces backward so as to reload in comparative safety while slagg followed his example but in desperate haste  before he had half charged the first barrel a second shot from the heavy rifle laid the royal monster dead on the ground  well done cried flinn seizing his friends hand and wringing it its nimrod you are no less  i niver saw a purtier shot  an faix its not every man that kills a tiger his first day out  but i didnt kill it said slagg modestly  sure but ye drew first blood me boy so the tigers yours an i wish you joy  come well go home now an git help to fetch the carcass wont they open their two eyes aich of them whin they see it  here ye black spalpeen take the rifle an give me the gun  in a few minutes the fortunate hunters were wending their way rapidly homeward and that night the whole party while enjoying their supper feasted their eyes on the magnificent form of the royal bengal tiger as it lay on the verandah in front of the electricians bungalow    chapter twenty six  begins with a disappointment continues with a great reception and ends with a series of surprises  at the breakfasttable next morning a telegram was handed to redpath there was nothing unusual in this  on the contrary it seemed peculiarly natural that telegrams should be frequent visitors at the house of a telegraphist but it was not so natural that redpath should first look at the missive with surprise and then toss it across the table to sam  it is for you mr shipton  for me  impossible  i am supposed to be dead at home exclaimed sam tearing it open  oh its from frank hedley andwell he has been successful after all  listen robin  excuse me mrs redpath  may i read it aloud  by all means answered the pretty little woman who would probably have answered the same if he had asked leave to go to bed in his boots  your affair settledcontinued sam reading  great eastern starts almost immediately  come without delay  how provoking exclaimed the pretty little woman  i had counted on having you a fortnight at least  and i had counted on showing you some capital sport in our jungles where we have all sorts of large game  but of course you cannot do otherwise than obey the summons at once  of course not said sam and robin together  flinn left the room and entered the servants quarters with something like a groan  sure its bad luck has followed me iver since i left owld ireland  whats wrong with you asked slagg looking up from the slice of peacock breast with which he was regaling himself  the matter  och its bad lucks the matter  hasnt our frindship only just begood an isnt it goin to be cut short all of a suddint niver more to be renewed  in pathetic tones and with many hibernian comments the poor man communicated the news brought by the telegram  but regrets were of no avail the orders were peremptory the chance of returning to england in such circumstances too good to be lightly thrown away so that same forenoon saw the whole party with the skin of the royal tiger on their way back to the city of bombay  it is easier to imagine than to describe the state of mind into which they were thrown when on returning to their hotel they discovered the perfidy of stumps  fortunately they had enough of money left to discharge the hotel bill and redeem their property  youre quite sure of the name of the vessel he sailed in asked sam of the waiter who had so cleverly obtained and so cautiously retained his information as to the proceedings of stumps  quite sure sir replied the waiter  the ships name was fairy queen bound for the port of london and the thiefthe genlemn i meanshipped in the name of james gibson  having received the consideration which he had anticipated and had afterwards given up as lost the waiter retired and sam with his friends went to inquire after the great cable with which they now felt themselves to be specially connected  letta said robin as they went along you and i must part for a time  oh must we asked the child with a distressed look  yes but only for a very short time dear returned robin  you know we cannot get you a berth on board the great eastern  they wont even take you as chief engineer or captain  but why not as the captains daughteror his wife said letta who thoroughly understood and enjoyed a joke  because letta you are engaged to me replied robin with an offended look  o yes i forgot that  well  well what we have arranged is this  i have met with many kind people here some of whom have been greatly interested in your story and one of thema very nice lady who is going homehas offered to take you with her and deliver you safely to my mother in england there to wait till i come home and marry you  how nice exclaimed letta and youll be sure to come home soon  yes quite sure and very soon  this arrangement being deemed satisfactory was afterwards carried into effect and letta sailed a few days later in one of the regular steamers for england via the suez canal  meanwhile the great eastern still lay at her moorings completing the arrangements for her voyage  during this period our hero lived in a whirl of excitement  it seemed to himself as if he were the subject of an amazing but by no means unpleasant dream the only dark spots in which were the departure of letta and the depravity of john shanks alias james gibson alias stumps  oh  stumps stumps he soliloquised sadly one day while standing on the green in the unromantic shade of a huge bale of cotton how could you behave so after being our trusted comrade so long  never mind stumps just now said sam shipton making his appearance at the moment but come along with me at once for we have received an invitation through my good and remarkable friend frank hedley to the grand entertainment to be given tonight at the palace of the chief and bahee sahib of junkhundee  and who may that be asked robin with an incredulous smile  what know you not the great chief whose praise is in the mouths of allhindu mohammedan jew and gentile because he feeds and entertains them all like a prince  he is the creation of your own brain sam  i fancy  no indeed protested sam earnestly i do not jest  the bahee sahib is a wealthy young mahratta chieftain who has been consistently loyal to us and who entertains mixed parties of englishmen and natives in european style and does his best to break down the barriers of prejudice and caste  he has been hospitably received on board the great eastern it seems and is now getting up a grand affair in honour of captain halpin and his officers  so come along  but my dear sam you forget we have not a dress suit between us and in the present condition of our finances it would be folly to  fiddlesticks robin  we have only to make a couple of turbans out of bathtowels and a few peacock feathers turn persian shawls which we can borrow into kilts put on slippers bare our legs and paint them with red and blue stripes crossed to indicate something of scottish highland origin anoint our noses with blue bearsgrease and  nonsense sam be serious if you can and consider what we are really to do  youre so impatient robin  the thing has all been considered for us we have nothing to do but accept our fate  frank hedley who is exactly your size has a dress suit which he will lend you and a friend of his who happens to be exactly and conveniently my size has also a suit and is equally accommodating  come now for time presses and i am told the bahees wife loves punctualitybut shes liberalminded like her husband and makes allowance for laziness especially in hot weather she is a regular trump it seems and quite amazed our electricians during her visit to the big ship by her intelligent comprehension of all they explained to her  she is an accomplished equestrian and dresses as a native princess with a huge ornament in her nose but does not disdain to mingle with english ladies in the bombay rotten row and uses a european saddle  the account which sam had thus slightly sketched was more than borne out by the facts that evening  the young rajahs receptionrooms blazing with light were decorated with all that the wealth of fancy could suggest or the wealth of precious metal procure while music and perfume filled the air and intoxicated the senses  for some time sam and robin moved slowly about in the crowded rooms finding themselves rubbing shoulders now with eastern aristocrats in richest costume and glittering jewels now with englands warriors in scarlet and blue sometimes with parsees hindus mohammedans and jews in their characteristic garbs at other times with european civilians like themselves in sober black  it was a bewildering scene and the loud continuous murmur of many voices chattering in many tongues did not tend to decrease the bewilderment  what are they about over there said robin directing his companions attention to a room in which the people appeared to be observing something with great attention  i dont know  lets go and see said sam  a little polite pushing brought them into an apartment in which an english professor of conjuring who had been engaged for the occasion was exhibiting his tricks  they were poor enough and would not have commanded much applause from any audience except one that had met to enjoy whatever chanced to be provided  in another room however they found a performer of much greater capacitya man who possessed considerable powers as a musician low comedian and local satirist he was noted for his delineations of native character and succeeded in making the parsees laugh heartily at his caricature of the hindus while he convulsed the hindus with his clever skits on the parsees  he also made effective reference to the great eastern and her work bringing out the humorous aspects of telegraphy and of quick communication between india and england  come lets go and see if we can find anything to eat said sam when tired of this man  who is that asked robin as they moved through the crowd  why thats the bahee himself  see he has got hold of captain halpin and seems greatly pleased to lead him about  the rajah did indeed exhibit much satisfaction in his beaming brown face at having got hold of so noted a character as the commander of the monster ship and it was pleasant to see the almost childlike glee with which taking the captain by the hand he threaded his way through the crowd introducing him right and left to his friends  not less pleasant was it to observe the lively interest with which the natives regarded the captain when they learned who he was  at this point in the evenings proceedings a gentleman in civilian costume came up to sam shipton and asked him if he were acquainted with mr davisone of the petty officers of the great eastern  i know him slightly said sam  he has got into trouble sir said the stranger and begged me to find you if possible and take you to him  i have been on board the great eastern looking for you and was directed here  thats strange returned sam i have seldom spoken to the man  are you sure he did not send you for some one elseone of his messmates  quite sure sir  and he bade me urge you to go quickly else you may be too late  welllead the way  come robin im sorry to quit this gay and festive sceneespecially before supperbut it cant be helped  youll go with me and we can return together  the stranger seemed to hesitate a moment as if annoyed at robin being thus asked to go but as if quickly making up his mind led them out of the rajahs residence and after a smart walk conducted them into one of the poorer districts of the city  what sort of trouble has the man got into asked sam as they went along  i really do not know  he will tell you when you see him i suppose  i am only a casual acquaintance of his and came on this errand to oblige him solely because he seemed in great mental distress and was very urgent  soon the conversation turned upon cablelaying and finding that robin had been at the laying of the atlantic cable of 1856 the stranger inquired about the attempts that had been made to injure that cable  tell me now would you think it a sin he said with a peculiar look at sam to drive a nail into the cable so as to destroy it if you were offered the sum of ten thousand pounds  of course i would said sam looking at his conductor with surprise i wonder that you should ask the question  why should you wonder returned the man with a smile at any question which aims at the investigation of that great enigma styled the human mind  i am fond of the study of character and of those principles of good and evil which influence men  under given circumstances and conditions the commission of a certain sin is greatly more blameworthy than the commission of the same sin under different conditions and circumstances  do you not think so  of course i do said sam  the man who having been born and brought up among pickpockets and under strong temptation commits a theft is not nearly so guilty as the man would be who having been trained under refined and christian influences should commit a similar theft but i do not see the application of your argument for your question did not refer to the relative depth of guilt but to the sinfulness or innocence of a certain dastardly act for a tempting sum of money  i may not have put my question very philosophically returned the stranger but i would like to have your opinion as to whether you think under any circumstances of distresspoverty for instance with those dependent on one dying of hungera man would be justified in destroying the power of a telegraph cable for a sum of moneypart let us suppose paid in advance and the remainder after the deed had been accomplished  my opinion is that no circumstances whatever would justify such an act said sam with indignation  dont you agree with me robin  of course i do said robin with even greater indignation  and i quite agree with you gentlemen said the stranger with a wider smile than before but i like to have my opinions corroborated or combated by other minds  we have now reached our destination please follow me and stoop a little for the ceiling of the passage is rather low and the poor people here cannot afford to light it  the recent discussion had diverted sams mind from the character of the place into which he had been led but a suspicion which had been growing now assailed him forcibly  keep your stick handy he whispered to robin at the same time grasping more firmly a stout cudgel which he carried  these precautions seemed needless however for the stranger opening with a latchkey a door at the further end of the dark passage ushered them into a dimly lighted room where about a dozen men were seated round a table drinking and smoking  the men rose on the entrance of the visitors and received them with courtesy  mr davis will be glad to see you sir said one he has been in much anxiety but here he comes and will speak for himself  a door at the other end of the room opened and a tall slightlybuilt man entered  sam saw at once that he was not davis  fool growled the man with a savage look at the stranger who had conducted them there you have brought the wrong man  i had already begun to suspect as much returned the other with a light laugh  swallowing his disgust apparently with an effort the slim man turned to sam and said a mistake has been made sir  one or two of my friends here will conduct you to any part of the city you may wish to go to  i require no assistance said sam flushing with sudden indignation i believe that you are conspirators and will take particular note of your dwelling in order that i may spoil your game  he was about to turn and quit the room when he was suddenly seized from behind by two powerful men who seemed to have come on the scene by rising through the floor  at the same moment robin was similarly secured  they did not however submit tamely  both were strongbodied as well as highspirited and sam was large as well as strong  but what were their powers against such odds  for a few seconds they struggled furiously  then feeling that their efforts were fruitless they ceased  it is as well to go quietly my fine fellows said the slim man in a slightly sarcastic tone  we are not only more than a match for you but we happen to belong to a class of gentlemen who dont allow trifles to stand in their way  at the same time we object to murder when we can get along without it  some of us will therefore conduct you to another part of the city  now i give you fair warning if you struggle or try to make a noise on the way we will silence you in a manner that will effectually keep you quiet for ever  just have your knives handy men and dont exercise forbearance if these gentlemen turn out to be fools  a prick in their necks by the point of some sharp instrument emphasised these words to robin and sam and at the same time proved that the subordinates were quite ready perhaps even anxious to obey their superior  they suffered themselves therefore to be blindfolded and led out of the house  of course once or twice they both thought of making a sudden struggle and endeavouring to throw off their captors but the vicelike strength of the fingers that held them and the recollection of the sharp instruments near their necks induced discretion besides the absence of the sound of footsteps told them that they could not count on aid from passersby even if the dwellers in such a region had been willing to assist them which was not probable  after passing quickly along several streets the men who led them stopped and relaxed their hold  now you stand quiet for half a minute said one of them gruffly theres a knife close to each of your spines at this moment  thus warned the captives stood still for nearly a minute  then sam lost patience  well he said angrily how long do you mean to keep us here  receiving no reply he suddenly pulled the handkerchief from his eyes and assumed the pugilistic attitude with the celerity of one whose life may depend on his action but the only enemy to be seen was robin who having also pulled down the handkerchief stood staring at his comrade in mute surprise  theyre gone cried sam bursting into a fit of laughter  the villains  the scoundrels  but who can they be  i fear there can be little doubt as to what mischief they are up to  we have not the smallest clue to trace them by said robin with a vexed expression  not the smallest  i dont even know what quarter of the town we are in now returned sam  the handkerchiefs exclaimed robin with sudden animation  well what of them  theythey may have names in the corners  again the risible sam burst into a loud laugh as the idea of scoundrels possessing any handkerchiefs of their own at all much less having their names marked in the corners and poor robin whose memories of maternal care had prompted the thought felt some degree of confusion which was deepened when he discovered that the kerchiefs with which their eyes had been bound were their own  they were startled by a gruff voice demanding to know what they were laughing at and kicking up such a row at that time of the morning  it was one of the guardians of the night who became very polite on drawing nearer and being informed in a mild voice by sam that they had lost their way and would be much indebted for guidance for sam thought it best to say nothing about their adventure until they had had ample time to think it over and decide what was best to be done  having been directed how to go having lost themselves a second time and been directed again by another guardian they found themselves at last in the neighbourhood of the port and here the sound of loud voices as if engaged in some nocturnal orgies was heard in the distance  as we seem in for a night of adventure said sam we may as well accept our fate and go see what its all about  agreed said robin  hurrying forward they came upon a remarkable and picturesque scene the engineers of the great eastern had chosen the previous day for the laying of the mile of landline with which the cable was to be connected  the burying of it in its appointed home had commenced at halfpast six in the evening and had continued all through the night it was about 2 am when our adventurers came upon the scene  the trench was cut through ground on which a number of soldiers were encamped whose white tents looked ghostlike in the feeble starlight and lines of naked natives were seen waving lanterns pushing along the mysterious cable or with hands and feet busily pressing down the loose soil that covered the buried portion  the whole operation was conducted with a superabundance of noise for the burying of a rope in a trench three feet deep was in itself such a tremendous joke to the coolies that they entered upon it with much excitement as a sort of unusual piece of fun  that they were in some degree also impressed with the mysterious and important object of their work might have been gathered from their chantgood are the cablewallahs great are their names good are the cablewallahs wah wah wah great are the cablewallahs wah which they continued without intermission all through the night to their own intense delight and to the annoyance no doubt of the military unfortunates who were encamped on the ground  besides the naked fellows who in their excitement and activity resembled goodhumoured brown demons there were many other figures in english dress moving about directing and encouraging running from point to point flitting to and fro like willsothewisp for all bore lights and plunged ever and anon out of sight in the trench  between three and four oclock the work was completed tests were taken the portion of cable was pronounced perfect and communication was thus established between the cablehouse and rampart row  this was the first link in the great chain of submarine telegraphy between india and england  now robin said sam with a tremendous yawn as weve seen the first act in the play it is time i think to go home to bed  with a yawn that rivalled that of his comrade robin admitted the propriety of the proposal and half an hour later they turned in to sleepperchance to dream    chapter twenty seven  describes several important events  the laying of this thick shoreend of the cable was an important point in the great work  by that time robin and cousin sam had been regularly installed as members of the expedition and were told off with many others to assist at the operation  the chiltern carried the great coil in her tanks  after rounding colaba point into back bay she found a barge waiting to receive some twoandahalf miles of the cable with which she was to proceed to the shore  the barge resembled a huge noahs ark having a canvas awning to protect the cable which was very sensitive to heat  a measure of anxiety is natural at the beginning of most enterprises and there were some who dreaded a hitch with superstitious fear as if it would be a bad omen  but all went well  now then boysshove her along push her through said an experienced leader among the cablehands who grasped the great coil and guided it the men took up the words at once and to this species of spoken chorus shove her along push her through the snaky coil was sent rattling over the pulleywheels by the tank and along the wooden gutter prepared for it to the payingout wheel at the chilterns stern whence it plunged down into the barge where other experienced hands coiled it carefully round and round the entire deck  it is difficult to describe the almost tender solicitude with which all this was done  the cable was passed carefullyso carefullythrough all the huge staples that were to direct its course from the foretank to the wheel at the stern  then it was made to pass over a wheel here and under a wheel there to restrain its impetuosity besides being passed three times round a drum which controlled the payingout  a man stood ready at a wheel which by a few rapid turns could bring the whole affair to a standstill should anything go wrong  in the foretank eight men guided each coil to prevent entanglement and on deck men were stationed a few feet apart all along to the stern to watch every foot as it passed out  three hours completed the transfer  then the barge went slowly shoreward dropping the cable into the sea as she went  it was quite a solemn procession  first went a government steamtug flaunting flags from deck to trucks as thick as they could hang  then came the barge with her precious cargo  then two boats full of cablehands and an official gig pulled by a chinaman while the steamlaunch electric kept buzzing about as if superintending all  when the tug had drawn the barge shoreward as far as she could with safety the smaller electric took her place  when she also had advanced as far as her draught allowed a boat carried to the shore a hawser one end of which was attached to the cable  then the cablehands dropped over the sides of the barge up to waist chest or neck according to size and ranging themselves on either side of the rope and cable dragged the latter to the shore up the trench made for its reception and laid its end on the great stone table where it was made fast tested by the electricians as we have said and pronounced perfect  a few more days had to pass before the insatiable great eastern was filled with coal and reported ready for sea  then as a matter of course she wound up with a grand feasta luncheonon board at which many of the leading authorities and merchants of bombay were present with a brilliant company which entirely filled the spacious saloons  owing to circumstances said sam to robin that day over which we have no control you and i cannot be included among the guests at this approaching feast  im sorry for that sam said our hero  why so robin  does a morbid devotion to chicken and ham or sweets influence you  not at all though i make no pretence of indifference to such things but i should so much like to hear the speeches  well my boy your desire shall be gratified  through the influence of our i might almost say miraculous friend frank hedley we shall be permitted to witness the proceedings from a retired corner of the saloon in company with crockery and waiters and other debris of the feast  at the appointed time the company assembled and enjoyed as good a luncheon as money could procure  how some people do eat murmured robin from his corner to sam who sat beside him  yes for it is their nature to replied sam  after the first toast was drunk the company braced themselves to the mental work of the afternoon and although as a matter of course a good deal of twaddle was spoken there was also much that threw light on the subject of ocean telegraphy  one of the leading merchants said in his opening remarks few of those present i daresay are really familiar with the history of ocean telegraphy  ah whispered robin to sam thats the man for me  hes sure to tell us a good deal that we dont know and although i have been ransacking bombay ever since i arrived for information i dont yet feel that i know much  hold your tongue robin and listen said sam  mind your foot sir remonstrated one of the stewards assistants who had a lugubrious countenance  robin took his foot out of a soup tureen and applied himself to listen  when i reflect continued the merchant that it is now fourteen years since the first ocean telegraph of any importance was laidwhen i remember that the first cable was laid after an infinity of personal effort on the part of those who had to raise the capitalwhen i mention that it was really a work of housetohouse visitation when sums of 500 pounds to 1000 pounds and even 10000 pounds were raised by private subscription with a view to laying a telegraph cable between england and america when i reflect that the queens government granted the use of one of its most splendid vessels the agamemnon hear hear and applause and that the american government granted the use of an equally fine vessel the niagara hear hear and another round of applause directed at the american consul who was present  five glasses smashed that round growled the lugubrious waiter  when i reflect continued the merchant that the expedition set out in 1857 with the greatest hopefulness but proved a total failurethat the earnest men hear hear connected with it again set to work the following year and laid another cable applause which after passing through it a few messages of great importance to england and america hear also ceased communication which so damped the courage of all concerned that for seven or eight weary years nothing was attemptedno i should not say nothing for during that period mr cyrus field thunders of longcontinued applause during which the lugubrious waiter counted the demolition of six glasses and two dessert plates without whose able and persevering advocacy it is a question whether to this day we should have had ocean telegraphy carried out at allduring that period i say mr cyrus field never gave himself rest until he had inspired others with some of the enthusiasm that burned so brightly in himself which resulted in the renewed effort of 1865 with its failure and loss of 1213 miles of cablewhen i think of the indomitable pluck and confidence shown by such men as thomas brassey sir samuel canning sir james anderson sir daniel gooch sir richard glass mr george elliot  mr fender captain sherard osborn and othersmen of mind and men of capital and men who could see no difficultiesand i like men who can see no difficulties hear hear and loud applause  youll see more difficulties than ye bargain for if ye go through life makin people smash crockery like that growled the lugubrious waiter  when i think of these men and of the formation of the telegraph construction and maintenance company applause and the successful laying of the 1866 cable and the pickingup and completion of the old cable loud cheershm a decanter gone this time  will you take your foot out of the soup tureen sir from the lugubrious man and an impatient hush from robin  when i think of all these things and a great deal more that i cannot venture to inflict on the indulgent company go on  i feel that the toast which i have the honour to propose deserves a foremost place in the toasts of the day and that you will heartily respond to it namely success to the telegraph construction and maintenance company for that company has laid scores of cables since its formation and has now successfully commenced and will doubtless triumphantly complete the laying of the cable which we have met to celebrate todaythe fourth great enterprise i may remark which the company has undertakenthe cable that is soon to connect india with england  the merchant sat down amid thunders of applause during which the reckoning of breakages was lost and finally abandoned by the lugubrious waiter  at first robin and sam listened with great interest and profound attention and the former treasured in his memory or made pencil notes of such facts and expectations as the followingthat only nine months previously had they commenced the construction of the cable which was now about to be laid that captain halpin in the great eastern had laid the french atlantic cable that in a few weeks they hoped to connect bombay with malta and two months later with england that a few months after that england would be connected with the straits of malacca and singapore  in short said one gentleman at the close of his speech we hope that in 1871 india will be connected chiefly by submarine telegraph with china australia europe and america and that your morning messages will reach home about the same hour at which they are sent from here allowing of course for the difference in time and that afternoon and evening messages from europe will be in your hands at an early hour next morning  at this point the heat and unpleasant fumes around him began to tell upon robin and he suggested that they had better go on deck for a little fresh air  ill not budge said sam positively  why the best is yet to come  saying this to the surprise of robin sam rose went forward to the table and asked permission to make a few remarks  who is hewhat eh exclaimed the chairman  turn him out cried one  sit down cried another  no no let him speak cried a third  dont you know it is samuel shipton the great electrician  bravo go on speak out cried several voices accompanied by loud applause  gentlemen began sam in his softest voice i regard this as one of the greatest occasions ofofmy life hear hear from a fussy guest and hush hush and then we shall hear here better from an angry one  i little thought continued sam warming apparently with his subjector the heat little thought that on this great occasion i couldcouldi could would or should go on man from an impatient guest  oh sam dont stick cried robin in an agony of anxiety  whos that  put him out chorused several voices indignantly  there sir youve put your foot in it at last said the lugubrious waiter  robin thought he referred to the interruption but the waiters eyes and forefinger directed his attention to the soup tureen which in his eagerness he had sacrificed with a stamp  finding that no further notice was taken of the interruption he listened while sam continued  yes gentlemen i have some difficulty in starting but once set agoing gentlemen i can keep on like an alarum clock  what nonsense have some of you fellows been talking  some of you have remarked that you shall be able to exchange messages with england in a few hours allow me to assure you that before long you will accomplish that feat in a few minutes  pooh pooh ejaculated an irascible old gentleman with a bald head  did you say pooh sir demanded sam with a terrible frown  i did sir replied the old gentleman with a contemptuous smile  then sir take that  sam hurled a wine decanter at the old gentleman which missing its mark fell with a loud crash at the feet of robin who awoke with a start to find sam shaking him by the arm  wake up robin he said man youve lost the best speech of the evening  comecome on deck now youve had quite enough of it  yes an done enough o damage too growled the lugubrious waiter  so robin became gradually aware that sams speech was a mere fancy while the smashing of the soup tureen was a hard fact  it may not however be out of place to remark here that the prophecy made by sam in robins dream did afterwards become a great reality    chapter twenty eight  the cable laid  i say robin said samuel shipton as he encountered our hero and slagg that same evening in the streets of bombay the government land telegraph was reported this morning to have recovered its health  well what of that  i have taken advantage of the lucid interval to send a telegram to uncle rik  no doubt your father has by this time received the telegram we sent announcing our safety and arrival here so this one wont take them by surprise  but what is it about asked robin  it is sent replied sam with the intention of converting uncle rik into a thiefcatcher  that stupid waiter told me only this morning that the time he followed stumps to the harbour he overheard a sailor conversing with him and praising a certain tavern named the tartar near london bridge to which he promised to introduce him on their arrival in england so it struck me that by telegraphing to uncle rik to find out the owners of the fairy queen and the position of the tartar he might lay hold of stumps on his arrival and recover our stolen property  but i hope he wont put him in limbo sir said jim slagg  ive no objection to recover our property but somehow i dont like to have the poor fellow transported  you see i cant help thinkin he was halfcracked when he did it  he must take his chance i suppose said sam thoughtfully  however the telegram is off and if it ever reaches him uncle rik will act with discretion  i agree with jim said robin and should be sorry to be the means of ruining our old comrade  it did not strike me in that light returned sam a little troubled at the thought  but it cant be helped now  in any case i suppose he could not be tried till we appear as witnesses against him  i aint much of a lawyer said slagg but it do seem to me that they couldnt very well take him up without some proof that the property wasnt his  it may be so returned sam we shall see when we get home  meanwhile it behoves us to square up here for the great eastern starts early tomorrow and we must be on board in good time tonight  now you must not imagine good reader that we intend to drag you a second time through all the details of laying a deepsea cable  the process of laying was much the same in its general principles as that already described but of course marked by all the improvements in machinery etcetera which time and experience had suggested  moreover the laying of the indian cable was eminently we might almost say monotonously successful and consequently devoid of stirring incident  we shall therefore merely touch on one or two features of interest connected with it and then pass on to the more important incidents of our story  when robin and his comrades drew near to the big ship she was surrounded by a perfect fleet of native boats whose owners were endeavouring to persuade the sailors to purchase bananas and other fruits and vegetables paroquets sticks monkeys and fancy wares  next morning the 14th of february 1870 the great eastern lifted her mighty anchor and spliced the end of the 2375 miles of cable she had on board to the shoreend which had been laid by the chiltern  this splice was effected in the presence of the governor of bombay sir seymour fitzgerald who with a small party accompanied the great eastern a short distance on its way  then embarking in his yacht they bade godspeed to the expedition gave them three ringing cheers and the voyage to aden began  soon the cablelayers were gliding merrily over the bright blue sea at the rate of five or six knots an hour with the cable going quietly over the stern the machinery working smoothly the electrical condition of the cable improving as the sea deepened and flocks of flyingfish hovering over the crisp and curly waves as if they were specially interested in the expedition and wished to bear it company  all went well yet were they well prepared for accident or disaster as sam informed robin on the morning of the 16th while sitting at breakfast  they have got two gongs as youve observed no doubt he said which are never to be sounded except when mischief is brewing  the first intimation of fault or disaster will be a note from one of these gongs when the ship will be instantly stepped the brakes put on and the engines reversed  everything is splendidly prepared and provided for said robin hand me the sugar sam  the elasticity and good behaviour of the big ship are all that could be desired remarked one of the engineers though she carries 3000 tons more deadweight than when she started with the atlantic cable in 1865  at that moment there was a lull of consternation round the breakfasttable for a drumming upon metal was heard  for one instant there was a gaze of doubt round the table  then they rose en masse cups were upset and chairs thrown over the cabin was crossed at racing speedcaptain halpin leadingthe staircase surmounted and a rush made to the testingroom  there all was quiet and orderly the operators placidly pursuing their labours working out their calculations or watching the telltale spot of light on the scale and all looking up in silent surprise at the sudden hubbub round their door  it was a false alarm caused by the steady dripping of a showerbath on its metal bottom  that was all but it was sufficient to prove how intensely men were on the qui vive  it was a wonderful scene the deck of the great eastern incomprehensible by those who have not seen it  the cabins offices workshops and machinery formed a continuous line of buildings up the centre of the vessels deck dividing it into two streets an eighth of a mile long  at the end of one of these were the wheels and drums running from the top of the afttank to the stern and between them and the two thoroughfares were wooden houses which shut them out from view  there was a farmyard also where cattle were regularly turned out for exercise there were goats which were allowed to go free about the decks and chickens which took the liberty of doing so sometimes without leave there were parrots being taken home by the sailors which shrieked their opinions noisily and there were numerous monkeys which gambolled in mischievous fun or sat still the embodiment of ludicrous despair while intermingling with the general noise could be heard the rattle of the payingout wheels as the cable passed with solemn dignity and unvarying persistency over the stern into the sea it seemed almost unheeded so perfect and selfacting was the machinery but it was nevertheless watched by keen sleepless eyesas the mouse is watched by the catnight and day  the perfection not only achieved but expected was somewhat absurdly brought out by the electrician in the cablehouse at bombay who one day complained to the operators on board the great eastern that the reply to one of his questions had been from three to twelve seconds late  it must be understood however that although the testing of the cable went on continuously during the whole voyage the sending of messages was not frequent as that interfered with the general work  accordingly communication with the shore was limited to a daily statement from the ship of her position at noon and to the acknowledgment of the same by the electrician at bombay  one of the greatest dangers in payingout consists in changing from tank to tank when one is emptied and a full one has to be commenced  this was always an occasion of great interest and anxiety  about midnight of the 19th the change to the foretank was made and nearly every soul in the ship turned out to see it  the moon was partially obscured but darkness was made visible by a row of lanterns hung at short intervals along the trough through which the cable was to be passed making the ship look inconceivably long  as robin wright hurried along the deck he observed that both port and starboard watches were on duty hid in the deep shadow of the wheels or standing by the bulwark ready for action  traversing the entire length of the deck past the houses of the sheep and pigs past the great lifeboats past the halfclosed door of the testingroom where the operators maintained their unceasing watch in a flood of light past the captains cabin a species of landmark or halfway house past a group of cows and goats lying on the deck chewing the cud peacefully and past offices and deckcabins too numerous to mentionhe came at last to the foretank which was so full of cable that the hands ready to act and standing on the upper coil had to stoop to save their heads from the deck above  the aftertank on the contrary was by that time a huge yawning pit twentyfive feet deep lighted by numerous swinging lamps like a subterranean church with its hands like lilliputians attending to the last coil of the cable  that coil or layer was full four miles long but it would soon run out therefore all was in readiness  the captain was giving directions in a low voice and seeing that every one was in his place  the chiefs of the engineers and electricians were on the alert  every few minutes a deep voice from below announced the number of turns before the last one  at last the operation was successfully accomplished and the danger past and the cable was soon running out from the foretank as smoothly as it had run out of the other  the tendency of one flake or coil of cable to stick to the coil immediately below and produce a wild irremediable entanglement before the ship could be stopped was another danger but these and all other mishaps of a serious nature were escaped and the unusually prosperous voyage was brought to a close on the 27th of february when the great eastern reached aden in a gale of windas if to remind the cablelayers of what might have beenand the cable was cut and buoyed in forty fathoms water  the continuation of the cable up the red sea the successful termination of the great enterprise and the start of our hero and his companions for old england after their work was done we must unwillingly leave to the readers imagination    chapter twenty nine  uncle riks adventures  uncle rik seated in mr wrights drawingroom mr wright in an easychair near the window mrs wrightwith much of the lustre gone out of her fine eyeslying languidly on the sofa madge mayland at work on some incomprehensible piece of netting beside her auntall in deep mourning  uncle rik has just opened a telegram at which he stares open eyed and mouthed without

that she felt in bitterness  what is it rik said mr wright anxiously  oh nothingnothing  that is to say not bad news certainly but amazing news  boh  im a fool  he stopped short after this complimentary assertion for uncle rik had somewhere read or heard that joy can kill and he feared to become an accomplice in a murder  come rik dont keep us in suspense said his brother rising something has happened  o yes something has indeed happened cried rik for this telegram is from sam shipton  then robin is alive cried mrs wright leaping up while madge turned perfectly white  nothat is to sayyesit may be soof course must be sofor bah what an ass i am  listen  he proceeded to read sams telegram while mrs wright covered her face with her hands and sank trembling on the sofa  the telegram having suffered rather severe mutilation at the hands of the foreigners by whom it was transmitted conveyed a very confusing idea of the facts that were intended but the puzzling over it by the whole party and the gradual though not perfect elucidation of its meaning had perhaps the effect of softening the joyful intelligence to a bearable extent  now said uncle rik while the perspiration of mental effort and anxiety stood on his bald forehead this is the outcome of it all  sam clearly says all well which means of course that robin is alive thank god for that  then he refers to a previous telegram which of course must be lost for it hasnt come to hand  bah  i wonder the nasty things ever do come to hand  anyhow that telegram must have been meant to announce their safe arrival at bombay undoubtedly  of coursei see it now said mrs wright with a deep sigh  of course echoed rik  then theres some queer reference to a ship and a fiery queen and a stamps and a shunks and a gibson and a thief and three bags and the port of london which of course means london and a publichouse named apparently torture  tartar i think uncle said madge  well tartar if you like its much the same if you catch him  and it winds up with a girlwhich is not surprisinwho is to be expectorated  expected surely said madge with a rather hysterical laugh for the conflicting feelings within her tended rather to tears  so be it madgeexpected with an unreadable name beginning with an land thats all and a pretty penny he must have paid to send us such a lot o rubbish  it has brought the oil of gladness to our hearts brother said mr wright and is worth its cost  but now what do you intend to do  do exclaimed rik who was never happier than when he could explode his feelings in action  ill go this moment to the port of london find out the owners of the fiery queen make particular inquiries about the stampses shunkses and gibsons visit torture publichousesthough theyre all that more or lessand see if i can hear anything about girls to be expectorated with names beginning with l  therethese are my sailing directions soup anchor and away  uncle rik immediately obeyed his own commands and spent the remainder of that day in what he styled cruising  and he cruised to some purpose for although he failed to obtain any information as to the girl he discovered the owners of the fairynot fieryqueen who said that she was expected home in a few weeks but that they knew nothing whatever about the rather remarkable names which he submitted for their consideration  with this amount of information he was fain to rest content and returned in an elevated state of mind to his brothers house  some weeks after these events the wright family was again seated round the social board as uncle rik called it when two visitors were announced  the social meal happening to be tea and the drawingroom at that time in dishabille owing to carpet disturbances the visitors were shown into the diningrooma lady accompanied by a pretty little girl  excuse my calling at an unusual hour said the lady but i trust the occasion of my visit will be a sufficient excuse  i have just arrived from bombay and hasten to present a letter from your son and to deliver over my interesting charge this dear child letta langley whom  the expectorated girl shouted uncle rik leaping up begins with an ltwo ls indeed  bah im an idiot  excuse my excitement madam pray go on  slightly surprised but more amused the lady went on to tell all she knew about robin and his friends while the happy mother read snatches of robins letter through her tears and mr wright and madge plied the lady with questions and tea and letta taking at once to uncle rik ecstatified amazed and horrified that retired seacaptain with her charming earnest little ways her wonderful experiences and her intimate acquaintance with pirates and their habits  a letter from robin to his mother and another from sam to mr wright arrived next morning and proved to be those which had been written immediately after their landing at bombay and had been posted so the writers thought at the time their first telegram was despatched  but the letters had been given to stumps to post and stumps was not blessed with a good memory which may account for the delay in transmission these letters corroborated all the lady had said  thus was letta formally installed in the wright family and uncle rik solemnly charged himself with the discovery of her mother  depend upon it my dear he said with an amount of selfsufficient assurance and indomitable resolution that carried sweet consolation to the childs heart that ill find your mother if shes above ground though the findin of her should cost me the whole of my fortune and the remainder of my life  and nobly did rik redeem his promise  he obtained special introduction to the british museum consulted every directory in existence hunted up every widow of the name of langley in the kingdom and found the right one at last not three miles distant from his own door in london captain rik it must be known had a room in london furnished like a cabin which he was wont to refer to as his ship and his bunk but he paid that retreat only occasional visits finding it more agreeable to live with his brother  it was a fine sabbath morning when rik took lettas hand and led her into the presence of her mother  he would not let himself be announced but pushed the child into the drawingroom and shut the door  with similar delicacy of feeling we now draw a curtain over the meeting of the mother and the longlost child  its almost too much for me tough old seadog though i am this perpetual cruisin about after strange runaway craft said uncle rik as he and letta walked hand in hand along the streets one day some weeks later  here have i been beatin about for i dont know how long and im only in the middle of it yet  we expect the fairy queen in port tonight or tomorrow  but you wont hurt poor stumps when you catch him will you pleaded letta looking earnestly up into her companions jovial face  he was very nice and kind to me you know on pirate island  no ill not hurt him little old woman said rik  indeed i dont know yet for certain that stumps is a thief it may be shunks or it may be gibson you see who is the thief  however well find out before long  now then goodbye ill be back soon  he shook hands with letta at mr wrights house she and her mother having agreed to reside there until robins return home  wending his way through the streets until he reached one of the great arteries of the metropolis he got into a bus and soon found himself on the banks of the thames  arrived at the docks one of the first vessels his eyes fell on was the fairy queen  going on board the first man he met was the captain to whom he said touching his hat  excuse me captain may i ask if you have a man in your crew named stumps  no sir no such name on my books  nor one named shunks  no not even shunks replied the captain with a sternlyhumorous look as if he thought the visitor were jesting  nor gibson continued rik  yes ive got one named gibson  what dye want with him  well i have reason to believe that he isor wasa friend of a friend of mine and i should like to see him  oh indeed responded the captain regarding his visitor with a doubtful look  well gibson has just got leave to go ashore and i heard him say to one of his mates he was going to the tartar publichouse so youll see him there probably for he is not invisible ornarily  but i dont know where the tartar is  but i know returned captain rik thank you  ill go seek him there  stumps sat alone in one of the boxes of the tartar publichouse which at that hour chanced to be nearly empty  his face was buried in his hands and a pot of untasted beer stood at his elbow  poor stumps conscience had been remarkably busy with him on the voyage home  he would have given worlds to have got back to bombay return the illgotten bags and confess his guilt but it was too latetoo late  there is something very awful in these words too late  we read of and hear them often and we use them sometimes lightly it may be but it is only when they can be used by ourselves with reference to something very serious that we have a glimmering of their terrible significance there is a proverb it is never too late to mend which is misleading when the dream of life is over and the doom is fixed it is too late to mend  no doubt the proverb is meant to refer to our condition while this life lasts but even here it is misleading  when the murderer withdraws the knife and gazes it may be horrorstruck at the expressionless face of his victim it is too late  he cannot mend the severed thread of life  when the reckless drunkard draws near the end of his career and looks in the mirror and starts to see the wreck of his former self it is too late  health will never more return  not too late blessed be god for the salvation of the soul but too late for the recovery of all that was held dear in the life of earth  yes stumps had many a time while on the sea muttered to himself too late  he did so once again in that low publichouse near the docks uncle rik overheard him and a feeling of profound pity arose within him  i beg pardon he said and at the first word stumps looked quickly almost fiercely up your name i believe is gibson  no it isnti that is to saywell yes it is  sailors has got aliases you know sometimes  what dye want wi me  you were acquainted in bombay resumed captain wright very quietly as he sat down opposite to stumps with a young man named wrightrobin wright  stumpss face became deadly pale  ah  i see you were resumed the captain and you and he had something to do now with bags of some sort  the captain was as the reader knows profoundly ignorant of everything connected with the bags except their existence but he had his suspicions and thought this a rather knowing way of inducing stumps to commit himself  his surprise then may be imagined when stumps instead of replying leaped up and dashed wildly out of the room overturning the pot of beer upon captain riks legs  stumps shot like an arrow past the landlord a retired pugilist who chanced to be in the doorway  captain rik recovering darted after him but was arrested by the landlord  not quite so fast old genlman  as youve had some of your mates beer youd better pay for it  let me gostop him cried the captain struggling  as well might he have struggled in the grasp of hercules  his reason asserted itself the instant the fugitive was out of sight  he silently paid for the beer went back to the fairy queen to inform the captain that his man gibson was a thiefto which the captain replied that it was very probable but that it was no business of hisand then wandered sadly back to tell the wright family how gibson alias stumps alias shunks had been found and lost    chapter thirty  the wright family reunited and sam becomes highly electrical  that muchabused and oftneglected meal called tea had always been a scene of great festivity and goodfellowship in the wright family circumstances uncontrollable of course had from the beginning necessitated a dinner at one oclock so that they assembled round the family board at six each evening in a hungry and happy frame of body and mind which late diners would envy if they understood it with the prospect of an eveningnot bedbefore them  in the earlier years of the family the meal had been so to speak a riotous one for both robin and madge had uncontrollable spirits with tendencies to drop spoons on the floor and overturn jugs of milk on the table  later on the meal became a jolly one and still later a chatty oneespecially after uncle rik and cousin sam began to be frequent guests  but never in all the experience of the family had the favourite meal been so jolly so prolific of spoony and porcelain accidents so chatty and so generally riotous as it was on a certain evening in june of the year 1870 shortly after the return home of robin and his companions  besides the original wright family consisting of father mother robin and madge there were assembled uncle rik sam shipton mrs langley letta andnonot jim slagg  the circle was unavoidably incomplete for jim had a mother and jim had said with indignant emphasis did they suppose all the teas an dinners an suppers to say nothin o breakfasts an messmates an chums an friends crammed and jammed into one enormous mass temptation would indooce him to delay his return to that old lady for the smallest fraction of an hour  no jim slagg was not at the table but the household cat was under it and the demoralising attentions that creature received on that occasion went far to undo the careful training of previous years  the occasion of the gathering was not simple  it was compound  first it was in commemoration of robins birthday second it was to celebrate the appointment of sam shipton to an influential position on the electrical staff of the telegraph construction and maintenance company and sams engagement to marjory mayland third to celebrate the appointment of robin wright to a sufficiently lucrative and hopeful post under sam and lastly to enjoy the passing hour  ladies and gentlemen said uncle rik getting on his feet with some difficulty when the tea toast muffins eggs and other fare had blunted the appetites i rise to propose the toast of the evening and mark you i dont mean to use any butter with this toast hear from sam unless im egged on oh to do itso i charge you to charge your cups with tea since were not allowed grog in this teetotal shipthough im free to confess that i go in with you there for ive long since given up the use o that pernicious though pleasant beverage takin it always neat now in the form of cold water varied occasionally with hot tea and coffee  my toast ladies and gentlemen is rob rik put his hand to his throat to ease off his necktie is robin wright whom ive known off an on as a babby boy an man almost ever since that nightnow twenty years ago more or lesswhen he was launched upon the sea in thunder lightning and in rain  ive known him i sayever sinceoff an onand im bound to say that  the captain paused  he had meant to be funny but the occasion proved too much for him  bless you robin my lad he gasped suddenly stretching his large hand across the table and grasping that of his nephew which was quickly extended  after shaking it with intense vigour he sat promptly down and blew his nose  the thunders of applause which burst from sam and mr wright were joined in even by the ladies who in the excess of their sympathy made use of knifehandles and spoons with such manly vigour that several pieces of crockery went by the board as the captain himself remarked and the household cat became positively electrified and negatively mad inasmuch as it was repelled by the horrors around and denied itself the remaining pleasure of the teatable by flying wildly from the room  of course robin attempted a reply but was equally unsuccessful in expressing his real sentiments or the true state of his feelings but uncle rik came to the rescue by turning sharply on sam and demanding  do you really mean to tell me sir that after all your experience you still believe in telegraphs and steamboats  sam promptly asserted that he really did mean that  of course returned the captain you cant help believing in their existencefor facts are factsbut are you so soft so unphilosophical so idiotical as to believe in their continuance  thats the point ladtheir continuance  are you not aware that in course o time rust they must  an then theyll bust interpolated robin  hee hee ha giggled letta who during all this time had been gazing with sparkling eyes and parted lips from one speaker to another utterly forgetful of and therefore thoroughly enjoying her own existence  yes then theyll bust repeated rik with an approving nod at robin youre right my boy and the sooner they do it the better for im quite sick of their flashings and crashings  i rather suspect sam said mr wright that the gentlemen with whom you dined the other day would not agree with uncle rik  whom do you refer to george asked mrs wright  has he not yet told you of the grand inaugural fete as they call it that was given at the house of mr fender chairman of the telegraph construction and maintenance company to celebrate the opening of direct submarine telegraphic communication with india  not a word replied mrs wright looking at sam  you never mentioned it to me said madge with a reproachful glance in the same direction  because madge we have been so busy in talking about something else said sam that i really forgot all about it  do tell us about it now said mrs langley who like her daughter had been listening in silence up to this point  a deal o rubbish was spoken i daresay observed the captain commencing to another muffin and demanding more tea  a deal of something was spoken at all events said sam and what is more to the point an amazing deal was done  come before speaking about it let me propose a toastsuccess to batteries and boilers  amen to that said robin with enthusiasm  if they deserve it said the captain with caution  the toast having been drunk with all the honours sam began by saying that the fete was a great occasion and included brilliant company  there were present of course he said nearly all the great electrical and engineering lights of the day also the prince of wales and the duke of cambridge with a lot of aristocrats whom it is not necessary to mention in the presence of a democratic seadog like uncle rik  dont yaw about to defame me but keep to your course sam  well you have no idea what an amount of interest and enthusiasm the affair created  you all know of course that the indian cable which robin and i had a hand in laying is now connected with the lines that pass between suez alexandria malta gibraltar lisbon and england and the company assembled at mr penders house witnessed the sending of the first messages direct from london to bombay and how long do you think it took to send the first message and receive a replyonly five minutes  you dont mean it sam exclaimed rik getting excited in spite of his professed unbelief  indeed i do replied sam warming with his subject  i tell you the sober truth however difficult it may be for you to believe it  you may see it in the papers of the 24th or 25th i suppose  here is my notebook in which i jotted down the most interesting points  the proceedings of the evening were opened by the managing director in london sending a telegram to the manager at bombay  how are you all was the brief first telegram by sir james anderson  all well was the briefer first reply from bombay  the question fled from london at 918 exactlyi had my watch in my hand at the timeand the answer came back at 923just five minutes  i can tell you it was hard to believe that the whole thing was not a practical joke  in fact the message and reply were almost instantaneous the five minutes being chiefly occupied in manipulating the instruments at either end  the second message between the same parties occupied the same time  after that sir bartle frere sent a telegram to sir seymour fitzgerald the governor of bombay as followssir bartle frere wishes health and prosperity to all old friends in bombay  this was received by the companys superintendent at bombay and the acknowledgment of its receipt sent back in four minutes and fifty seconds  but the reply from the governor your old friend returns your good wishes did not come to us for thirtysix minutes because the message had to be sent to the governors house and it found his excellency in bed  next a message was sent by lady mayo in london to lord mayo at simla which with the acknowledgment of it occupied 15 minutes in transmission  of course time was lost in some cases because the persons telegraphed to were not on the spot at the moment  the prince of wales telegraphed to the viceroy of india i congratulate your excellency on england and india being now connected by a submarine cable  i feel assured this grand achievement will prove of immense benefit to the welfare of the empire  its success is thus matter of imperial interest which telegram passed out and the acknowledgment of its receipt in india was returned to london all within eleven minutes but as in the former case the viceroy was in bed so that his reply was not received till fortyfive minutes had elapsed  had the viceroy been at the indian end of the wire he and the prince could have conversed at an average rate of five minutes a sentence  many other messages were sent to and fro continued sam turning over the leaves of his notebook not only from london to india but to each of the intermediate stations on the cable line so that we had direct intercourse that night with the king of portugal the governors of gibraltar malta and aden and the khedive of egypt  but that was not all  we put the old and the new world into communication so that the press of india sent salaam to the press of america  sir james anderson also telegraphed to cyrus w field esquire the father of submarine telegraphy in my estimation hear hear from robin and he sent a reply which began your message of this evening received by me before five oclock this afternoon  mark that captain rik the message received before it was sent so to speak  ay ay ladi knowdifference of longitudefire away  well i have fired away most of my ammunition now returned sam and if you dont haul down your colours it must be because you have nailed them to the mast and are blind to reason  i may add however that the viceroy of india sent a telegram to the president of the united states to which he got a reply in seven hours and forty minutes but the slowness of this message was accounted for by the fact of accidental and partly unavoidable delay in transmission both in washington and london at 130 am of the 24th the traffic of the line became pressing and all complimentary messages ceased with one from bombay which said sun just risen delightfully cool raining  doesnt it seem as if the baron monkhausens tales were possible after all remarked mrs wright looking as if her mind had got slightly confused  the barons tales are mere childsplay mother said robin to the grand facts of electricity  thats so robin said sam still turning over the leaves of his notebook and we had some magnificent experiments or illustrations at the fete which go far to prove the truth of your remarkexperiments which were so beautiful that they would have made the eyes of letta sparkle even more gorgeously than they are doing at present if she had seen them  letta blushed returned to selfconsciousness for a moment looked down laughed looked up as sam proceeded and soon again forgot herself in a fixed and earnest gaze  the two telegraph instruments communicating with india and america which stood on two tables side by side in mr penders house were supplied by two batteries in the basement of the building  eighty cells of daniels battery were used upon the penzance circuit for india and 100 cells on the brest circuit for america  the ordinary waterpipes of the house served to connect the batteries with the earth so as to enable them to pump their electricity from that inexhaustible reservoir  i was not aware that electricity had to be pumped up through pipes like water interrupted mrs wright on whose mild countenance a complication of puzzled expressions was gradually gathering  it is not so pumped up said sam  the pipes were used not because they were pipes but because they were metal and therefore good conductors  but you havent told us about the beautiful experiments yet murmured letta a little impatiently  im coming to them little one said sam  one battery exhibited the power as well as the beauty of that mysterious force which we call electricity  it was the large grove battery  a current passed from it to copper wires in a certain manner produced a dazzling green light and the copper melted like wax  with silver a still brighter and purer green flame was the result  with platinum an intense white light was given off and the molten metal fell in globules of exceeding brilliancy  with iron lovely coruscations were exhibited the boiling vapour flying and burning in all directions and a platinum wire three feet long was in an instant melted into thousands of minute globules all this showed the power of electricity to produce intense heat when resistance is opposed to its passage  it is remarkably humanlike in that respect said captain rik in an undertone  then its power to produce magnetism continued sam was shown by lord lindsays huge electromagnet  this magnet you must know is nothing but a bit of ordinary metal until it is electrified when it becomes a most powerful magnet  but the instant the current is cut off from it it ceases to be a magnet  if you understood much about electricity said sam looking round on his rapt audience i might tell you that it is upon this power of making a piece of iron a magnet or not at pleasure that depend the morse and digne telegraph instruments but as you dont understand i wont perplex you further  well when a piece of sheet copper was passed between the poles of lord lindsays giant magnet it was as difficult to move as if it had been sticking in cheesethough it was in reality touching nothinginfluenced only by attraction  that beats your power over sam madge whispered robin no it doesnt whispered madge in reply then one most beautiful experiment i could not hope to get you to understand but its result was that a tengallon glass jar coated inside and out with perforated squares of tinfoil was filled with tens of thousands of brilliant sparks which produced so much noise as completely to drown the voices of those who described the experiment  a knowledge of these and other deep things and of the laws that govern them has enabled sir william thomson and mr cromwell f varley to expedite the transmission of messages through very long submarine cables in an enormous degree  then the aurora borealis was illustrated by a large long exhausted tube  i say sam interrupted rik dont you think theres just a possibility of our becoming a large longexhausted company if you dont bring this interesting lecture to a close  shame shame uncle rik cried robin  as the rest of the company sided with him the captain had to give way and sam went on  i wont try your patience much longer in fact i have nearly come to an end  in this long exhausted tube ten feet in length and three inches in diameter a brilliant and beautiful crimson stream was produced by means of an induction coil  in short the occasion and the proceedings altogether made it the most interesting evening i have ever spent in my life eexcept  sam paused abruptly and looked at madge  madge blushed and looked down under the tablepresumably for the catand the rest of the company burst into an uproarious fit of laughter in which condition we will leave them and convey the reader to a very different though not less interesting scene    chapter thirty one  describes a happy home and a happier meeting  in a small wayside cottage in the outskirts of one of those picturesque villages which surround london an old woman sat at the head of a small deal table with a black teapot a brown sugarbasin a yellow milk jug and a cracked teacup before her  at the foot of the same table sat a young man with a large knife in one hand a huge loaf of bread in the other and a mass of yellow butter in a blue plate in front of him  the young man was james slagg the old woman was his mother  jim had no brothers or sisters and his father chanced to be absent at market so he had the old lady all to himself  well well jim said mrs slagg with a loving look at her sons flushed face youve told me a heap o wonderful tales about telegrumphs an tigers an electricity an what not  if you was as great a liar as you was used to be jim i tell ee plain lad i wouldnt believe one word on it  but youre a better boy than you was jim an i do believe youindeed i do though i must confess that some on it is hard to swallow  thank ee mother said jim with a pleasant nod as he cut an enormous slice from the loaf trowelled upon it a mass of the yellow butter and pushed in his cup for more tea  it was good of ye jim said the old woman to leave all yer fine friends and come straight away here to see your mother  good o me ejaculated jim with his mouth fulltoo full we might saywhat goodness is there in a feller goin home eh  whos finer i should like to know than a fellers mother  well you are a good boy jim said the old woman glancing at a superannuated clock which told of the moments in loud almost absurd solemnity but if you dont stop talkin and go on wi your eatin youll lose the train  true mother  time and tide they say wait for no man but trains is wuss than time or tide they wont even wait for a woman  but why go at all today jim wont tomorrow do  no mother it wont do  i didnt mean to tell ee till i came back for fear it should be a mistake but i cant keep nothin from you old lady so i may as well ease my mind before i go  the fact is ive just heard of the whereabouts of john shanksstumps you knowmy old mate that ive told you bolted with all our treasure from bombay  ah mother if id only brought that treasure home wi me its a lady youd have bin today  i had all sorts o plans for youa coach an six was  never mind your plans jim but tell me about poor stumps  well mother a tramp came past here an had a bit of a talk wi me yesterday  you know i ginerally have a bit of a chat wi tramps now ever since that city missionarygod bless himpulled me up at the docks an began talkin to me about my soul  well that tramp came here early this mornin sayin hed bin in a poor womans house in the city where there was a man dyin in a corner  while he was talkin with some o the people there he chanced to mention my name an observed that the dyin man got excited when he heard it and called to the tramp and asked him about me and then begged him for love and for money which he offered him to come and fetch me to him as fast as he could sayin that his name was stumps and he knew me  so you see as the next train is the first thatyou neednt look at the clock so often old lady its full ten minutes yet and ill back my legs to do it in three  dont forget to take your bible wi you dear boy  jim slagg rose with a pleasant nod slapped the breast of his coat on which the oblong form of a small book in the pocket could be traced said goodday mother and left the cottage  it was not long before he stood in the dark passage which led to the room described to him by the tramp  the old woman who rented it gave him her unasked opinion of her lodger before admitting him  youve got no notion sir what a strange character that young man is  o yes i have let me see him said slagg  but sir continued the landlady detaining him you must be careful for he aint hisself quite  not that hes ever done anythink wiolent to me poor young man but hes strong in his fits an he raves terribly  has no doctor bin to see him asked slagg  no he wont let me send for one  he says its o no use an he couldnt afford to pay for one  an oh youve no notion what a miser that poor young man is  he must have plenty of money for the box as he takes it out onan its at his head he keeps it day and night ginerally holdin it with one handseems full o money for its wonderful heavy  i could see that when he brought it here an theres no cloes in it that i can see when he opens it to get at the few pence he wants now an again  an he starves hisself an says hes not fit to live an calls hisself sitch awful names an  well well show me his room said slagg with as much decision in his tone as compelled immediate obedience  in the corner of a small room on a trucklebed with scant bedding lay the emaciated form of john shanks alias stumps alias james gibson he had raised himself on one elbow and was gazing with great lustrous invalid eyes at the door when his old comrade entered for he had been watching and heard the first sound of footsteps in the passage  oh  jim slagg he cried extending a hand which bore strong resemblance to a claw it was so thin  come to me jim how ive wished an longed an  he stopped and burst into tears for he was very weak poor fellow and even strong men weep when their strength is brought low  come now stumps said slagg in a serious voice as he sat down on the bed put an arm round his old comrades thin shoulders and made him lie down if you go to excite yourself like that illillquit the room an i wont come back for an hour or more  no  o no exclaimed the sick man clutching slaggs arm with a trembling grip dont leave me jimdont dont  i shall die if you do  im dyin anyhow but it will kill me quicker if you go  well i wont go  there keep quiet my poor old stumps  yes thats itthats iti like to hear the old name murmured the sick man closing his eyes  say it again jimsay it again  stumps said slagg getting down on his knees the better to arrange and grasp his former comrade dont be a fool now but listen  i have come to look after you so make your mind easy  but ive been such a beast to you jim it was so awful shabby cried stumps rousing himself again and ive been so sorry ever since you cant think how sorry  i have repented jim if ever a man did an id have come back and confessed long ago if id had the chance but i can get no restno peace  ive never spent a rap of it jim except what i couldnt helpfor you know jim body an soul wouldnt stick together without a little o suthin to eat an drink an when i was ill i couldnt work you know  see its all hereall hereexcept what little  he stopped abruptly having raised himself to open the lid of the box at his elbow but his strength failed and he sank on the pillow with a groan  stumps said slagg come old boy you an me will have a bit of prayer together  the sick man opened his great eyes in astonishment  it was so unlike his old friends brusque rollicking character to propose prayer that he fancied he must be dreaming and the possibility of the visit turning out unreal induced an expression of distress on his haggard countenance  on being ordered however in the peremptory and familiar tones of former days to shut his eyes he felt reassured and became calm while his friend prayed for him  it was not a set or formal prayer by any means  it sounded strangely like a man asking a friend in commonplace terms but very earnestly to give him what he stood in great need of and what jim asked for was the salvation of his friends soul and his restoration to health  the petition therefore was remarkably brief yet full of reverence for jim though naturally blunt and straightforward felt that he was addressing the great and blessed god and saviour who had so recently rescued his own soul  after saying amen which the sick man echoed slagg pulled out his bible and read through the fourteenth chapter of johns gospel commenting quietly as he went along while his comrade listened with intense earnestness  at the first verse jim paused and said this wasnt written to holy and sinless men  let not your heart be troubled was said to the disciples one o them bein peter the man who was to deny jesus three times with oaths and curses and then forsake him  the lord came to save sinners  it would be a poor lookout for you stumps if you thought yourself a good man  but i dontoh  i dont and you know i dont exclaimed the sick man vehemently  then the lord says let not your heart be troubled and tells you to believe in god and himself  at the second verse slagg remarked that it would be a sad sad thing if the mansion prepared among the many mansions for his friend were to be left empty  but how am i to get to it jim how am i ever to find the way  just what the disciple named thomas askedan he was a very doubting follower of jesus like too many of us  the master said to him what he says to you and me i am the way and the truth and the life no one cometh unto the father but by me  at the ninth verse the sailormissionary said jesus is god you see so were safe to trust him and at the thirteenth verse whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will i do he said  now we have asked jesus to save you and he will do it by his holy spirit as he has saved mehas saved millions in time past and will save millions more in time to come  why you see in the sixteenth verse he tells you he will pray the father to send you a comforter who will stay with you for ever  has he not reason then for beginnin with let not your heart be troubled  and that same comforter the holy spirit is to teach us all things so you see every difficulty is taken out of our way arise let us go hence  now my old messmate i have arisen  will you not arise and go with me both of us looking unto jesus  i willgod helping me cried the sick man literally arising from his couch and raising both arms to heaven  there nowthank the lord but you must lie down again and keep quiet said jim gently and kindly forcing his friend backward  stumps did not resist  he closed his eyes and the restful feeling that had suddenly arisen in his heart when he said the momentous words i will coupled with exhaustion resulted almost instantaneously in a quiet slumber  when did he eat last asked slagg of the old woman in a low voice for he had been taught or had learned intuitively that few things are more disheartening in a sickroom than a whisper  this morning he breakfasted at six but it was ony a haporth o bread and a drink o cold water  and how dare you starve your lodger in that way demanded slagg leading the astonished woman into the passage and closing the door dont you know that starving a man is equal to murdering him and that youll be liable to be hung if he dies  there take this halfsov and be off to the nearest shop an buylet me seesassengers and steaks andoh you know better than me what a sick man wants  get along with you and be back sharp  stay where are your matches  ah  any coals  good now away with you and fetch a doctor too else ill fetch a policeman you bolster of bones  thus ordered threatened and adjured the landlady halfamused and more than halffrightened at the visitors gushing energy hurried from the house while slagg returned to the miserable room and did his best to render it less miserable by kindling a splendid fire  it is perhaps unnecessary to add that a breakfast soon filled that room with delicious odour such as had not been felt in that lowly neighbourhood for many years that stumps after a refreshing sleep partook of the feast with relish that jim slagg also partook of itof most of it indeedand enjoyed it to the full that the old landlady was invited to fall to and did fall to with alacrity that the domestic cat also managed to fall to surreptitiously without invitation and not the less enjoyably on that account that a miserable semifeatherless but unconquerable canary in a cage in the window took care that it was not forgotten and that several street boys smelling the viands from afar came round the outer door became clamorous and were not sent empty away  it may however be advisable to add that stumps did not die that joy of heart good feeding andperhapsthe doctor brought him round and that he afterwards went to the country to spend the period of convalescence in the cottage by the roadside with slaggs mother    chapter thirty two  in which the story finds a fault and the electrical current ends  now it is not in the nature of things that man in his present state should attain to full satisfaction  he may indeed he should attain to contentment but as long as there are higher and better things within his reach he must of necessity remain in some degree unsatisfied  some such idea must have been passing through robin wrights brain one fine morning as he slowly paced the deck of a small schooner with his friend sam shipton for he suddenly broke a prolonged silence with the following remark  i dont know how it is sam but although i am surrounded with everything that should make a fellow happy imim not happy  in fact im as miserable as it is possible to be  come now robin dont exaggerate said sam in a remonstrative tone hyperbole is very objectionable especially in young men  you know that if you were tied to a huge gridiron over a slow fire you would be more miserable than you are at present  robin smiled and admitted the truth of this but nevertheless reiterated his assertion that he was decidedly unhappy  this conversation we may remark took place on board of sam shiptons yacht off the west coast of scotland several years after the events narrated in the previous chapter  well now it is strange said sam with an earnestly sympathetic air and tone of voice but with the faintest possible twinkle in the extreme corner of one of his eyes  let me seeeverything as you justly remark ought to make you happy here  the weather to begin with people always begin with the weather you knowis splendid though there is a thundery look about the horizon to the westard  then our yacht the gleam is a perfect duck both as to her seagoing and sailing qualities and captain james slagg is a perfect seaman while stumps is a superlative steward and cook  our time is our own and the world before us where to choose  then as to our companionship what female society could be more agreeable than that of my wife madge and her bosom friend letta who since she has grown up has become one of the most beautiful fascinating charmingbut why go on when in the language of the poet adequate words is wantin  and lettas mother is second only to herself  then as to the men could there be found anywhere finer fellows than uncle rik and ebenezer smith and frank hedleyto say nothing of myself and our splendid little boy sammy  i cant understand it robin  youre not ill are you  ill no  never was better in my life  well then what is it  be confidential my boy  the witching hour of sunrise is fitted for confidential communications  youre not in love are  hush sam the skylight is open  come forward to the bows  yes sam i am in love  well robin i cant pretend ignorance for i know itat least i have seen it  seen it echoed robin how is that  i have never by word or look given the slightest indication to any one of the state of my feelings  true robin as regards words but there are other modes of indication as must be wellknown to a celebrated electrician like yourself  the fact is my dear boy that you and letta have been rubbing your intellects together for so many years that you have electrified each otherthe one positively the other negatively and even a manx cat with an absent mind and no tail could hardly fail to observe the telegraphic communication which you have established by means of that admirable duplex instrument a pair of eyes  you distress me very much sam returned robin seriously  i assure you i have never consciously done anything of the sort and i have never opened my lips to letta on the subjecti dare not  i believe you as to your consciousness but to be serious robin why should being in love make you miserable  because it makes me doubt whether letta cares for me  nonsense robin  take my advice put an end to your doubts and make sure of your ground by taking heart and proposing to letta  i dare not sam  it is all very well for a fine manly fellow like you to give such advice but i am such a poor miserable sort of  hallo fasser cried a merry voice at that moment how red de sun am  the owner of the voicea mere chip of a child in perfect miniature middy costumeran up to its father and was hoisted on his shoulder  yes the sun is very red like your own face sammy my boy to say nothing of cousin robins  where is mamma  the question was answered by mamma herself our old friend madge mayland coming up the companionhatchtall dark beautiful like the spirit of departed night  she was followed by lettagraceful fair sunny like the spirit of the coming morn  sunbeam ahoy came up through the cabin skylight at that moment like the sonorous voice of neptune  well grunkle rik wat is it shouted sammy in silvery tones from his fathers shoulder  grunkle was the outcome of various efforts made to teach sammy to call the old captain granduncle  where have you stowed away my hairbrush you rascal cried the voice of thunder  its under my bunk grunkle i was bracking yous boots with it  the thunder subsided in tempestuous mutterings and sammy feeling that he had begun the day well struggled out of his fathers arms and went careering round the deck into every possible position of danger  he kept them all lively until stumps caught him and extinguished him for a time with breakfast  uncle rik said sam while that meal was being discussed in the snuggest little cabin that could be imagined did you hear of the extraordinary manner in which a whale was caught by a telegraph cable lately  no i didnt sam an whats more i wouldnt believe it if i did  it is true nevertheless said sam breaking his fifth eggsea breezes being appetising  how did it happen sam asked madge  in a very curious manner madge  it will amuse letta for i know she takes a deep interest in cables  indeed it will said letta who was the soul of earnest simplicity i delight in electric cables  robin looked at letta and wished that he were an electric cable  it happened to the persian gulf cable quite recently continued sam addressing himself to letta  the cable between kurrachee and gwadur a distance of 300 miles suddenly failed one evening  now you must know that electrical science has advanced with such rapid strides of late that we have the power to discover pretty nearly the exact position of a fault in a cable  of course i cannot expect a young lady to understand the technical details of the mode in which this is done but you will understand that by tests taken at either end the damage appeared to be about 118 miles from kurrachee and a telegraph steamer was sent with an electrical and engineering staff to repair it  the steamer reached the supposed locality early on the morning of the second day out and proceeded at once to grapple for the cable though a thick fog prevailed at the time and a heavy sea was running  the soundings at the place were very irregular implying a rugged bottom of submarine mountaintops and valleys  on winding in the cable unusual resistance was experienced as if it were foul of rocks and when after great difficulty they drew it up they found that this was caused by the body of an immense whale with two and a half turns of the cable round it immediately above the tail  pooh boh exclaimed uncle rik i dont believe it  but i do uncle returned sam as he opened his sixth egg for i read the account of it in one of the engineering journals in which dates and names were given  the steamer was the amber witch commanded by captain bishop and the staff of operators were under mr harry mance  the body of the huge creature was found to be rapidly decomposing the jaws falling away as it reached the surface and sharks had evidently been devouring it  the tail which measured twelve feet across was covered with barnacles at the extremities  but how could it have entangled itself so asked mrs langley  they suppose that at the time the whale had found a part of the cable hanging in a deep loop over a submarine precipice and thinking the chance a good one no doubt for scraping off the barnacles and other parasites that annoy whales very much had probably twisted the cable round him with a flip of his tail  anyhow the fact is unquestionable that it held him fast until he was fished up dead by the electricians and engineers  how strange murmured letta  it is indeed responded robin the most extraordinary case i ever heard of though cables are subject to many singular accidents  i remember one case of accident to the cable across the river yar in the isle of wight  a bullock fell from the deck of a vessel and in its struggles caught the cable and broke it  i have read of several very singular cases said sam in which cables have been attacked and damaged by inhabitants of the sea  the cuba and florida cable was once damaged by the bite of some large fish and a similar accident happened to the china cable  in the maltaalexandria cable a piece of the core from which the sheathing had been worn was found to have been bitten by a shark and pieces of the teeth were found sticking in the guttapercha  i thought it was to the singapore cable that that happened said robin  no but something similar happened to it  that cable was laid in december  in the following march a stoppage occurred  the fault was spotted at 200 miles from singapore  when hauled up the cable was found to have been pierced and bits of crushed bone were sticking in the hole  the piece was cut out and sent to mr frank buckland who after long and careful examination came to the conclusion that it had been the work of a sawfish  dear me mr shipton said mrs langley you speak as if every part of the world were connected by electric cables  and such is the case said sam we have now direct communication by submarine cable and land telegraph with every part of europe with canada and the united states down south america nearly to cape horn with africa from algiers to the cape of good hope with india from afghanistan to ceylon with china from pekin to hongkong and down through the malacca archipelago australia and tasmania  i say sam are you a member of the royal geographical society or a walking atlas asked uncle rik  in short continued sam not heeding the interruption there isnt a civilised quarter of the globe which is not tied to us by telegraph and from which we might not hear any morning of the events of the preceding day  always excepting central africa and the two poles said the captain  i said civilised quarters retorted sam and as far as i know the poles are inhabited only by bears  true i forgot the poles are barely civilised said uncle rik  now master sammy growled a deep voice from the adjoining galley you keep your hands out o that copper  fasser shouted a silvery voice from the same region tumps is naughty  i wants to wass my hands in de soup an he wont let me  quite right  keep him in order stumps said the unfeeling sam senior  derepa says is kite right an to keep you in order tumps said the silvery voice  then after a few minutes grunkle rik is you finish bekfist  ay ay sunbeam quite finished  den come on deck an pay vid me  uncle rik rose with a laugh and obediently went on deck to play  but the play did not last long for that day ominous clouds rose in the west and overspreading the sky soon drenched the little yacht with rain  towards evening the rain ceased but the wind increased to a gale and the weather showed signs of becoming what is known among seamen we believe as dirty  ere long the low mutterings of thunder increased to mighty peals and the occasional gleams of lightning to frequent and vivid flashes that lit up the scene with the brilliancy of full moonlight  i wish we were nearer shore said letta timidly to robin as they stood looking over the bulwarks what is the land we see far away on our left  the island of mull returned robin  better if it was further away growled captain rik who overheard the remark  we want plenty of searoom on a night like this  weve got searoom enough observed captain slagg with the confidence of a man who knows well what he is about as he stood by the tiller balancing himself with his legs well apart  youve got a lightning conductor on the mast of course observed captain rik to sam  no replied sam  sam exclaimed the captain in a tone of intense surprise you of all men without such a safeguard  well uncle rik replied sam with a laugh yachts are not always fitted with conductors  but im not so bad as you think me  i had ordered a special conductor with some trifling novelties of construction for the yacht but it was not ready when we started so we had to sail without it  however it is not once in a thousand times that a vessel is struck by lightning  while sam was yet speaking a flash of lightning almost blinded them and the little schooner received a shock which told of disaster  next moment the roar of reverberating thunder drowned the crash of timber as the topmast went overboard carrying the bowsprit and its gear along with it  fortunately no one was hurt but the schooner became unmanageable owing to the mass of wreckage which hung to her  jim slagg seizing an axe sprang to the side to cut this away ably seconded by all the men on board but before it could be accomplished the gleam had drifted dangerously near to the rocks on the coast of mull  to add to the confusion the darkness became intense  captain rik forgetting or ignoring his years had thrown off his coat and was working like a hero with the rest  the ladies unable to remain below were clinging to the stern rails madge holding her little boy tightly in her arms and the spray dashing wildly over all  another moment and the gleam struck on the rocks with tremendous violence  only by the lightning could they see the wild rocky shore on which they had drifted  instinctively each member of the little crew drew towards those nearest and dearest  get out the boat shouted captain slagg but the men could not obey for a heavy sea had anticipated them and the little dinghy was already careering shoreward bottom up  the next wave lifted the gleam like a cork and let her down on the rocks like fiftysix tons of lead  a flash of lightning revealed for a moment a range of frowning cliffs as if to add horror to a scene that was already sufficiently appalling  then all was again dark as erebus  in a frenzy of resolution captain rik seized an axe with the view of extemporising a raft when the gleam parted amidships and we might almost say went out leaving her crew struggling in the waves  sam had seized his wife with his strong left armhe happened to be lefthandedand buffeted the waves with his right  madge held on to sammy with the power of maternal love  sam was aware of that and felt comparatively at ease in regard to his firstborn  robins arm had been round lettas waistunknown to himself or her when the gleam struck  it did not relax when he felt that they were afloat  frank hedley gallantly offered to take charge of mrs langley  ebenezer smith being unable to swim confessed the fact with something of a gasp to captain rik who considerately told him never to mind  i can swim for both he said tying a piece of ropeyarn tight round his waist for he had long before cast off coat vest and braces but you ought to be ashamed of yourself a man come to your time o life an not able to swim  i never lived near the sea and had no one to teach me pleaded ebenezer in a tremblingly apologetic voice for the roar of united wind waves and thunder was really tremendous even to those who could swim  what o that returned captain rik sternly  was there no river or pond nigh  even a horsetrough or a washingtub would have sufficed to make a man of you  as for teachingwhat teaching did you want swimmin aint latin or greek  it aint even mathematicsonly aquatics  all the brute beasts swimeven donkeys swim without teaching  boh bah  there lay hold o meso  now mind if you try to take me round the neck with your two arms ill plant my fist on the bridge of your nose an let you go to davy joness locker  a flash of lightning revealed captain riks face in such a way that ebenezer smith resolved to obey him to the letter  it was at this point of their conversation that the gleam went downor outand they sank with a gurgle coming up next moment however with a gasp  strange to say after the first plunge and overthrow amid the boiling waves the swimmers found themselves in almost still water  youd better let me take sammy maam said captain slagg swimming quietly alongside of madge and speaking in the calm tone of a man taking an evening stroll  is that you slagg asked sam who was striking out vigorously  yes sir it is said slagg  youve no need to exert yourself sir so violently  i know the spot well  weve bin washed clean over the reef by the wave that sank us into a sort o natral harbour an we aint far from shore  i can feel bottom now sir which bein a sixfooter youll touch easy  so i do exclaimed sam letting down his feet  madge darling cheer up weve got soundings  give sammy to slagg  there well do famously now  only those who have been for a few moments in deadly peril can understand the feeling of intense relief that came to sam shiptons heart when he felt his toes touch ground on that eventful night  the feeling was expressed in his tone of voice as he asked slagg whether he had seen any of the others  no sir i aint seen em for want o light but ive heerd em stumps is splutterin behind us like a grampus  if youll hold on a bit an listen youll hear him  hes a bad swimmer and its all he can do to save hisself  if he only knowed he could reach bottom with his long legs hed find it easier  not quite so tight sammy my boy and keep off the windpipeso youre quite safe my lad  as for the rest of em sir they all swim like ducks except mr ebbysneezer smith but hes took charge on by captin rik so you may keep your mind easy theres a bit o flat beach hereabouts an no sea inside the reef so well git ashore easy enoughlets be thankful  jim slagg was right  they got ashore without difficulty and they were thankfulprofoundly sowhen they had time to think of the danger they had escaped  after a few minutes rest and wringing of salt water from their garments they proceeded inland to search for shelter and well was it for the shipwrecked party that the captain of the lost yacht was acquainted with the lie of the land for it was a rugged shore with intermingled fields and morasses and wooded rocky heights among which it would have been difficult if not impossible to thread ones way in the dark without severe damage to the shins  but jim slagg led them to a cottage not far from the sea where they received from the family resident there at the time a warm and hearty scottish welcome  it is not uncommon we suspect for eccentric natures to undertake the most important matters at the most unsuitable times and in the most ridiculous manners  at all events robin wright while stumbling among the rocks and rugged ground of that midnight march in mull dripping wet and with the elements at war around him conceived the idea of declaring his unalterable not to say unutterable attachment to letta langley who leant heavily on the arm of her preserver  but robin was intensely sensitive  he shrank from the idea which he had only got the length of conceiving as if it had been a suggestion from beneath  it would be unfair mean contemptible he thought to take advantage of the darkness and the elemental noise to press his suit at such a time  no he would wait till the morrow  he did wait for the morrow  then he waited for the morrow afterwards and as each morrow passed he felt that more morrows must come and go for it was quite obvious that letta regarded him only as a brother  at last unable to bear it our unhappy hero suddenly discovered that one of the morrows was the last of his leave of absence so he said goodbye in despair and parted from his companions who could not resist the genial hospitality of their new friends in the cottage on the west of mull  ten days later sam got a letter from robin telling him that he had received a cabletelegram from india from their friend redpath offering him a good situation there and that having reached the lowest depths of despair he had resolved to accept it and was sorry he should not have an opportunity of saying goodbye as he was urged to start without a days delay  sam was staying with his friends at the oban hotel at the time having at last managed to tear himself away from the cottage in mull  he instantly ran out and telegraphed  dont accept on any account  then he sought mrs langley and opened robins case to her  mrs langley listened with a smile of intelligence and soon after went to her daughters room the window of which commanded a splendid view of the western sea  letta dear are you moralising or meditating  both mamma  well i will try to help you said mrs langley seating herself by the window  by the way did you hear that mr wright has been offered a lucrative appointment in the telegraph department of india and is going off at oncehas not time even to say goodbye to his old friend sam shipton  letta turned very pale then extremely red then covered her face with both hands and burst into tears  so letta you love him said her mother gently  why did you not let me know this sooner  oh mamma said poor letta why do you put it sososuddenly  i dont love himthat isi dont know that i love him  ive never thought about it seriously  he has never opened his lips to me on the subjectandand  letta dear said her mother tenderly would you wish to prevent his going away if you could  open your heart to your mother darling  letta laid her head on her mothers shoulder but spoke not  a few minutes later mrs langley went to sam and said  robin must not go to india  sam instantly went by the shortest conceivable route to london where he found robin in his room feverishly packing his portmanteau and said  robin you must not go to india  from that text he preached an eloquent laysermon which he wound up with the words now my boy you must just propose to her at once  but i cant sam  i havent got the pluck  im such a miserable sort of fellowhow could i expect such a creature to throw herself away on me  besides its all very well your saying you have good ground for believing she cares for me but how can you know  of course you have not dared to speak to her  robin looked actually fierce at the bare idea of such a thing  no i have not dared said sam  well then  it is merely your goodnatured fancy  no my dear fellow it is my fate  i must bow to it  and i know that if i were to wait till i see her again all my courage would have oozed away  but i dont intend that you shall wait robin interrupted sam  you need not go on talking so selfishly about yourself  you must consider the girl  im not going to stand by and see injustice done to her you have paid marked attention to her and are bound in honour to lay yourself at her feet even at the risk of a refusal  but how sam  i tell you if i wait  then dont waittelegraph  robin gazed at his friend in stupefied amazement  what make a proposal of marriage by telegraph  even so robin  you began life with electricity so it is quite in keeping that you should begin a new departure in life with it  sam rose sought for paper and with pencil wrote as followsfrom mr r wright london to miss letta langley  hotel obani can stand it no longer  may i come to see you  presenting this to his friend sam said may i despatch it  robin nodded smiled and looked foolish  an hour later mrs langley sitting beside her daughter took up a pen and wrote as follows  from miss letta langley oban to r wright londonyes  presenting this to her daughter she said  may i send it  letta once more covered her face with her hands and blushed  thus it came to pass that our heros fate in life as well as his career was decided by the electric telegraph  but the best of it was that robin did go to india after allas if to do despite to his friends who had said he must not go  moreover he took letta with him and he hunted many a day through the jungles of that land in company with his friend redpath and his henchman flinn and long afterwards he returned to england a sturdy middleaged man with a wife whose beauty was unabated because it consisted chiefly in that love of heart to god and man which lends neverfading loveliness to the human countenance  awaiting them at home was a troop of little onesthe first homeinstalment of a troop of lesser ones who accompanied the parent stems  all of these besides being gifted with galvanic energy and flashing eyes were impressed with the strong conviction strange to say that batteries boilers and submarine cables were the most important things in the whole world and the only subjects worth being played at by reasonable human children  the end
