 jonathan swift dd  edited by  temple scott  with a biographical introduction by  the rt hon w e h lecky mp  vol iii  1898   swifts  writings on religion and the church  vol i  edited by  temple scott  1898     preface   the inquiry into the religious thought of the eighteenth century forms one of the most interesting subjects for speculation in the history of the intellectual development of western nations it is true that in that history swift takes no special or distinguished part but he forms a figure of peculiar interest in a special circle of his own swift had no natural bent for the ministry of a church his instincts his temperament his intellect were of that order which fitted him for leadership and administration he was a born magistrate and commander of men it is therefore one of the finest compliments we can pay swift to say that no more faithful no more devoted no stauncher servant has that church possessed for we must remember the proud and haughty temper which attempted to content itself with the humdrum duties of a parish life swift entered the service of that church at a time when its need for such a man was great and in spite of its disdain of his worth in spite of its failure to recognize and acknowledge his transcendent qualities he never forgot his oath and never shook in his allegiance to any one however who reads carefully his sermons his thoughts on religion and his letter to a young clergyman there comes a questionwhether for his innermost conscience swift found a satisfying conviction in the doctrines of christianity i am not answerable to god he says for the doubts that arise in my own breast since they are the consequence of that reason which he hath planted in me if i take care to conceal those doubts from others if i use my best endeavours to subdue them and if they have no influence on the conduct of my life we search in vain in any of his writings for any definite expression of doubt or want of faith in these doctrines when he touches on them as he does in the sermon on the trinity he seems to avoid of set purpose rational inquiry and contents himself with insisting on the necessity for a belief in those mysteries concerning god about which we cannot hope to know anything i do not find he says in his letter to a young clergyman that you are anywhere directed in the canons or articles to attempt explaining the mysteries of the christian religion and indeed since providence intended there should be mysteries i dont see how it can be agreeable to piety orthodoxy or good sense to go about such a work for to me there seems a manifest dilemma in the case if you explain them they are mysteries no longer if you fail you have laboured to no purpose  it must at once be admitted that swift had not the metaphysical bent philosophyin our modern sense of the wordwas to him only a species of word spinning that only was valuable which had a practical bearing on lifeand christianity had that he found in christianity as he knew itin the church of england that is to sayan excellent organization which recognized the frailties of human nature aimed at making healthier mens souls and gave mankind a reasonable guidance in the selection of the best motives to action he himself as a preacher made it his principal business first to tell the people what is their duty and then to convince them that it is so he had a profound faith in existing institutions which to him were founded on the fundamental traits of humanity the church of england he considered to be such an institution and it was moreover regulated and settled by order of the state to follow its teachings would lead men to become good citizens honest dealers truthful and cleanly companions upright friends what more could be demanded of any religion  the romish church led away from the constitution as by law established dissent set up private authority which could no more be permitted in religious than it was in political matters it meant dissension revolution and the upheaval of tried and trusted associations therefore the church of rome and the teachings of dissent were alike dangerous and against both whenever they attempted the possession of political power he waged a fierce and uncompromising war where sects are tolerated in a state he says in his sentiments of a church of england man it is fit they should enjoy a full liberty of conscience and every other privilege of freeborn subjects to which no power is annexed and to preserve their obedience upon all emergencies a government cannot give them too much ease nor trust them with too little power  swift had no passionate love for idealsindeed he may have thought ideals to be figments of an overheated and therefore aberrated imagination the practically real was the best ideal and by the real he would understand that power which most capably and most regulatively nursed guided and assisted the best instincts of the average man the average man was but a sorry creature and required adventitious aids for his development gifted as he was with a large sympathy swift yet was seemingly incapable of appreciating those thoughtforms which help us to visualize mentally our religious aspirations and emotions a mere emotion was but subjectmatter for his satire he suspected any zeal which protested too much for truth and considered it odds on it being either petulancy ambition or pride  whatever may have been his private speculations as to the truth of the doctrines of christianity they never interfered with his sense of his responsibilities as a clergyman i look upon myself he says in the capacity of a clergyman to be one appointed by providence for defending a post assigned me and for gaining over as many enemies as i can although i think my cause is just yet one great motive is my submitting to the pleasure of providence and to the laws of my country if anyone had asked him what was the pleasure of providence he would probably have answered that it was plainly shown in the scriptures and required not the aid of the expositions of divines who were too curious or too narrow in reducing orthodoxy within the compass of subtleties niceties and distinctions truth was no abstractionthat was truth which found its expression in the best action and this explains swifts acceptance of any organization which made for such expression he found one ready in the church of england and whatever his doubts were those only moved him which were aroused by action from those who attempted to interfere with the working of that organization and this also helps to explain his political attitude at the time when it was thought he had deserted his friends the church was always his first consideration he was not a churchman because he was a politician but a politician because he was a churchman these however are matters which are more fully entered into by swift himself in the tracts herewith reprinted and in the notes prefixed to them by the editor  it was originally intended that swifts writings on religion and the church should occupy a single volume of this edition of his works they are however so numerous that it has been found more convenient to divide them into two volumesthe first including all the tracts except those relating to the sacramental test the second containing the test pamphlets and the twelve sermons with the remarks on dr gibbss paraphrase of the psalms in an appendix it is hoped that this division while it entails upon the student the necessity for a double reference will yet preserve the continuity of form enabling him to view swifts religious standpoint and work with as much advantage as he would have obtained by the original plan  the editor again takes the opportunity to thank colonel f grant for the service he has rendered him in placing at his disposal his fine collection of swifts tracts the portrait which forms the frontispiece to this volume is one of those painted by francis bindon

inconveniences and perhaps not produce those many good effects proposed thereby  written in the year 1708   note  in november 1707 swift left dublin in the train of the then lord lieutenant lord pembroke his travelling companion was sir andrew fountaine who on landing in england set out with lord pembroke for wilton while swift went on to leicester to visit his mother he stayed with her until some time in december but by the middle of the same month he was in london during this absence from ireland swift corresponded somewhat freely with archbishop king of dublin and with archdeacon wallsthe letters to the former were first printed in forsters life of swift for these forster was indebted to the rev mr reeves vicar of lusk co dublin who discovered them in the recordroom of the see of armagh see life p 205 et seq and note one of swifts intentions while in the metropolis was to push forward the claim of the irish clergy for the remission of the first fruits and tenths a grant which had already been conceded to the english clergy and his letters to king often include requests for the necessary papers by means of which he could lay the matter before either godolphin or somers walls had written to swift of the vacancy of the see of waterford and from the reply to the archdeacon we learn that even at so early a date swift suffered a grievous disappointment for in january 1708 the bishopric of which swift had hopes was presented to dr thomas milles in his letter to walls swift confesses that he once had a glimpse that things would have gone otherwise but let us talk no further on this subject i am stomachsick of it already  pray send me an account of some smaller vacancy in the governments gift it was to somers and through him to lord halifax that swift looked for recognition either for services rendered or because of their appreciation of his abilities but however much he may have been disappointed at their inaction it may not be argued as it has been that swifts socalled change in his political opinions was the outcome either of spleen or chagrin against the whigs for their ingratitude towards him it is indeed questionable whether swift ever changed his political opinions speaking of these as party opinions from the day of his entrance it may be said into the orders of the church his first thought was for it and on all political questions which touched church matters swift was neither whig nor tory but churchman it was because of the attitude of the whigs towards the church that swift left them and in his writings he does not spare the tories even when he finds them taking up similar attitudes on purely political questions swift was too independent a thinker to be influenced by mere party views that he wrote for the tories must be put down to harleys personal influence and to his foresight which saw in swift a man who must be treated as an equal with the highest in the land swifts intercourse with the leading men of his day only served to accentuate his consciousness of his superiority and a party which would permit him the free play of his powers would be the party to which swift would give his adhesion godolphin somers and walpole either did not recognize the genius of the man or their own points of view did not permit them to give him the free play they felt he would obtain be that as it may harley gained not only a splendid party fighter but a friend on whose affection he could ever rely  in these tracts on religion and the church which he wrote in the year 1708 swift is not a party man speaking for party purposes he believed and sincerely believed that for such beings as were the men and women of this kingdom the church was if not the highest and noblest instrument for good yet the worthiest and ablest they had swift never lost himself in theories he was however not blind to the dangers which an established religion might engender but whatever its dangers these would be inevitable to the most perfect system so long as human nature was as base as it was the argument is written in a vein of satirical banter but the swiftian cynicism permeates every line it is the first of four tracts which form swifts most important expression of his thoughts on religion and the church scott well describes it as one of the most felicitous efforts in our language to engage wit and humour on the side of religion and forster speaks of it as having also that indefinable subtlety of style which conveys not the writers knowledge of the subject only but his power and superiority over it  i have not been able to find a copy of the original edition of the argument upon which to base the present textfor that i have gone to the first edition of the miscellanies published in 1711 but i have collated this with those given by the miscellanies 1728 faulkner hawkesworth scott morley and craik  t s   an argument against abolishing christianity   i am very sensible what a weakness and presumption it is to reason against the general humour and disposition of the world i remember it was with great justice and a due regard to the freedom both of the public and the press forbidden upon several penalties to write1 or discourse or lay wagers against the union even before it was confirmed by parliament because that was looked upon as a design to oppose the current of the people which besides the folly of it is a manifest breach of the fundamental law that makes this majority of opinion the voice of god in like manner and for the very same reasons it may perhaps be neither safe nor prudent to argue against the abolishing of christianity at a juncture when all parties appear2 so unanimously determined upon the point as we cannot but allow from their actions their discourses and their writings however i know not how whether from the affectation of singularity or the perverseness of human nature but so it unhappily falls out that i cannot be entirely of this opinion nay though i were sure an order were issued for my immediate prosecution by the attorneygeneral i should still confess that in the present posture of our affairs at home or abroad i do not yet see the absolute necessity of extirpating the christian religion from among us  footnote 1 this refers to the jacobitism of the time particularly among those who were opposed to the union a reference to lord mahons reign of queen anne will show how strong was the opposition in scotland and how severe were the measures taken to put down that opposition ts  footnote 2 craik and hawkesworth print the word seem but the miscellanies faulkner and scott give it as in the text ts  this perhaps may appear too great a paradox even for our wise and paradoxical age to endure therefore i shall handle it with all tenderness and with the utmost deference to that great and profound majority which is of another sentiment  and yet the curious may please to observe how much the genius of a nation is liable to alter in half an age i have heard it affirmed for certain by some very old people that the contrary opinion was even in their memories as much in vogue as the other is now and that a project for the abolishing of christianity would then have appeared as singular and been thought as absurd as it would be at this time to write or discourse in its defence  therefore i freely own that all appearances are against me the system of the gospel after the fate of other systems is generally antiquated and exploded and the mass or body of the common people among whom it seems to have had its latest credit are now grown as much ashamed of it as their betters opinions like fashions always descending from those of quality to the middle sort and thence to the vulgar where at length they are dropped and vanish  but here i would not be mistaken and must therefore be so bold as to borrow a distinction from the writers on the other side when they make a difference between nominal and real trinitarians i hope no reader imagines me so weak to stand up in the defence of real christianity such as used in primitive times if we may believe the authors of those ages to have an influence upon mens belief and actions to offer at the restoring of that would indeed be a wild project it would be to dig up foundations to destroy at one blow all the wit and half the learning of the kingdom to break the entire frame and constitution of things to ruin trade extinguish arts and sciences with the professors of them in short to turn our courts exchanges and shops into deserts and would be full as absurd as the proposal of horace3 where he advises the romans all in a body to leave their city and seek a new seat in some remote part of the world by way of cure for the corruption of their manners  footnote 3 this proposal is embodied in the 16th epode where in an appeal to the roman people horace advises them to fly the evils of tyranny and civil war by sailing away to the happy land those islands of the blest    nos manet oceanus circumvagus arva beata   petamus arva divites et insulas ts  therefore i think this caution was in itself altogether unnecessary which i have inserted only to prevent all possibility of cavilling since every candid reader will easily understand my discourse to be intended only in defence of nominal christianity the other having been for some time wholly laid aside by general consent as utterly inconsistent with our present schemes of wealth and power  but why we should therefore cast off the name and title of christians although the general opinion and resolution be so violent for it i confess i cannot with submission apprehend the consequence necessary4 however since the undertakers propose such wonderful advantages to the nation by this project and advance many plausible objections against the system of christianity i shall briefly consider the strength of both fairly allow them their greatest weight and offer such answers as i think most reasonable after which i will beg leave to shew what inconveniences may possibly happen by such an innovation in the present posture of our affairs  footnote 4 i give the reading of the miscellanies 1711 faulkner and hawkesworth scott and craik print it i confess i cannot with submission apprehend nor is the consequence necessary ts  first one great advantage proposed by the abolishing of christianity is that it would very much enlarge and establish liberty of conscience that great bulwark of our nation and of the protestant religion which is still too much limited by priestcraft notwithstanding all the good intentions of the legislature as we have lately found by a severe instance for it is confidently reported that two young gentlemen of real hopes bright wit and profound judgment who upon a thorough examination of causes and effects and by the mere force of natural abilities without the least tincture of learning having made a discovery that there was no god and generously communicating their thoughts for the good of the public were some time ago by an unparalleled severity and upon i know not what obsolete law broke for blasphemy5 and as it hath been wisely observed if persecution once begins no man alive knows how far it may reach or where it will end  footnote 5 no record of this breaking has been discovered ts  in answer to all which with deference to wiser judgments i think this rather shews the necessity of a nominal religion among us great wits love to be free with the highest objects and if they cannot be allowed a god to revile or renounce they will speak evil of dignities abuse the government and reflect upon the ministry which i am sure few will deny to be of much more pernicious consequence according to the saying of tiberius deorum offensa diis curae6 as to the particular fact related i think it is not fair to argue from one instance perhaps another cannot be produced yet to the comfort of all those who may be apprehensive of persecution blasphemy we know is freely spoken a million of times in every coffeehouse and tavern or wherever else good company meet it must be allowed indeed that to break an english freeborn officer only for blasphemy was to speak the gentlest of such an action a very high strain of absolute power little can be said in excuse for the general perhaps he was afraid it might give offence to the allies among whom for aught we know it may be the custom of the country to believe a god but if he argued as some have done upon a mistaken principle that an officer who is guilty of speaking blasphemy may some time or other proceed so far as to raise a mutiny the consequence is by no means to be admitted for surely the commander of an english army is likely to be but ill obeyed whose soldiers fear and reverence him as little as they do a deity  footnote 6 tacitus annals bk i c lxxiii ts  it is further objected against the gospel system that it obliges men to the belief of things too difficult for freethinkers and such who have shaken off the prejudices that usually cling to a confined education to which i answer that men should be cautious how they raise objections which reflect upon the wisdom of the nation is not every body freely allowed to believe whatever he pleases and to publish his belief to the world whenever he thinks fit especially if it serves to strengthen the party which is in the right would any indifferent foreigner who should read the trumpery lately written by asgil tindal toland coward7 and forty more imagine the gospel to be our rule of faith and confirmed by parliaments does any man either believe or say he believes or desire to have it thought that he says he believes one syllable of the matter and is any man worse received upon that score or does he find his want of nominal faith a disadvantage to him in the pursuit of any civil or military employment what if there be an old dormant statute or two against him are they not now obsolete to a degree that empsom and dudley8 themselves if they were now alive would find it impossible to put them in execution  footnote 7 john asgill 16591738 became a member of lincolns inn and went over to ireland in 1697 where he practised as a barrister amassed a large fortune and was elected to the irish parliament for writing an argument proving that man may be translated from hence without passing through death he was in 1700 expelled the house and the book ordered to be burnt on returning to england he was elected to parliament for bramber but suffered a second expulsion in 1712 also on account of this book he was imprisoned for debt and remained under the rules of the fleet and kings bench for thirty years during which time he wrote and published various political tracts his argument attempted to interpret the relations between god and man by the technical rules of english law and coleridge thought no little of its power and style  matthew tindal 16571733 was born at beer ferrers in devonshire he studied at oxford and obtained a fellowship in all souls he was made lld in 1685 and although he professed himself a roman catholic in james iis reign he managed to keep his fellowship after that monarchs flight by becoming protestant again his most important work was the rights of the christian church asserted which the house of commons in 1710 adjudged fit for burning by the hangman in 1730 he published anonymously the first part of christianity as old as creation a work which attacked strongly the authority of the scriptures a second volume was never published  john toland 16691722 born near londonderry and educated in a catholic school he professed himself a protestant and was sent to glasgow and edinburgh in the latter university he graduated in his masters degree while studying at leyden he became a sceptic and in 1695 published his christianity not mysterious a work which aroused a wide controversy in his life of milton 1698 he denied that king charles was the author of eikon basilikae and also attacked the gospels this also brought upon him rejoinders from dr blackall and dr samuel clarke he died at putney in easy circumstances due to the presents made him while visiting german courts he wrote other works chief among which may be mentioned socinianism truly stated 1705 nazarenas 1718 and tetradymus his posthumous works were issued in two volumes in 1726 with a life by des maizeaux craik calls him a man of utterly worthless character and refers to his being mixed up in some discreditable episodes as a political spy  william coward 16561724 was born at winchester he studied medicine and became a fellow of wadham college oxford his second thoughts concerning human souls published in 1702 occasioned fierce disputes on account of its materialism the house of commons ordered the work to be burnt by the hangman  asgill toland tindal collins and coward are classed as the deistical writers of the eighteenth century in his history of english thought in the eighteenth century mr leslie stephen gives an admirable exposition of their views and their special interpretation of lockes theories ts  footnote 8 of henry vii notoriety who aided the king by illegal exactions to amass his large fortune they were executed by henry viii ts  it is likewise urged that there are by computation in this kingdom above ten thousand parsons whose revenues added to those of my lords the bishops would suffice to maintain at least two hundred young gentlemen of wit and pleasure and freethinking enemies to priestcraft narrow principles pedantry and prejudices who might be an ornament to the court and town and then again so great a number of able bodied divines might be a recruit to our fleet and armies this indeed appears to be a consideration of some weight but then on the other side several things deserve to be considered likewise as first whether it may not be thought necessary that in certain tracts of country like what we call parishes there shall be one man at least of abilities to read and write then it seems a wrong computation that the revenues of the church throughout this island would be large enough to maintain two hundred young gentlemen or even half that number after the present refined way of living that is to allow each of them such a rent as in the modern form of speech would make them easy but still there is in this project a greater mischief behind and we ought to beware of the womans folly who killed the hen that every morning laid her a golden egg for pray what would become of the race of men in the next age if we had nothing to trust to beside the scrofulous consumptive productions furnished by our men of wit and pleasure when having squandered away their vigour health and estates they are forced by some disagreeable marriage to piece up their broken fortunes and entail rottenness and politeness on their posterity now here are ten thousand persons reduced by the wise regulations of henry the eighth9 to the necessity of a low diet and moderate exercise who are the only great restorers of our breed without which the nation would in an age or two become one great hospital  footnote 9 his seizures of the revenues of the church ts  another advantage proposed by the abolishing of christianity is the clear gain of one day in seven which is now entirely lost and consequently the kingdom one seventh less considerable in trade business and pleasure besides the loss to the public of so many stately structures now in the hands of the clergy which might be converted into playhouses exchanges market houses common dormitories and other public edifices  i hope i shall be forgiven a hard word if i call this a perfect cavil i readily own there has been an old custom time out of mind for people to assemble in the churches every sunday and that shops are still frequently shut in order as it is conceived to preserve the memory of that ancient practice but how this can prove a hindrance to business or pleasure is hard to imagine what if the men of pleasure are forced one day in the week to game at home instead of the chocolate houses10 are not the taverns and coffeehouses open can there be a more convenient season for taking a dose of physic are fewer claps got upon sundays than other days is not that the chief day for traders to sum up the accounts of the week and for lawyers to prepare their briefs but i would fain know how it can be pretended that the churches are misapplied where are more appointments and rendezvouzes of gallantry where more care to appear in the foremost box with greater advantage of dress where more meetings for business where more bargains driven of all sorts and where so many conveniences or enticements to sleep  footnote 10 the chocolate houses seem to have been largely used for gambling purposes they were not so numerous as the coffee houses ts  there is one advantage greater than any of the foregoing proposed by the abolishing of christianity that it will utterly extinguish parties among us by removing those factious distinctions of high and low church of whig and tory presbyterian and church of england which are now so many mutual clogs upon public proceedings and are apt to prefer the gratifying themselves or depressing their adversaries before the most important interest of the state  i confess if it were certain that so great an advantage would redound to the nation by this expedient i would submit and be silent but will any man say that if the words whoring drinking cheating lying stealing were by act of parliament ejected out of the english tongue and dictionaries we should all awake next morning chaste and temperate honest and just and lovers of truth is this a fair consequence or if the physicians would forbid us to pronounce the words pox gout rheumatism and stone would that expedient serve like so many talismans to destroy the diseases themselves are party and faction rooted in mens hearts no deeper than phrases borrowed from religion or founded upon no firmer principles and is our language so poor that we cannot find other terms to express them are envy pride avarice and ambition such ill nomenclators that they cannot furnish appellations for their owners will not heydukes and mamalukes mandarins and patshaws or any other words formed at pleasure serve to distinguish those who are in the ministry from others who would be in it if they could what for instance is easier than to vary the form of speech and instead of the word church make it a question in politics whether the monument be in danger because religion was nearest at hand to furnish a few convenient phrases is our invention so barren we can find no other suppose for argument sake that the tories favoured margarita the whigs mrs tofts11 and the trimmers12 valentini13 would not margaritians toftians and valentinians be very tolerable marks of distinction the prasini and veniti14 two most virulent factions in italy began if i remember right by a distinction of colours in ribbons which we might do with as good a grace15 about the dignity of the blue and the green and would serve as properly to divide the court the parliament and the kingdom between them as any terms of art whatsoever borrowed from religion and therefore i think there is little force in this objection against christianity or prospect of so great an advantage as is proposed in the abolishing of it  footnote 11 margarita was a famous italian singer of the day her name was francesca margherita de lepine and she was known as the italian woman in his journal to stella for august 6th 1711 swift writes we have a music meeting in our town windsor tonight i went to the rehearsal of it and there was margarita and her sister and another drab and a parcel of fiddlers i was weary and would not go to the meeting which i am sorry for because i heard it was a great assembly see present edition vol ii p 219  mrs catherine tofts was an englishwoman who also sang in italian opera she had a fine figure and a beautiful voice steele in the tatler no 20 refers to her when in her state of insanity her mind evidently could not stand the strain of her great popularity and she became mad in 1709 in the tatler she is called camilla and cibber also speaks of the silver tone of her voice ts  footnote 12 by the trimmers swift referred to the nickname given to the party in the time of charles ii which consisted of those who wished to compromise between the advocates of the crown and the supporters of the protestant succession as against the duke of york ts  footnote 13 another italian singer of the time who was the rival of margarita and mrs tofts ts  footnote 14 this refers to the roman chariot races they gave rise to the factions called albati russati prasini and veniti the prasini green and veniti blue were the principal and their rivalry landed the empire under justinian in a civil war ts  footnote 15 scott has and we might contend with as good a grace c craik follows scott the reading in the text is that of the miscellanies 1711 faulkner and hawkesworth ts  tis again objected as a very absurd ridiculous custom that a set of men should be suffered much less employed and hired to bawl one day in seven against the lawfulness of those methods most in use toward the pursuit of greatness riches and pleasure which are the constant practice of all men alive on the other six but this objection is i think a little unworthy so refined an age as ours let us argue this matter calmly i appeal to the breast of any polite freethinker whether in the pursuit of gratifying a predominant passion he hath not always felt a wonderful incitement by reflecting it was a thing forbidden and therefore we see in order to cultivate this taste the wisdom of the nation hath taken special care that the ladies should be furnished with prohibited silks and the men with prohibited wine and indeed it were to be wished that some other prohibitions were promoted in order to improve the pleasures of the town which for want of such expedients begin already as i am told to flag and grow languid giving way daily to cruel inroads from the spleen  tis likewise proposed as a great advantage to the public that if we once discard the system of the gospel all religion will of course be banished for ever and consequently along with it those grievous prejudices of education which under the names of virtue conscience honour justice and the like are so apt to disturb the peace of human minds and the notions whereof are so hard to be eradicated by right reason or freethinking sometimes during the whole course of our lives  here first i observe how difficult it is to get rid of a phrase which the world is once grown fond of though the occasion that first produced it be entirely taken away for several years past if a man had but an illfavoured nose the deepthinkers of the age would some way or other contrive to impute the cause to the prejudice of his education from this fountain were said to be derived all our foolish notions of justice piety love of our country all our opinions of god or a future state heaven hell and the like and there might formerly perhaps have been some pretence for this charge but so effectual care has been taken to remove those prejudices by an entire change in the methods of education that with honour i mention it to our polite innovators the young gentlemen who are now on the scene seem to have not the least tincture of those infusions or string of those weeds and by consequence the reason for abolishing nominal christianity upon that pretext is wholly ceased  for the rest it may perhaps admit a controversy whether the banishing of all notions of religion whatsoever would be convenient for the vulgar not that i am in the least of opinion with those who hold religion to have been the invention of politicians to keep the lower part of the world in awe by the fear of invisible powers unless mankind were then very different to what it is now for i look upon the mass or body of our people here in england to be as freethinkers that is to say as staunch unbelievers as any of the highest rank but i conceive some scattered notions about a superior power to be of singular use for the common people as furnishing excellent materials to keep children quiet when they grow peevish and providing topics of amusement in a tedious winternight  lastly tis proposed as a singular advantage that the abolishing of christianity will very much contribute to the uniting of protestants by enlarging the terms of communion so as to take in all sorts of dissenters who are now shut out of the pale upon account of a few ceremonies which all sides confess to be things indifferent that this alone will effectually answer the great ends of a scheme for comprehension by opening a large noble gate at which all bodies may enter whereas the chaffering with dissenters and dodging about this or tother ceremony is but like opening a few wickets and leaving them at jar by which no more than one can get in at a time and that not without stooping and sideling and squeezing his body16  footnote 16 in this passage says scott the authors high church principles and jealousy of the dissenters plainly shew themselves and it is perhaps in special reference to what is here said that he ranks it among the pamphlets he wrote in opposition to the party then in power t s  to all this i answer that there is one darling inclination of mankind which usually affects to be a retainer to religion though she be neither its parent its godmother or its friend i mean the spirit of opposition that lived long before christianity and can easily subsist without it let us for instance examine wherein the opposition of sectaries among us consists we shall find christianity to have no share in it at all does the gospel any where prescribe a starched squeezed countenance a stiff formal gait a singularity of manners and habit or any affected modes of speech different from the reasonable part of mankind yet if christianity did not lend its name to stand in the gap and to employ or divert these humours they must of necessity be spent in contraventions to the laws of the land and disturbance of the public peace there is a portion of enthusiasm assigned to every nation which if it hath not proper objects to work on will burst out and set all into a flame if the quiet of a state can be bought by only flinging men a few ceremonies to devour it is a purchase no wise man would refuse let the mastiffs amuse themselves about a sheeps skin stuffed with hay provided it will keep them from worrying the flock the institution of convents abroad seems in one point a strain of great wisdom there being few irregularities in human passions which may not have recourse to vent themselves in some of those orders which are so many retreats for the speculative the melancholy the proud the silent the politic and the morose to spend themselves and evaporate the noxious particles for each of whom we in this island are forced to provide a several sect of religion to keep them quiet and whenever christianity shall be abolished the legislature must find some other expedient to employ and entertain them for what imports it how large a gate you open if there will be always left a number who place a pride and a merit in not coming in17  footnote 17 so the miscellanies 1711 and hawkesworth faulkner scott and craik print in refusing to enter t s  having thus considered the most important objections against christianity and the chief advantages proposed by the abolishing thereof i shall now with equal deference and submission to wiser judgments as before proceed to mention a few inconveniences that may happen if the gospel should be repealed which perhaps the projectors may not have sufficiently considered  and first i am very sensible how much the gentlemen of wit and pleasure are apt to murmur and be choqued18 at the sight of so many draggled tail parsons that happen to fall in their way and offend their eyes but at the same time these wise reformers do not consider what an advantage and felicity it is for great wits to be always provided with objects of scorn and contempt in order to exercise and improve their talents and divert their spleen from falling on each other or on themselves especially when all this may be done without the least imaginable danger to their persons  footnote 18 shocked swifts habit when using a word of french origin was to keep the french spelling t s  and to urge another argument of a parallel nature if christianity were once abolished how could the freethinkers the strong reasoners and the men of profound learning be able to find another subject so calculated in all points whereon to display their abilities what wonderful productions of wit should we be deprived of from those whose genius by continual practice hath been wholly turned upon raillery and invectives against religion and would therefore never be able to shine or distinguish themselves upon any other subject we are daily complaining of the great decline of wit among us and would we take away the greatest perhaps the only topic we have left who would ever have suspected asgil for a wit or toland for a philosopher if the inexhaustible stock of christianity had not been at hand to provide them with materials what other subject through all art or nature could have produced tindal for a profound author or furnished him with readers it is the wise choice of the subject that alone adorns and distinguishes the writer for had a hundred such pens as these been employed on the side of religion they would have immediately sunk into silence and oblivion  nor do i think it wholly groundless or my fears altogether imaginary that the abolishing of christianity may perhaps bring the church into danger or at least put the senate to the trouble of another securing vote i desire i may not be mistaken i am far from presuming to affirm or think that the church is in danger at present or as things now stand but we know not how soon it may be so when the christian religion is repealed as plausible as this project seems there may a dangerous design lurk under it19 nothing can be more notorious than that the atheists deists socinians antitrinitarians and other subdivisions of freethinkers are persons of little zeal for the present ecclesiastical establishment their declared opinion is for repealing the sacramental test they are very indifferent with regard to ceremonies nor do they hold the jus divinum of episcopacy therefore this may be intended as one politic step toward altering the constitution of the church established and setting up presbytery in the stead which i leave to be further considered by those at the helm  footnote 19 craik follows scott in altering this sentence to there may be a dangerous design lurking under it but all other editors except morley and roscoe give it as printed in the text ts  in the last place i think nothing can be more plain than that by this expedient we shall run into the evil we chiefly pretend to avoid and that the abolishment of the christian religion will be the readiest course we can take to introduce popery and i am the more inclined to this opinion because we know it has been the constant practice of the jesuits to send over emissaries with instructions to personate themselves members of the several prevailing sects among us so it is recorded that they have at sundry times appeared in the guise of presbyterians anabaptists independents and quakers according as any of these were most in credit so since the fashion hath been taken up of exploding religion the popish missionaries have not been wanting to mix with the freethinkers among whom toland the great oracle of the antichristians is an irish priest the son of an irish priest and the most learned and ingenious author of a book called the rights of the christian church20 was in a proper juncture reconciled to the romish faith whose true son as appears by a hundred passages in his treatise he still continues perhaps i could add some others to the number but the fact is beyond dispute and the reasoning they proceed by is right for supposing christianity to be extinguished the people will never be at ease till they find out some other method of worship which will as infallibly produce superstition as this will end in popery  footnote 20 dr matthew tindal see previous note p 9 the book was afterwards specially criticised by swift in his remarks upon a book entitled the rights of the christian church see also note to the present reprint of these remarks ts  and therefore if notwithstanding all i have said it still be thought necessary to have a bill brought in for repealing christianity i would humbly offer an amendment that instead of the word christianity may be put religion in general which i conceive will much better answer all the good ends proposed by the projectors of it for as long as we leave in being a god and his providence with all the necessary consequences which curious and inquisitive men will be apt to draw from such premises we do not strike at the root of the evil though we should ever so effectually annihilate the present scheme of the gospel for of what use is freedom of thought if it will not produce freedom of action which is the sole end how remote soever in appearance of all objections against christianity and therefore the freethinkers consider it as a sort of edifice wherein all the parts have such a mutual dependence on each other that if you happen to pull out one single nail the whole fabric must fall to the ground this was happily expressed by him who had heard of a text brought for proof of the trinity which in an ancient manuscript was differently read he thereupon immediately took the hint and by a sudden deduction of a long sorites most logically concluded why if it be as you say i may safely whore and drink on and defy the parson from which and many the like instances easy to be produced i think nothing can be more manifest than that the quarrel is not against any particular points of hard digestion in the christian system but against religion in general which by laying restraints on human nature is supposed the great enemy to the freedom of thought and action  upon the whole if it shall still be thought for the benefit of church and state that christianity be abolished i conceive however it may be more convenient to defer the execution to a time of peace and not venture in this conjuncture to disoblige our allies who as it falls out are all christians and many of them by the prejudices of their education so bigoted as to place a sort of pride in the appellation if upon being rejected by them we are to trust an alliance with the turk we shall find ourselves much deceived for as he is too remote and generally engaged in war with the persian emperor so his people would be more scandalized at our infidelity than our christian neighbours for they the turks are not only strict observers of religious worship but what is worse believe a god which is more than required of us even while we preserve the name of christians  to conclude whatever some may think of the great advantages to trade by this favourite scheme i do very much apprehend that in six months time after the act is passed for the extirpation of the gospel the bank and eastindia stock may fall at least one per cent and since that is fifty times more than ever the wisdom of our age thought fit to venture for the preservation of christianity there is no reason we should be at so great a loss merely for the sake of destroying it                            for the  advancement of religion  and the  reformation of manners  by a person of quality   note  in placing this tract second in chronological order i am following forster and craik all the collected editions of swifts works including the miscellanies of 1711 begin with the sentiments of a church of england man continue with the argument and then the project but the short intervals which separated the publication of all three tracts and the letter on the sacramental test make a strict chronological order of less value than the order of development of the subjectmatter with which they deal granting even that the project appeared after the sentiments there seems however nothing improbable in the suggestion made by forster that swift planned the writing of both the argument and the project while on a visit to the earl of berkeley at cranford in 1708 and his dedication of the latter to lady berkeley lends this suggestion added weight that the original edition of the project is dated 1709 is nothing to the point since it is wellknown that the booksellers often antedated their publications as publishers do now when the issue occurred towards the end of a year moreover the letter of the earl of berkeley to swift which scott misdates 17061707 but which should be 1708 makes special reference to this very tract showing that it was certainly published in 1708 i earnestly entreat you writes the earl if you have not done it already that you would not fail of having your bookseller enable the archbishop of york dr sterne to give a book to the queen for with mr nelson i am entirely of opinion that her majestys reading of that book on the progress for the increase of morality and piety may be of very great use to that end i have never seen a copy of the first edition of the sentiments and i cannot fix the exact date of its publication but it was certainly not written before the project the project therefore must be considered in the light of a preliminary essay to the fuller and more digested statement of the sentiments of a church of england man and i have on this account placed it as the second tract written by swift in the year 1708  whatever may be thought of the particular methods which swift suggested for realizing his reformatory scheme and they were no doubt artificial and wooden enough the tract itself remains an excellent survey of the evils and gross habits of the time the methods may be utopian swift himself thought they were open to discussion but the spirit of sincerity and piety is unmistakable it is worth remembering however that several of the proposals such as those for closing the publichouses at twelve oclock at night the penalizing of publicans who supplied drink to drunken customers the building of churches have since been adopted  i cannot agree with mr churton collins jonathan swift pp 5961 in suspecting swift of a special policy of selfinterest in writing the project swift was too honest a man to use the religious sentiment for the purpose of counteracting any bad impression his previous writings had made on those who had the power to advance him however much he might delight in the possession of high worldly station he would never so prostitute himself to obtain it nor did he care to let the world into the secret of his heart indeed all his life swift seemed to hide almost jealously the genuine piety of his nature whatever suspicion of policy has surrounded the tract must be ascribed to the wellintentioned letter of the earl of berkeley above quoted and the earl would not have written thus had he felt swifts motive to be any other than a purely impersonal one  steele in his review of the project in the fifth tatler april 20th 1709 makes some interesting observations and seems to take special note of the person of honour in the character of which swift wrote it writing from wills coffeehouse steele says this week being sacred to holy things and no public diversions allowed there has been taken notice of even here a little treatise called a project for the advancement of religion dedicated to the countess of berkeley the title was so uncommon and promised so peculiar a way of thinking that every man here has read it and as many as have done so have approved it it is written with the spirit of one who has seen the world enough to undervalue it with good breeding the author must certainly be a man of wisdom as well as piety and have spent as much time in the exercise of both the real causes of the decay of the interests of religion are set forth in a clear and lively manner without unseasonable passions and the whole air of the book as to the language the sentiments and the reasonableness show it was written by one whose virtue sits easy about him and to whom vice is thoroughly contemptible it was said by one of this company alluding to that knowledge of the world the author seems to have the man writes much like a gentleman and goes to heaven with a very good mien  in his apology steele refers to this tatler note and remarks the gentleman i here intended was dr swift this kind of man i thought him at that time we have not met of late but i hope he deserves this character still  the present text is based upon the first edition but this edition was so wretchedly printed that i have carefully collated it with those given in the miscellanies 1711 faulkner 1735 and hawkesworth 1762  t s     a   project   for the   advancement of religion   and the   reformation of manners   by a person of quality     o quisquis volet impias     caedes  rabiem tollere civicam   si quaeret pater urbium     subscribi statuis indomitam audeat   refraenare licentiam  hor  london  printed and sold by h hills in blackfryars near the waterside for the benefit of the poor 1709   to the countess of berkeley1  madam  my intention in prefixing your ladyships name is not after the common form to desire your protection of the following papers which i take to be a very unreasonable request since by being inscribed to your ladyship though without your knowledge and from a concealed hand you cannot recommend them without some suspicion of partiality my real design is i confess the very same i have often detested in most dedications that of publishing your praises to the world not upon the subject of your noble birth for i know others as noble or of the greatness of your fortune for i know others far greater or of that beautiful race the images of their parents which call you mother for even this may perhaps have been equalled in some other age or country besides none of these advantages do derive any accomplishments to the owners but serve at best only to adorn what they really possess what i intend is your piety truth good sense and good nature affability and charity wherein i wish your ladyship had many equals or any superiors and i wish i could say i knew them too for then your ladyship might have had a chance to escape this address in the meantime i think it highly necessary for the interest of virtue and religion that the whole kingdom should be informed in some parts of your character for instance that the easiest and politest conversation joined with the truest piety may be observed in your ladyship in as great perfection as they were ever seen apart in any other persons that by your prudence and management under several disadvantages you have preserved the lustre of that most noble family into which you are grafted and which the immeasurable profusion of ancestors for many generations had too much eclipsed then how happily you perform every office of life to which providence has called you in the education of those two incomparable daughters whose conduct is so universally admired in every duty of a prudent complying affectionate wife in that care which descends to the meanest of your domestics and lastly in that endless bounty to the poor and discretion where to distribute it i insist on my opinion that it is of importance for the public to know this and a great deal more of your ladyship yet whoever goes about to inform them shall instead of finding credit perhaps be censured for a flatterer to avoid so usual a reproach i declare this to be no dedication but properly an introduction to a proposal for the advancement of religion and morals by tracing however imperfectly some few lineaments in the character of a lady who hath spent all her life in the practice and promotion of both  footnote 1 this is the same countess of berkeley whom swift hoaxed with his meditation on a broomstick she was the daughter of viscount campden and sister to the earl of gainsborough ts  among all the schemes offered to the public in this projecting age i have observed with some displeasure that there have never been any for the improvement of religion and morals which beside the piety of the design from the consequence of such a reformation in a future life would be the best natural means for advancing the public felicity of the state as well as the present happiness of every individual for as much as faith and morality are declined among us i am altogether confident they might in a short time and with no very great trouble be raised to as high a perfection as numbers are capable of receiving indeed the method is so easy and obvious and some present opportunities so good that in order to have this project reduced to practice there seems to want nothing more than to put those in mind who by their honour duty and interest are chiefly concerned  but because it is idle to propose remedies before we are assured of the disease or to be in pain2 till we are convinced of the danger i shall first shew in general that the nation is extremely corrupted in religion and morals and then i will offer a short scheme for the reformation of both  footnote 2 scott follows faulkner in using the word fear the reading in the text is that of the first edition the miscellanies 1711 and of hawkesworth ts  as to the first i know it is reckoned but a form of speech when divines complain of the wickedness of the age however i believe upon a fair comparison with other times and countries it would be found an undoubted truth  for first to deliver nothing but plain matter of fact without exaggeration or satire i suppose it will be granted that hardly one in a hundred among our people of quality or gentry appears to act by any principle of religion that great numbers of them do entirely discard it and are ready to own their disbelief of all revelation in ordinary discourse nor is the case much better among the vulgar especially in great towns where the profaneness and ignorance of handicraftsmen small traders servants and the like are to a degree very hard to be imagined greater then it is observed abroad that no race of mortals hath so little sense of religion as the english soldiers to confirm which i have been often told by great officers in the army that in the whole compass of their acquaintance they could not recollect three of their profession who seemed to regard or believe one syllable of the gospel and the same at least may be affirmed of the fleet the consequences of all which upon the actions of men are equally manifest they never go about as in former time to hide or palliate their vices but expose them freely to view like any other common occurrences of life without the least reproach from the world or themselves for instance any man will tell you he intends to be drunk this evening or was so last night with as little ceremony or scruple as he would tell you the time of the day he will let you know he is going to a whore or that he has got a clap with as much indifferency as he would a piece of public news he will swear curse or blaspheme without the least passion or provocation and though all regard for reputation is not quite laid aside in the other sex tis however at so low an ebb that very few among them seem to think virtue and conduct of absolute necessity for preserving it if this be not so how comes it to pass that women of tainted reputations find the same countenance and reception in all public places with those of the nicest virtue who pay and receive visits from them without any manner of scruple which proceeding as it is not very old among us so i take it to be of most pernicious consequence it looks like a sort of compounding between virtue and vice as if a woman were allowed to be vicious provided she be not a profligate as if there were a certain point where gallantry ends and infamy begins or that a hundred criminal amours were not as pardonable as half a score  besides those corruptions already mentioned it would be endless to enumerate such as arise from the excess of play or gaming the cheats the quarrels the oaths and blasphemies among the men among the women the neglect of household affairs the unlimited freedoms the indecent passion and lastly the known inlet to all lewdness when after an ill run the person must answer the defects of the purse the rule on such occasions holding true in play as it does in law quod non habet in crumena luat in corpore  but all these are trifles in comparison if we step into other scenes and consider the fraud and cozenage of trading men and shopkeepers that insatiable gulf of injustice and oppression the law the open traffic for all civil and military employments i wish it rested there without the least regard to merit or qualifications the corrupt management of men in office the many detestable abuses in choosing those who represent the people with the management of interest and factions among the representatives to which i must be bold to add the ignorance of some of the lower clergy the mean servile temper of others the pert pragmatical demeanour of several young stagers in divinity upon their first producing themselves into the world with many other circumstances needless or rather invidious to mention which falling in with the corruptions already related have however unjustly almost rendered the whole order contemptible  this is a short view of the general depravities among us without entering into particulars which would be an endless labour now as universal and deeprooted as these appear to be i am utterly deceived if an effectual remedy might not be applied to most of them neither am i at present upon a wild speculative project but such a one as may be easily put in execution  for while the prerogative of giving all employments continues in the crown either immediately or by subordination it is in the power of the prince to make piety and virtue become the fashion of the age if at the same time he would make them necessary qualifications for favour and preferment  it is clear from present experience that the bare example of the best prince will not have any mighty influence where the age is very corrupt for when was there ever a better prince on the throne than the present queen i do not talk of her talent for government her love of the people or any other qualities that are purely regal but her piety charity temperance conjugal love and whatever other virtues do best adorn a private life wherein without question or flattery she hath no superior yet neither will it be satire or peevish invective to affirm that infidelity and vice are not much diminished since her coming to the crown nor will in all probability till some more effectual remedies be provided  thus human nature seems to lie under this disadvantage that the example alone of a vicious prince will in time corrupt an age but that of a good one will not be sufficient to reform it without further endeavours princes must therefore supply this defect by a vigorous exercise of that authority which the law has left them by making it every mans interest and honour to cultivate religion and virtue by rendering vice a disgrace and the certain ruin to preferment or pretensions all which they should first attempt in their own courts and families for instance might not the queens domestics of the middle and lower sort be obliged upon penalty of suspension or loss of their employments to a constant weekly attendance at least on the service of the church to a decent behaviour in it to receive the sacrament four times in the year to avoid swearing and irreligious profane discourses and to the appearance at least of temperance and chastity might not the care of all this be committed to the strict inspection of proper persons might not those of higher rank and nearer access to her majestys person receive her own commands to the same purpose and be countenanced or disfavoured according as they obey might not the queen lay her injunctions on the bishops and other great men of undoubted piety to make diligent enquiry to give her notice if any person about her should happen to be of libertine principles or morals might not all those who enter upon any office in her majestys family be obliged to take an oath parallel with that against simony which is administered to the clergy tis not to be doubted but that if these or the like proceedings were duly observed morality and religion would soon become fashionable court virtues and be taken up as the only methods to get or keep employments there which alone would have mighty influence upon many of the nobility and principal gentry  but if the like methods were pursued as far as possible with regard to those who are in the great employments of state it is hard to conceive how general a reformation they might in time produce among us for if piety and virtue were once reckoned qualifications necessary to preferment every man thus endowed when put into great stations would readily imitate the queens example in the distribution of all offices in his disposal especially if any apparent transgression through favour or partiality would be imputed to him for a misdemeanour by which he must certainly forfeit his favour and station and there being such great numbers in employment scattered through every town and county in this kingdom if all these were exemplary in the conduct of their lives things would soon take a new face and religion receive a mighty encouragement nor would the public weal be less advanced since of nine offices in ten that are ill executed the defect is not in capacity or understanding but in common honesty i know no employment for which piety disqualifies any man and if it did i doubt the objection would not be very seasonably offered at present because it is perhaps too just a reflection that in the disposal of places the question whether a person be fit for what he is recommended to is generally the last that is thought on or regarded  i have often imagined that something parallel to the office of censors anciently in rome would be of mighty use among us and could be easily limited from running into any exorbitances the romans understood liberty at least as well as we were as jealous of it and upon every occasion as bold assertors yet i do not remember to have read any great complaint of the abuses in that office among them but many admirable effects of it are left upon record there are several pernicious vices frequent and notorious among us that escape or elude the punishment of any law we have yet invented or have had no law at all against them such as atheism drunkenness fraud avarice and several others which by this institution wisely regulated might be much reformed suppose for instance that itinerary commissioners were appointed to inspect everywhere throughout the kingdom into the conduct at least of men in office with respect to their morals and religion as well as their abilities to receive the complaints and informations that should be offered against them and make their report here upon oath to the court or the ministry who should reward or punish accordingly i avoid entering into the particulars of this or any other scheme which coming from a private hand might be liable to many defects but would soon be digested by the wisdom of the nation and surely six thousand pounds a year would not be ill laid out among as many commissioners duly qualified who in three divisions should be personally obliged to take their yearly circuits for that purpose  but this is beside my present design which was only to show what degree of reformation is in the power of the queen without the interposition of the legislature and which her majesty is without question obliged in conscience to endeavour by her authority as much as she does by her practice  it will be easily granted that the example of this great town hath a mighty influence over the whole kingdom and it is as manifest that the town is equally influenced by the court and the ministry and those who by their employments or their hopes depend upon them now if under so excellent a princess as the present queen we would suppose a family strictly regulated as i have above proposed a ministry where every single person was of distinguished piety if we should suppose all great offices of state and law filled after the same manner and with such as were equally diligent in choosing persons who in their several subordinations would be obliged to follow the examples of their superiors under the penalty of loss of favour and place will not everybody grant that the empire of vice and irreligion would be soon destroyed in this great metropolis and receive a terrible blow through the whole island which hath so great an intercourse with it and so much affects to follow its fashions  for if religion were once understood to be the necessary step to favour and preferment can it be imagined that any man would openly offend against it who had the least regard for his reputation or his fortune there is no quality so contrary to any nature which men cannot affect and put on upon occasions in order to serve an interest or gratify a prevailing passion the proudest man will personate humility the morosest learn to flatter the laziest will be sedulous and active where he is in pursuit of what he has much at heart how ready therefore would most men be to step into the paths of virtue and piety if they infallibly led to favour and fortune  if swearing and profaneness scandalous and avowed lewdness excessive gaming and intemperance were a little discountenanced in the army i cannot readily see what ill consequences could be apprehended if gentlemen of that profession were at least obliged to some external decorum in their conduct or even if a profligate life and character were not a means of advancement and the appearance of piety a most infallible hindrance it is impossible the corruptions there should be so universal and exorbitant i have been assured by several great officers that no troops abroad are so ill disciplined as the english which cannot well be otherwise while the common soldiers have perpetually before their eyes the vicious example of their leaders and it is hardly possible for those to commit any crime whereof these are not infinitely more guilty and with less temptation  it is commonly charged upon the gentlemen of the army that the beastly vice of drinking to excess hath been lately from their example restored among us which for some years before was almost dropped in england but whoever the introducers were they have succeeded to a miracle many of the young nobility and gentry are already become great proficients and are under no manner of concern to hide their talent but are got beyond all sense of shame or fear of reproach  this might soon be remedied if the queen would think fit to declare that no young person of quality whatsoever who was notoriously addicted to that or any other vice should be capable of her favour or even admitted into her presence with positive command to her ministers and others in great office to treat them in the same manner after which all men who had any regard for their reputation or any prospect of preferment would avoid their commerce this would quickly make that vice so scandalous that those who could not subdue would at least endeavour to disguise it  by the like methods a stop might be put to that ruinous practice of deep gaming and the reason why it prevails so much is because a treatment directly opposite in every point is made use of to promote it by which means the laws enacted against this abuse are wholly eluded  it cannot be denied that the want of strict discipline in the universities hath been of pernicious consequence to the youth of this nation who are there almost left entirely to their own management especially those among them of better quality and fortune who because they are not under a necessity of making learning their maintenance are easily allowed to pass their time and take their degrees with little or no improvement than which there cannot well be a greater absurdity for if no advancement of knowledge can be had from those places the time there spent is at best utterly lost because every ornamental part of education is better taught elsewhere and as for keeping youths out of harms way i doubt where so many of them are got together at full liberty of doing what they please it will not answer the end but whatever abuses corruptions or deviations from statutes have crept into the universities through neglect or length of time they might in a great degree be reformed by strict injunctions from court upon each particular to the visitors and heads of houses besides the peculiar authority the queen may have in several colleges whereof her predecessors were the founders and among other regulations it would be very convenient to prevent the excess of drink with that scurvy custom among the lads and parent of the former vice the taking of tobacco where it is not absolutely necessary in point of health  from the universities the young nobility and others of great fortunes are sent for early up to town for fear of contracting any airs of pedantry by a college education many of the younger gentry retire to the inns of court where they are wholly left to their own discretion and the consequence of this remissness in education appears by observing that nine in ten of those who rise in the church or the court the law or the army are younger brothers or new men whose narrow fortunes have forced them upon industry and application  as for the inns of court unless we suppose them to be much degenerated they must needs be the worst instituted seminaries in any christian country but whether they may be corrected without interposition of the legislature i have not skill enough to determine however it is certain that all wise nations have agreed in the necessity of a strict education which consisted among other things in the observance of moral duties especially justice temperance and chastity as well as the knowledge of arts and bodily exercises but all these among us are laughed out of doors  without the least intention to offend the clergy i cannot but think that through a mistaken notion and practice they prevent themselves from doing much service which otherwise might lie in their power to religion and virtue i mean by affecting so much to converse with each other and caring so little to mingle with the laity they have their particular clubs and particular coffeehouses where they generally appear in clusters a single divine dares hardly shew his person among numbers of fine gentlemen or if he happens to fall into such company he is silent and suspicious in continual apprehension that some pert man of pleasure should break an unmannerly jest and render him ridiculous now i take this behaviour of the clergy to be just as reasonable as if the physicians should agree to spend their time in visiting one another or their several apothecaries and leave their patients to shift for themselves in my humble opinion the clergys business lies entirely among the laity neither is there perhaps a more effectual way to forward the salvation of mens souls than for spiritual persons to make themselves as agreeable as they can in the conversations of the world for which a learned education gives them great advantage if they would please to improve and apply it it so happens that the men of pleasure who never go to church nor use themselves to read books of devotion form their ideas of the clergy from a few poor strollers they often observe in the streets or sneaking out of some person of qualitys house where they are hired by the lady at ten shillings a month while those of better figure and parts do seldom appear to correct these notions and let some reasoners think what they please tis certain that men must be brought to esteem and love the clergy before they can be persuaded to be in love with religion no man values the best medicine if administered by a physician whose person he hates or despises if the clergy were as forward to appear in all companies as other gentlemen and would a little study the arts of conversation to make themselves agreeable they might be welcome at every party where there was the least regard for politeness or good sense and consequently prevent a thousand vicious or profane discourses as well as actions neither would men of understanding complain that a clergyman was a constraint upon the company because they could not speak blasphemy or obscene jests before him while the people are so jealous of the clergys ambition as to abhor all thoughts of the return of ecclesiastic discipline among them i do not see any other method left for men of that function to take in order to reform the world than by using all honest arts to make themselves acceptable to the laity this no doubt is part of that wisdom of the serpent which the author of christianity directs and is the very method used by st paul who became all things to all men to the jews a jew and a greek to the greeks  how to remedy these inconveniences may be a matter of some difficulty since the clergy seem to be of an opinion that this humour of sequestering themselves is a part of their duty nay as i remember they have been told so by some of their bishops in their pastoral letters particularly by one3 among them of great merit and distinction who yet in his own practice hath all his lifetime taken a course directly contrary but i am deceived if an awkward shame and fear of ill usage from the laity have not a greater share in this mistaken conduct than their own inclinations however if the outward profession of religion and virtue were once in practice and countenance at court as well as among all men in office or who have any hopes or dependence for preferment a good treatment of the clergy would be the necessary consequence of such a reformation and they would soon be wise enough to see their own duty and interest in qualifying themselves for layconversation when once they were out of fear of being chocqued by ribaldry or profaneness  footnote 3 bishop burnet of salisbury see swifts remarks on the bishop of sarums introduction ts  there is one further circumstance upon this occasion which i know not whether it will be very orthodox to mention the clergy are the only set of men among us who constantly wear a distinct habit from others the consequence of which not in reason but in fact is this that as long as any scandalous persons appear in that dress it will continue in some degree a general mark of contempt whoever happens to see a scoundrel in a gown reeling home at midnight a sight neither frequent nor miraculous is apt to entertain an ill idea of the whole order and at the same time to be extremely comforted in his own vices some remedy might be put to this if those straggling gentlemen who come up to town to seek their fortunes were fairly dismissed to the west indies where there is work enough and where some better provision should be made for them than i doubt there is at present or what if no person were allowed to wear the habit who had not some preferment in the church or at least some temporal fortune sufficient to keep him out of contempt though in my opinion it were infinitely better if all the clergy except the bishops were permitted to appear like other men of the graver sort unless at those seasons when they are doing the business of their function  there is one abuse in this town which wonderfully contributes to the promotion of vice that such men are often put into the commission of the peace whose interest it is that virtue should be utterly banished from among us who maintain or at least enrich themselves by encouraging the grossest immoralities to whom all the bawds of the ward pay contribution for shelter and protection from the laws thus these worthy magistrates instead of lessening enormities are the occasion of just twice as much debauchery as there would be without them for those infamous women are forced upon doubling their work and industry to answer double charges of paying the justice and supporting themselves like thieves who escape the gallows and are let out to steal in order to discharge the gaolers fees  it is not to be questioned but the queen and ministry might easily redress this abominable grievance by enlarging the number of justices of the peace by endeavouring to choose men of virtuous principles by admitting none who have not considerable fortunes perhaps by receiving into the number some of the most eminent clergy then by forcing all of them upon severe penalties to act when there is occasion and not permitting any who are offered to refuse the commission but in these two last cases which are very material i doubt there will be need of the legislature  the reformation of the stage is entirely in the power of the queen and in the consequences it hath upon the minds of the younger people does very well deserve the strictest care besides the indecent and profane passages besides the perpetual turning into ridicule the very function of the priesthood with other irregularities in most modern comedies which have by others been objected to them it is worth observing the distributive justice of the authors which is constantly applied to the punishment of virtue and the reward of vice directly opposite to the rules of their best critics as well as to the practice of dramatic poets in all other ages and countries for example a country squire who is represented with no other vice but that of being a clown and having the provincial accent upon his tongue which is neither a fault nor in his power to remedy must be condemned to marry a cast wench or a cracked chambermaid on the other side a rakehell of the town whose character is set off with no other accomplishment but excessive prodigality profaneness intemperance and lust is rewarded with a lady of great fortune to repair his own which his vices had almost ruined and as in a tragedy the hero is represented to have obtained many victories in order to raise his character in the minds of the spectators so the hero of a comedy is represented to have been victorious in all his intrigues for the same reason i do not remember that our english poets ever suffered a criminal amour to succeed upon the stage till the reign of king charles the second ever since that time the alderman is made a cuckold the deluded virgin is debauched and adultery and fornication are supposed to be committed behind the scenes as part of the action these and many more corruptions of the theatre peculiar to our age and nation need continue no longer than while the court is content to connive at or neglect them surely a pension would not be ill employed on some men of wit learning and virtue who might have power to strike out every offensive or unbecoming passage from plays already written as well as those that may be offered to the stage for the future by which and other wise regulations the theatre might become a very innocent and useful diversion instead of being a scandal and reproach to our religion and country  the proposals i have hitherto made for the advancement of religion and morality are such as come within reach of the administration such as a pious active prince with a steady resolution might soon bring to effect neither am i aware of any objections to be raised against what i have advanced unless it should be thought that making religion a necessary step to interest and favour might increase hypocrisy among us and i readily believe it would but if one in twenty should be brought over to true piety by this or the like methods and the other nineteen be only hypocrites the advantage would still be great besides hypocrisy is much more eligible than open infidelity and vice it wears the livery of religion it acknowledges her authority and is cautious of giving scandal nay a long continued disguise is too great a constraint upon human nature especially an english disposition men would leave off their vices out of mere weariness rather than undergo the toil and hazard and perhaps expense of practising them perpetually in private and i believe it is often with religion as it is with love which by much dissembling at last grows real  all other projects to this great end have proved hitherto ineffectual laws against immorality have not been executed and proclamations occasionally issued out to enforce them are wholly unregarded as things of form religious societies though begun with excellent intention and by persons of true piety4 have dwindled into factious clubs and grown a trade to enrich little knavish informers of the meanest rank such as common constables and broken shopkeepers  footnote 4 the original edition omits here the words are said i know not whether truly or not all other editions give these words t s  and that some effectual attempt should be made toward such a reformation is perhaps more necessary than people commonly apprehend because the ruin of a state is generally preceded by a universal degeneracy of manners and contempt of religion which is entirely our case at present    dis te minorem quod geris imperashor 5  footnote 5 carmina iii 6 5  neither is this a matter to be deferred till a more convenient time of peace and leisure because a reformation in mens faith and morals is the best natural as well as religious means to bring the war to a good conclusion for if men in trust performed their duty for conscience sake affairs would not suffer through fraud falsehood and neglect as they now perpetually do and if they believed a god and his providence and acted accordingly they might reasonably hope for his divine assistance in so just a cause as ours  nor could the majesty of the english crown appear upon any occasion in a greater lustre either to foreigners or subjects than by an administration which producing such great effects would discover so much power and power being the natural appetite of princes a limited monarch cannot so well gratify it in anything as a strict execution of the laws  besides all parties would be obliged to close with so good a work as this for their own reputation neither is any expedient more likely to unite them for the most violent party men i have ever observed are such as in the conduct of their lives have discovered least sense of religion or morality and when all such are laid aside at least those among them as shall be found incorrigible it will be a matter perhaps of no great difficulty to reconcile the rest  the many corruptions at present in every branch of business are almost inconceivable i have heard it computed by skilful persons that of six millions raised every year for the service of the public one third at least is sunk and intercepted through the several classes and subordinations of artful men in office before the remainder is applied to the proper use this is an accidental ill effect of our freedom and while such men are in trust who have no check from within nor any views but toward their interest there is no other fence against them but the certainty of being hanged upon the first discovery by the arbitrary will of an unlimited monarch or his vizier among us the only danger to be apprehended is the loss of an employment and that danger is to be eluded a thousand ways besides when fraud is great it furnishes weapons to defend itself and at worst if the crimes be so flagrant that a man is laid aside out of perfect shame which rarely happens he retires loaded with the spoils of the nation et fruitur diis iratis i could name a commission where several persons out of a salary of five hundred pounds without other visible revenues have always lived at the rate of two thousand and laid out forty or fifty thousand upon purchases of lands or annuities a hundred other instances of the same kind might easily be produced what remedy therefore can be found against such grievances in a constitution like ours but to bring religion into countenance and encourage those who from the hope of future reward and dread of future punishment will be moved to act with justice and integrity  this is not to be accomplished any other way but by introducing religion as much as possible to be the turn and fashion of the age which only lies in the power of the administration the prince with utmost strictness regulating the court the ministry and other persons in great employment and these by their example and authority reforming all who have dependence on them  it is certain that a reformation successfully carried on in this great town would in time spread itself over the whole kingdom since most of the considerable youth pass here that season of their lives wherein the strongest impressions are made in order to improve their education or advance their fortune and those among them who return into their several counties are sure to be followed and imitated as the greatest patterns of wit and good breeding  and if things were once in this train that is if virtue and religion were established as the necessary titles to reputation and preferment and if vice and infidelity were not only loaded with infamy but made the infallible ruin of all mens pretensions our duty by becoming our interest would take root in our natures and mix with the very genius of our people so that it would not be easy for the example of one wicked prince to bring us back to our former corruptions  i have confined myself as it is before observed to those methods for the advancement of piety which are in the power of a prince limited like ours by a strict execution of the laws already in force and this is enough for a project that comes without any name or recommendation i doubt a great deal more than will suddenly be reduced into practice though if any disposition should appear towards so good a work it is certain that the assistance of the legislative power would be necessary to make it more complete i will instance only a few particulars  in order to reform the vices of this town which as we have said hath so mighty an influence on the whole kingdom it would be very instrumental to have a law made that all taverns and alehouses should be obliged to dismiss their company at twelve at night and shut up their doors and that no woman should be suffered to enter any tavern or alehouse upon any pretence whatsoever it is easy to conceive what a number of ill consequences such a law would prevent the mischiefs of quarrels and lewdness and thefts and midnight brawls the diseases of intemperance and venery and a thousand other evils needless to mention nor would it be amiss if the masters of those publichouses were obliged upon the severest penalties to give only a proportioned quantity of drink to every company and when he found his guests disordered with excess to refuse them any more  i believe there is hardly a nation in christendom where all kind of fraud is practised in so immeasurable a degree as with us the lawyer the tradesman the mechanic have found so many arts to deceive in their several callings that they far outgrow the common prudence of mankind which is in no sort able to fence against them neither could the legislature in anything more consult the public good than by providing some effectual remedy against this evil which in several cases deserves greater punishment than many crimes that are capital among us the vintner who by mixing poison with his wines destroys more lives than any one disease in the bill of mortality the lawyer who persuades you to a purchase which he knows is mortgaged for more than the worth to the ruin of you and your family the goldsmith or scrivener who takes all your fortune to dispose of when he has beforehand resolved to break the following day do surely deserve the gallows much better than the wretch who is carried thither for stealing a horse  it cannot easily be answered to god or man why a law is not made for limiting the press at least so far as to prevent the publishing of such pernicious books as under pretence of freethinking endeavour to overthrow those tenets in religion which have been held inviolable almost in all ages by every sect that pretend to be christian and cannot therefore with any colour of reason be called points in controversy or matters of speculation as some would pretend the doctrine of the trinity the divinity of christ the immortality of the soul and even the truth of all revelation are daily exploded and denied in books openly printed though it is to be supposed neither party will avow such principles or own the supporting of them to be any way necessary to their service6  footnote 6 this passage refers to the deistical publications of asgill toland tindal and collins already noted t s  it would be endless to set down every corruption or defect which requires a remedy from the legislative power senates are like to have little regard for any proposals that come from without doors though under a due sense of my own inabilities i am fully convinced that the unbiassed thoughts of an honest and wise man employed on the good of his country may be better digested than the results of a multitude where faction and interest too often prevail as a single guide may direct the way better than five hundred who have contrary views or look asquint or shut their eyes  i shall therefore mention but one more particular which i think the parliament ought to take under consideration whether it be not a shame to our country and a scandal to christianity that in many towns where there is a prodigious increase in the number of houses and inhabitants so little care should be taken for the building of churches that five parts in six of the people are absolutely hindered from hearing divine service particularly here in london where a single minister with one or two sorry curates hath the care sometimes of above twenty thousand souls incumbent on him a neglect of religion so ignominious in my opinion that it can hardly be equalled in any civilized age or country7  footnote 7 this paragraph is known to have given the first hint to certain bishops particularly to bishop atterbury to procure a fund for building fifty new churches in london t s  but to leave these airy imaginations of introducing new laws for the amendment of mankind what i principally insist on is a due execution of the old which lies wholly in the crown and in the authority derived from thence i return therefore to my former assertion that if stations of power trust profit and honour were constantly made the rewards of virtue and piety such an administration must needs have a mighty influence on the faith and morals of the whole kingdom and men of great abilities would then endeavour to excel in the duties of a religious life in order to qualify themselves for public service i may possibly be wrong in some of the means i prescribe towards this end but that is no material objection against the design itself let those who are at the helm contrive it better which perhaps they may easily do everybody will agree that the disease is manifest as well as dangerous that some remedy is necessary and that none yet applied hath been effectual which is a sufficient excuse for any man who wishes well to his country to offer his thoughts when he can have no other end in view but the public good the present queen is a princess of as many and great virtues as ever filled a throne how would it brighten her character to the present and after ages if she would exert her utmost authority to instil some share of those virtues into her people which they are too degenerate to learn only from her example and be it spoke with all the veneration possible for so excellent a sovereign her best endeavours in this weighty affair are a most important part of her duty as well as of her interest and her honour  but it must be confessed that as things are now every man thinks that he has laid in a sufficient stock of merit and may pretend to any employment provided he has been loud and frequent in declaring himself hearty for the government tis true he is a man of pleasure and a freethinker that is in other words he is profligate in his morals and a despiser of religion but in point of party he is one to be confided in he is an assertor of liberty and property he rattles it out against popery and arbitrary power and priestcraft and high church tis enough he is a person fully qualified for any employment in the court or the navy the law or the revenue where he will be sure to leave no arts untried of bribery fraud injustice oppression that he can practise with any hope of impunity no wonder such men are true to a government where liberty runs high where property however attained is so well secured and where the administration is at least so gentle tis impossible they could choose any other constitution without changing to their loss  fidelity to a present establishment is indeed the principal means to defend it from a foreign enemy but without other qualifications will not prevent corruptions from within and states are more often ruined by these than the other  to conclude whether the proposals i have offered toward a reformation be such as are most prudent and convenient may probably be a question but it is none at all whether some reformation be absolutely necessary because the nature of things is such that if abuses be not remedied they will certainly increase nor ever stop till they end in the subversion of a commonwealth as there must always of necessity be some corruptions so in a wellinstituted state the executive power will be always contending against them by reducing things as michiaevel speaks to their first principles never letting abuses grow inveterate or multiply so far that it will be hard to find remedies and perhaps impossible to apply them as he that would keep his house in repair must attend every little breach or flaw and supply it immediately else time alone will bring all to ruin how much more the common accidents of storms and rain he must live in perpetual danger of his house falling about his ears and will find it cheaper to throw it quite down and build it again from the ground perhaps upon a new foundation or at least in a new form which may neither be so safe nor so convenient as the old                            the sentiments  of a  church of england man  with respect to  religion and government  written in the year 1708   note  the writing of this tract as has been already observed placed swift in a position where allegiance to party was not easy to maintain it amounted to a warning to whigs as well as tories to the former he urged that the church of england was wide enough for the highest principles of civil liberty to the latter he tried to show that to be a religious and godfearing man it was not absolutely necessary to be a tory in politics whoever has examined the conduct and proceedings of both parties for some years past whether in or out of power cannot well conceive it possible to go far towards the extremes of either without offering some violence to his integrity or understanding it is true that whiggism and fanatical genius were almost synonymous terms for swift but that was because the church was of prime consideration with him and the whigs numbered in their ranks the great army of dissent swift in his famous letter to pope dated dublin january 10th 172021 reviews his political opinions of 1708 to justify himself against the misrepresentations of the virulence of libellers whose malice has taken the same train in both by fathering dangerous principles in government upon me which i never maintained and insipid productions which i am not capable of writing that review is but a summary of what is given fully in this tract no appeal was ever better intentioned i only wish he says to pope my endeavours had succeeded better in the great point i had at heart which was that of reconciling the ministers to each other but high church and low church were cries which had divided politicians as if they did not belong to one nation to swift it was easy enough to be a staunch churchman and at the same time expose the fallacies underlying the faith in the sovereign power but then swift was here no party fanatic who would use the church in danger cry for party purposes if others he writes twelve years later who had more concern and more influence would have acted their parts his appeal had not been made in vain as it was it failed in its intended purpose and swift lost what hold he had on somers godolphin and the rest it remains however to testify to swifts principles in a manner least expected by those who have set him down as intemperate and inconsistent certainly no principles were ever more moderately expressed and assuredly no expression of principles found fitter realization in conduct  the text of this edition is based on that given in the miscellanies of 1711 i have not succeeded in obtaining a copy of the original issue but i have collated the various texts given in the reissues by faulkner hawkesworth scott and the miscellanies of 1728 vol i and 1747 vol i  t s     the sentiments of a church of   england man with respect to   religion and government   whosoever hath examined the conduct and proceedings of both parties for some years past whether in or out of power cannot well conceive it possible to go far towards the extremes of either without offering some violence to his integrity or understanding a wise and a good man may indeed be sometimes induced to comply with a number whose opinion he generally approves though it be perhaps against his own but this liberty should be made use of upon very few occasions and those of small importance and then only with a view of bringing over his own side another time to something of greater and more public moment but to sacrifice the innocency of a friend the good of our country or our own conscience to the humour or passion or interest of a party plainly shews that either our heads or our hearts are not as they should be yet this very practice is the fundamental law of each faction among us as may be obvious to any who will impartially and without engagement be at the pains to examine their actions which however is not so easy a task for it seems a principle in human nature to incline one way more than another even in matters where we are wholly unconcerned and it is a common observation that in reading a history of facts done a thousand years ago or standing by at play among those who are perfect strangers to us we are apt to find our hopes and wishes engaged on a sudden in favour of one side more than another no wonder then we are all so ready to interest ourselves in the course of public affairs where the most inconsiderable have some real share and by the wonderful importance which every man is of to himself a very great imaginary one  and indeed when the two parties that divide the whole commonwealth come once to a rupture without any hopes left of forming a third with better principles to balance the others it seems every mans duty to choose a side1 though he cannot entirely approve of either and all pretences to neutrality are justly exploded by both being too stale and obvious only intending the safety and ease of a few individuals while the public is embroiled this was the opinion and practice of the latter cato whom i esteem to have been the wisest and best of all the romans but before things proceed to open violence the truest service a private man may hope to do his country is by unbiassing his mind as much as possible and then endeavouring to moderate between the rival powers which must needs be owned a fair proceeding with the world because it is of all others the least consistent with the common design of making a fortune by the merit of an opinion  footnote 1 faulkner and scott have one of the two sides t s  i have gone as far as i am able in qualifying myself to be such a moderator i believe i am no bigot in religion and i am sure i am none in government i converse in full freedom with many considerable men of both parties and if not in equal number it is purely accidental and personal as happening to be near the court and to have made acquaintance there more under one ministry than another then i am not under the necessity of declaring myself by the prospect of an employment and lastly if all this be not sufficient i industriously conceal my name which wholly exempts me from any hopes and fears in delivering my opinion  in consequence of this free use of my reason i cannot possibly think so well or so ill of either party as they would endeavour to persuade the world of each other and of themselves for instance i do not charge it upon the body of the whigs or the tories that their several principles lead them to introduce presbytery and the religion of the church of rome or a commonwealth and arbitrary power for why should any party be accused of a principle which they solemnly disown and protest against but to this they have a mutual answer ready they both assure us that their adversaries are not to be believed that they disown their principles out of fear which are manifest enough when we examine their practices to prove this they will produce instances on one side either of avowed presbyterians or persons of libertine and atheistical tenets and on the other of professed papists or such as are openly in the interest of the abdicated family now it is very natural for all subordinate sects and denominations in a state to side with some general party and to choose that which they find to agree with themselves in some general principle thus at the restoration the presbyterians anabaptists independents and other sects did all with very good reason unite and solder up their several schemes to join against the church who without regard to their distinctions treated them all as equal adversaries thus our present dissenters do very naturally close in with the whigs who profess moderation declare they abhor all thoughts of persecution and think it hard that those who differ only in a few ceremonies and speculations should be denied the privilege and profit of serving their country in the highest employments of state thus the atheists libertines despisers of religion and revelation in general that is to say all those who usually pass under the name of freethinkers do properly join with the same body because they likewise preach up moderation and are not so overnice to distinguish between an unlimited liberty of conscience and an unlimited freedom of opinion then on the other side the professed firmness of the tories for episcopacy as an apostolical institution their aversion to those sects who lie under the reproach of having once destroyed their constitution and who they imagine by too indiscreet a zeal for reformation have defaced the primitive model of the church next their veneration for monarchical government in the common course of succession and their hatred to republican schemes these i say are principles which not only the nonjuring zealots profess but even papists themselves fall readily in with and every extreme here mentioned flings a general scandal upon the whole body it pretends to adhere to  but surely no man whatsoever ought in justice or good manners to be charged with principles he actually disowns unless his practices do openly and without the least room for doubt contradict his profession not upon small surmises or because he has the misfortune to have ill men sometimes agree with him in a few general sentiments however though the extremes of whig and tory seem with little justice to have drawn religion into their controversies wherein they have small concern yet they both have borrowed one leading principle from the abuse of it which is to have built their several systems of political faith not upon enquiries after truth but upon opposition to each other upon injurious appellations charging their adversaries with horrid opinions and then reproaching them for the want of charity et neuter falso  in order to remove these prejudices i have thought nothing could be more effectual than to describe the sentiments of a church of england man with respect to religion and government this i shall endeavour to do in such a manner as may not be liable to least objection from either party and which i am confident would be assented to by great numbers in both if they were not misled to those mutual misrepresentations by such motives as they would be ashamed to own  i shall begin with religion  and here though it makes an odd sound yet it is necessary to say that whoever professes himself a member of the church of england ought to believe a god and his providence together with revealed religion and the divinity of christ for beside those many thousands who to speak in the phrase of divines do practically deny all this by the immorality of their lives there is no small number who in their conversation and writings directly or by consequence endeavour to overthrow it yet all these place themselves in the list of the national church though at the same time as it is highly reasonable they are great sticklers for liberty of conscience  to enter upon particulars a church of england man hath a true veneration for the scheme established among us of ecclesiastic government and though he will not determine whether episcopacy be of divine right he is sure it is most agreeable to primitive institution fittest of all others for preserving order and purity and under its present regulations best calculated for our civil state he should therefore think the abolishment of that order among us would prove a mighty scandal and corruption to our faith and manifestly dangerous to our monarchy nay he would defend it by arms against all the powers on earth except our own legislature in which case he would submit as to a general calamity a dearth or a pestilence  as to rites and ceremonies and forms of prayer he allows there might be some useful alterations and more which in the prospect of uniting christians might be very supportable as things declared in their own nature indifferent to which he therefore would readily comply if the clergy or though this be not so fair a method if the legislature should direct yet at the same time he cannot altogether blame the former for their unwillingness to consent to any alteration which beside the trouble and perhaps disgrace would certainly never produce the good effects intended by it the only condition that could make it prudent and just for the clergy to comply in altering the ceremonial or any other indifferent part would be a firm resolution in the legislature to interpose by some strict and effectual laws to prevent the rising and spreading of new sects how plausible soever for the future else there must never be an end and it would be to act like a man who should pull down and change the ornaments of his house in compliance to every one who was disposed to find fault as he passed by which besides the perpetual trouble and expense would very much damage and perhaps in time destroy the building sects in a state seem only tolerated with any reason because they are already spread and because it would not be agreeable with so mild a government or so pure a religion as ours to use violent methods against great numbers of mistaken people while they do not manifestly endanger the constitution of either but the greatest advocates for general liberty of conscience will allow that they ought to be checked in their beginnings if they will allow them to be an evil at all or which is the same thing if they will only grant it were better for the peace of the state that there should be none but while the clergy consider the natural temper of mankind in general or of our own country in particular what assurances can they have that any compliances they shall make will remove the evil of dissension while the liberty still continues of professing whatever new opinion we please or how can it be imagined that the body of dissenting teachers who must be all undone by such a revolution will not cast about for some new objections to withhold their flocks and draw in fresh proselytes by some further innovations or refinements  upon these reasons he is for tolerating such different forms in religious worship as are already admitted but by no means for leaving it in the power of those who are tolerated to advance their own models upon the ruin of what is already established which it is natural for all sects to desire and which they cannot justify by any consistent principles if they do not endeavour and yet which they cannot succeed in without the utmost danger to the public peace  to prevent these inconveniences he thinks it highly just that all rewards of trust profit or dignity which the state leaves in the disposal of the administration should be given only to those whose principles direct them to preserve the constitution in all its parts in the late affair of occasional conformity the general argument of those who were against it was not to deny it an evil in itself but that the remedy proposed was violent untimely and improper which is the bishop of salisburys opinion in the speech he made and published against the bill but however just their fears or complaints might have been upon that score he thinks it a little too gross and precipitate to employ their writers already in arguments for repealing the sacramental test upon no wiser a maxim than that no man should on the account of conscience be deprived the liberty of serving his country a topic which may be equally applied to admit papists atheists mahometans heathens and jews if the church wants members of its own to employ in the service of the public or be so unhappily contrived as to exclude from its communion such persons who are likeliest to have great abilities it is time it should be altered and reduced into some more perfect or at least more popular form but in the meanwhile it is not altogether improbable that when those who dislike the constitution are so very zealous in their offers for the service of their country they are not wholly unmindful of their party or of themselves  the dutch whose practice is so often quoted to prove and celebrate the great advantages of a general liberty of conscience have yet a national religion professed by all who bear office among them but why should they be a precedent for us either in religion or government our country differs from theirs as well in situation soil and productions of nature as in the genius and complexion of inhabitants they are a commonwealth founded on a sudden by a desperate attempt in a desperate condition not formed or digested into a regular system by mature thought and reason but huddled up under the pressure of sudden exigencies calculated for no long duration and hitherto subsisting by accident in the midst of contending powers who cannot yet agree about sharing it among them these difficulties do indeed preserve them from any great corruptions which their crazy constitution would extremely subject them to in a long peace that confluence of people in a persecuting age to a place of refuge nearest at hand put them upon the necessity of trade to which they wisely gave all ease and encouragement and if we could think fit to imitate them in this last particular there would need no more to invite foreigners among us who seem to think no further than how to secure their property and conscience without projecting any share in that government which gives them protection or calling it persecution if it be denied them but i speak it for the honour of our administration that although our sects are not so numerous as those in holland which i presume is not our fault and i hope is not our misfortune we much excel them and all christendom besides in our indulgence to tender consciences2 one single compliance with the national form of receiving the sacrament is all we require to qualify any sectary among us for the greatest employments in the state after which he is at liberty to rejoin his own assemblies for the rest of his life besides i will suppose any of the numerous sects in holland to have so far prevailed as to have raised a civil war destroyed their government and religion and put their administrators to death after which i will suppose the people to have recovered all again and to have settled on their old foundation then i would put a query whether that sect which was the unhappy instrument of all this confusion could reasonably expect to be entrusted for the future with the greatest employments or indeed to be hardly tolerated among them  footnote 2 when this was written there was no law against occasional conformity faulkner 1735  to go on with the sentiments of a church of england man he does not see how that mighty passion for the church which some men pretend can well consist with those indignities and that contempt they bestow on the persons of the clergy3 tis a strange mark whereby to distinguish high churchmen that they are such who imagine the clergy can never be too low he thinks the maxim these gentlemen are so fond of that they are for an humble clergy is a very good one and so is he and for an humble laity too since humility is a virtue that perhaps equally benefits and adorns every station of life  footnote 3 i observed very well with what insolence and haughtiness some lords of the highchurch party treated not only their own chaplains but all other clergy whatsoever and thought this was sufficiently recompensed by their professions of zeal to the church  but then if the scribblers on the other side freely speak the sentiments of their party a divine of the church of england cannot look for much better quarter thence you shall observe nothing more frequent in their weekly papers than a way of affecting to confound the terms of clergy and high church of applying both indifferently and then loading the latter with all the calumny they can invent they will tell you they honour a clergyman but talk at the same time as if there were not three in the kingdom who could fall in with their definition4 after the like manner they insult the universities as poisoned fountains and corrupters of youth  footnote 4 i had likewise observed how the whig lords took a direct contrary measure treated the persons of particular clergymen with great courtesy but shewed much illwill and contempt for the order in general  now it seems clear to me that the whigs might easily have procured and maintained a majority among the clergy and perhaps in the universities if they had not too much encouraged or connived at this intemperance of speech and virulence of pen in the worst and most prostitute of their party among whom there has been for some years past such a perpetual clamour against the ambition the implacable temper and the covetousness of the priesthood such a cant of high church and persecution and being priestridden so many reproaches about narrow principles or terms of communion then such scandalous reflections on the universities for infecting the youth of the nation with arbitrary and jacobite principles that it was natural for those who had the care of religion and education to apprehend some general design of altering the constitution of both and all this was the more extraordinary because it could not easily be forgot that whatever opposition was made to the usurpations of king james proceeded altogether from the church of england and chiefly from the clergy and one of the universities for if it were of any use to recall matters of fact what is more notorious than that princes applying himself first to the church of england and upon their refusal to fall in with his measures making the like advances to the dissenters of all kinds who readily and almost universally complied with him affecting in their numerous addresses and pamphlets the style of our brethren the roman catholics whose interests they put on the same foot with their own and some of cromwells officers took posts in the army raised against the prince of orange5 these proceedings of theirs they can only extenuate by urging the provocations they had met from the church in king charless reign which though perhaps excusable upon the score of human infirmity are not by any means a plea of merit equal to the constancy and sufferings of the bishops and clergy or of the head and fellows of magdalen college that furnished the prince of oranges declaration with such powerful arguments to justify and promote the revolution  footnote 5 de foes history of addresses contains some humbling instances of the applause with which the sectaries hailed their old enemy james ii when they saw him engaged in hostility with the established church t s  therefore a church of england man abhors the humour of the age in delighting to fling scandals upon the clergy in general which besides the disgrace to the reformation and to religion itself casts an ignominy upon the kingdom that it does not deserve we have no better materials to compound the priesthood of than the mass of mankind which corrupted as it is those who receive orders must have some vices to leave behind them when they enter into the church and if a few do still adhere it is no wonder but rather a great one that they are no worse therefore he cannot think ambition or love of power more justly laid to their charge than to other men because that would be to make religion itself or at least the best constitution of churchgovernment answerable for the errors and depravity of human nature  within these last two hundred years all sorts of temporal power have been wrested from the clergy and much of their ecclesiastic the reason or justice of which proceeding i shall not examine but that the remedies were a little too violent with respect to their possessions the legislature hath lately confessed by the remission of their first fruits6 neither do the common libellers deny this who in their invectives only tax the church with an insatiable desire of power and wealth equally common to all bodies of men as well as individuals but thank god that the laws have deprived them of both however it is worth observing the justice of parties the sects among us are apt to complain and think it hard usage to be reproached now after fifty years for overturning the state for the murder of a king and the indignity of a usurpation yet these very men and their partisans are continually reproaching the clergy and laying to their charge the pride the avarice the luxury the ignorance and superstition of popish times for a thousand years past  footnote 6 the first fruits were the first years income of ecclesiastical benefices in the middle ages they were taken by the pope as a right but were handed over to the english crown in 1534 anne in 1703 gave them back to the church by letters patent an act confirmed by parliament in 1704 the bounty of queen anne however did not extend to ireland and one of swifts missions in london was to obtain this remission of the first fruits for the irish clergy also t s  he thinks it a scandal to government that such an unlimited liberty should be allowed of publishing books against those doctrines in religion wherein all christians have agreed much more to connive at such tracts as reject all revelation and by their consequences often deny the very being of a god surely tis not a sufficient atonement for the writers that they profess much loyalty to the present government and sprinkle up and down some arguments in favour of the dissenters that they dispute as strenuously as they can for liberty of conscience and inveigh largely against all ecclesiastics under the name of high church and in short under the shelter of some popular principles in politics and religion undermine the foundations of all piety and virtue  as he doth not reckon every schism of that damnable nature which some would represent so he is very far from closing with the new opinion of those who would make it no crime at all and argue at a wild rate that god almighty is delighted with the variety of faith and worship as he is with the varieties of nature to such absurdities are men carried by the affectation of freethinking and removing the prejudices of education under which head they have for some time begun to list morality and religion it is certain that before the rebellion in 1642 though the number of puritans as they were then called was as great as it is with us and though they affected to follow pastors of that denomination yet those pastors had episcopal ordination possessed preferments in the church and were sometimes promoted to bishoprics themselves7 but a breach in the general form of worship was in those days reckoned so dangerous and sinful in itself and so offensive to roman catholics at home and abroad and that it was too unpopular to be attempted neither i believe was the expedient then found out of maintaining separate pastors out of private purses  footnote 7 in the reign of elizabeth and even in that of james the puritans were not properly speaking dissenters but on the contrary formed a sort of low church party in the national establishment archbishop abbot himself has been considered as a puritan t s  when a schism is once spread in a nation there grows at length a dispute which are the schismatics without entering on the arguments used by both sides among us to fix the guilt on each other tis certain that in the sense of the law the schism lies on that side which opposes itself to the religion of the state i leave it among the divines to dilate upon the danger of schism as a spiritual evil but i would consider it only as a temporal one and i think it clear that any great separation from the established worship though to a new one that is more pure and perfect may be an occasion of endangering the public peace because it will compose a body always in reserve prepared to follow any discontented heads upon the plausible pretext of advancing true religion and opposing error superstition or idolatry for this reason plato lays it down as a maxim that men ought to worship the gods according to the laws of the country and he introduces socrates in his last discourse utterly disowning the crime laid to his charge of teaching new divinities or methods of worship thus the poor huguenots of france were engaged in a civil war by the specious pretences of some who under the guise of religion sacrificed so many thousand lives to their own ambition and revenge thus was the whole body of puritans in england drawn to be instruments or abettors of all manner of villainy by the artifices of a few men whose8 designs from the first were levelled to destroy the constitution both of religion and government and thus even in holland itself where it is pretended that the variety of sects live so amicably together and in such perfect obedience to the magistrate it is notorious how a turbulent party joining with the arminians did in the memory of our fathers attempt to destroy the liberty of that republic so that upon the whole where sects are tolerated in a state tis fit they should enjoy a full liberty of conscience and every other privilege of freeborn subjects to which no power is annexed and to preserve their obedience upon all emergencies a government cannot give them too much ease nor trust them with too little power  footnote 8 lord clarendons history but see also gardiners history of england t s  the clergy are usually charged with a persecuting spirit which they are said to discover by an implacable hatred to all dissenters and this appears to be more unreasonable because they suffer less in their interests by a toleration than any of the conforming laity for while the church remains in its present form no dissenter can possibly have any share in its dignities revenues or power whereas by once receiving the sacrament he is rendered capable of the highest employments in the state and it is very possible that a narrow education together with a mixture of human infirmity may help to beget among some of the clergy in possession such an aversion and contempt for all innovators as physicians are apt to have for empirics or lawyers for pettifoggers or merchants for pedlars but since the number of sectaries doth not concern the clergy either in point of interest or conscience it being an evil not in their power to remedy tis more fair and reasonable to suppose their dislike proceeds from the dangers they apprehend to the peace of the commonwealth in the ruin whereof they must expect to be the first and greatest sufferers  to conclude this section it must be observed there is a very good word which hath of late suffered much by both parties and that is moderation which the one side very justly disowns and the other as unjustly pretends to beside what passeth every day in conversation any man who reads the papers published by mr lesley9 and others of his stamp must needs conclude that if this author could make the nation see his adversaries under the colours he paints them in we have nothing else to do but rise as one man and destroy such wretches from the face of the earth on the other side how shall we excuse the advocates for moderation among whom i could appeal to a hundred papers of universal approbation by the cause they were writ for which lay such principles to the whole body of the tories as if they were true and believed our next business should in prudence be to erect gibbets in every parish and hang them out of the way but i suppose it is presumed the common people understand raillery or at least rhetoric and will not take hyperboles in too literal a sense which however in some junctures might prove a desperate experiment  footnote 9 this was charles leslie the second son of the bishop of clogher 16501722 he was educated for the bar but forsook that and entered into holy orders in his zeal for the established church he persecuted the catholics but this did not interfere with his adhesion to jacobite political principles he settled in london and wrote a weekly paper called the rehearsal or a review of the times in which he attacked locke and hoadly he did all he could for the cause of the exiled james but he gave up the work when he found it hopeless and died in ireland he wrote many virulent theological works as well as a host of political tracts t s  and this is moderation in the modern sense of the word to which speaking impartially the bigots of both parties are equally entitled  section ii  the sentiments of a church of england man with respect to government  we look upon it as a very just reproach though we cannot agree where to fix it that there should be so much violence and hatred in religious matters among men who agree in all fundamentals and only differ in some ceremonies or at most mere speculative points yet is not this frequently the case between contending parties in a state for instance do not the generality of whigs and tories among us profess to agree in the same fundamentals their loyalty to the queen their abjuration of the pretender the settlement of the crown in the protestant line and a revolution principle their affection to the church established with toleration of dissenters nay sometimes they go further and pass over into each others principles the whigs become great assertors of the prerogative and the tories of the peoples liberty these crying down almost the whole set of bishops and those defending them so that the differences fairly stated would be much of a sort with those in religion among us and amount to little more than who should take place or go in and out first or kiss the queens hand and what are these but a few court ceremonies or who should be in the ministry and what is that to the body of the nation but a mere speculative point yet i think it must be allowed that no religious sects ever carried their aversions for each other to greater heights than our stateparties have done who the more to inflame their passions have mixed religious and civil animosities together borrowing one of their appellations from the church with the addition of high and low how little soever their disputes relate to the term as it is generally understood  i now proceed to deliver the sentiments of a church of england man with respect to government  he doth not think the church of england so narrowly calculated that it cannot fall in with any regular species of government nor does he think any one regular species of government more acceptable to god than another the three generally received in the schools have all of them their several perfections and are subject to their several depravations however few states are ruined by any defect in their institution but generally by the corruption of manners against which the best institution is no long security and without which a very ill one may subsist and flourish whereof there are two pregnant instances now in europe the first is the aristocracy of venice which founded upon the wisest maxims and digested by a great length of time hath in our age admitted so many abuses through the degeneracy of the nobles that the period of its duration seems to approach the other is the united republics of the statesgeneral where a vein of temperance industry parsimony and a public spirit running through the whole body of the people hath preserved an infant commonwealth of an untimely birth and sickly constitution for above an hundred years through so many dangers and difficulties as a much more healthy one could never have struggled against without those advantages  where security of person and property are preserved by laws which none but the whole can repeal there the great ends of government are provided for whether the administration be in the hands of one or of many where any one person or body of men who do not represent the whole seize into their hands the power in the last resort there is properly no longer a government but what aristotle and his followers call the abuse and corruption of one this distinction excludes arbitrary power in whatever numbers which notwithstanding all that hobbes filmer10 and others have said to its advantage i look upon as a greater evil than anarchy itself as much as a savage is in a happier state of life than a slave at the oar  footnote 10 hobbes thomas 15881679 the english philosopher and author of de cive 1642 treatise on human nature 1650 de corpore politico 1650 leviathan 1651 and other works swift is here combating hobbess advocacy for a sovereign power as vested in a single person  filmer sir robert died 1647 author of the anarchy of a limited and mixed monarchy patriarcha and the freeholders grand inquest in the patriarcha filmer attempted to prove that absolute government by a monarch was a patriarchal institution locke replied to this work in his two treatises on government ts  it is reckoned ill manners as well as unreasonable for men to quarrel upon difference in opinion because that is usually supposed to be a thing which no man can help in himself which however i do not conceive to be an universal infallible maxim except in those cases where the question is pretty equally disputed among the learned and the wise where it is otherwise a man of tolerable reason small experience and willing to be instructed may apprehend he is got into a wrong opinion though the whole course of his mind and inclination would persuade him to believe it true he may be convinced that he is in error though he does not see where it lies by the bad effects of it in the common conduct of his life and by observing those persons for whose wisdom and goodness he has the greatest deference to be of a contrary sentiment according to hobbess comparison of reasoning with casting up accounts whoever finds a mistake in the sum total must allow himself out though after repeated trials he may not see in which article he has misreckoned i will instance in one opinion which i look upon every man obliged in conscience to quit or in prudence to conceal i mean that whoever argues in defence of absolute power in a single person though he offers the old plausible plea that it is his opinion which he cannot help unless he be convinced ought in all free states to be treated as the common enemy of mankind yet this is laid as a heavy charge upon the clergy of the two reigns before the revolution who under the terms of passive obedience and nonresistance are said to have preached up the unlimited power of the prince because they found it a doctrine that pleased the court and made way for their preferment and i believe there may be truth enough in this accusation to convince us that human frailty will too often interpose itself among persons of the holiest function however it may be offered in excuse for the clergy that in the best societies there are some ill members which a corrupted court and ministry will industriously find out and introduce besides it is manifest that the greater number of those who held and preached this doctrine were misguided by equivocal terms and by perfect ignorance in the principles of government which they had not made any part of their study the question originally put and as i remember to have heard it disputed in public schools was this whether under any pretence whatsoever it may be lawful to resist the supreme magistrate which was held in the negative and this is certainly the right opinion but many of the clergy and other learned men deceived by dubious expression mistook the object to which passive obedience was due by the supreme magistrate is properly understood the legislative power which in all government must be absolute and unlimited but the word magistrate seeming to denote a single person and to express the executive power it came to pass that the obedience due to the legislature was for want of knowing or considering this easy distinction misapplied to the administration neither is it any wonder that the clergy or other wellmeaning people should fall into this error which deceived hobbes himself so far as to be the foundation of all the political mistakes in his book where he perpetually confounds the executive with the legislative power though all wellinstituted states have ever placed them in different hands as may be obvious to those who know anything of athens sparta thebes and other republics of greece as well as the greater ones of carthage and rome  besides it is to be considered that when these doctrines began to be preached among us the kingdom had not quite worn out the memory of that unhappy rebellion under the consequences of which it had groaned almost twenty years and a weak prince in conjunction with a succession of most prostitute ministers began again to dispose the people to new attempts which it was no doubt the clergys duty to endeavour to prevent if some of them had not for want of knowledge in temporal affairs and others perhaps from a worse principle proceeded upon a topic that strictly followed would enslave all mankind  among other theological arguments made use of in those times in praise of monarchy and justification of absolute obedience to a prince there seemed to be one of a singular nature it was urged that heaven was governed by a monarch who had none to control his power but was absolutely obeyed then it followed that earthly governments were the more perfect the nearer they imitated the government in heaven all which i look upon as the strongest argument against despotic power that ever was offered since no reason can possibly be assigned why it is best for the world that god almighty hath such a power which doth not directly prove that no mortal man should ever have the like  but though a church of england man thinks every species of government equally lawful he does not think them equally expedient or for every country indifferently there may be something in the climate naturally disposing men toward one sort of obedience as is manifest all over asia where we never read of any commonwealth except some small ones on the western coasts established by the greeks there may be a great deal in the situation of a country and in the present genius of the people it hath been observed that the temperate climates usually run into moderate governments and the extremes into despotic power tis a remark of hobbes that the youth of england are corrupted in their principles of government by reading the authors of greece and rome who writ under commonwealths but it might have been more fairly offered for the honour of liberty that while the rest of the known world was overrun with the arbitrary government of single persons arts and sciences took their rise and flourished only in those few small territories were the people were free and though learning may continue after liberty is lost as it did in rome for a while upon the foundations laid under the commonwealth and the particular patronage of some emperors yet it hardly ever began under a tyranny in any nation because slavery is of all things the greatest clog and obstacle to speculation and indeed arbitrary power is but the first natural step from anarchy or the savage life the adjusting of power and freedom being an effect and consequence of maturer thinking and this is nowhere so duly regulated as in a limited monarchy because i believe it may pass for a maxim in state that the administration cannot be placed in too few hands nor the legislature in too many now in this material point the constitution of the english government far exceeds all others at this time on the earth to which the present establishment of the church doth so happily agree that i think whoever is an enemy to either must of necessity be so to both  he thinks as our monarchy is constituted a hereditary right is much to be preferred before election because the government here especially by some late amendments is so regularly disposed in all its parts that it almost executes itself and therefore upon the death of a prince among us the administration goes on without any rub or interruption for the same reasons we have little to apprehend from the weakness or fury of our monarchs who have such wise councils to guide the first and laws to restrain the other and therefore this hereditary right should be kept so sacred as never to break the succession unless where the preserving of it may endanger the constitution which is not from any intrinsic merit or unalienable right in a particular family but to avoid the consequences that usually attend the ambition of competitors to which elective kingdoms are exposed and which is the only obstacle to hinder them from arriving at the greatest perfection that government can possibly reach hence appears the absurdity of that distinction between a king de facto and one de jure with respect to us for every limited monarch is a king de jure because he governs by the consent of the whole which is authority sufficient to abolish all precedent right if a king come in by conquest he is no longer a limited monarch if he afterward consent to limitations he becomes immediately king de jure for the same reason  the great advocates for succession who affirm it ought not to be violated upon any regard or consideration whatsoever do insist much upon one argument that seems to carry little weight they would have it that a crown is a princes birthright and ought at least to be as well secured to him and his posterity as the inheritance of any private man in short that he has the same title to his kingdom which every individual has to his property now the consequence of this doctrine must be that as a man may find several ways to waste misspend or abuse his patrimony without being answerable to the laws so a king may in like manner do what he will with his own that is he may squander and misapply his revenues and even alienate the crown without being called to an account by his subjects they allow such a prince to be guilty indeed of much folly and wickedness but for those he is to answer to god as every private man must do that is guilty of mismanagement in his own concerns now the folly of this reasoning will best appear by applying it in a parallel case should any man argue that a physician is supposed to understand his own art best that the law protects and encourages his profession and therefore although he should manifestly prescribe poison to all his patients whereof they should immediately die he cannot be justly punished but is answerable only to god or should the same be offered in behalf of a divine who would preach against religion and moral duties in either of these two cases everybody would find out the sophistry and presently answer that although common men are not exactly skilled in the composition or application of medicines or in prescribing the limits of duty yet the difference between poisons and remedies is easily known by their effects and common reason soon distinguishes between virtue and vice and it must be necessary to forbid both these the further practice of their professions because their crimes are not purely personal to the physician or the divine but destructive to the public all which is infinitely stronger in respect to a prince with whose good or ill conduct the happiness or misery of a whole nation is included whereas it is of small consequence to the public farther than examples how any private person manages his property  but granting that the right of a lineal successor to a crown were upon the same foot with the property of a subject still it may at any time be transferred by the legislative power as other properties frequently are the supreme power in a state can do no wrong because whatever that doth is the action of all and when the lawyers apply this maxim to the king they must understand it only in that sense as he is administrator of the supreme power otherwise it is not universally true but may be controlled in several instances easy to produce  and these are the topics we must proceed upon to justify our exclusion of the young pretender in france that of his suspected birth being merely popular and therefore not made use of as i remember since the revolution in any speech vote or proclamation where there was occasion to mention him  as to the abdication of king james which the advocates on that side look upon to have been forcible and unjust and consequently void in itself i think a man may observe every article of the english church without being in much pain about it tis not unlikely that all doors were laid open for his departure and perhaps not without the privity of the prince of orange as reasonably concluding that the kingdom might be settled in his absence but to affirm he had any cause to apprehend the same treatment with his father is an improbable scandal flung upon the nation by a few bigotted french scribblers or the invidious assertion of a ruined party at home in the bitterness of their souls not one material circumstance agreeing with those in 1648 and the greatest part of the nation having preserved the utmost horror for that ignominious murder but whether his removal were caused by his own fears or other mens artifices tis manifest to me that supposing the throne to be vacant which was the foot they went upon the body of the people were thereupon left at liberty to choose what form of government they pleased by themselves or their representatives  the only difficulty of any weight against the proceedings at the revolution is an obvious objection to which the writers upon that subject have not yet given a direct or sufficient answer as if they were in pain at some consequences which they apprehend those of the contrary opinion might draw from it i will repeat this objection as it was offered me some time ago with all its advantages by a very pious learned and worthy gentleman11 of the nonjuring party  footnote 11 mr nelson author of the feasts and fasts of the church of england  the force of his argument turned upon this that the laws made by the supreme power cannot otherwise than by the supreme power be annulled that this consisting in england of a king lords and commons whereof each have a negative voice no two of them can repeal or enact a law without consent of the third much less may any one of them be entirely excluded from its part of the legislature by a vote of the other two that all these maxims were openly violated at the revolution where an assembly of the nobles and people not summoned by the kings writ which was an essential part of the constitution and consequently no lawful meeting did merely upon their own authority declare the king to have abdicated the throne vacant and gave the crown by a vote to a nephew when there were three children to inherit though by the fundamental laws of the realm the next heir is immediately to succeed neither does it appear how a princes abdication can make any other sort of vacancy in the throne than would be caused by his death since he cannot abdicate for his children who claim their right of succession by act of parliament otherwise than by his own consent in form to a bill from the two houses  and this is the difficulty that seems chiefly to stick with the most reasonable of those who from a mere scruple of conscience refuse to join with us upon the revolution principle but for the rest are i believe as far from loving arbitrary government as any others can be who are born under a free constitution and are allowed to have the least share of common good sense  in this objection there are two questions included first whether upon the foot of our constitution as it stood in the reign of the late king james a king of england may be deposed the second is whether the people of england convened by their own authority after the king had withdrawn himself in the manner he did had power to alter the succession  as for the first it is a point i shall not presume to determine and shall therefore only say that to any man who holds the negative i would demand the liberty of putting the case as strongly as i please i will suppose a prince limited by laws like ours yet running into a thousand caprices of cruelty like nero or caligula i will suppose him to murder his mother and his wife to commit incest to ravish matrons to blow up the senate and burn his metropolis openly to renounce god and christ and worship the devil these and the like exorbitances are in the power of a single person to commit without the advice of a ministry or assistance of an army and if such a king as i have described cannot be deposed but by his own consent in parliament i do not well see how he can be resisted or what can be meant by a limited monarchy or what signifies the peoples consent in making and repealing laws if the person who administers hath no tie but conscience and is answerable to none but god i desire no stronger proof that an opinion must be false than to find very great absurdities annexed to it and there cannot be greater than in the present case for it is not a bare speculation that kings may run into such enormities as are abovementioned the practice may be proved by examples not only drawn from the first caesars or later emperors but many modern princes of europe such as peter the cruel philip the second of spain john basilovitz12 of muscovy and in our own nation king john richard the third and henry the eighth but there cannot be equal absurdities supposed in maintaining the contrary opinion because it is certain that princes have it in their power to keep a majority on their side by any tolerable administration till provoked by continual oppressions no man indeed can then answer where the madness of the people will stop  footnote 12 peter the cruel is pedro of castile ivan basilovitz was the first emperor of russia who assumed the title of czar he was born in 1529 and died in 1584  as to the second part of the objection whether the people of england convened by their own authority upon king jamess precipitate departure had power to alter the succession  in answer to this i think it is manifest from the practice of the wisest nations and who seem to have had the truest notions of freedom that when a prince was laid aside for maladministration the nobles and people if they thought it necessary for the public weal did resume the administration of the supreme power the power itself having been always in them and did not only alter the succession but often the very form of government too because they believed there was no natural right in one man to govern another but that all was by institution force or consent thus the cities of greece when they drove out their tyrannical kings either chose others from a new family or abolished the kingly government and became free states thus the romans upon the expulsion of tarquin found it inconvenient for them to be subject any longer to the pride the lust the cruelty and arbitrary will of single persons and therefore by general consent entirely altered the whole frame of their government nor do i find the proceedings of either in this point to have been condemned by any historian of the succeeding ages  but a great deal hath been already said by other writers upon this invidious and beaten subject therefore i shall let it fall though the point is commonly mistaken especially by the lawyers who of all others seem least to understand the nature of government in general like underworkmen who are expert enough at making a single wheel in a clock but are utterly ignorant how to adjust the several parts or regulate the movements  to return therefore from this digression it is a church of england mans opinion that the freedom of a nation consists in an absolute unlimited legislative power wherein the whole body of the people are fairly represented and in an executive duly limited because on this side likewise there may be dangerous degrees and a very ill extreme for when two parties in a state are pretty equal in power pretensions merit and virtue for these two last are with relation to parties and a court quite different things it hath been the opinion of the best writers upon government that a prince ought not in any sort to be under the guidance or influence of either because he declines by this means from his office of presiding over the whole to be the head of a party which besides the indignity renders him answerable for all public mismanagements and the consequences of them and in whatever state this happens there must either be a weakness in the prince or ministry or else the former is too much restrained by the legislature1  footnote 1 this is as given in the miscellanies 1711 scott and faulkner print by the nobles or those who represent the people t s  to conclude a church of england man may with prudence and a good conscience approve the professed principles of one party more than the other according as he thinks they best promote the good of church and state but he will never be swayed by passion or interest to advance an opinion merely because it is that of the party he most approves which one single principle he looks upon as the root of all our civil animosities to enter into a party as into an order of friars with so resigned an obedience to superiors is very unsuitable both with the civil and religious liberties we so zealously assert thus the understandings of a whole senate are often enslaved by three or four leaders on each side who instead of intending the public weal have their hearts wholly set upon ways and means how to get or to keep employments but to speak more at large how has this spirit of faction mingled itself with the mass of the people changed their nature and manners and the very genius of the nation broke all the laws of charity neighbourhood alliance and hospitality destroyed all ties of friendship and divided families against themselves and no wonder it should be so when in order to find out the character of a person instead of inquiring whether he be a man of virtue honour piety wit good sense or learning the modern question is only whether he be a whig or a tory under which terms all good and ill qualities are included  now because it is a point of difficulty to choose an exact middle between two ill extremes it may be worth enquiring in the present case which of these a wise and good man would rather seem to avoid taking therefore their own good and ill characters with due abatements and allowances for partiality and passion i should think that in order to preserve the constitution entire in church and state whoever has a true value for both would be sure to avoid the extremes of whig for the sake of the former and the extremes of tory on account of the latter  i have now said all that i could think convenient upon so nice a subject and find i have the ambition common with other reasoners to wish at least that both parties may think me in the right which would be of some use to those who have any virtue left but are blindly drawn into the extravagancies of either upon false representations to serve the ambition or malice of designing men without any prospect of their own but if that is not to be hoped for my next wish should be that both might think me in the wrong which i would understand as an ample justification of myself and a sure ground to believe that i have proceeded at least with impartiality and perhaps with truth                             remarks  upon a  book  intituled  the rights of the christian church c  written in the year 1708 but left unfinished   note  dr matthew tindal of whom a short account has already been given see note p 9 issued his rights of the christian church in 1706 in 1707 it had already gone through three editions the full title of the work is the rights of the christian church asserted against the romish and all other priests who claim an independent power over it with a preface concerning the government of the church of england as by law established ostensibly the book was an attack on the roman catholic church but the attack was so cleverly veiled that it included in its criticisms the church of england also and must take its place among the works of the deistical writers of the time who aimed at subverting the foundations of the relationships between the church and the state according to dr hicks who wrote several works in reply to tindals book tindal told a gentleman who found him at work on it that he was writing a book which would make the clergy mad if so he did not fall short of his intention for not only the clergy but even learned laymen became mad in addition to dr hicks of oxford the church of england found champions in dr william wotton samuel hill conyersplace mr oldisworth and swift swift delayed the preparation of the materials for his reply or else he found other matters to occupy his timethe sacheverel business came on soon after and the tindal controversy lost interest in this more immediate and more important affair so that swifts criticism remained unfinished and was only published when his editors came to search among his papers in 1710 tindals work was ordered by a vote of the house of commons to be publicly burned by the hangman the grand jury of middlesex were presented that the author printer and publisher of the rights of the christian church to be dangerous and disaffected persons and promoters of sedition and profaneness and this charge was grounded on the following extracts i take these from scotts note and i find that the page references are to the second edition of tindals work issued in 1706  the church is a private society and no more power belonging to it than to other private companies and clubs and consequently all the right anyone has to be an ecclesiastical officer and the power he is entrusted with depends on the consent of the parties concerned and is no greater than they can bestow preface p xxx  the scriptures nowhere make the receiving the lords supper from the hands of a priest necessary p 104  the remembrance of christs sufferings a mere gracecup delivered to be handed about p 105  among christians one no more than another can be reckoned a priest from scriptureand the clerk has as good a title to the priesthood as the parson  every one as well as the minister rightly consecrateth the elements to himself  anything farther than this may rather be called conjuration than consecration p 108  the absurdities of bishops being by divine appointment governors of the christian church and no others are capable of being of that number who derive not their right by an uninterrupted succession of bishops in the catholic church p 313  the supreme powers had no way to escape the heavier oppressions and more insupportable usurpations of their own clergy than by submitting to the popes milder yoke and gentler authority p 255  one grand cause of mistake is not considering when god acts as governor of the universe and when as prince of a particular nation the jews when they came out of the land of bondage were under no settled government till god was pleased to offer himself to be their king to which all the people expressly consented  gods laws bound no nation except those that agreed to the horeb contract p 151  not only an independent power of excommunication but of ordination in the clergy is inconsistent with the magistrates right to protect the commonwealth p 87  priests no better than spiritual makebaits baraters boutefeux and incendiaries and who make churches serve to worse purposes than bear gardens p 118  it is a grand mistake to suppose the magistrates power extends to indifferent things  men have liberty as they please and a right  to form what clubs companies or meetings they think fit either for business or pleasure which the magistrate  cannot hinder without manifest injustice p 15  god  interposed not among the jews until they had chosen him for their king p 312  for a full account of tindal and his work see the memoirs of the life and writings of matthew tindal with a history of the controversies wherein he was engaged published in 1733 the text of the present reprint of swifts remarks is based on that given in works vol vii of the 4to edition of 1764 it has also been collated with the 8vo edition of same date vol xiii and with that of 1762 vol xiii  t s     remarks upon a book intituled   the rights of the christian   church c   before i enter upon a particular examination of this treatise it will be convenient to do two things  first to give some account of the author together with the motives that might probably engage him in such a work and  secondly to discover the nature and tendency in general of the work itself  the first of these although it hath been objected against seems highly reasonable especially in books that instil pernicious principles for although a book is not intrinsically much better or worse according to the stature or complexion of the author yet when it happens to make a noise we are apt and curious as in other noises to look about from whence it cometh but however there is something more in the matter  if a theological subject be well handled by a layman it is better received than if it came from a divine and that for reasons obvious enough which although of little weight in themselves will ever have a great deal with mankind  but when books are written with ill intentions to advance dangerous opinions or destroy foundations it may be then of real use to know from what quarter they come and go a good way towards their confutation for instance if any man should write a book against the lawfulness of punishing felony with death and upon enquiry the author should be found in newgate under condemnation for robbing a house his arguments would not very unjustly lose much of their force from the circumstances he lay under so when milton writ his book of divorces it was presently rejected as an occasional treatise because every body knew he had a shrew for his wife neither can there be any reason imagined why he might not after he was blind have writ another upon the danger and inconvenience of eyes but it is a piece of logic which will hardly pass on the world that because one man hath a sore nose therefore all the town should put plasters upon theirs so if this treatise about the rights of the church should prove to be the work of a man steady in his principles of exact morals and profound learning a true lover of his country and a hater of christianity as what he really believes to be a cheat upon mankind whom he would undeceive purely for their good it might be apt to check unwary men even of good dispositions towards religion but if it be found the production of a man soured with age and misfortunes together with the consciousness of past miscarriages of one who in hopes of preferment was reconciled to the popish religion1 of one wholly prostitute in life and principles and only an enemy to religion because it condemns them in this case and this last i find is the universal opinion he is like to have few proselytes beside those who from a sense of their vicious lives require to be perpetually supplied by such amusements as this which serve to flatter their wishes and debase their understandings  footnote 1 dr matthew tindal became a convert to the romish religion during the reign of james ii what share interest had in his conversion may be easily imagined but it is uncertain whether it was the disappointment of his expectations or conviction that in 1687 induced him to reconcile himself to the church of england and become a decided favourer of those doctrines which produced the revolution he often sat as a judge in the court of delegates but did not practise much as an advocate in doctors commons his chief means of support was a pension from government of £200 tindal died in 1733 three years after publication of his grand deistical work christianity as old as the creation his effects amounting to £2000 and upwards were appropriated by the noted eustace budgell to the prejudice of the heir at law under a will attended with circumstances of great suspicion t s  i know there are some who would fain have it that this discourse was written by a club of freethinkers among whom the supposed author only came in for a share but sure we cannot judge so meanly of any party without affronting the dignity of mankind if this be so and if here be the product of all their quotas and contributions we must needs allow that freethinking is a most confined and limited talent it is true indeed the whole discourse seemeth to be a motley inconsistent composition made up of various shreds of equal fineness although of different colours it is a bundle of incoherent maxims and assertions that frequently destroy one another but still there is the same flatness of thought and style the same weak advances towards wit and raillery the same petulancy and pertness of spirit the same train of superficial reading the same thread of threadbare quotations the same affectation of forming general rules upon false and scanty premises and lastly the same rapid venom sprinkled over the whole which like the dying impotent bite of a trodden benumbed snake may be nauseous and offensive but cannot be very dangerous  and indeed i am so far from thinking this libel to be born of several fathers that it hath been the wonder of several others as well as myself how it was possible for any man who appeareth to have gone the common circle of academical education2 who hath taken so universal a liberty and hath so entirely laid aside all regards not only of christianity but common truth and justice one who is dead to all sense of shame and seemeth to be past the getting or losing a reputation should with so many advantages and upon so unlimited a subject come out with so poor so jejune a production should we pity or be amazed at so perverse a talent which instead of qualifying an author to give a new turn to old matter disposeth him quite contrary to talk in an old beaten trivial manner upon topics wholly new to make so many sallies into pedantry without a call upon a subject the most alien and in the very moments he is declaiming against it and in an age too where it is so violently exploded especially among those readers he proposeth to entertain  footnote 2 see note p 9 where it will be seen that tindal was an oxford man ts  i know it will be said that this is only to talk in the common style of an answerer but i have not so little policy if there were any hope of reputation or merit from such victory i should be apt like others to cry up the courage and conduct of an enemy whereas to detect the weakness the malice the sophistry the falsehood the ignorance of such a writer requireth little more than to rank his perfections in such an order and place them in such a light that the commonest reader may form a judgment of them  it may still be a wonder how so heavy a book written upon a subject in appearance so little instructive or diverting should survive to three editions and consequently find a better reception than is usual with such bulky spiritless volumes and this in an age that pretendeth so soon to be nauseated with what is tedious and dull to which i can only return that as burning a book by the common hangman is a known expedient to make it sell so to write a book that deserveth such treatment is another and a third perhaps as effectual as either is to ply an insipid worthless tract with grave and learned answers as dr hickes dr potter3 and mr wotton have done design and performances however commendable have glanced a reputation upon the piece which oweth its life to the strength of those hands and weapons that were raised to destroy it like flinging a mountain upon a worm which instead of being bruised by the advantage of its littleness lodgeth under it unhurt  footnote 3 george hickes dd 16421715 born at newsham yorks and educated at oxford he visited scotland with his patron the duke of lauderdale in 1677 and was presented by the st andrews university with the degree of lld became dean of worcester in 1683 but lost that office at the revolution for not taking the oaths the nonjuring prelates in 1693 consecrated him bishop of thetford dr hickes was a profound scholar and well versed in northern literature among his works may be named institutiones grammaticae anglosaxonicae et maesogothicae antiquae literaturae septentrionalis thesaurus  john potter dd 16741747 born at wakefield and educated at oxford in 1707 he published a discourse on church government and eight years later became bishop of oxford on the death of wake in 1737 he was appointed to the archbishopric of canterbury ts  but neither is this all for the subject as unpromising as it seemeth at first view is no less than that of lucretius to free mens minds from the bondage of religion and this not by little hints and by piecemeal after the manner of those little atheistical tracts that steal into the world but in a thorough wholesale manner by making religion church christianity with all their concomitants a perfect contrivance of the civil power it is an imputation often charged on this sort of men that by their invectives against religion they can possibly propose no other end than that of fortifying themselves and others against the reproaches of a vicious life it being necessary for men of libertine practices to embrace libertine principles or else they cannot act in consistence with any reason or preserve any peace of mind whether such authors have this design whereof i think they have never gone about to acquit themselves thus much is certain that no other use is made of such writings neither did i ever hear this authors book justified by any person either whig or tory except such who are of that profligate character and i believe whoever examineth it will be of the same opinion although indeed such wretches are so numerous that it seemeth rather surprising why the book hath had no more editions than why it should have so many  having thus endeavoured to satisfy the curious with some account of this authors character let us examine what might probably be the motives to engage him in such a work i shall say nothing of the principal which is a sum of money because that is not a mark to distinguish him from any other trader with the press i will say nothing of revenge and malice from resentment of the indignities and contempt he hath undergone for his crime of apostasy to this passion he has thought fit to sacrifice order propriety discretion and common sense as may be seen in every page of his book but i am deceived if there were not a third motive as powerful as the other two and that is vanity about the latter end of king jamess reign he had almost finished a learned discourse in defence of the church of rome and to justify his conversion all which upon the revolution was quite out of season having thus prostituted his reputation and at once ruined his hopes he had no course left but to shew his spite against religion in general the false pretensions to which had proved so destructive to his credit and fortune and at the same time loth to employ the speculations of so many years to no purpose by an easy turn the same arguments he had made use of to advance popery were full as properly levelled by him against christianity itself like the image which while it was new and handsome was worshipped for a saint and when it came to be old and broken was still good enough to make a tolerable devil and therefore every reader will observe that the arguments for popery are much the strongest of any in his book as i shall further remark when i find them in my way  there is one circumstance in his titlepage which i take to be not amiss where he calleth his book part the first this is a project to fright away answerers and make the poor advocates for religion believe he still keepeth further vengeance in petto it must be allowed he hath not wholly lost time while he was of the romish communion this very trick he learned from his old father the pope whose custom it is to lift up his hand and threaten to fulminate when he never meant to shoot his bolts because the princes of christendom had learned the secret to avoid or despise them dr hickes knew this very well and therefore in his answer to this book of rights where a second part is threatened like a rash person he desperately crieth let it come but i who have not too much phlegm to provoke angry wits of his standard must tell the author that the doctor plays the wag as if he were sure it were all grimace for my part i declare if he writeth a second part i will not write another answer or if i do it shall be published before the other part cometh out4  footnote 4 tindal did however attempt to maintain his ground against his numerous opponents in a defence of the rights of the christian church against a late visitation sermon 8vo 1707 and also in a second defence of the rights of the christian church considered in two late indictments against a bookseller and his servant for selling one of the said books 1707 t s  there may have been another motive although it be hardly credible both for publishing this work and threatening a second part it is not soon conceived how far the sense of a mans vanity will transport him this man must have somewhere heard that dangerous enemies have been often bribed to silence with money or preferment and therefore to shew how formidable he is he hath published his first essay and in hopes of hire to be quiet hath frighted us with his design of another what must the clergy do in these unhappy circumstances if they should bestow this man bread enough to stop his mouth it will but open those of a hundred more who are every whit as well qualified to rail as he and truly when i compare the former enemies to christianity such as socinus5 hobbes and spinosa6 with such of their successors as toland asgil coward gildon7 this author of the rights and some others the church appeareth to me like the sick old lion in the fable who after having his person outraged by the bull the elephant the horse and the bear took nothing so much to heart as to find himself at last insulted by the spurn of an ass  footnote 5 laelius socinus 15251562 born at siena he studied at bologna and in 1546 became a member of a secret freethinking society in venice the society however was broken up and socinus left italy for switzerland and poland he died at zurich his papers were published by his nephew faustus socinus who founded a sect on the tenets they taught  footnote 6 benedict or baruch spinoza 16321677 born at amsterdam of a portuguese jewish family he was excommunicated by his people for atheism he retired to the hague and took to making lenses and the study of philosophy his ethics and tractatus theologicopoliticus constitute a system of philosophy which has had no little influence on modern thought see pollocks spinoza  footnote 7 charles gildon 166517234 was educated at douay he printed a book called the deists manual for accounts of coward toland and asgil see note p 9 i will now add a few words to give the reader some general notion of the nature and tendency of the work itself  i think i may assert without the least partiality that it is a treatise wholly devoid of wit or learning under the most violent and weak endeavours and pretences to both that it is replenished throughout with bold rude improbable falsehoods and gross misinterpretations and supported by the most impudent sophistry and false logic i have anywhere observed to this he hath added a paltry traditional cant of priestrid and priestcraft without reason or pretext as he applyeth it and when he raileth at those doctrines in popery which no protestant was ever supposed to believe he leads the reader however by the hand to make applications against the english clergy and then he never faileth to triumph as if he had made a very shrewd and notable stroke and because the court and kingdom seemeth disposed to moderation with regard to dissenters more perhaps than is agreeable to the hot unreasonable temper of some mistaken men among us therefore under the shelter of that popular opinion he ridiculeth all that is sound in religion even christianity itself under the names of jacobite tackers high church and other terms of factious jargon all which if it were to be first rased from his book as just so much of nothing to the purpose how little would remain to give the trouble of an answer to which let me add that the spirit or genius which animates the whole is plainly perceived to be nothing else but the abortive malice of an old neglected man8 who hath long lain under the extremes of obloquy poverty and contempt that have soured his temper and made him fearless but where is the merit of being bold to a man that is secure of impunity to his person and is past apprehension of anything else he that hath neither reputation nor bread hath very little to lose and hath therefore as little to fear and as it is usually said whoever values not his own life is master of another mans so there is something like it in reputation he that is wholly lost to all regards of truth or modesty may scatter so much calumny and scandal that some part may perhaps be taken up before it fall to the ground because the ill talent of the world is such that those who will be at pains enough to inform themselves in a malicious story will take none at all to be undeceived nay will be apt with some reluctance to admit a favourable truth  footnote 8 tindal was not an old man at the time swift wrote certainly not older than was swift himself t s  to expostulate therefore with this author for doing mischief to religion is to strew his bed with roses he will reply in triumph that this was his design and i am loth to mortify him by asserting he hath done none at all for i never yet saw so poor an atheistical scribble which would not serve as a twig for sinking libertines to catch at it must be allowed in their behalf that the faith of christians is not as a grain of mustard seed in comparison of theirs which can remove such mountains of absurdities and submit with so entire a resignation to such apostles if these men had any share of that reason they pretend to they would retire into christianity merely to give it ease and therefore men can never be confirmed in such doctrines until they are confirmed in their vices which last as we have already observed is the principal design of this and all other writers against revealed religion  i am now opening the book which i propose to examine an employment as it is entirely new to me so it is that to which of all others i have naturally the greatest antipathy and indeed who can dwell upon a tedious piece of insipid thinking and false reasoning so long as i am likely to do without sharing the infection  but before i plunge into the depths of the book itself i must be forced to wade through the shallows of a long preface  this preface large as we see it is only made up of such supernumerary arguments against an independent power in the church as he could not without nauseous repetition scatter into the body of his book and it is detached like a forlorn hope to blunt the enemys sword that intendeth to attack him now i think it will be easy to prove that the opinion of imperium in imperio in the sense he chargeth it upon the clergy of england is what no one divine of any reputation and very few at all did ever maintain and that their universal sentiment in this matter is such as few protestants did ever dispute but if the author of the regale or two or three more obscure writers have carried any points further than scripture and reason will allow which is more than i know or shall trouble myself to enquire the clergy of england is no more answerable for those than the laity is for all the folly and impertinence of this treatise and therefore that people may not be amused or think this man is somewhat that he hath advanced or defended any oppressed truths or overthrown any growing dangerous errors i will set in as clear a light as i can what i conceive to be held by the established clergy and all reasonable protestants in this matter  everybody knows and allows that in all government there is an absolute unlimited legislative power which is originally in the body of the people although by custom conquest usurpation or other accidents sometimes fallen into the hands of one or a few this in england is placed in the three estates otherwise called the two houses of parliament in conjunction with the king and whatever they please to enact or to repeal in the settled forms whether it be ecclesiastical or civil immediately becometh law or nullity their decrees may be against equity truth reason and religion but they are not against law because law is the will of the supreme legislature and that is themselves and there is no manner of doubt but the same authority whenever it pleaseth may abolish christianity and set up the jewish mahometan or heathen religion in short they may do anything within the compass of human power and therefore who will dispute that the same law which deprived the church not only of lands misapplied to superstitious uses but even the tithes and glebes the ancient and necessary support of parish priests may take away all the rest whenever the lawgivers please and make the priesthood as primitive as this writer or others of his stamp can desire  but as the supreme power can certainly do ten thousand things more than it ought so there are several things which some people may think it can do although it really cannot for it unfortunately happens that edicts which cannot be executed will not alter the nature of things so if a king and parliament should please to enact that a woman who hath been a month married is virgo intacta would that actually restore her to her primitive state if the supreme power should resolve a corporal of dragoons to be a doctor of divinity law or physic few i believe would trust their souls fortunes or bodies to his direction because that power is neither fit to judge or teach those qualifications which are absolutely necessary to the several professions put the case that walking on the slack rope were the only talent required by act of parliament for making a man a bishop no doubt when a man had done his feat of activity in form he might sit in the house of lords put on his robes and his rochet go down to his palace receive and spend his rents but it requireth very little christianity to believe this tumbler to be one whit more a bishop than he was before because the law of god hath otherwise decreed which law although a nation may refuse to receive it cannot alter in its own nature  and here lies the mistake of this superficial man who is not able to distinguish between what the civil power can hinder and what it can do if the parliament can annul ecclesiastical laws they must be able to make them since no greater power is required for one than the other see pref p viii this consequence he repeateth above twenty times and always in the wrong he affecteth to form a few words into the shape and size of a maxim then trieth it by his ear and according as he likes the sound or cadence pronounceth it true cannot i stand over a man with a great pole and hinder him from making a watch although i am not able to make one myself if i have strength enough to knock a man on the head doth it follow i can raise him to life again the parliament may condemn all the greek and roman authors can it therefore create new ones in their stead they may make laws indeed and call them canon and ecclesiastical laws and oblige all men to observe them under pain of high treason and so may i who love as well as any man to have in my own family the power in the last resort take a turnip then tie a string to it and call it a watch and turn away all my servants if they refuse to call it so too  for my own part i must confess that this opinion of the independent power of the church or imperium in imperio wherewith this writer raiseth such a dust is what i never imagined to be of any consequence never once heard disputed among divines nor remember to have read otherwise than as a scheme in one or two authors of middle rank but with very little weight laid on it and i dare believe there is hardly one divine in ten that ever once thought of this matter yet to see a large swelling volume written only to encounter this doctrine what could one think less than that the whole body of the clergy were perpetually tiring the press and the pulpit with nothing else  i remember some years ago a virtuoso writ a small tract about worms proved them to be in more places than was generally observed and made some discoveries by glasses this having met with some reception presently the poor mans head was full of nothing but worms all we eat and drink all the whole consistence of human bodies and those of every other animal the very air we breathe in short all nature throughout was nothing but worms and by that system he solved all difficulties and from thence all causes in philosophy thus it hath fared with our author and his independent power the attack against occasional conformity the scarcity of coffee the invasion of scotland the loss of kerseys and narrow cloths the death of king william the authors turning papist for preferment the loss of the battle of almanza with ten thousand other misfortunes are all owing to this imperium in imperio  it will be therefore necessary to set this matter in a clear light by enquiring whether the clergy have any power independent of the civil and of what nature it is  whenever the christian religion was embraced by the civil power in any nation there is no doubt but the magistrates and senates were fully instructed in the rudiments of it besides the christians were so numerous and their worship so open before the conversion of princes that their discipline as well as doctrine could not be a secret they saw plainly a subordination of ecclesiastics bishops priests and deacons that these had certain powers and employments different from the laity that the bishops were consecrated and set apart for that office by those of their own order that the presbyters and deacons were differently set apart always by the bishops that none but the ecclesiastics presumed to pray or preach in places set apart for gods worship or to administer the lords supper that all questions relating either to discipline or doctrine were determined in ecclesiastical conventions these and the like doctrines and practices being most of them directly proved and the rest by very fair consequences deduced from the words of our saviour and his apostles were certainly received as a divine law by every prince or state which admitted the christian religion and consequently what they could not justly alter afterwards any more than the common laws of nature and therefore although the supreme power can hinder the clergy or church from making any new canons or executing the old from consecrating bishops or refuse those that they do consecrate or in short from performing any ecclesiastical office as they may from eating drinking and sleeping yet they cannot themselves perform those offices which are assigned to the clergy by our saviour and his apostles or if they do it is not according to the divine institution and consequently null and void our saviour telleth us his kingdom is not of this world and therefore to be sure the world is not of his kingdom nor can ever please him by interfering in the administration of it since he hath appointed ministers of his own and hath empowered and instructed them for that purpose so that i believe the clergy who as he sayeth are good at distinguishing would think it reasonable to distinguish between their power and the liberty of exercising this power the former they claim immediately from christ and the latter from the permission connivance or authority of the civil government with which the clergys power according to the solution i have given cannot possibly interfere  but this writer setting up to form a system upon stale scanty topics and a narrow circle of thought falleth into a thousand absurdities and for a further help he hath a talent of rattling out phrases which seem to have sense but have none at all the usual fate of those who are ignorant of the force and compass of words without which it is impossible for a man to write either pertinently or intelligibly upon the most obvious subjects  so in the beginning of his preface page iv he says the church of england being established by acts of parliament is a perfect creature of the civil power i mean the polity and discipline of it and it is that which maketh all the contention for as to the doctrines expressed in the articles i do not find high church to be in any manner of pain but they who lay claim to most orthodoxy can distinguish themselves out of them it is observable in this author that his style is naturally harsh and ungrateful to the ear and his expressions mean and trivial but whenever he goeth about to polish a period you may be certain of some gross defect in propriety or meaning so the lines just quoted seem to run easily over the tongue and upon examination they are perfect nonsense and blunder to speak in his own borrowed phrase what is contained in the idea of established surely not existence doth establishment give being to a thing he might have said the same thing of christianity in general or the existence of god since both are confirmed by acts of parliament but the best is behind for in the next line having named the church half a dozen times before he now says he meaneth only the polity and discipline of it as if having spoke in praise of the art of physic a man should explain himself that he meant only the institution of a college of physicians into a president and fellows and it will appear that this author however versed in the practice hath grossly transgressed the rules of nonsense whose property it is neither to affirm nor deny since every visible assertion gathered from those few lines is absolutely false for where was the necessity of excepting the doctrines expressed in the articles since these are equally creatures of the civil power having been established by acts of parliament as well as the others but the church of england is no creature of the civil power either as to its polity or doctrines the fundamentals of both were deduced from christ and his apostles and the instructions of the purest and earliest ages and were received as such by those princes or states who embraced christianity whatever prudential additions have been made to the former by human laws which alone can be justly altered or annulled by them  what i have already said would i think be a sufficient answer to his whole preface and indeed to the greatest part of his book which is wholly turned upon battering down a sort of independent power in the clergy which few or none of them ever claimed or defended but there being certain peculiarities in this preface that very much set off the wit the learning the raillery reasoning and sincerity of the author i shall take notice of some of them as i pass  but here i hope it will not be expected that i should bestow remarks upon every passage in this book that is liable to exception for ignorance falsehood dulness or malice where he is so insipid that nothing can be struck out for the readers entertainment i shall observe horaces rule  quae desperes tractata nitescere posse relinquas  upon which account i shall say nothing of that great instance of his candour and judgment in relation to dr stillingfleet9 who happening to lie under his displeasure upon the fatal test of imperium in imperio is high church and jacobite took the oaths of allegiance to save him from the gallows10 and subscribed the articles only to keep his preferment whereas the character of that prelate is universally known to have been directly the reverse of what this writer gives him  footnote 9 edward stillingfleet 16351699 educated at cambridge wrote in 1659 his irenicum or weapon salve for the churchs wounds he also published a rational account of the protestant religion in 1664 he occupied successively the important clerical offices of prebendary of st pauls archdeaconry of london deanery of st pauls and bishopric of worcester the later years of his life were occupied in a controversy with locke on that writers essay on the human understanding t s  footnote 10 page v he quotes bishop stillingfleets vindication of the doctrine of the trinity where the bishop says that a man might be very right in the belief of an article though mistaken in the explication of it upon which tindal observes these men treat the articles as they do the oath of allegiance which they say obliges them not actually to assist the government but to do nothing against it that is nothing that would bring em to the gallows note in edition 1764 4to  but before he can attempt to ruin this damnable opinion of two independent powers he telleth us page vi it will be necessary to shew what is contained in the idea of government now it is to be understood that this refined way of speaking was introduced by mr locke after whom the author limpeth as fast as he is able all the former philosophers in the world from the age of socrates to ours would have ignorantly put the question quid est imperium but now it seemeth we must vary our phrase and since our modern improvement of human understanding instead of desiring a philosopher to describe or define a mousetrap or tell me what it is i must gravely ask what is contained in the idea of a mousetrap but then to observe how deeply this new way of putting questions to a mans self maketh him enter into the nature of things his present business is to show us what is contained in the idea of government the company knoweth nothing of the matter and would gladly be instructed which he doth in the following words p 5  it would be in vain for one intelligent being to pretend to set rules to the actions of another if he had it not in his power to reward the compliance with or punish the deviations from his rules by some good or evil which is not the natural consequence of those actions since the forbidding men to do or forbear an action on the account of that convenience or inconvenience which attendeth it whether he who forbids it will or no can be no more than advice  i shall not often draw such long quotations as this which i could not forbear to offer as a specimen of the propriety and perspicuity of this authors style and indeed what a light breaketh out upon us all as soon as we have read these words how thoroughly are we instructed in the whole nature of government what mighty truths are here discovered and how clearly conveyed to our understandings and therefore let us melt this refined jargon into the old style for the improvement of such who are not enough conversant in the new  if the author were one who used to talk like one of us he would have spoke in this manner i think it necessary to give a full and perfect definition of government such as will shew the nature and all the properties of it and my definition is thus one man will never cure another of stealing horses merely by minding him of the pains he hath taken the cold he hath got and the shoeleather he hath lost in stealing that horse nay to warn him that the horse may kick or fling him or cost him more than he is worth in hay and oats can be no more than advice for the gallows is not the natural effect of robbing on the highway as heat is of fire and therefore if you will govern a man you must find out some other way of punishment than what he will inflict upon himself  or if this will not do let us try it in another case which i instanced before and in his own terms suppose he had thought it necessary and i think it was as much so as the other to shew us what is contained in the idea of a mousetrap he must have proceeded in these terms it would be in vain for an intelligent being to set rules for hindering a mouse from eating his cheese unless he can inflict upon that mouse some punishment which is not the natural consequence of eating the cheese for to tell her it may lie heavy on her stomach that she will grow too big to get back into her hole and the like can be no more than advice therefore we must find out some way of punishing her which hath more inconveniences than she will ever suffer by the mere eating of cheese after this who is so slow of understanding as not to have in his mind a full and complete idea of a mousetrap wellthe free thinkers may talk what they please of pedantry and cant and jargon of schoolmen and insignificant terms in the writings of the clergy if ever the most perplexed and perplexing follower of aristotle from scotus to suarez11 could be a match for this author  footnote 11 duns scotus flourished in the thirteenth century he studied at oxford and paris and his learning and acumen in reasoning earned for him the title the subtle doctor he died at cologne in 1308 he was a strong upholder of the doctrine of the immaculate conception his works are published in twelve volumes folio  francis suarez 15481617 was a spanish jesuit who wrote a work by command of the pope against the english reformation he published some very able religiophilosophical treatises from the roman catholic point of view but indeed his writings altogether were enormous so far as their number are concerned t s  but the strength of his arguments is equal to the clearness of his definitions for having most ignorantly divided government into three parts whereof the first contains the other two he attempteth to prove that the clergy possess none of these by a divine right and he argueth thus p vii as to a legislative power if that belongs to the clergy by a divine right it must be when they are assembled in convocation but the 25 hen viii c 19 is a bar to any such divine right because that act makes it no less than a praemunire for them so much so as to meet without the kings writ c so that the force of his argument lieth here if the clergy had a divine right it is taken away by the 25th of henry the eighth and as ridiculous as this argument is the preface and book are founded upon it  another argument against the legislative power in the clergy of england is p viii that tacitus telleth us that in great affairs the germans consulted the whole body of the people de minoribus rebus principes consultant de majoribus omnes ita tamen ut ea quoque quorum penes plebem arbitrium est apud principes pertractenturtacitus de moribus et populis germaniae upon which tindal observeth thus de majoribus omnes was a fundamental amongst our ancestors long before they arrived in great britain and matters of religion were ever reckoned among their majora see pref p viii and ix now it is plain that our ancestors the saxons came from germany it is likewise plain that religion was always reckoned by the heathens among their majora and it is plain the whole body of the people could not be the clergy and therefore the clergy of england have no legislative power  thirdly p ix they have no legislative power because mr washington in his observations on the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the kings of england sheweth from undeniable authorities that in the time of william the conqueror and several of his successors there were no laws enacted concerning religion but by the great council of the kingdom i hope likewise mr washington observeth that this great council of the kingdom as appeareth by undeniable authorities was sometimes entirely composed of bishops and clergy and called the parliament and often consulted upon affairs of state as well as church as it is agreed by twenty writers of three ages and if mr washington says otherwise he is an author just fit to be quoted by beaux  fourthlybut it is endless to pursue this matter any further in that it is plain the clergy have no divine right to make laws because henry viii edward vi and queen elizabeth with their parliaments will not allow it them now without examining what divine right the clergy have or how far it extendeth is it any sort of proof that i have no right because a stronger power will not let me exercise it or doth all that this author says through his preface or book itself offer any other sort of argument but this or what he deduces the same way  but his arguments and definitions are yet more supportable than the grossness of historical remarks which are scattered so plentifully in his book that it would be tedious to enumerate or to shew the fraud and ignorance of them i beg the readers leave to take notice of one here just in my way and the rather because i design for the future to let hundreds of them pass without further notice when says he p x by the abolishing of the popes power things were brought back to their ancient channel the parliaments right in making ecclesiastical laws revived of course what can possibly be meant by this ancient channel why the channel that things ran in before the pope had any power in england that is to say before austin the monk converted england before which time it seems the parliament had a right to make ecclesiastical laws and what parliament could this be why the lords spiritual and temporal and the commons met at westminster  i cannot here forbear reproving the folly and pedantry of some lawyers whose opinions this poor creature blindly followeth and rendereth yet more absurd by his comments the knowledge of our constitution can be only attained by consulting the earliest english histories of which those gentlemen seem utterly ignorant further than a quotation or an index they would fain derive our government as now constituted from antiquity and because they have seen tacitus quoted for his majoribus omnes and have read of the goths military institution in their progresses and conquests they presently dream of a parliament had their reading reached so far they might have deduced it much more fairly from aristotle and polybius who both distinctly name the composition of rex seniores et populus and the latter as i remember particularly with the highest approbation the princes in the saxon heptarchy did indeed call their nobles sometimes together upon weighty affairs as most other princes of the world have done in all ages but they made war and peace and raised money by their own authority they gave or mended laws by their charters and they raised armies by their tenures besides some of those kingdoms fell in by conquests before england was reduced under one head and therefore could pretend no rights but by the concessions of the conqueror  further which is more material upon the admission of christianity great quantities of land were acquired by the clergy so that the great council of the nation was often entirely of churchmen and ever a considerable part but our present constitution is an artificial thing not fairly to be traced in my opinion beyond henry i since which time it hath in every age admitted several alterations and differeth now as much even from what it was then as almost any two species of government described by aristotle and it would be much more reasonable to affirm that the government of rome continued the same under justinian as it was in the time of scipio because the senate and consuls still remained although the power of both had been several hundred years transferred to the emperors   remarks on the preface12  footnote 12 references to tindals book and remarks upon it which the author left thus indigested being hints for himself to use in answering the said book  page iv v if men of opposite sentiments can subscribe the same articles they are as much at liberty as if there were none may not a man subscribe the whole articles because he differs from another in the explication of one how many oaths are prescribed that men may differ in the explication of some part of them instance c  page vi idea of government a canting pedantic way learned from locke and how prettily he sheweth it instance  page vii 25 hen viii c 19 is a bar to any such divine right of a legislative power in the clergy absurd to argue against the clergys divine right because of the statute of henry viii how doth that destroy divine right the sottish way of arguing from what the parliament can do from their power c  page viii if the parliament did not think they had a plenitude of power in this matter they would not have damned all the canons of 1640 what doth he mean a grave divine could not answer all his playhouse and alsatia13 cant c he hath read hudibras and many plays  footnote 13 or whitefriars then a place of asylum and frequented by sharpers of whose gibberish there are several specimens in shadwells comedy the squire of alsatia t s   ibid if the parliament can annul ecclesiastical laws they must be able to make them distinguish and shew the silliness c  ibid all that he saith against the discipline he might say the same against the doctrine nay against the belief of a god viz that the legislature might forbid it the church formeth and contriveth canons and the civil power which is compulsive confirms them  page ix there were no laws enacted but by the great council of the kingdom and that was very often chiefly only bishops  ibid laws settled by parliament to punish the clergy what laws were those  page x the people are bound to no laws but of their own choosing it is fraudulent for they may consent to what others choose and so people often do  page xiv paragraph 6 the clergy are not supposed to have any divine legislature because that must be superior to all worldly power and then the clergy might as well forbid the parliament to meet but when and where they please c no such consequence at all they have a power exclusive from all others ordained to act as clergy but not govern in civil affairs nor act without leave of the civil power  page xxv the parliament suspected the love of power natural to churchmen truly so is the love of pudding and most other things desirable in this life and in that they are like the laity as in all other things that are not good and therefore they are held not in esteem for what they are like in but for their virtues the true way to abuse them with effect is to tell us some faults of theirs that other men have not or not so much of as they c might not any man speak full as bad of senates diets and parliaments as he can do about councils and as bad of princes as he does of bishops  page xxxi they might as well have made cardinals campegi and de chinuchii bishops of salisbury and worcester as have enacted that their several sees and bishoprics were utterly void no the legislature might determine who should not be a bishop there but not make a bishop  ibid were not a great number deprived by parliament upon the restoration does he mean presbyters what signifies that  ibid have they not trusted this power with our princes why aye but that argueth not right but power have they not cut off a kings head c the church must do the best they can if not what they would  page xxxvi if tithes and firstfruits are paid to spiritual persons as such the king or queen is the most spiritual person c as if the firstfruits c were paid to the king as tithes to a spiritual person  page xliii king charles ii thought fit that the bishops in scotland should hold their bishoprics during will and pleasure i do not find that the high church complained of this as an encroachment c no but as a pernicious counsel of lord loch14  footnote 14 scott thinks this refers to lord lauderdale ts  page xliv the common law judges have a power to determine whether a man has a legal right to the sacrament they pretend it but what we complain of as most abominable hardship c  page xlv giving men thus blindly to the devil is an extraordinary piece of complaisance to a lay chancellor he is something in the right and therefore it is a pity there are any and i hope the church will provide against it but if the sentence be just it is not the person but the contempt and if the author attacketh a man on the highway and taketh but twopence he shall be sent to the gallows more terrible to him than the devil for his contempt of the law c therefore he need not complain of being sent to hell  page xliv mr leslie may carry things too far as it is natural because the other extreme is so great but what he says of the kings losses since the church lands were given away is too great a truth c  page lxxvi to which i have nothing to plead except the zeal i have for the church of england you will see some pages further what he meaneth by the church but it is not fair not to begin with telling us what is contained in the idea of a church c  page lxxxiii they will not be angry with me for thinking better of the church than they do c no but they will differ from you because the worse the queen is pleased you think her better i believe the church will not concern themselves much about your opinion of them c  page lxxxiv but the popish eastern presbyterian and jacobite clergy c this is like a general pardon with such exceptions as make it useless if we compute it c  page lxxxvii misapplying of the word church c this is cavilling no doubt his project is for exempting the people but that is not what in common speech we usually mean by the church besides who doth not know that distinction  ibid constantly apply the same ideas to them this is in old english meaning the same thing  page lxxxix demonstrates i could have no design but the promoting of truth c yes several designs as money spleen atheism c what will any man think truth was his design and not money and malice doth he expect the house will go into a committee for a bill to bring things to his scheme to confound everything c  some deny tindal to be the author and produce stories of his dulness and stupidity but what is there in all this book that the dullest man in england might not write if he were angry and bold enough and had no regard to truth  remarks upon the book c  page 4 whether lewis xiv has such a power over philip v he speaketh here of the unlimited uncontrollable authority of fathers a very foolish question and his discourse hitherto of government weak and trivial and liable to objections  ibid whom he is to consider not as his own but the almightys workmanship a very likely consideration for the ideas of the state of nature a very wrong deduction of paternal government but that is nothing to the dispute c  page 12 and as such might justly be punished by every one in the state of nature false he doth not seem to understand the state of nature although he hath borrowed it from hobbes c  page 14 merely speculative points and other indifferent things c and why are speculative opinions so insignificant do not men proceed in their practice according to their speculations so if the author were a chancellor and one of his speculations were that the poorer the clergy the better would not that be of great use if a cause came before him of tithes or church lands  ibid which can only be known by examining whether men had any power in the state of nature over their own or others actions in these matters no that is a wrong method unless where religion hath not been revealed in natural religion  ibid nothing at first sight can be more obvious than that in all religious matters none could make over the right of judging for himself since that would cause his religion to be absolutely at the disposal of another at his rate of arguing i think i do not misrepresent him and i believe he will not deny the consequence a man may profess heathenism mahometism c and gain as many proselytes as he can and they may have their assemblies and the magistrate ought to protect them provided they do not disturb the state and they may enjoy all secular preferments be lords chancellors judges c but there are some opinions in several religions which although they do not directly make men rebel yet lead to it instance some nay we might have temples for idols c a thousand such absurdities follow from his general notions and illdigested schemes and we see in the old testament that kings were reckoned good or ill as they suffered or hindered imageworship and idolatry c which was limiting conscience  page 15 men may form what clubs companies or meetings they think fit c which the magistrate as long as the public sustains no damage cannot hinder c this is false although the public sustain no damage they will forbid clubs where they think danger may happen  page 16 the magistrate is as much obliged to protect them in the way they choose of worshipping him as in any other indifferent matterpage 17 the magistrate to treat all his subjects alike how much soever they differ from him or one another in these matters this shews that although they be turks jews or heathens it is so but we are sure christianity is the only true religion c and therefore it should be the magistrates chief care to propagate it and that god should be worshipped in that that those who are the teachers think most proper c  page 18 so that persecution is the most comprehensive of all crimes c but he hath not told us what is concluded in the idea of persecution state it right  ibid but here it may be demanded if a mans conscience make him do such acts c this doth not answer the above objection for if the public be not disturbed with atheistical principles preached nor immoralities all is well so that still men may be jews turks c  page 22 the same reason which obliges them to make statutes of mortmain and other laws against the peoples giving estates to the clergy will equally hold for their taking them away when given a great security for property will this hold to any other society in the state as merchants c or only to ecclesiastics a pretty project forming general schemes requires a deeper head than this mans  ibid but the good of the society being the only reason of the magistrates having any power over mens properties i cannot see why he should deprive his subjects of any part thereof for the maintenance of such opinions as have no tendency that way c here is a paragraph vide also infra which has a great deal in it the meaning is that no man ought to pay tithes who doth not believe what the minister preacheth but how came they by this property when they purchased the land they paid only for so much and the tithes were exempted it is an older title than any mans estate is and if it were taken away tomorrow it could not without a new law belong to the owners of the other nine parts any more than impropriations do  ibid for the maintenance of such opinions as no ways contribute to the public good by such opinions as the public receive no advantage by he must mean christianity  page 23 who by reason of such articles are divided into different sects a pretty cause of sects c  page 24 so the same reason as often as it occurs will oblige him to leave that church this is an excuse for his turning papist  ibid unless you suppose churches like traps easy to admit one but when once he is in there he must always stick either for the pleasure or profit of the trapsetters remark his wit  page 29 nothing can be more absurd than maintaining there must be two independent powers in the same society this is abominably absurd shew it  page 33 the whole hierarchy as built on it must necessarily fall to the ground and great will be the fall of this spiritual babylon i will do him justice and take notice when he is witty c  page 36 for if there may be two such independent powers in every society on earth why may there not be more than one in heaven a delicate consequence  page 37 without having the less he could not have the greater in which that is contained sophistical instance wherein  page 42 some since subtler than the jews have managed commutations more to their own advantage by enriching themselves and beggaring if fame be not a liar many an honest dissenter it is fair to produce witnesses is she a liar or not the report is almost impossible commutations were contrived for roguish registers and proctors and lay chancellors but not for the clergy  page 43 kings and people who as the indians do the devil adored the pope out of fear i am in doubt whether i shall allow that for wit or no c look you in these cases preface it thus if one may use an old saying  page 44 one reason why the clergy make what they call schism to be so heinous a sin there it is now because he hath changed churches he ridiculeth schism as milton wrote for divorces because he had an ill wife for ten pages on we must give the true answer that makes all these arguments of no use  page 60 it possibly will be said i have all this while been doing these gentlemen a great deal of wrong to do him justice he sets forth the objections of his adversaries with great strength and much to their advantage no doubt those are the very objections we would offer  page 68 their executioner he is fond of this word in many places yet there is nothing in it further than it is the name for the hangman c  page 69 since they exclude both from having anything in the ordering of church matters another part of his scheme for by this the people ought to execute ecclesiastical offices without distinction for he brings the other opinion as an absurd one  page 72 they claim a judicial power and by virtue of it the government of the church and thereby pardon the expression become traitors both to god and man who doth he desire to pardon him or is this meant of the english clergy so it seemeth doth he desire them to pardon him they do it as christians doth he desire the government to do it but then how can they make examples he says the clergy do so c so he means all  page 74 i would gladly know what they mean by giving the holy ghost explain what is really meant by giving the holy ghost like a king empowering an ambassador15  footnote 15 see hookers eccl pol book v § 77  page 76 the popish clergy make very bold with the three persons of the trinity why then dont mix them but we see whom this glanceth on most as to the congé dÉlire and nolo episcopari not so absurd and if omitted why changed  page 78 but not to digresspray doth he call scurrility upon the clergy a digression the apology needless c  ibid a clergyman it is said is gods ambassador but you know an ambassador may have a secretary c  ibid call their pulpit speeches the word of god that is a mistake  page 79 such persons to represent him are not they that own his power fitter to represent him than others would the author be a fitter person  ibid puffed up with intolerable pride and insolence not at all for where is the pride to be employed by a prince whom so few own and whose being is disputed by such as this author  ibid perhaps from a poor servitor c to be a prime minister in gods kingdom that is right god taketh notice of the difference between poor servitors c extremely foolishshew it the argument lieth strongly against the apostles poor fishermen and st paul a tentmaker so gross and idle  page 80 the formality of laying hand over head on a man a pun but an old one i remember when swan16 made that pun first he was severely checked for it  footnote 16 captain swan was a celebrated low humorist and punster who frequented wills coffeehouse when it was the fashionable resort of men of wit and pleasure t s  ibid what more is required to give one a right c here shew what power is in the church and what in the state to make priests  page 85 to bring men into and not turn them out of the ordinary way of salvation yes but as one rotten sheep doth mischiefand do you think it reasonable that such a one as this author should converse with christians and weak ones  page 86 see his fine account of spiritual punishment  page 87 the clergy affirm that if they had not the power to exclude men from the church its unity could not be preserved so to expel an ill member from a college would be to divide the college as in allsouls c apply it to him17  footnote 17 tindal was a fellow of all souls college t s  page 88 i cannot see but it is contrary to the rules of charity to exclude men from the church c all this turns upon the falsest reasoning in the world so if a man be imprisoned for stealing a horse he is hindered from other duties and you might argue that a man who doth ill ought to be more diligent in minding other duties and not to be debarred from them it is for contumacy and rebellion against that power in the church which the law hath confirmed so a man is outlawed for a trifle upon contumacy  page 92 obliging all by penal laws to receive the sacrament this is false  page 93 the want of which means can only harden a man in his impenitence it is for his being hardened that he is excluded suppose a son robbeth his father on the highway and his father will not see him till he restoreth the money and owneth his fault it is hard to deny him paying his duty in other things c how absurd this  page 95 and that only they had a right to give it another part of his scheme that the people have a right to give the sacrament see more of it pp 135 and 137  page 96 made familiar to such practices by the heathen priests well and this shews the necessity of it for peace sake a silly objection of this and other enemies to religion to think to disgrace it by applying heathenism which only concerns the political part wherein they were as wise as others and might give rules instance in some c  page 98 how differently from this do the great pretenders to primitive practice act c this is a remarkable passage doth he condemn or allow this mysterious way it seems the firstand therefore these words are a little turned but infallibly stood in the first draught as a great argument for popery  page 100 they dress them up in a sanbenito so now we are to answer for the inquisition one thing is that he makes the fathers guilty of asserting most of the corruptions about the power of priests  page 104 some priests assume to themselves an arbitrary power of excluding men from the lords supper his scheme that any body may administer the sacraments women or children c  page 108 one no more than another can be reckoned a priest see his scheme here he disgraces what the law enacts about the manner of consecrating c  page 118 churches serve to worse purposes than beargardens this from hudibras  page 119 in the time of that wise heathen ammianus marcellinus18 here he runs down all christianity in general  footnote 18 ammianus marcellinus died c 390 wrote a history of rome in thirtyone books of which gibbon thought rather highly the history may be taken as a continuation of tacitus and suetonius t s  page 120 i shall in the following part of my discourse shew that this doctrine is so far from serving the ends of religion that 1 it prevents the spreading of the gospel c this independent power in the church is like the worms being the cause of all diseases  page 124 how easily could the roman emperors have destroyed the church just as if he had said how easily could herod kill christ whilst a child c  page 125 the people were set against bishops by reason of their tyranny wrong for the bishops were no tyrants their power was swallowed up by the popes and the people desired they should have more it were the regulars that tyrannized and formed priestcraft he is ignorant  page 139 he is not bound by the laws of christ to leave his friends in order to be baptized c this directly against the gospelone would think him an emissary by his preaching schism  page 142 then will the communion of saints be practicable to which the principles of all parties the occasional conformists only excepted stand in direct opposition c so that all are wrong but they the scripture is fully against schism tindal promoteth it and placeth in it all the present and future happiness of man  page 144 all he has hitherto said on this matter with a very little turn were arguments for popery for it is certain that religion had share in very few wars for many hundred years before the reformation because they were all of a mind it is the ambition of rebels preaching upon the discontents of sectaries that they are not supreme which hath caused wars for religion he is mistaken altogether his little narrow understanding and want of learning  page 145 though some say the highfliers lives might serve for a very good rule if men would act quite contrary to them is he one of those some beside the new turn of wit c all the clergy in england come under his notion of highfliers as he states it  page 147 none of them churchmen could be brought to acknowledge it lawful upon any account whatever to exclude the duke of york this account false in fact  ibid and the bodypolitic whether ecclesiastical or civil must be dealt with after the same manner as the bodynatural what because it is called a body and is a simile must it hold in all circumstances  page 148 we find all wise legislators have had regard to the tempers inclinations and prejudices c this paragraph falseit was directly contrary in several as lycurgus c  page 152 all the skill of the prelatists is not able to discover the least distinction between bishop and presbyter yet god knows this hath been done many a time  page 158 the epistle to the philippians is directed to the bishops and deacons i mean in due order after the people viz to the saints with their bishops and deacons i hope he would argue from another place that the people precede the king because of these words ye shall be destroyed both you and your king  page 167 the pope and other great church dons i suppose he meaneth bishops but i wish he would explain himself and not be so very witty in the midst of an argument it is like two mediums not fair in disputing  page 168 clemens romanus blames the people not for assuming a power but for making a wrong use of it c his great error all along is that he doth not distinguish between a power and a liberty of exercising that power c i would appeal to any man whether the clergy have not too little power since a book like this that unsettleth foundations and would destroy all goes unpunished c  page 171 by this or some such method the bishops obtained their power over their fellow presbyters and both over the people the whole tenor of the gospel directly contrary to it then it is not an allowable means this carries it so far as to spoil his own system it is a sin to have bishops as we have them  page 172 the preservation of peace and unity and not any divine right was the reason of establishing a superiority of one of the presbyters over the rest otherwise there would as they say have been as many schismatics as presbyters no great compliment to the clergy of those days why so it is the natural effect of a worse independency which he keepeth such a clatter about an independency of churches on each other which must naturally create schism  page 183 how could the christians have asserted the disinterestedness of those who first preached the gospel particularly their having a right to the tenth part yes that would have passed easy enough for they could not imagine teachers could live on air and their heathen priests were much more unreasonable  page 184 mens suffering for such opinions is not sufficient to support the weight of them this is a glance against christianity state the case of converting infidels the converters are supposed few the bulk of the priests must be of the converted country it is their own people therefore they maintain what project or end can a few converters propose they can leave no power to their families c state this i say at length and give it a true turn princes give corporations power to purchase lands  page 187 that it became an easy prey to the barbarous nations ignorance in tindal the empire long declined before christianity was introduced this a wrong cause if ever there was one  page 190 it is the clergys interest to have religion corrupted quite the contrary prove it how is it the interest of the english clergy to corrupt religion the more justice and piety the people have the better it is for them for that would prevent the penury of farmers and the oppression of exacting covetous landlords c that which hath corrupted religion is the liberty unlimited of professing all opinions do not lawyers render law intricate by their speculations c and physicians c  page 209 the spirit and temper of the clergy c what does this man think the clergy are made of answer generally to what he says against councils in the ten pages before suppose i should bring quotations in their praise  page 211 as the clergy though few in comparison of the laity were the inventors of corruptions his scheme is that the fewer and poorer the clergy the better and the contrary among the laity a noble principle and delicate consequences from it  page 207 men are not always condemned for the sake of opinions but opinions sometimes for the sake of men and so he hopes that if his opinions are condemned people will think it is a spite against him as having been always scandalous  page 210 the meanest layman as good a judge as the greatest priest for the meanest man is as much interested in the truth of religion as the greatest priest as if one should say the meanest sick man hath as much interest in health as a physician therefore is as good a judge of physic as a physician c  ibid had synods been composed of laymen none of those corruptions which tend to advance the interest of the clergy c true but the part the laity had in reforming was little more than plundering he should understand that the nature of things is this that the clergy are made of men and without some encouragement they will not have the best but the worst  page 215 they who gave estates to rather than they who took them from the clergy were guilty of sacrilege then the people are the church and the clergy not another part of his scheme  page 219 the clergy as they subsisted by the alms of the people c this he would have still shew the folly of it not possible to shew any civilized nation ever did it who would be clergymen then the absurdity appears by putting the case that none were to be statesmen lawyers or physicians but who were to subsist by alms  page 222 these subtle clergymen work their designs who lately cut out such a tacking job for them c he is mistakeneverybody was for the bill almost though not for the tack the bishop of sarum was for it as appears by his speech against it but it seems the tacking is owing to metaphysical speculations i wonder whether is most perplexed this author in his style or the writings of our divines in the judgment of all people our divines have carried practical preaching and writing to the greatest perfection it ever arrived to which shews that we may affirm in general our clergy is excellent although this or that man be faulty as if an army be constantly victorious regular c we may say it is an excellent victorious army but tindal to disparage it would say such a serjeant ran away such an ensign hid himself in a ditch nay one colonel turned his back therefore it is a corrupt cowardly army c  page 224 they were as apprehensive of the works of aristotle as some men are of the works of a late philosopher which they are afraid will let too much light into the world yet just such another only a commentator on aristotle people are likely to improve their understanding much with locke it is not his human understanding but other works that people dislike although in that there are some dangerous tenets as that of no innate ideas  page 226 could they like the popish priests add to this a restraint on the press their business would be done so it ought for example to hinder his book because it is written to justify the vices and infidelity of the age there can be no other design in it for is this a way or manner to do good railing doth but provoke the opinion of the whole parliament is the clergy are too poor  ibid when some nations could be no longer kept from prying into learning this miserable gibberish of the schools was contrived we have exploded schoolmen as much as he and in some peoples opinion too much since the liberty of embracing any opinion is allowed they following aristotle who is doubtless the greatest master of arguing in the world but it hath been a fashion of late years to explode aristotle and therefore this man hath fallen into it like others for that reason without understanding him aristotles poetry rhetoric and politics are admirable and therefore it is likely so are his logics  page 230 in these freer countries as the clergy have less power so religion is better understood and more useful and excellent discourses are made on that subject c not generally holland not very famous spain hath been and france is but it requireth more knowledge than his to form general rules which people strain when ignorant to false deductions to make them out  page 232 chap vii that this hypothesis of an independent power in any set of clergymen makes all reformation unlawful except where those who have this power do consent the title of this chapter a truism  page 234 if god has not placed mankind in respect to civil matters under an absolute power but has permitted them in every society to act as they judge best for their own safety c bad parallels bad politics want of due distinction between teaching and government the people may know when they are governed well but not be wiser than their instructors shew the difference  ibid if god has allowed the civil society these privileges can we suppose he hath less kindness for his church c here they are distinguished then here it makes for him it is a sort of turn of expression which is scarce with him and he contradicts himself to follow it  page 235 this cursed hypothesis had perhaps never been thought on with relation to civils had not the clergy who have an inexhaustible magazine of oppressive doctrines contrived first in ecclesiasticals c the seventh paragraph furious and false were there no tyrants before the clergy c  page 236 therefore in order to serve them though i expect little thanks c and why so will they not as you say follow their interest i thought you said so he has three or four sprightly turns of this kind that look as if he thought he had done wonders and had put all the clergy in a ferment whereas i do assure him there are but two things wonderful in his book first how any man in a christian country could have the boldness and wickedness to write it and how any government would neglect punishing the author of it if not as an enemy of religion yet a profligate trumpeter of sedition these are hard words got by reading his book  ibid the light of nature as well as the gospel obliges people to judge of themselves c to avoid false prophets seducers c the legislature can turn out a priest and appoint another readymade but not make one as you discharge a physician and may take a farrier but he is no physician unless made as he ought to be  ibid since no more power is required for the one than the other that is i dislike my physician and can turn him off therefore i can make any man a physician c cujus est destruere c jest on it therefore because he lays schemes for destroying the church we must employ him to raise it again see what danger lies in applying maxims at random so because it is the soldiers business to knock men on the head it is theirs likewise to raise them to life c  page 237 it can belong only to the people to appoint their own ecclesiastical officers this word people is so delicious in him that i cannot tell what is included in the idea of the people doth he mean the rabble or the legislature c in this sense it may be true that the legislature giveth leave to the bishops to appoint and they appoint themselves i mean the executive power appoints c he sheweth his ignorance in government as to high church he carrieth it a prodigious way and includeth in the idea of it more than others will allow  page 239 though it be customary to admit none to the ministry who are not approved by the bishops or priests c one of his principles to expose  ibid if every one has not an inherent right to choose his own guide then a man must be either of the religion of his guide or c that would make delicate work in a nation what would become of all our churches they must dwindle into conventicles show what would be the consequence of this scheme in several points this great reformer if his projects were reduced to practice how many thousand sects and consequently tumults c men must be governed in speculation at least not suffered to vent them because opinions tend to actions which are most governed by opinions c if those who write for the church writ no better they would succeed but scurvily but to see whether he be a good writer let us see when he hath published his second part  page 253 an excellent author in his preface to the account of denmark this man judgeth and writeth much of a level molesworths preface full of stale profligate topics that author wrote his book in spite to a nation as this doth to religion and both perhaps on poor personal piques1  footnote 19 this was robert viscount molesworth 16561725 who was born in dublin and educated at trinity college there he was ambassador at copenhagen but had to resign on account of a dispute with the danish king the account of denmark which he wrote on his return was answered by dr king t s  ibid by which means and not by any difference in speculative matters they are more rich and populous as if ever anybody thought that a difference in speculative opinions made men richer or poorer for example c  page 258 play the devil for gods sake if this is meant for wit i would be glad to observe it but in such cases i first look whether there be common sense c  page 261 christendom has been the scene of perpetual wars massacres c he doth not consider that most religious wars have been caused by schisms when the dissenting parties were ready to join with any ambitious discontented man the national religion always desireth peace even in her notions for its interests  page 270 some have taken the liberty to compare a high church priest in politics to a monkey in a glassshop where as he can do no good so he never fails of doing mischief enough that is his modesty it is his own simile and it rather fits a man that does so and so meaning himself besides the comparison is foolish so it is with men as with stags  page 276 their interest obliges them directly to promote tyranny the matter is that christianity is the fault which spoils the priests for they were like other men before they were priests among the romans priests did not do so for they had the greatest power during the republic i wonder he did not prove they spoiled nero  page 277 no princes have been more insupportable and done greater violence to the commonwealth than those the clergy have honoured for saints and martyrs for example in our country the princes most celebrated by our clergy are c c c and the quarrels since the conquest were nothing at all of the clergy but purely of families c wherein the clergy only joined like other men  page 279 after the reformation20i desire to know whether the conduct of the clergy was anyways altered for the better c monstrous misrepresentation does this mans spirit of declaiming let him forget all truth of fact as here c shew it or doth he flatter himself a time will come in future ages that men will believe it on his word in short between declaiming between misrepresenting and falseness and charging popish things and independency huddled together his whole book is employed  footnote 20 reformation in 4to and 8vo editions but tindals word is restoration ts  set forth at large the necessity of union in religion and the disadvantage of the contrary and answer the contrary in holland where they have no religion and are the worst constituted government in the world to last it is ignorance of causes and appearances which makes shallow people judge so much to their advantage they are governed by the administration and almost legislature of holland through advantage of property nor are they fit to be set in balance with a noble kingdom c like a man that gets a hundred pounds a year by hard labour and one that has it in land  page 280 it may be worth enquiring whether the difference between the several sects in england c a noble notion started that union in the church must enslave the kingdom reflect on it this man hath somewhere heard that it is a point of wit to advance paradoxes and the bolder the better but the wit lies in maintaining them which he neglecteth and formeth imaginary conclusions from them as if they were true and uncontested  he adds that in the best constituted church the greatest good which can be expected of the ecclesiastics is from their divisions this is a maxim deduced from a gradation of false suppositions if a man should turn the tables and argue that all the debauchery atheism licentiousness c of the times were owing to the poverty of the clergy c what would he say there have been more wars of religion since the ruin of the clergy than before in england all the civil wars before were from other causes  page 283 prayers are made in the loyal university of oxford to continue the throne free from the contagion of schism see mathers sermon on the 29th of may 1705 thus he ridicules the university while he is eating their bread the whole university comes with the most loyal addresses yet that goes for nothing if one indiscreet man drops an indiscreet word all must answer for it  page 286 by allowing all who hold no opinions prejudicial to the state and contribute equally with their fellowsubjects to its support equal privileges in it but who denies that of the dissenters the calvinist scheme one would not think proper for monarchy therefore they fall in with the scotch geneva and holland and when they had strength here they pulled down the monarchy but i will tell an opinion they hold prejudicial to the state in his opinion and that is that they are against toleration of which if i do not shew him ten times more instances from their greatest writers than he can do of passive obedience among the clergy i have done  does not justice demand that they who alike contribute to the burden should alike receive the advantage here is another of his maxims closely put without considering what exceptions may be made the papists have contributed doubly being so taxed therefore by this rule they ought to have double advantage protection in property leave to trade and purchase c are enough for a government to give employments in a state are a reward for those who entirely agree with it c for example a man who upon all occasions declared his opinion of a commonwealth to be preferable to a monarchy would not be a fit man to have employments let him enjoy his opinion but not be in a capacity of reducing it to practice c  page 287 there can be no alteration in the established mode of church discipline which is not made in a legal way oh but there are several methods to compass this legal way by cunning faction industry the common people he knows may be wrought upon by priests these may influence the faction and so compass a very pernicious law and in a legal way ruin the state as king charles i began to be ruined in a legal way by passing bills c  page 288 as everything is persecution which puts a man in a worse condition than his neighbours it is hard to think sometimes whether this man is hired to write for or against dissenters and the sects this is their opinion although they will not own it so roundly let this be brought to practice make a quaker lord chancellor who thinketh paying tithes unlawful and bring other instances to shew that several employments affect the church  ibid great advantage which both church and state have got by the kindness already shewn to dissenters let them then be thankful for that we humour children for their good sometimes but too much may hurt observe that this 64th paragraph just contradicts the former for if we have advantage by kindness shewn dissenters then there is no necessity of banishment or death  page 290 christ never designed the holy sacrament should be prostituted to serve a party and that people should be bribed by a place to receive unworthily why the business is to be sure that those who are employed are of the national church and the way to know it is by receiving the sacrament which all men ought to do in their own church and if not are hardly fit for an office and if they have those moral qualifications he mentioneth joined to religion no fear of receiving unworthily and for this there might be a remedy to take an oath that they are of the same principles c for that is the end of receiving and that it might be no bribe the bill against occasional conformity would prevent entirely  ibid preferring men not for their capacity but their zeal to the church the misfortune is that if we prefer dissenters to great posts they will have an inclination to make themselves the national church and so there will be perpetual struggling which case may be dangerous to the state for men are naturally wishing to get over others to their own opinion witness this writer who hath published as singular and absurd notions as possible yet hath a mighty zeal to bring us over to them c  page 292 here are two pages of scurrilous faction with a deal of reflections on great persons under the notion of highchurchmen he runs down all uniformity and church government here is the whole lower house of convocation which represents the body of the clergy and both universities treated with rudeness by an obscure corrupt member while he is eating their bread  page 294 the reason why the middle sort of people retain so much of their ancient virtue c is because no such pernicious notions are the ingredients of their education which tis a sign are infinitely absurd when so many of the gentry and nobility can notwithstanding their prepossession get clear of them now the very same argument lies against religion morality honour and honesty which are it seems but prejudices of education and too many get clear of them the middle sort of people have other things to mind than the factions of the age he always assigneth many causes and sometimes with reason since he maketh imaginary effects he quarrels at power being lodged in the clergy when there is no reasonable protestant clergy or laity who will not readily own the inconveniences by too great power and wealth in any one body of men ecclesiastics or seculars but on that account to weed up the wheat with the tares to banish all religion because it is capable of being corrupted to give unbounded licence to all sects cand if heresies had not been used with some violence in the primitive age we should have had instead of true religion the most corrupt one in the world  page 316 the dutch and the rest of our presbyterian allies c the dutch will hardly thank him for this appellation the french huguenots and geneva protestants themselves and others have lamented the want of episcopacy and approved ours c in this and the next paragraph the author introduceth the arguments he formerly used when he turned papist in king jamess time and loth to lose them he gives them a new turn and they are the strongest in his book at least have most artifice  page 333 tis plain all the power the bishops have is derived from the people c in general the distinction lies here the permissive power of exercising jurisdiction lies in the people or legislature or administrator of a kingdom but not of making him a bishop as a physician that commenceth abroad may be suffered to practise in london or be hindered but they have not the power of creating him a doctor which is peculiar to a university this is some allusion but the thing is plain as it seemeth to me and wanteth no subterfuge c  page 338 a journeyman bishop to ordain for him doth any man think that writing at this rate does the authors cause any service is it his wit or his spleen that he cannot govern  page 364 can any have a right to an office without having a right to do those things in which the office consists i answer the ordination is valid but a man may prudentially forbid to do some things as a clergyman may marry without licence or banns the marriage is good yet he is punishable for it  page 368 a choice made by persons who have no right to choose is an error of the first concoction that battered simile again this is hard i wish the physicians had kept that a secret it lieth so ready for him to be witty with  page 370 if prescription can make mere nullities to become good and valid the laity may be capable of all manner of ecclesiastical power c there is a difference for here the same way is kept although there might be breaches but it is quite otherwise if you alter the whole method from what it was at first we see bishops there always were bishops it is the old way still so a family is still held the same although we are not sure of the purity of every one of the race  page 380 it is said that every nation is not a complete body politic within itself as to ecclesiasticals but the whole church say they composes such a body and christ is the head of it but christs headship makes christians no more one body politic with respect to ecclesiasticals than to civils here we must shew the reason and necessity of the church being a corporation all over the world to avoid heresies and preserve fundamentals and hinder corrupting of scripture c but there are no such necessities in government to be the same everywhere c it is something like the colleges in a university they all are independent yet joined are one body so a general council consisteth of many persons independent of one another c  however there is such a thing as jus gentium c and he that is doctor of physic or law is so in any university of europe like the respublica literaria nor to me does there seem anything contradicting or improper in this notion of the catholic church and for want of such a communion religion is so much corrupted and would be more if there were not more communion in this than in civils it is of no import to mankind how nations are governed but the preserving the purity of religion is best held up by endeavouring to make it one body over the world something like as there is in trade so to be able to communicate with all christians we come among is at least to be wished and aimed at as much as we can  page 384 in a word if the bishops are not supreme c here he reassumeth his arguments for popery that there cannot be a body politic of the church through the whole world without a visible head to have recourse to these were formerly writ to advance popery and now to put an absurdity upon the hypothesis of a catholic church as they say in ireland in king jamess time they built masshouses which we make very good barns of  page 388 bishops are under a premunire obliged to confirm and consecrate the person named in the congé dÉlire this perhaps is complained of he is permitted to do it we allow the legislature may hinder if they please as they may turn out christianity if they think fit  page 389 it is the magistrate who empowers them to do more for other bishops than they can for themselves since they cannot appoint their own successors yes they could if the magistrate would let them here is an endless splutter and a parcel of perplexed distinctions upon no occasion all that the clergy pretend to is a right of qualifying men for the ministry something like what a university doth with degrees this power they claim from god and that the civil power cannot do it as pleasing to god without them but they may choose whether they will suffer it or no a religion cannot be crammed down a nations throat against their will but when they receive a religion it is supposed they receive as their converters give it and upon that foot they cannot justly mingle their own methods that contradict that religion c  page 390 with us the bishops act only ministerially and by virtue of the regal commission by which the prince firmly enjoins and commands them to proceed in choosing confirming and consecrating c suppose we held it unlawful to do so how can we help it but does that make it rightful if it be not so suppose the author lived in a heathen country where a law would be made to call christianity idolatrous would that be a topic for him to prove it so by c and why do the clergy incur a premunireto frighten thembecause the law understandeth that if they refuse the chosen cannot be a bishop but if the clergy had an order to do it otherwise than they have prescribed they ought and would incur an hundred rather  page 402 i believe the catholic church c here he ridicules the apostles creedanother part of his schemeby what he says in these pages it is certain his design is either to run down christianity or set up popery the latter it is more charitable to think and from his past life highly probable  page 405 that which gave the papists so great advantage was clergymens talking so very inconsistent with themselves c state the difference here between our separation from rome and the dissenters from us and shew the falseness of what he sayeth i wish he would tell us what he leaveth for a clergyman to do if he may not instruct the people in religion and if they should not receive his instructions  page 411 the restraint of the press a badge of popery why is that a badge of popery why not restrain the press to those who would confound religion as in civil matters but this toucheth himself he would starve perhaps c let him get some honester livelihood then it is plain all his arguments against constraint c favour the papists as much as dissenters for both have opinions that may affect the peace of the state  page 413 since this discourse c and must we have another volume on this one subject of independency or is it to fright us i am not of dr hickess mind quil venge i pity the readers and the clergy that must answer it be it ever so insipid reflect on his sarcastic conclusion c                            a  preface  to the  bp of sms  introduction c   note  at the time of writing this scathing piece of invective swift was busy dealing out to an old friend a similar specimen of his terrible power of rejoinder steele in the newly established guardian as mr churton collins well puts it drunk with party spirit had so far forgotten himself as to insert  a coarse and ungenerous reflection on swift swift sought an explanation through addison but steeles egotism was stronger than the feeling of friendship and the insult remained for swift to wipe out in the importance of the guardian considered probably this severance from his friend due to political differencesfor steele glowed in whiggismdeepened if possible his hatred to whigs of whatever degree and in burnet he found another object for his wit but apart from such a suggestion there was enough in the bishops attitude towards the tories to rouse swift to his task it was not enough that burnet should accuse his political opponents of sympathy with the french jacobitism and popery but he must needs flaunt his vanity in issuing in advance for purposes of advertisement the introduction to a work which was to come later this was enough for swift and the prelate who could smell popery at five hundred miles distance better than fanaticism under his nose became the recipient of one of the most amusing and yet most virulent attacks which even that controversial age produced the whole pamphlet mr collins truly says is inimitable its irony its humour its drollery are delicious  it must not however be imagined that swifts opinion of burnet is only that which can be gathered from this preface he fully appreciated the sterling qualities of scholarship and good nature since in his remarks on burnets history of my own time he says after all he was a man of generosity and good nature and very communicative but in his last ten years was absolutely partymad and fancied he saw popery under every bush lord dartmouth has left an excellent sketch of burnets character in a note to the history of my own time bishop burnet was a man of the most extensive knowledge i ever met with had read and seen a great deal with a prodigious memory and a very indifferent judgment he was extremely partial and readily took everything for granted that he heard to the prejudice of those he did not like which made him pass for a man of less truth than he really was i do not think he designedly published anything he believed to be false he had a boisterous vehement manner of expressing himself which often made him ridiculous especially in the house of lords when what he said would not have been thought so delivered in a lower voice and a calmer behaviour his vast knowledge occasioned his frequent rambling from the point he was speaking to which ran him into discourses of so universal a nature that there was no end to be expected but from a failure of his strength and spirits of both which he had a larger share than most men which were accompanied with a most invincible assurance note to the preface of burnets history of my own time vol i p xxxiii oxford 1897  it may not be altogether out of place to give here a short biographical sketch of bishop burnet  gilbert burnet was born at edinburgh in 1643 he studied first at aberdeen and then in holland in 1665 after he was elected a fellow of the royal society he entered holy orders became vicar of saltoun and in 1669 professor of divinity at glasgow the year 1673 found him in london engaged on his history of the reformation and fulfilling the duties of chaplain to the king preacher to the rolls and lecturer of st clements the reformation appeared in three folio volumes the first in 1679 the second in 1681 and the third in 1714 he had already written the lives of the dukes of hamilton the life of sir matthew hale and a life of the earl of rochester getting into some political trouble he was deprived of his offices and left england for the continent after travelling in france he settled in holland and married a dutch lady when the prince of orange came to england to assume the government of the country burnet accompanied him and in 1689 was installed into the bishopric of salisbury evidently he had too zealous a sentiment for william and mary for his pastoral letter to the clergy of his diocese commenting on the new sovereign was condemned by the parliament and ordered to be burnt by the common hangman he married again on the death of his dutch wife a rich widow mrs berkeley who was his third spousehence swifts caustic reference he died march 17th 171415 in addition to his histories of the reformation and his own times he wrote an exposition of the thirtynine articles 1699 the life of bishop bedell and the other lives already named and several sermons and controversial pieces  the text of this pamphlet is that of the first edition collated with those given by faulkner hawkesworth the miscellanies of 1745 and scott it was originally published in 1713  ts     a   preface1   t o   t h e   bp of srms   introduction   to the third volume of the   history of the reformation   of the   church of england  by

your care in putting an advertisement in the examiner has been of great use to me i do now send you my preface to the bp of srms introduction to his third volume which i desire you to print in such a form as in the booksellers phrase will make a sixpenny touch hoping it will give such a public notice of my design that it may come into the hands of those who perhaps look not into the bps introduction i desire you will prefix to this a passage out of virgil which does so perfectly agree with my present thoughts of his ldshp that i cannot express them better nor more truly than those words do  i am sir  your most humble servant  g misosarum  footnote 1 mr nichols quotes from the speculum sarisburianum that the frequent and hasty repetitions of such prefaces and introductions no less than three new ones in about one years time beside an old serviceable one republished concerning persecutionare preludes to other practical things beside pastoral cares sermons and histories t s  footnote 2 this preface to the bookseller is in imitation of the bishops own preface to the bookseller in the introduction which was signed g sarum t s  this way of publishing introductions to books that are god knows when to come out is either wholly new or so long unpractised that my small reading cannot trace it however we are to suppose that a person of his lordships great age and experience would hardly act such a piece of singularity without some extraordinary motives i cannot but observe that his fellowlabourer the author of the paper called the englishman3 seems in some of his late performances to have almost transcribed the notions of the bishop these notions i take to have been dictated by the same masters leaving to each writer that peculiar manner of expressing himself which the poverty of our language forces me to call their style when the guardian changed his title and professed to engage in faction i was sure the word was given that grand preparations were making against next sessions that all advantages would be taken of the little dissensions reported to be among those in power and that the guardian would soon be seconded by some other piqueerers4 from the same camp but i will confess my suspicions did not carry me so far as to conjecture that this venerable champion would be in such mighty haste to come into the field and serve in the quality of an enfant perdu5 armed only with a pocket pistol before his great blunderbuss could be got ready his old rusty breastplate scoured and his cracked headpiece mended  footnote 3 steele  footnote 4 piqueerer  pickeerer modern  a marauder a skirmisher in advance of an army from french picorer  to maraud ts  footnote 5 enfant perdu one of the advanced guard or as hawkesworth notes it one of the forlorn hope ts  i was debating with myself whether this hint of producing a small pamphlet to give notice of a large folio was not borrowed from the ceremonial in spanish romances where a dwarf is sent out upon the battlements to signify to all passengers what a mighty giant there is in the castle or whether the bishop copied this proceeding from the fanfarronade of monsieur boufflers when the earl of portland and that general had an interview several men were appointed at certain periods to ride in great haste toward the english camp and cry out monseigneur vient monseigneur vient then small parties advanced with the same speed and the same cry and this foppery held for many hours until the mareschal himself arrived so here the bishop as we find by his dedication to mr churchill the bookseller has for a long time sent warning of his arrival by advertisements in gazettes and now his introduction advances to tell us again monseigneur vient in the mean time we must gape and wait and gaze the lord knows how long and keep our spirits in some reasonable agitation until his lordships real self shall think fit to appear in the habit of a folio  i have seen the same sort of management at a puppetshow some puppets of little or no consequence appeared several times at the window to allure the boys and the rabble the trumpeter sounded often and the doorkeeper cried a hundred times till he was hoarse that they were just going to begin yet after all we were forced sometimes to wait an hour before punch himself in person made his entry  but why this ceremony among old acquaintance the world and he have long known one another let him appoint his hour and make his visit without troubling us all day with a succession of messages from his laqueys and pages  with submission these little arts of getting off an edition do ill become any author above the size of marten6 the surgeon my lord tells us that many thousands of the two former parts of his history are in the kingdom7 and now he perpetually advertises in the gazette that he intends to publish the third this is exactly in the method and style of marten the seventh edition many thousands of the former editions having been sold off in a small time of mr martens book concerning secret diseases c  footnote 6 this is john marten the author of two treatises on the gout and a treatise of all the degrees and symptoms of the venereal disease 17089 his notoriety brought on him the ire of a licensd practitioner in physick and surgery one j spinke who in a pamphlet entitled quackery unmaskd 1709 dealt marten some most uncourteous blows from the pamphlet it is difficult to judge whether spinke or marten were the greater quack we should judge the former certainly marten deserves our sympathy if only for spinkes virulence ts  footnote 7 page 26  does his lordship intend to publish his great volume by subscription and is this introduction only by way of specimen i was inclined to think so because in the prefixed letter to mr churchill which introduces this introduction there are some dubious expressions he says the advertisements he published were in order to move people to furnish him with materials which might help him to finish his work with great advantage if he means halfaguinea upon the subscription and tother half at the delivery why does he not tell us so in plain terms  i am wondering how it came to pass that this diminutive letter to mr churchill should understand the business of introducing better than the introduction itself or why the bishop did not take it into his head to send the former into the world some months before the latter which would have been a greater improvement upon the solemnity of the procession  since i writ these last lines i have perused the whole pamphlet which i had only dipped in before and found i have been hunting upon a wrong scent for the author hath in several parts of his piece discovered the true motives which put him upon sending it abroad at this juncture i shall therefore consider them as they come in my way  my lord begins his introduction with an account of the reasons why he was guilty of so many mistakes in the first volume of his history of the reformation his excuses are just rational and extremely consistent he says he wrote in haste8 which he confirms by adding that it lay a year after he wrote it before it was put into the press9 at the same time he mentioned a passage extremely to the honour of that pious and excellent prelate archbishop sancroft which demonstrates his grace to have been a person of great sagacity and almost a prophet dr burnet then a private divine desired admittance to the cotton library but was prevented by the archbishop who told sir john cotton that the said doctor was no friend to the prerogative of the crown nor to the constitution of the kingdom this judgment was the more extraordinary because the doctor had not long before published a book in scotland with his name prefixed which carries the regal prerogative higher than any writer of the age10 however the good archbishop lived to see his opinion become universal in the kingdom  footnote 8 page 6  footnote 9 page 10  footnote 10 this was burnets vindication of the authority constitution and laws of the church and state of scotland dedicated to the duke of lauderdale and published in 1672 the dedication contains an eulogium of the duke and the work a defence of episcopacy and monarchy against buchanan and his followers at a later period the author did not probably recollect this juvenile publication with much complacence  it is somewhat remarkable to see the progress of this story in the first edition of this introduction it should seem he was prevented by the archbishop c when the introduction was reprinted a year after with the history it stands a great prelate had been beforehand and possessed him sir john cotton against methat unless the archbishop of canterbury would recommend mehe desired to be excusedthe bishop of worcester could not prevail on the archbishop to interpose this is somewhat less than preventing unless the archbishop be meant by the great prelate which is not very probable 1 because in the preface to this very third volume p 4 he says it was by archbishop sancrofts order he had the free use of everything that lay in the lambeth library 2 because the author of speculum sarisburianum p 6 tells us his access to the library was owing solely to the recommendation of archbishop sancroft as i have been informed by some of the family 3 because bishop burnet in his history of my own times vol i p 396 says it was dolben bishop of rochester at the instigation of the duke of lauderdale that diverted sir john cotton from suffering me to search his library miscellanies vol viii 1745  the bishop goes on for many pages with an account of certain facts relating to the publishing of his two former volumes of the reformation the great success of that work and the adversaries who appeared against it these are matters out of the way of my reading only i observe that poor mr henry wharton11 who has deserved so well of the commonwealth of learning and who gave himself the trouble of detecting some hundreds of the bishops mistakes meets with very ill quarter from his lordship upon which i cannot avoid mentioning a peculiar method which this prelate takes to revenge himself upon those who presume to differ from him in print the bishop of rochester12 happened some years ago to be of this number my lord of sarum in his reply ventured to tell the world that the gentleman who had writ against him meaning dr atterbury was one upon whom he had conferred great obligations which was a very generous christian contrivance of charging his adversary with ingratitude but it seems the truth happened to be on the other side which the doctor made appear in such a manner as would have silenced his lordship for ever if he had not been writing proof poor mr wharton in his grave is charged with the same accusation but with circumstances the most aggravating that malice and something else could invent13 and which i will no more believe than five hundred passages in a certain book of travels14 see the character he gives of a divine and a scholar who shortened his life in the service of god and the church mr wharton desired me to intercede with tillotson for a prebend of canterbury i did so but wharton would not believe it said he would be revenged and so writ against me soon after he was convinced i had spoke for him said he was set on to do what he did and if i would procure any thing for him he would discover every thing to me15 what a spirit of candour charity and good nature generosity and truth shines through this story told of a

in the preface to his history of the reformation and it contains also the bishops rejoinder against whartons method of criticism in the specimen he had examined the dark ages before the reformation with much diligence and so knew many things relating to those times beyond any man of the age he pretended that he had many more errors in reserve and that this specimen was only a hasty collection of a few out of many other discoveries he could make this consisted of some trifling and minute differences in some dates and transactions of no importance upon which nothing depended so i cannot tell whether i took these too easily from printed books or if i committed any errors in my notes taken in the several offices he likewise follows me through the several recapitulations i had made of the state of things before the reformation and finds errors and omissions in most of these he adds some things out of papers i had never seen the whole was writ with so much malice and such contempt that i must give some account of the man and of his motives he had expressed great zeal against popery in the end of king jamess reign being then chaplain to archbishop sancroft who as he said had promised him the first of those prebends of canterbury that should fall in his gift for when he saw that the archbishop was resolved not to take the oaths but to forsake the post he made an earnest application to me to secure that for him at archbishop tillotsons hands i pressed him in it as much as was decent for me to do but he said he would not encourage these aspiring men by promising any thing before it should fall as indeed none of them fell during his time wharton upon this answer thought i had neglected him looking on it as a civil denial and said he would be revenged and so he published that specimen upon which i in a letter that i printed addressed to the present bishop of worcester charged him again and again to bring forth all that he pretended to have reserved at that time for till that was done i would not enter upon the examination of that specimen it was received with contempt and tillotson justified my pressing him to take wharton under his particular protection so fully that he sent and asked me pardon he said he was set on to it and that if i would procure any thing for him he would discover any thing to me i despised that offer but said that i would at any price buy of him those discoveries that he pretended to have in reserve but mr chiswell at whose house he then lay being sick said he could draw nothing of that from him and he believed he had nothing he died about a year afterburnets history of the reformation iii vii t s  come we now to the reasons which moved his lordship to set about this work at this time he could delay it no longer because the reasons of his engaging in it at first seem to return upon him17 he was then frightened with the danger of a popish successor in view and the dreadful apprehensions of the power of france england has forgot these dangers and yet is nearer to them than ever18 and therefore he is resolved to awaken them with his third volume but in the mean time sends this introduction to let them know they are asleep he then goes on in describing the condition of the kingdom19 after such a manner as if destruction hung over us by a single hair as if the pope the devil the pretender and france were just at our doors  footnote 17 page 27  footnote 18 page 28  footnote 19 page 28  when the bishop published his history there was a popish plot on foot the duke of york a known papist was presumptive heir to the crown the house of commons would not hear of any expedient for securing their religion under a popish prince nor would the king or lords consent to a bill of exclusion the french king was in the height of his grandeur and the vigour of his age at this day the presumptive heir with that whole illustrious family are protestants the popish pretender excluded for ever by several acts of parliament and every person in the smallest employment as well as the members in both houses obliged to abjure him the french king is at the lowest ebb of life his armies have been conquered and his towns won from him for ten years together and his kingdom is in danger of being torn by divisions during a long minority are these cases parallel or are we now in more danger of france and popery than we were thirty years ago what can be the motive for advancing such false such detestable assertions what conclusions would his lordship draw from such premises as these if injurious appellations were of any advantage to a cause as the style of our adversaries would make us believe what appellations would those deserve who thus endeavour to sow the seeds of sedition and are impatient to see the fruits but saith he20 the deaf adder stops her ear let the charmer charm never so wisely true my lord there are indeed too many adders in this nations bosom adders in all shapes and in all habits whom neither the queen nor parliament can charm to loyalty truth religion or honour  footnote 20 page 28 among other instances produced by him of the dismal condition we are in he offers one which could not easily be guessed it is this that the little factious pamphlets written about the end of king charles iis reign lie dead in shops are looked on as waste paper and turned to pasteboard how many are there of his lordships writings which could otherwise never have been of any real service to the public has he indeed so mean an opinion of our taste to send us at this time of day into all the corners of holborn duck lane and moorfields in quest after the factious trash published in those days by julian johnson hickeringil dr oates and himself21  footnote 21 the rev samuel johnson  degraded from his clerical rank scourged and imprisoned for a work called julians arts to undermine christianity in which he drew a parallel between that apostate and james then duke of york s  edmund hickeringil a fanatic preacher at colchester he appears from the various pamphlets which he wrote during the reigns of charles ii and his brother to have been a meddling crazy fool he was born in essex 1630 and was educated at cambridge he entered the army and went to jamaica of which place he wrote a very curious account afterwards he entered holy orders and became rector of all saints colchester he was a most eccentric individual t s  his lordship taking it for a postulatum that the queen and ministry both houses of parliament and a vast majority of the landed gentlemen throughout england are running headlong into popery lays hold on the occasion to describe the cruelties in queen marys reign an inquisition setting up faggots in smithfield and executions all over the kingdom here is that says he which those that look toward a popish successor must look for22 and he insinuates through his whole pamphlet that all who are not of his party look toward a popish successor these he divides into two parts the tory laity and the tory clergy he tells the former though they have no religion at all but resolve to change with every wind and tide yet they ought to have compassion on their countrymen and kindred23 then he applies himself to the tory clergy assures them that the fires revived in smithfield and all over the nation will have no amiable view but least of all to them who if they have any principle at all must be turned out of their livings leave their families be hunted from place to place into parts beyond the seas and meet with that contempt with which they treated foreigners who took sanctuary among us  footnote 22 page 36  footnote 23 page 36  this requires a recapitulation with some remarks first i do affirm that of every hundred professed atheists deists and socinians in the kingdom ninetynine at least are staunch thoroughpaced whigs entirely agreeing with his lordship in politics and discipline and therefore will venture all the fires of hell rather than singe one hair of their beards in smithfield secondly i do likewise affirm that those whom we usually understand by the appellation of tory or highchurch clergy were the greatest sticklers against the exorbitant proceedings of king james the best writers against popery and the most exemplary sufferers for the established religion thirdly i do pronounce it to be a most false and infamous scandal upon the nation in general and on the clergy in particular to reproach them for treating foreigners with haughtiness and contempt the french huguenots are many thousand witnesses to the contrary and i wish they deserved a thousandth part of the good treatment they have received24  footnote 24 swifts disparaging reference to the huguenots must be put down to the fact that he included them among dissenters on account of their calvinism t s  lastly i observe that the author of the paper called the englishman hath run into the same cant gravely advising the whole body of the clergy not to bring in popery because that will put them under a necessity of parting with their wives or losing their livings  the bulk of the kingdom both clergy and laity happens to differ extremely from this prelate in many principles both of politics and religion now i ask whether if any man of them had signed his name to a system of atheism or popery he could have argued with them otherwise than he does or if i should write a grave letter to his lordship with the same advice taking it for granted that he was half an atheist and half a papist and conjuring him by all he held dear to have compassion upon all those who believed a god not to revive the fires in smithfield that he must either forfeit his bishopric or not marry a fourth wife25 i ask whether he would not think i intended him the highest injury and affront  footnote 25 bishop burnet had already been married three times t s  but as to the tory laity he gives them up in a lump for abandoned atheists they are a set of men so impiously corrupted in the point of religion that no scene of cruelty can fright them from leaping into it popery and perhaps acting such a part in it as may be assigned them26 he therefore despairs of influencing them by any topics drawn from religion or compassion and advances the consideration of interest as the only powerful argument to persuade them against popery  footnote 26 page 37  what he offers upon this head is so very amazing from a christian a clergyman and a prelate of the church of england that i must in my own imagination strip him of those three capacities and put him among the number of that set of men he mentions in the paragraph before or else it will be impossible to shape out an answer  his lordship in order to dissuade the tories from their design of bringing in popery tells them how valuable a part of the whole soil of england the abbey lands the estates of the bishops of the cathedrals and the tithes are27 how difficult such a resumption would be to many families yet all these must be thrown up for sacrilege in the church of rome is a mortal sin i desire it may be observed what a jumble here is made of ecclesiastical revenues as if they were all upon the same foot were alienated with equal justice and the clergy had no more reason to complain of the one than the other whereas the four branches mentioned by him are of very different consideration if i might venture to guess the opinion of the clergy upon this matter i believe they could wish that some small part of the abbey lands had been applied to the augmentation of poor bishoprics and a very few acres to serve for glebes in those parishes where there are none after which i think they would not repine that the laity should possess the rest if the estates of some bishops and cathedrals were exorbitant before the reformation i believe the present clergys wishes reach no further than that some reasonable temper had been used instead of paring them to the quick but as to the tithes without examining whether they be of divine institution i conceive there is hardly one of that sacred order in england and very few even among the laity that love the church who will not allow the misapplying of those revenues to secular persons to have been at first a most flagrant act of injustice and oppression though at the same time god forbid they should be restored any other way than by gradual purchase by the consent of those who are now the lawful possessors or by the piety and generosity of such worthy spirits as this nation sometimes produceth the bishop knows very well that the application of tithes to the maintenance of monasteries was a scandalous usurpation even in popish times that the monks usually sent out some of their fraternity to supply the cures and that when the monasteries were granted away by henry viii the parishes were left destituted or very meanly provided of any maintenance for a pastor so that in many places the whole ecclesiastical dues even to mortuaries easterofferings and the like are in lay hands and the incumbent lies wholly at the mercy of his patron for his daily bread by these means there are several hundred parishes in england under £20 a year and many under ten i take his lordships bishopric to be worth near £2500 annual income and i will engage at half a years warning to find him above 200 beneficed clergymen who have not so much among them all to support themselves and their families most of them orthodox of good life and conversation as loth to see the fires kindled in smithfield as his lordship and at least as ready to face them under a popish persecution but nothing is so hard for those who abound in riches as to conceive how others can be in want how can the neighbouring vicar feel cold or hunger while my lord is seated by a good fire in the warmest room in his palace with a dozen dishes before him i remember one other prelate much of the same stamp who when his clergy would mention their wishes that some act of parliament might be thought of for the good of the church would say gentlemen we are very well as we are if they would let us alone we should ask no more28  footnote 27 page 38  footnote 28 scott in a note thinks this reflection on burnet to be unjust because of that prelates zeal in forwarding a scheme in 1704 for improving the livings of the poorer clergy t s  sacrilege says my lord in the church of rome is a mortal sin29 and is it only so in the church of rome or is it but a venial sin in the church of england our litany calls fornication a deadly sin and i would appeal to his lordship for fifty years past whether he thought that or sacrilege the deadliest to make light of such a sin at the same moment that he is frighting us from an idolatrous religion should seem not very consistent thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery dost thou commit adultery thou that abhorrest idols dost thou commit sacrilege  footnote 29 page 38  to smooth the way for the return of popery in queen marys time the grantees were confirmed by the pope in the possession of the abbey lands but the bishop tells us that this confirmation was fraudulent and invalid i shall believe it to be so though i happen to read in his lordships history but he adds that although the confirmation had been good the priests would have got their land again by these two methods first30 the statute of mortmain was repealed for 20 years in which time no doubt they reckoned they would recover the best part of what they had lost besides that engaging the clergy to renew no leases was a thing entirely in their own power and this in forty years time would raise their revenues to be about ten times their present value these two expedients for increasing the revenues of the church he represents as pernicious designs fit only to be practised in times of popery and such as the laity ought never to consent to whence and from what he said before about tithes his lordship has freely declared his opinion that the clergy are rich enough and that the least addition to their subsistence would be a step toward popery now it happens that the two only methods which could be thought on with any probability of success toward some reasonable augmentation of ecclesiastical revenues are here rejected by a bishop as a means for introducing popery and the nation publicly warned against them the continuance of the statute of mortmain in full force after the church had been so terribly stripped appeared to her majesty and the kingdom a very unnecessary hardship upon which account it was at several times relaxed by the legislature now as the relaxation of that statute is manifestly one of the reasons which gives the bishop those terrible apprehensions of popery coming on us so i conceive another ground of his fears is the remission of the firstfruits and tenths but where the inclination to popery lay whether in her majesty who proposed this benefaction the parliament which confirmed or the clergy who accepted it his lordship hath not thought fit to determine  footnote 30 page 39  the other popish expedient for augmenting churchrevenues is engaging the clergy to renew no leases31 several of the most eminent clergymen have assured me that nothing has been more wished for by good men than a law to prevent at least bishops from setting leases for lives i could name ten bishoprics in england whose revenues one with another do not amount to £600 ayear for each and if his lordships for instance would be above ten times the value when the lives are expired i should think the overplus would not be ill disposed toward an augmentation of such as are now shamefully poor but i do assert that such an expedient was not always thought popish and dangerous by this right reverend historian i have had the honour formerly to converse with him and he has told me several years ago that he lamented extremely the power which bishops had of letting leases for lives whereby as he said they were utterly deprived of raising their revenues whatever alterations might happen in the value of money by length of time i think the reproach of betraying private conversation will not upon this account be laid to my charge neither do i believe he would have changed his opinion upon any score but to take up another more agreeable to the maxims of his party that the least addition of property to the church is one step toward popery  footnote 31 page 39  the bishop goes on with much earnestness and prolixity to prove that the popes confirmation of the church lands to those who held them by king henrys donation was null and fraudulent which is a point that i believe no protestant in england would give threepence to have his choice whether it should be true or false it might indeed serve as a passage in his history among a thousand other instances to detect the knavery of the court of rome but i ask where could be the use of it in this introduction or why all this haste in publishing it at this juncture and so out of all method apart and before the work itself he gives his reasons in very plain terms we are now it seems in more danger of popery than toward the end of king charles iis reign that set of men the tories is so impiously corrupted in the point of religion that no scene of cruelty can fright them from leaping into it and perhaps from acting such a part in it as may be assigned them32 he doubts whether the highchurch clergy have any principles and therefore will be ready to turn off their wives and look on the fires kindled in smithfield as an amiable view these are the facts he all along takes for granted and argues accordingly therefore in despair of dissuading the nobility and gentry of the land from introducing popery by any motives of honour religion alliance or mercy he assures them that the pope has not duly confirmed their titles to the church lands in their possession which therefore must infallibly be restored as soon as that religion is established among us  footnote 32 page 37  thus in his lordships opinion there is nothing wanting to make the majority of the kingdom both for number quality and possession immediately embrace popery except a firm bull from the pope to secure the abbey and other church lands and tithes to the present proprietors and their heirs if this only difficulty could now be adjusted the pretender would be restored next session the two houses reconciled to the church of rome against easter term and the fires lighted in smithfield by midsummer such horrible calumnies against a nation are not the less injurious to decency goodnature truth honour and religion because they may be vented with safety and i will appeal to any reader of common understanding whether this be not the most natural and necessary deduction from the passages i have cited and referred to  yet all this is but friendly dealing in comparison with what he affords the clergy upon the same article he supposes33 all that reverend body who differ from him in principles of church or state so far from disliking popery upon the abovementioned motives of perjury quitting their wives or burning their relations that the hopes of enjoying the abbey lands would soon bear down all such considerations and be an effectual incitement to their perversion and so he goes gravely on as with the only argument which he thinks can have any force to assure them that the parochial priests in roman catholic countries are much poorer than in ours the several orders of regulars and the magnificence of their church devouring all their treasure and by consequence their hopes are vain of expecting to be richer after the introduction of popery  footnote 33 page 46  but after all his lordship despairs that even this argument will have any force with our abominable clergy because to use his own words they are an insensible and degenerate race who are thinking of nothing but their present advantages and so that they may now support a luxurious and brutal course of irregular and voluptuous practices they are easily hired to betray their religion to sell their country and give up that liberty and those properties which are the present felicities and glories of this nation34 he seems to reckon all these evils as matters fully determined on and therefore falls into the last usual form of despair by threatening the authors of these miseries with lasting infamy and the curses of posterity upon perfidious betrayers of their trust35  footnote 34 page 47  footnote 35 page 47  let me turn this paragraph into vulgar language for the use of the poor and strictly adhere to the sense of the words i believe it may be faithfully translated in the following manner the bulk of the clergy and onethird of the bishops are stupid sons of whores who think of nothing but getting money as soon as they can if they may but produce enough to supply them in gluttony drunkenness and whoring they are ready to turn traitors to god and their country and make their fellowsubjects slaves the rest of the period about threatening infamy and the curses of posterity upon such dogs and villains may stand as it does in the bishops own phrase and so make the paragraph all of a piece  i will engage on the other side to paraphrase all the rogues and rascals in the englishman so as to bring them up exactly to his lordships style but for my own part i much prefer the plain billingsgate way of calling names because it expresses our meaning full as well and would save abundance of time which is lost by circumlocution so for instance john dunton36 who is retained on the same side with the bishop calls my lordtreasurer and lord bolingbroke traitors whoremasters and jacobites which three words cost our right reverend author thrice as many lines to define them and i hope his lordship does not think there is any difference in point of morality whether a man calls me traitor in one word or says i am one hired to betray my religion and sell my country37  footnote 36 see note on p 50 of vol i of this edition of swifts works ts  footnote 37 page 51  i am not surprised to see the bishop mention with contempt all convocations of the clergy38 for toland collins tindal39 and others of the fraternity talk the very same language his lordship confesses he is not inclined to expect much from the assemblies of clergymen there lies the misfortune for if he and some more of his order would correct their inclinations a great deal of good might be expected from such assemblies as much as they are now cramped by that submission which a corrupt clergy brought upon their innocent successors he will not deny that his copiousness in these matters is in his own opinion one of the meanest parts of his new work i will agree with him unless he happens to be more copious in any thing else however it is not easy to conceive why he should be so copious upon a subject he so much despises unless it were to gratify his talent of railing at the clergy in the number of whom he disdains to be reckoned because he is a bishop for it is a style i observe some prelates have fallen into of late years to talk of clergymen as if themselves were not of the number you will read in many of their speeches at dr sacheverels40 trial expressions to this or the like effect my lords if clergymen be suffered c wherein they seem to have reason and i am pretty confident that a great majority of the clergy were heartily inclined to disown any relation they had to the managers in lawn however it was a confounding argument against presbytery that those who are most suspected to lean that way treating their inferior brethren with haughtiness rigour and contempt although to say the truth nothing better could be hoped for because i believe it may pass for a universal rule that in every diocese governed by bishops of the whig species the clergy especially the poorer sort are under double discipline and the laity left to themselves the opinion of sir thomas more which he produces to prove the ill consequences or insignificancy of convocations advances no such thing but says if the clergy assembled often and might act as other assemblies of clergy in christendom much good might have come but the misfortune lay in their long disuse and that in his own and a good part of his fathers time they never came together except at the command of the prince41  footnote 38 page 47  footnote 39 see note p 9 ts  footnote 40 henry sacheverell dd was educated at marlborough and oxford at magdalen college he was a fellowstudent with addison and obtained there his fellowship and doctors degree in 1709 he preached two sermons one at the derby assizes and the other at st pauls in which he urged the imminent danger of the church for these sermons which the parliament considered highly inflammatory he was by the house of commons at the instigation of godolphin impeached and tried before the lords in 1710 he was found guilty of a misdemeanour and was suspended from preaching for three years the trial made a great stir at the time and served but to increase the popularity of a man who had he been let alone would probably never have been heard of he died in 1724 holding the living of st andrew holborn to which he was presented after the expiration of his sentence ts  footnote 41 see sir thomas mores apology 1533 p 241  i suppose his lordship thinks there is some original impediment in the study of divinity or secret incapacity in a gown and cassock without lawn which disqualifies all inferior clergymen from debating upon subjects of doctrine or discipline in the church it is a famous saying of his that he looks upon every layman to be an honest man until he is by experience convinced to the contrary and on every clergyman as a knave till he finds him to be an honest man what opinion then must we have of a lower house of convocation42 where i am confident he will hardly find three persons that ever convinced him of their honesty or will ever be at the pains to do it nay i am afraid they would think such a conviction might be no very advantageous bargain to gain the character of an honest man with his lordship and lose it with the rest of the world  footnote 42 it must not be forgotten that during the reign of queen anne the body of the clergy were highchurch men but the bishops who had chiefly been promoted since the revolution were whiggish in politics and moderate in their sentiments of church government hence the upper and lower houses of convocation rarely agreed in sentiment on affairs of church or state t s  in the famous concordate that was made between francis i of france and pope leo x the bishop tells us that the king and pope came to a bargain by which they divided the liberties of the gallican church between them and indeed quite enslaved it43 he intends in the third part of his history which he is going to publish to open this whole matter to the world in the mean time he mentions some ill consequences to the gallican church from that concordate which are worthy to be observed the church of france became a slave and this change in their constitution put an end not only to national but even to provincial synods in that kingdom the assemblies of the clergy there meet now only to give subsidies c and he says our nation may see by that proceeding what it is to deliver up the essential liberties of a free constitution to a court 44  footnote 43 page 53  footnote 44 page 53  all i can gather from this matter is that our king henry made a better bargain than his contemporary francis who divided the liberties of the church between himself and the pope while the king of england seized them all to himself but how comes he to number the want of synods in the gallican church among the grievances of that concordate and as a mark of their slavery since he reckons all convocations of the clergy in england to be useless and dangerous or what difference in point of liberty was there between the gallican church under francis and the english under harry for the latter was as much a papist as the former unless in the point of obedience to the see of rome and in every quality of a good man or a good prince except personal courage wherein both were equal the french monarch had the advantage by as many degrees as is possible for one man to have over another  henry viii had no manner of intention to change religion in his kingdom he still continued to persecute and burn protestants after he had cast off the popes supremacy and i suppose this seizure of ecclesiastical revenues which francis never attempted cannot be reckoned as a mark of the churchs liberty by the quotation the bishop sets down to show the slavery of the french church he represents it as a grievance that bishops are not now elected there as formerly but wholly appointed by the prince and that those made by the court have been ordinarily the chief advancers of schisms heresies and oppressions of the church 45 he cites another passage from a greek writer and plainly insinuates that it is justly applicable to her majestys reign princes choose such men to that charge of a bishop who may be their slaves and in all things obsequious to what they prescribe and may lie at their feet and have not so much as a thought contrary to their commands 46  footnote 45 page 55  footnote 46 page 55  these are very singular passages for his lordship to set down in order to show the dismal consequences of the french concordate by the slavery of the gallican church compared with the freedom of ours i shall not enter into a long dispute whether it were better for religion that bishops should be chosen by the clergy or people or both together i believe our author would give his vote for the second which however would not have been of much advantage to himself and some others that i could name but i ask whether bishops are any more elected in england than in france and the want of synods are in his own opinion rather a blessing than a grievance unless he will affirm that more good can be expected from a popish synod than an english convocation did the french clergy ever receive a greater blow to their liberties than the submission made to henry viii or so great a one as the seizure of their lands the reformation owed nothing to the good intentions of k henry he was only an instrument of it as the logicians speak by accident nor doth he appear through his whole reign to have had any other views than those of gratifying his insatiable love of power cruelty oppression and other irregular appetites but this kingdom as well as many other parts of europe was at that time generally weary of the corruptions and impositions of the roman court and church and disposed to receive those doctrines which luther and his followers had universally spread cranmer the archbishop cromwell and others of the court did secretly embrace the reformation and the kings abrogating the popes supremacy made the people in general run into the new doctrines with greater freedom because they hoped to be supported in it by the authority and example of their prince who disappointed them so far that he made no other step than rejecting the popes supremacy as a clog upon his own power and passions but retained every corruption beside and became a cruel persecutor as well of those who denied his own supremacy as of all others who professed any protestant doctrine neither hath any thing disgusted me more in reading the histories of those times than to see one of the worst princes of any age or country celebrated as an instrument in that glorious work of the reformation  the bishop having gone over all the matters that properly fall within his introduction proceeds to expostulate with several sorts of people47 first with protestants who are no christians such as atheists deists freethinkers and the like enemies to christianity but these he treats with the tenderness of a friend because they are all of them of sound whig principles in church and state however to do him justice he lightly touches some old topics for the truth of the gospel and concludes by wishing that the freethinkers would consider well if anglice whether they think it possible to bring a nation to be without any religion at all and what the consequences of that may prove 48 and in case they allow the negative he gives it clearly for christianity  footnote 47 page 56  footnote 48 page 59  secondly he applies himself if i take his meaning right to christian papists who have a taste of liberty and desires them to compare the absurdities of their own religion with the reasonableness of the reformed 49 against which as good luck would have it i have nothing to object  footnote 49 page 59  thirdly he is somewhat rough against his own party who having tasted the sweets of protestant liberty can look back so tamely on popery coming on them it looks as if they were bewitched or that the devil were in them to be so negligent it is not enough that they resolve not to turn papists themselves they ought to awaken all about them even the most ignorant and stupid to apprehend their danger and to exert themselves with their utmost industry to guard against it and to resist it if after all their endeavours to prevent it the corruption of the age and the art and power of our enemies prove too hard for us then and not until then we must submit to the will of god and be silent and prepare ourselves for all the extremity of suffering and of misery50 with a great deal more of the same strain  footnote 50 pages 60 61  with due submission to the profound sagacity of this prelate who can smell popery at 500 miles distance better than fanaticism just under his nose i take leave to tell him that this reproof to his friends for want of zeal and clamour against popery slavery and the pretender is what they have not deserved are the pamphlets and papers daily published by the sublime authors of his party full of any thing else are not the queen the ministers the majority of lords and commons loudly taxed in print with this charge against them at full length is it not the perpetual echo of every whig coffeehouse and club have they not quartered popery and the pretender upon the peace and treaty of commerce upon the possessing and quieting and keeping and demolishing of dunkirk have they not clamoured because the pretender continued in france and because he left it have they not reported that the town swarmed with many thousand papists when upon search there were never found so few of that religion in it before if a clergyman preaches obedience to the higher powers is he not immediately traduced as a papist can mortal man do more to deal plainly my lord your friends are not strong enough yet to make an insurrection and it is unreasonable to expect it from them until their neighbours are ready  my lord i have a little seriousness at heart upon this point where your lordship affects to show so much when you can prove that one single word has ever dropped from any minister of state in public or private in favour of the pretender or his cause when you can make it appear that in the course of this administration since the queen thought fit to change her servants there hath one step been made toward weakening the hanover title or giving the least countenance to any other whatsoever then and not until then go dry your chaff and stubble give fire to the zeal of your faction and reproach them with lukewarmness  fourthly the bishop applies himself to the tories in general taking it for granted after his charitable manner that they are all ready prepared to introduce popery he puts an excuse into their mouths by which they would endeavour to justify their change of religion that popery is not what it was before the reformation things are now much mended and further corrections might be expected if we would enter into a treaty with them in particular they see the error of proceeding severely with heretics so that there is no reason to apprehend the returns of such cruelties as were practised an age and a half ago51  footnote 51 page 62  this he assures us is a plea offered by the tories in defence of themselves for going about at this juncture to establish the popish religion among us what argument does he bring to prove the fact itself        quibus indiciis quo teste probavit   nil horum verbosa et grandis epistola venit 52  footnote 52 juvenal sat x 7071 t s  nothing but this tedious introduction wherein he supposes it all along as a thing granted that there might be a perfect union in the whole christian church is a blessing which every good man wishes but no reasonable man can hope that the more polite roman catholics have in several places given up some of their superstitious fopperies particularly concerning legends relics and the like is what nobody denies but the material points in difference between us and them are universally retained and asserted in all their controversial writings and if his lordship really thinks that every man who differs from him under the name of a tory in some church and state opinions is ready to believe transubstantiation purgatory the infallibility of pope or councils to worship saints and angels and the like i can only pray god to enlighten his understanding or graft in his heart the first principles of charity a virtue which some people ought not by any means wholly to renounce because it covers a multitude of sins  fifthly the bishop applies himself to his own party in both houses of parliament whom he exhorts to guard their religion and liberty against all danger at what distance soever it may appear if they are absent and remiss on critical occasions that is to say if they do not attend close next sessions to vote upon all occasions whatsoever against the proceedings of the queen and her ministry or if any views of advantage to themselves prevail on them 53 in other words if any of them vote for the bill of commerce in hopes of a place or a pension a title or a garter god may work a deliverance for us another way that is to say by inviting the dutch but they and their families id est those who are negligent or revolters shall perish by which is meant they shall be hanged as well as the present ministry and their abettors as soon as we recover our power because they let in idolatry superstition and tyranny because they stood by and suffered the peace to be made the bill of commerce to pass and dunkirk to lie undemolished longer than we expected without raising a rebellion  footnote 53 pages 67 68  his last application is to the tory clergy a parcel of blind ignorant dumb sleeping greedy drunken dogs54 a pretty artful episcopal method is this of calling his brethren as many injurious names as he pleases it is but quoting a text of scripture where the characters of evil men are described and the thing is done and at the same time the appearances of piety and devotion preserved i would engage with the help of a good concordance and the liberty of perverting holy writ to find out as many injurious appellations as the englishman throws out in any of his politic papers and apply them to those persons who call good evil and evil good to those who cry without cause every man to his tent o israel and to those who curse the queen in their hearts  footnote 54 this is the bishops reference to the tory clergy but in the last place those who are appointed to be the watchmen who ought to give warning and to lift up their voice as a trumpet when they see those wolves ready to break in and devour the flock have the heaviest account of all others to make if they neglect their duty much more if they betray their trust if they are so set on some smaller matters and are so sharpened upon that account that they will not see their danger nor awaken others to see it and to fly from it the guilt of those souls who have perished by their means god will require at their hands if they in the view of any advantage to themselves are silent when they ought to cry out day and night they will fall under the character given by the prophet of the watchmen in his time they are blind they are all dumb dogs they cannot bark sleeping lying down loving to slumber yea they are greedy dogs which can never have enough and they are shepherds that cannot understand they all look to their own way every one for his gain from his quarter that say come i will fetch wine and we will fill ourselves with strong drink tomorrow shall be as this day and much more abundantburnets history of the reformation vol iii p xxii t s  these decent words he tells us make up a lively description of such pastors as will not study controversy nor know the depths of satan he means i suppose the controversy between us and the papists for as to the freethinkers and dissenters of every denomination they are some of the best friends to the cause now i have been told there is a body of that kind of controversy published by the london divines which is not to be matched in the world i believe likewise there is a good number of the clergy at present thoroughly versed in that study after which i cannot but give my judgment that it would be a very idle thing for pastors in general to busy themselves much in disputes against popery it being a dry heavy employment of the mind at best especially when god be thanked there is so little occasion for it in the generality of parishes throughout the kingdom and must be daily less and less by the just severity of the laws and the utter aversion of our people from that idolatrous superstition  if i might be so bold as to name those who have the honour to be of his lordships party i would venture to tell him that pastors have much more occasion to study controversies against the several classes of freethinkers and dissenters the former i beg his lordships pardon for saying so being a little worse than papists and both of them more dangerous at present to our constitution both in church and state not that i think presbytery so corrupt a system of christian religion as popery i believe it is not above onethird as bad but i think the presbyterians and their clans of other fanatics of freethinkers and atheists that dangle after them are as well inclined to pull down the present establishment of monarchy and religion as any set of papists in christendom and therefore that our danger as things now stand is infinitely greater from our protestant enemies because they are much more able to ruin us and full as willing there is no doubt but presbytery and a commonwealth are less formidable evils than popery slavery and the pretender for if the fanatics were in power i should be in more apprehension of being starved than burned but there are probably in england forty dissenters of all kinds including their brethren the freethinkers for one papist and allowing one papist to be as terrible as three dissenters it will appear by arithmetic that we are thirteen times and onethird more in danger of being ruined by the latter than the former  the other qualification necessary for all pastors if they will not be blind ignorant greedy drunken dogs c is to know the depths of satan this is harder than the former that a poor gentleman ought not to be parson vicar or curate of a parish except he be cunninger than the devil i am afraid it will be difficult to remedy this defect for one manifest reason because whoever had only half the cunning of the devil would never take up with a vicarage of £10 ayear to live on at his ease as my lord expresseth it but seek out for some better livelihood his lordship is of a nation very much distinguished for that quality of cunning though they have a great many better and i think he was never accused for wanting his share however upon a trial of skill i would venture to lay six to four on the devils side who must be allowed to be at least the older practitioner telling truth shames him and resistance makes him fly but to attempt outwitting him is to fight him at his own weapon and consequently no cunning at all another thing i would observe is that a man may be in the depths of satan without knowing them all and such a man may be so far in satans depths as to be out of his own one of the depths of satan is to counterfeit an angel of light another i believe is to stir up the people against their governors by false suggestions of danger a third is to be a prompter to false brethren and to send wolves about in sheeps clothing sometimes he sends jesuits about england in the habit and cant of fanatics at other times he has fanatic missionaries in the habits of  i shall mention but one more of satans depths for i confess i know not the hundredth part of them and that is to employ his emissaries in crying out against remote imaginary dangers by which we may be taken off from defending ourselves against those which are real and just at our elbows  but his lordship draws towards a conclusion and bids us look about to consider the danger we are in before it is too late for he assures us we are already going into some of the worst parts of popery55 like the man who was so much in haste for his new coat that he put it on the wrong side out auricular confession priestly absolution and the sacrifice of the mass have made great progress in england and nobody has observed it several other popish points are carried higher with us than by the papists themselves56 and somebody it seems had the impudence to propose a union with the gallican church57 i have indeed heard that mr lesley58 published a discourse to that purpose which i have never seen nor do i perceive the evil in proposing an union between any two churches in christendom without doubt mr lesley is most unhappily misled in his politics but if he be the author of the late tract against popery59 he has given the world such a proof of his soundness in religion as many a bishop ought to be proud of i never saw the gentleman in my life i know he is the son of a great and excellent prelate who upon several accounts was one of the most extraordinary men of his age mr lesley has written many useful discourses upon several subjects and hath so well deserved of the christian religion and the church of england in particular that to accuse him of impudence for proposing an union in two very different faiths is a style which i hope few will imitate i detest mr lesleys political principles as much as his lordship can do for his heart but i verily believe he acts from a mistaken conscience and therefore i distinguish between the principles and the person however it is some mortification to me when i see an avowed nonjuror contribute more to the confounding of popery than could ever be done by a hundred thousand such introductions as this  footnote 55 page 70  footnote 56 page 70  footnote 57 swift here disowns a charge loudly urged by the whigs of the time against the high churchmen there were however strong symptoms of a nearer approach on their part to the church of rome hickes the head of the jacobite writers had insinuated that there was a proper sacrifice in the eucharist brett had published a sermon on the doctrine of priestly absolution as essential to salvation dodwell had written against laybaptism and his doctrine at once excluded all the dissenters whose teachers are held as laymen from the pale of christianity  and upon the whole there was a general disposition among the clergy to censure if not the reformation itself at least the mode in which it was carried on s  footnote 58 charles lesley or leslie the celebrated nonjuror he published a jacobite paper called the rehearsal and was a strenuous assertor of divine right but he was also so steady a protestant that he went to barleduc to convert the chevalier de st george from the errors of rome s see note on p 63 t s  footnote 59 the case stated between the church of rome and the church of england 1713  his lordship ends with discovering a small ray of comfort god be thanked there are many among us that stand upon the watchtower and that give faithful warning that stand in the breach and make themselves a wall for their church and country that cry to god day and night and lie in the dust mourning before him to avert those judgments that seem to hasten towards us they search into the mystery of iniquity that is working among us and acquaint themselves with that mass of corruption that is in popery60 he prays that the number of these may increase and that he may be of that number ready either to die in peace or to seal that doctrine he has been preaching above fifty years with his blood61 this being his last paragraph i have made bold to transcribe the most important parts of it his design is to end after the manner of orators with leaving the strongest impression possible upon the minds of his hearers a great breach is made the mystery of popish iniquity is working among us may god avert those judgments that are hastening towards us i am an old man a preacher above fifty years and i now expect and am ready to die a martyr for the doctrines i have preached what an amiable idea does he here leave upon our minds of her majesty and her government he has been poring so long upon foxs book of martyrs that he imagines himself living in the reign of queen mary and is resolved to set up for a knighterrant against popery upon the supposition of his being in earnest which i am sure he is not it would require but a very little more heat of imagination to make a history of such a knights adventures what would he say to behold the fires kindled in smithfield and all over the town on the 17th of november to behold the pope borne in triumph on the shoulders of the people with a cardinal on the one side and the pretender on the other he would never believe it was queen elizabeths day but that of her persecuting sister in short how easily might a windmill be taken for the whore of babylon and a puppetshow for a popish procession  footnote 60 page 71  footnote 61 page 72  but enthusiasm is none of his lordships faculty i am inclined to believe he might be melancholy enough when he writ this introduction the despair at his age of seeing a faction restored to which he hath sacrificed so great a part of his life the little success he can hope for in case he should resume those highchurch principles in defence of which he first employed his pen no visible expectation of removing to farnham or lambeth and lastly the misfortune of being hated by every one who either wears the habit or values the profession of a clergyman no wonder such a spirit in such a situation is provoked beyond the regards of truth decency religion or selfconviction to do him justice he seems to have nothing else left but to cry out halters gibbets faggots inquisition popery slavery and the pretender but in the meantime he little considers what a world of mischief he does to his cause it is very convenient for the present designs of that faction to spread the opinion of our immediate danger from popery and the pretender his directors therefore ought in my humble opinion to have employed his lordship in publishing a book wherein he should have asserted by the most solemn asseverations that all things were safe and well for the world has contracted so strong a habit of believing him backwards that i am confident nine parts in ten of those who have read or heard of his introduction have slept in greater security ever since it is like the melancholy tone of a watchman at midnight who thumps with his pole as if some thief were breaking in but you know by the noise that the door is fast  however he thanks god there are many among us who stand in the breach i believe they may tis a breach of their own making and they design to come forward and storm and plunder if they be not driven back they make themselves a wall for their church and country a south wall i suppose for all the best fruit of the church and country to be nailed on let us examine this metaphor the wall of our church and country is built of those who love the constitution in both our domestic enemies undermine some parts of the wall and place themselves in the breach and then they cry we are the wall we do not like such patchwork they build with untempered mortar nor can they ever cement with us till they get better materials and better workmen god keep us from having our breaches made up with such rubbish they stand upon the watchtower they are indeed pragmatical enough to do so but who assigned them that post to give us false intelligence to alarm us with false dangers and send us to defend one gate while their accomplices are breaking in at another they cry to god day and night to avert the judgment of popery which seems to hasten towards us then i affirm they are hypocrites by day and filthy dreamers by night when they cry unto him he will not hear them for they cry against the plainest dictates of their own conscience reason and belief  but lastly they lie in the dust mourning before him hang me if i believe that unless it be figuratively spoken but suppose it to be true why do they lie in the dust because they love to raise it for what do they mourn why for power wealth and places there let the enemies of the queen and monarchy and the church lie and mourn and lick the dust like serpents till they are truly sensible of their ingratitude falsehood disobedience slander blasphemy sedition and every evil work  i cannot find in my heart to conclude without offering his lordship a little humble advice upon some certain points  first i would advise him if it be not too late in his life to endeavour a little at mending his style which is mighty defective in the circumstances of grammar propriety politeness and smoothness62 i fancied at first it might be owing to the prevalence of his passion as people sputter out nonsense for haste when they are in a rage and indeed i believe this piece before me has received some additional imperfections from that occasion but whoever has heard his sermons or read his other tracts will find him very unhappy in his choice and disposition of his words and for want of variety repeating them especially the particles in a manner very grating to an english ear but i confine myself to this introduction as his last work where endeavouring at rhetorical flowers he gives us only bunches of thistles of which i could present the reader with a plentiful crop but i refer him to every page and line of the pamphlet itself  footnote 62 in swifts notes on burnets history of his own times he points out many instances of the deficiency here stated s  secondly i would most humbly advise his lordship to examine a little into the nature of truth and sometimes to hear what she says i shall produce two instances among a hundred when he asserts that we are now in more danger of popery than toward the end of king charles iis reign and gives the broadest hints that the queen the ministry the parliament and the clergy are just going to introduce it i desire to know whether he really thinks truth is of his side or whether he be not sure she is against him if the latter then truth and he will be found in two different stories and which are we to believe again when he gravely advises the clergy and laity of the tory side not to light the fires in smithfield and goes on in twenty places already quoted as if the bargain was made for popery and slavery to enter i ask again whether he has rightly considered the nature of truth i desire to put a parallel case suppose his lordship should take it into his fancy to write and publish a letter to any gentleman of no infamous character for his religion or morals and there advise him with great earnestness not to rob or fire churches ravish his daughter or murder his father show him the sin and the danger of these enormities that if he flattered himself he could escape in disguise or bribe his jury he was grievously mistaken that he must in all probability forfeit his goods and chattels die an ignominious death and be cursed by posterity would not such a gentleman justly think himself highly injured though his lordship did not affirm that the said gentleman had his picklocks or combustibles ready that he had attempted his daughter and drawn his sword against his father in order to stab him whereas in the other case this writer affirms over and over that all attempts for introducing popery and slavery are already made the whole business concerted and that little less than a miracle can prevent our ruin  thirdly i could heartily wish his lordship would not undertake to charge the opinions of one or two and those probably nonjurors upon the whole body of the nation that differs from him mr lesley writ a proposal for a union with the gallican church somebody else has carried the necessity of priesthood in the point of baptism farther than popery a third has asserted the independency of the church on the state and in many things arraigned the supremacy of the crown then he speaks in a dubious insinuating way as if some other popish tenets had been already advanced and at last concludes in this affected strain of despondency what will all these things end in and on what design are they driven alas it is too visible tis as clear as the sun that these authors are encouraged by the ministry with a design to bring in popery and in popery all these things will end  i never was so uncharitable as to believe that the whole party of which his lordship professeth himself a member had a real formed design of establishing atheism among us the reason why the whigs have taken the atheists or freethinkers into their body is because they wholly agree in their political schemes and differ very little in church power and discipline however i could turn the argument against his lordship with very great advantage by quoting passages from fifty pamphlets wholly made up of whiggism and atheism and then conclude what will all these things end in and on what design are they driven alas it is too visible  lastly i would beg his lordship not to be so exceedingly outrageous upon the memory of the dead because it is highly probable that in a very short time he will be one of the number he has in plain words given mr wharton the character of a most malicious revengeful treacherous lying mercenary villain to which i shall only say that the direct reverse of this amiable description is what appears from the works of that most learned divine and from the accounts given me by those who knew him much better than the bishop seems to have done i meddle not with the moral part of his treatment god almighty forgive his lordship this manner of revenging himself and then there will be but little consequence from an accusation which the dead cannot feel and which none of the living will believe                             mr collinss discourse of  freethinking  put into plain english  by way of abstract  for the use of the poor  by a friend of the author  first printed in 1713   note  of the deistical writers of the early eighteenth century anthony collins 16761729 is perhaps the most celebrated he was born near hounslow and educated at eton and cambridge his writings were mainly attacks on christianity and in addition to the discourse on freethinking he published discourse of the grounds and reasons of the christian religion scheme of literal prophecy considered priestcraft in perfection historical and critical essay on the thirtynine articles and a philosophical enquiry concerning human liberty most of these writings engaged him in many and violent controversies with some of the ablest divines of his time among these beside swift may be named whiston hare hoadly bentley and samuel clarke steele also had his fling at collins and thought that if ever man deserved to be denied the common benefits of air and water it is the author of a discourse upon freethinking guardian no 3 but then steeles opinion on such a matter was of no great moment what was of more was the fact that the school to which collins belonged found a decided opponent in locke from the writings of whom the members of the school professed to draw their strongest arguments for a philosophical appreciation of toland collins and the rest see mr leslie stephens english thought in the eighteenth century chaps iii and iv of vol i 1881  swift took an entirely different attitude towards collins from that assumed by the professional controversialists he refused to take him seriously and no doubt he felt that ridicule would as effectually serve his purpose as another method moreover he sought to use the opportunity for scoring a point against the whigs by insisting on the political side of the matter and in the person of an assumed defender of collins betrayed undoubted whig leanings swift at this time was deep in work pamphleteering for harley and st john he had already written the conduct of the allies and some remarks on the barrier treaty and was soon to write the public spirit of the whigs the assumed and sarcastic defence of collins must be taken as a swiftian dodge to bring odium and suspicion on the opponents of the tory ministry by showing that the propounders of the hateful and ridiculous atheism were themselves whigs  sir henry craik in a note to his reprint of this tract selections from swift oxford 1893 vol ii p 42 agrees with scott as to the motive which urged swift in writing it in this later tract he says swift makes no attempt to cloak his enmity and he boldly assumes the character of a whig as the propounder of those atheistical absurdities which he wished as a useful political move but without any scrupulous regard to fairness to represent as part and parcel of the tenets of that party what gave colour says scott though only a colour to his charge was that toland tindal collins and most of those who carried to licence their abhorrence of churchgovernment were naturally enough enrolled among that party in politics who professed most attachment to freedom of sentiment it must not however be forgotten that swifts attachment to his church as it influenced him against the whigs would naturally influence him against the deistical writers also and that he must be credited to that extent with honesty of purpose that these writers were whigs was if one may so put it an accident of which it would have been more than a human act for swift not to take advantage for party purposes  curiously enough none of swifts more modern biographers have thought this imitation of collinss discourse worthy of a mention yet it is in its way as fine a performance as his castigation of bishop burnet and his introduction the fooling is admirably carried on and the intention as explained in the introduction is excellently well realized it frightened collins into holland to appreciate the cleverness with which it has been done one should read swifts abstract side by side with collinss discourse  the pamphlet was advertised for sale in the examiner for tuesday january 26th 171213 in his letters to stella january 16th and 21st 171213 swift makes the following references to it i came home at seven and began a little whim which just came into my head and will make a threepenny pamphlet it shall be finished in a week and if it succeeds you shall know what it is otherwise not  i was today with my printer to give him a little pamphlet i have written but not politics it will be out by monday  the present text is based on that of the first edition collated with those given by nichols hawkesworth and scott none of the miscellanies prints this tract nor is it given in faulkners edition of 173538 6 vols it is fully annotated and edited by nichols in the first volume of his supplement to swifts works 1779  t s     mr collins   discourse   of   freethinking   put into plain english   by way of abstract   for the   use of the poor  by a friend of the author  1713   introduction  our party having failed by all their political arguments to reestablish their power the wise leaders have determined that the last and principal remedy should be made use of for opening the eyes of this blinded nation and that a short but perfect system of their divinity should be published to which we are all of us ready to subscribe and which we lay down as a model bearing a close analogy to our schemes in religion crafty designing men that they might keep the world in awe have in their several forms of government placed a supreme power on earth to keep humankind in fear of being hanged and a supreme power in heaven for fear of being damned in order to cure mens apprehensions of the former several of our learned members have writ many profound treatises on anarchy but a brief complete body of atheology seemed yet wanting till this irrefragable discourse appeared however it so happens that our ablest brethren in their elaborate disquisitions upon this subject have written with so much caution that ignorant unbelievers have edified very little by them i grant that those daring spirits who first adventured to write against the direct rules of the gospel the current of antiquity the religion of the magistrate and the laws of the land had some measures to keep and particularly when they railed at religion were in the right to use little artful disguises by which a jury could only find them guilty of abusing heathenism or popery but the mystery is now revealed that there is no such thing as mystery or revelation and though our friends are out of place and power yet we may have so much confidence in the present ministry to be secure that those who suffer so many free speeches against their sovereign and themselves to pass unpunished will never resent our expressing the freest thoughts against their religion but think with tiberius that if there be a god he is able enough to revenge any injuries done to himself without expecting the civil power to interpose1  footnote 1 swift was evidently very fond of this reference since he uses it several times in his writings t s  by these reflections i was brought to think that the most ingenious author of the discourse upon freethinking in a letter to somebody esq although he hath used less reserve than any of his predecessors might yet have been more free and open i considered that several wellwitters to infidelity might be discouraged by a show of logic and a multiplicity of quotations scattered through his book which to understandings of that size might carry an appearance of something like booklearning and consequently fright them from reading for their improvement i could see no reason why these great discoveries should be hid from our youth of quality who frequent whites and toms why they should not be adapted to the capacities of the kitcat and hanover clubs2 who might then be able to read lectures on them to their several toasts and it will be allowed on all hands that nothing can sooner help to restore our abdicated cause than a firm universal belief of the principles laid down by this sublime author  footnote 2 these were chocolate houses of the time supported mainly by the aristocracy and the gamblers whites is still in existence and has had the honour of having had a special history written about it toms was in russell street and socalled after its landlord tom west the kitcat club was the resort of the whig wits of the day and the hanover club of those who favoured the hanover succession t s  for i am sensible that nothing would more contribute to the continuance of the war and the restoration of the late ministry than to have the doctrines delivered in this treatise well infused into the people i have therefore compiled them into the following abstract wherein i have adhered to the very words of our author only adding some few explanations of my own where the terms happen to be too learned and consequently a little beyond the comprehension of those for whom the work was principally intended i mean the nobility and gentry of our party after which i hope it will be impossible for the malice of a jacobite highflying priestridden faction to misrepresent us the few additions i have made are for no other use than to help the transition which could not otherwise be kept in an abstract but i have not presumed to advance anything of my own which besides would be needless to an author who hath so fully handled and demonstrated every particular i shall only add that though this writer when he speaks of priests desires chiefly to be understood to mean the english clergy yet he includes all priests whatsoever except the ancient and modern heathens the turks quakers and socinians   the letter  sir  i send you this apology for freethinking3 without the least hopes of doing good but purely to comply with your request for those truths which nobody can deny will do no good to those who deny them the clergy who are so impudent to teach the people the doctrines of faith are all either cunning knaves or mad fools for none but artificial designing men and crackbrained enthusiasts presume to be guides to others in matters of speculation which all the doctrines of christianity are and whoever has a mind to learn the christian religion naturally chooses such knaves and fools to teach them now the bible which contains the precepts of the priests religion is the most difficult book in the world to be understood it requires a thorough knowledge in natural civil ecclesiastical history law husbandry sailing physic pharmacy mathematics metaphysics ethics and everything else that can be named and everybody who believes it ought to understand it and must do so by force of his own freethinking without any guide or instructor  footnote 3 the chief strain of collinss discourse is an eulogium upon the necessity and advantage of freethinking in which it is more than insinuated that the advocates of revealed religion are enemies to the progress of enlightened inquiry this insidious position is ridiculed in the following parody s  how can a man think at all if he does not think freely a man who does not eat and drink freely does not eat and drink at all why may not i be denied the liberty of freeseeing as well as freethinking yet nobody pretends that the first is unlawful for a cat may look on a king though you be nearsighted or have weak or sore eyes or are blind you may be a freeseer you ought to see for yourself and not trust to a guide to choose the colour of your stockings or save you from falling into a ditch  in like manner there ought to be no restraint at all on thinking freely upon any proposition however impious or absurd there is not the least hurt in the wickedest thoughts provided they be free nor in telling those thoughts to everybody and endeavouring to convince the world of them for all this is included in the doctrine of freethinking as i shall plainly show you in what follows and therefore you are all along to understand the word freethinking in this sense  if you are apt to be afraid of the devil think freely of him and you destroy him and his kingdom freethinking has done him more mischief than all the clergy in the world ever could do they believe in the devil they have an interest in him and therefore are the great supports of his kingdom the devil was in the statesgeneral before they began to be freethinkers for england and holland4 were formerly the christian territories of the devil i told you how he left holland and freethinking and the revolution banished him from england i defy all the clergy to shew me when they ever had such success against him my meaning is that to think freely of the devil is to think there is no devil at all and he that thinks so the devils in him if he be afraid of the devil  footnote 4 collins is supposed to have imbibed his freethinking philosophy during his repeated visits to holland s  but within these two or three years the devil has come into england again and dr sacheverell5 has given him commission to appear in the shape of a cat and carry old women about upon broomsticks and the devil has now so many ministers ordained to his service that they have rendered freethinking odious and nothing but the second coming of christ can restore it  footnote 5 see note on p 147  the priests tell me i am to believe the bible but freethinking tells me otherwise in many particulars the bible says the jews were a nation favoured by god but i who am a freethinker say that cannot be because the jews lived in a corner of the earth and freethinking makes it clear that those who live in corners cannot be favourites of god the new testament all along asserts the truth of christianity but freethinking denies it because christianity was communicated but to a few and whatever is communicated but to a few cannot be true for that is like whispering and the proverb says that there is no whispering without lying  here is a society in london for propagating freethinking throughout the world encouraged and supported by the queen and many others you say perhaps it is for propagating the gospel do you think the missionaries we send will tell the heathens that they must not think freely no surely why then it is manifest those missionaries must be freethinkers and make the heathens so too but why should not the king of siam whose religion is heathenism and idolatry send over a parcel of his priests to convert us to his church as well as we send missionaries there both projects are exactly of a piece and equally reasonable and if those heathen priests were here it would be our duty to hearken to them and think freely whether they may not be in the right rather than we i heartily wish a detachment of such divines as dr atterbury dr smallridge6 dr swift dr sacheverell and some others were sent every year to the farthest part of the heathen world and that we had a cargo of their priests in return who would spread freethinking among us then the war would go on the late ministry be restored and faction cease which our priests inflame by haranguing upon texts and falsely call that preaching the gospel  footnote 6 dr smallridge it will be remembered was the gentleman who indignantly denied the authorship of a tale of a tub see vol i of this edition he became bishop of bristol in 1714 and died in 1719 his style was well thought of at the time ts  i have another project in my head which ought to be put in execution in order to make us freethinkers it is a great hardship and injustice that our priests must not be disturbed while they are prating in the pulpit for example why should not william penn the quaker or any anabaptist papist muggletonian jew or sweetsinger7 have liberty to come into st pauls church in the midst of divine service and endeavour to convert first the aldermen then the preacher and singingmen or pray why might not poor mr whiston8 who denies the divinity of christ be allowed to come into the lower house of convocation and convert the clergy but alas we are overrun with such false notions that if penn or whiston should do their duty they would be reckoned fanatics and disturbers of the holy synod although they have as good a title to it as st paul had to go into the synagogues of the jews and their authority is full as divine as his  footnote 7 the sweetsingers were a fanatical sect of wailers founded in scotland but which had no long life ts christ himself commands us to be freethinkers for he bids us search the scriptures and take heed what and whom we hear by which he plainly warns us not to believe our bishops and clergy for jesus christ when he considered that all the jewish and heathen priests whose religion he came to abolish were his enemies rightly concluded that those appointed by him to preach his own gospel would probably be so too and could not be secure that any set of priests of the faith he delivered would ever be otherwise therefore it is fully demonstrated that the clergy of the church of england are mortal enemies to christ and ought not to be believed  footnote 8 yet whiston who receives this sidecut was himself an anxious combatant of collins in his reflections on an anonymous pamphlet entitled a defence of freethinking 1713 s  but without the privilege of freethinking how is it possible to know which is the right scripture here are perhaps twenty sorts of scriptures in the several parts of the world and every set of priests contend that their scripture is the true one the indian brahmins have a book of scripture called the shaster the persees their zundivastaw9 the bonzes in china have theirs written by the disciples of fohe whom they call god and saviour of the world who was born to teach the way of salvation and to give satisfaction for all mens sins which you see is directly the same with what our priests pretend of christ and must we not think freely to find out which are in the right whether the bishops or the bonzes but the talapoins or heathen clergy of siam approach yet nearer to the system of our priests they have a book of scripture written by sommonocodam who the siamese say was born of a virgin and was the god expected by the universe just as our priests tell us that jesus christ was born of the virgin mary and was the messiah so long expected the turkish priests or dervises have their scripture which they call the alcoran the jews have the old testament for their scripture and the christians have both the old and the new now among all these scriptures there cannot above one be right and how is it possible to know which is that without reading them all and then thinking freely every one of us for ourselves without following the advice or instruction of any guide before we venture to choose the parliament ought to be at the charge of finding a sufficient number of these scriptures for every one of her majestys subjects for there are twenty to one against us that we may be in the wrong but a great deal of freethinking will at last set us all right and every one will adhere to the scripture he likes best by which means religion peace and wealth will be for ever secured in her majestys realms  footnote 9 swift means here of course the zendavesta the commentaries on the sacred books of the parsees not that swift could have known much of these oriental religions but the names were good enough for his purpose ts  and it is the more necessary that the good people of england should have liberty to choose some other scripture because all christian priests differ so much about the copies of theirs and about the various readings of the several manuscripts which quite destroys the authority of the bible for what authority can a book pretend to where there are various readings10 and for this reason it is manifest that no man can know the opinions of aristotle or plato or believe the facts related by thucydides or livy or be pleased with the poetry of homer and virgil all which books are utterly useless upon account of their various readings some books of scripture are said to be lost and this utterly destroys the credit of those that are left some we reject which the africans and copticks receive and why may we not think freely and reject the rest some think the scriptures wholly inspired some partly and some not at all now this is just the very case of the bramins persees bonzes talapoins dervises rabbis and all other priests who build their religion upon books as our priests do upon their bibles they all equally differ about the copies various readings and inspirations of their several scriptures and god knows which are in the right freethinking alone can determine it  footnote 10 in the discourse on freethinking p 80 collins insists much on a passage in victor of tunis from which he infers that the gospels were corrected and altered in the fourth century s  it would be endless to show in how many particulars the priests of the heathen and christian churches differ about the meaning even of those scriptures which they universally receive as sacred but to avoid prolixity i shall confine myself to the different opinions among the priests of the church of england and here only give you a specimen because even these are too many to be enumerated  i have found out a bishop though indeed his opinions are condemned by all his brethren who allows the scriptures to be so difficult that god has left them rather as a trial of our industry than a repository of our faith and furniture of creeds and articles of belief with several other admirable schemes of freethinking which you may consult at your leisure  the doctrine of the trinity is the most fundamental point of the whole christian religion nothing is more easy to a freethinker yet what different notions of it do the english priests pretend to deduce from scripture explaining it by specific unities eternal modes of subsistence and the like unintelligible jargon nay it is a question whether this doctrine be fundamental or no for though dr south and bishop bull affirm it yet bishop taylor and dr wallis deny it11 and that excellent freethinking prelate bishop taylor observes that athanasiuss example was followed with too much greediness by which means it has happened that the greater number of our priests are in that sentiment and think it necessary to believe the trinity and incarnation of christ12  footnote 11 dr robert south 16331716 rector of islip the reference by swift is to his controversy with sherlock on the doctrine of the trinity the two disputants got into such depths that both were charged with heresy  dr george bull 16341710 bishop of st davids wrote the defensio fidei nicenae for his exposition of the necessity for the belief in the divinity of the son of god he received the thanks of bossuet  dr jeremy taylor bishop of down and connor 16131667 and author of holy living and holy dying wrote also unum necessarium or the doctrine and practice of repentance his treatment in this work of the doctrine of original sin was considered heterodox by bishop warner and dr sanderson and a controversy ensued in the course of which taylor was imprisoned in chepstow castle on a charge of being concerned in a royalist insurrection  dr john wallis 16161703 here referred to is the famous mathematician and divine and one of the original members of the royal society he is mentioned in the text by swift because of a work he published on the trinity which brought him into collision with the arians but the doctor seems to have been addicted to views of a controversial nature for his opinions on infant baptism and the keeping of the sabbath found many objectors he was savilian professor of geometry at oxford in 1648 ts  footnote 12 see swifts opinion of controversies on this subject in his sermon upon the trinity s  our priests likewise dispute several circumstances about the resurrection of the dead the nature of our bodies after the resurrection and in what manner they shall be united to our souls they also attack one another very weakly with great vigour about predestination and it is certainly true for bishop taylor and mr whiston the socinian say so that all churches in prosperity alter their doctrines every age and are neither satisfied with themselves nor their own confessions neither does any clergyman of sense believe the thirtynine articles  our priests differ about the eternity of hell torments the famous dr henry more13 and the most pious and rational of all priests dr tillotson14 both freethinkers believe them to be not eternal they differ about keeping the sabbath the divine right of episcopacy and the doctrine of original sin which is the foundation of the whole christian religion for if men are not liable to be damned for adams sin the christian religion is an imposture yet this is now disputed among them so is lay baptism so was formerly the lawfulness of usury but now the priests are common stockjobbers attorneys and scriveners in short there is no end of disputing among priests and therefore i conclude that there ought to be no such thing in the world as priests teachers or guides for instructing ignorant people in religion but that every man ought to think freely for himself  footnote 13 dr henry more 16141687 the platonist theologian wrote a philosophical poem entitled psychozoia or the life of the soul 1640 ts  footnote 14 dr john tillotson 16301694 succeeded bancroft as archbishop of canterbury he published some eloquent sermons and several controversial tracts against catholicism ts  i will tell you the meaning in all this the priests dispute every point in the christian religion as well as almost every text in the bible and the force of my argument lies here that whatever point is disputed by one or two divines however condemned by the church not only that particular point but the whole article to which it relates may lawfully be received or rejected by any freethinker for instance suppose more and tillotson deny the eternity of hell torments a freethinker may deny all future punishments whatsoever the priests dispute about explaining the trinity therefore a freethinker may reject one or two or the whole three persons at least he may reject christianity because the trinity is the most fundamental doctrine of that religion so i affirm original sin and that men are now liable to be damned for adams sin to be the foundation of the whole christian religion but this point was formerly and is now disputed therefore a freethinker may deny the whole and i cannot help giving you one farther direction how i insinuate all along that the wisest freethinking priests whom you may distinguish by the epithets i bestow them were those who differed most from the generality of their brethren  but besides the conduct of our priests in many other points makes freethinking unavoidable for some of them own that the doctrines of the church are contradictory to one another as well as to reason which i thus prove dr sacheverell says in his speech at his trial that by abandoning passive obedience we must render ourselves the most inconsistent church in the world now tis plain that one inconsistency could not make the most inconsistent church in the world ergo there must have been a great many inconsistencies and contradictory doctrines in the church before dr south describes the incarnation of christ as an astonishing mystery impossible to be conceived by mans reason ergo it is contradictory to itself and to reason and ought to be exploded by all freethinkers  another instance of the priests conduct which multiplies freethinkers is their acknowledgment of abuses defects and false doctrines in the church particularly that of eating black pudding15 which is so plainly forbid in the old and new testament that i wonder those who pretend to believe a syllable in either will presume to taste it why should i mention the want of discipline and of a sideboard at the altar with complaints of other great abuses and defects made by some of the priests which no man can think on without freethinking and consequently rejecting christianity  footnote 15 collins in his pamphlet quotes a dr grabe who following the jewish code of rules as regards food considered the eating of blood one of the points on which the church did not insist against in the text swift ridicules this in the reference to black pudding t s  when i see an honest freethinking bishop endeavour to destroy the power and privileges of the church and dr atterbury angry with him for it and calling it dirty work what can i conclude by virtue of being a freethinker but that christianity is all a cheat  mr whiston has published several tracts wherein he absolutely denies the divinity of christ a bishop tells him sir in any matter where you have the churchs judgment against you you should be careful not to break the peace of the church by writing against it though you are sure you are in the right16 now my opinion is directly contrary and i affirm that if ten thousand freethinkers thought differently from the received doctrine and from each other they would be all in duty bound to publish their thoughts provided they were all sure of being in the right though it broke the peace of the church and state ten thousand times  footnote 16 swifts sermon on the trinity as well as a passage in his thoughts upon religion shews the weight which he attached to this important argument s  and here i must take leave to tell you although you cannot but have perceived it from what i have already said and shall be still more amply convinced by what is to follow that freethinking signifies nothing without freespeaking and freewriting it is the indispensable duty of a freethinker to endeavour forcing all the world to think as he does and by that means make them freethinkers too you are also to understand that i allow no man to be a freethinker any further than as he differs from the received doctrines of religion where a man falls in though by perfect chance with what is generally believed he is in that point a confined and limited thinker and you shall see by and by that i celebrate those for the noblest freethinkers in every age who differed from the religion of their countries in the most fundamental points and especially in those which bear any analogy to the chief fundamentals of religion among us  another trick of the priests is to charge all men with atheism who have more wit than themselves which therefore i expect will be my case for writing this discourse this is what makes them so implacable against mr gildon dr tindal mr toland17 and myself and when they call us wits atheists it provokes us to be freethinkers  footnote 17 see notes on pp 9 79 80 82  again the priests cannot agree when their scripture was written they differ about the number of canonical books and the various readings now those few among us who understand latin are careful to tell this to our disciples who presently fall afreethinking that the bible is a book not to be depended upon in anything at all  there is another thing that mightily spreads freethinking which i believe you would hardly guess the priests have got a way of late of writing books against freethinking i mean treatises in dialogue where they introduce atheists deists sceptics and socinians offering their several arguments now these freethinkers are too hard for the priests themselves in their own books and how can it be otherwise for if the arguments usually offered by atheists are fairly represented in these books they must needs convert everybody that reads them because atheists deists sceptics and socinians have certainly better arguments to maintain their opinions than any the priests can produce to maintain the contrary  mr creech18 a priest translated lucretius into english which is a complete system of atheism and several young students who were afterwards priests wrote verses in praise of this translation the arguments against providence in that book are so strong that they have added mightily to the number of freethinkers  footnote 18 this is thomas creech the translator of horace to whom swift refers in the battle of the books see vol i p 180 the translation of lucretius was published in english verse in 1682 t s  why should i mention the pious cheats of the priests who in the new testament translate the word ecclesia sometimes the church and sometimes the congregation and episcopus sometimes a bishop and sometimes an overseer a priest19 translating a book left out a whole passage that reflected on the king by which he was an enemy to political freethinking a most considerable branch of our system another priest translating a book of travels20 left out a lying miracle out of mere malice to conceal an argument for freethinking in short these frauds are very common in all books which are published by priests but however i love to excuse them whenever i can and as to this accusation they may plead the authority of the ancient fathers of the church for forgery corruption and mangling of authors with more reason than for any of their articles of faith st jerom st hilary eusebius vercellensis victorinus21 and several others were all guilty of arrant forgery and corruption for when they translated the works of several freethinkers whom they called heretics they omitted all their heresies or freethinkings and had the impudence to own it to the world  footnote 19 collins refers to the rev mr brown who translated father pauls letters and omitted the words if the king of england james i were not more a doctor than a king  footnote 20 baumgartens travels t s  footnote 21 jerome or st hieronymus circa 340420 wrote the latin vulgate translation of the scriptures is accepted as one of the fathers of the church  st hilary another accepted father was bishop of poictiers he died 367 or 368  the eusebius here named was bishop of vercelli a city of liguria he flourished about ad 360 and distinguished himself at the council of milan in ad 355 for his attacks against arianism he was exiled to upper thebais with several other bishops who refused to subscribe to the condemnation of athanasius but was recalled with lucifer bishop of cagliari sardinia in conjunction with athanasius he attended an alexandrian synod which declared the trinity consubstantial he travelled much in the eastern provinces and italy engaging in missionary work he died about ad 373  fabius marius victorinus was born in africa and died at rome in 370 he was a distinguished orator grammarian and rhetorician his chief work was a treatise entitled de orthographia he also wrote many theological books t s  from these many notorious instances of the priests conduct i conclude they are not to be relied on in any one thing relating to religion but that every man must think freely for himself  but to this it may be objected that the bulk of mankind is as well qualified for flying as thinking and if every man thought it his duty to think freely and trouble his neighbour with his thoughts which is an essential part of freethinking it would make wild work in the world i answer whoever cannot think freely may let it alone if he pleases by virtue of his right to think freely that is to say if such a man freely thinks that he cannot think freely of which every man is a sufficient judge why then he need not think freely unless he thinks fit  besides if the bulk of mankind cannot think freely in matters of speculation as the being of a god the immortality of the soul c why then freethinking is indeed no duty but then the priests must allow that men are not concerned to believe whether there is a god or no but still those who are disposed to think freely may think freely if they please  it is again objected that freethinking will produce endless divisions in opinion and by consequence disorder society to which i answer  when every single man comes to have a different opinion every day from the whole world and from himself by virtue of freethinking and thinks it his duty to convert every man to his own freethinking as all we freethinkers do how can that possibly create so great a diversity of opinions as to have a set of priests agree among themselves to teach the same opinions in their several parishes to all who will come to hear them besides if all people were of the same opinion the remedy would be worse than the disease i will tell you the reason some other time  besides difference in opinion especially in matters of great moment breeds no confusion at all witness papist and protestant roundhead and cavalier whig and tory now among us i observe the turkish empire is more at peace within itself than christian princes are with one another those noble turkish virtues of charity and toleration are what contribute chiefly to the flourishing state of that happy monarchy there christians and jews are tolerated and live at ease if they can hold their tongues and think freely provided they never set foot within the mosques nor write against mahomet a few plunderings now and then by the janissaries are all they have to fear  it is objected that by freethinking men will think themselves into atheism and indeed i have allowed all along that atheistical books convert men to freethinking but suppose that to be true i can bring you two divines who affirm superstition and enthusiasm to be worse than atheism and more mischievous to society and in short it is necessary that the bulk of the people should be atheists or superstitious  it is objected that priests ought to be relied on by the people as lawyers and physicians because it is their faculty  i answer tis true a man who is no lawyer is not suffered to plead for himself but every man may be his own quack if he pleases and he only ventures his life but in the other case the priest tells him he must be damned therefore do not trust the priest but think freely for yourself and if you happen to think there is no hell there certainly is none and consequently you cannot be damned i answer further that wherever there is no lawyer physician or priest the country is paradise besides all priests except the orthodox and those are not ours nor any that i know are hired by the public to lead men into mischief but lawyers and physicians are not you hire them yourself  it is objected by priests no doubt but i have forgot their names that false speculations are necessary to be imposed upon men in order to assist the magistrate in keeping the peace and that men ought therefore to be deceived like children for their own good i answer that zeal for imposing speculations whether true or false under which name of speculations i include all opinions of religion as the belief of a god providence immortality of the soul future rewards and punishments c has done more hurt than it is possible for religion to do good it puts us to the charge of maintaining ten thousand priests in england which is a burden upon society never felt upon any other occasion and a greater evil to the public than if these ecclesiastics were only employed in the most innocent offices of life which i take to be eating and drinking now if you offer to impose anything on mankind besides what relates to moral duties as to pay your debts not pick pockets nor commit murder and the like that is to say if besides this you oblige them to believe in god and jesus christ what you add to their faith will take just so much off from their morality by this argument it is manifest that a perfect moral man must be a perfect atheist every inch of religion he gets loses him an inch of morality for there is a certain quantum belongs to every man of which there is nothing to spare this is clear from the common practice of all our priests they never once preach to you to love your neighbour to be just in your dealings or to be sober and temperate the streets of london are full of common whores publicly tolerated in their wickedness yet the priests make no complaints against this enormity either from the pulpit or the press i can affirm that neither you nor i sir have ever heard one sermon against whoring since we were boys no the priests allow all these vices and love us the better for them provided we will promise not to harangue upon a text nor to sprinkle a little water in a childs face which they call baptizing and would engross it all to themselves  besides the priests engage all the rogues villains and fools in their party in order to make it as large as they can by this means they seduced constantine the great22 over to their religion who was the first christian emperor and so horrible a villain that the heathen priests told him they could not expiate his crimes in their church so he was at a loss to know what to do till an aegyptian bishop assured him that there was no villainy so great but was to be expiated by the sacraments of the christian religion upon which he became a christian and to him that religion owes its first settlement  footnote 22 the reference here is to the luminous cross which constantine said he saw in the heavens and which influenced him to embrace christianity t s  it is objected that freethinkers themselves are the most infamous wicked and senseless of all mankind  i answer first we say the same of priests and other believers but the truth is men of all sects are equally good and bad for no religion whatsoever contributes in the least to mend mens lives  i answer secondly that freethinkers use their understanding but those who have religion do not therefore the first have more understanding than the others witness toland tindal gildon23 clendon coward and myself for use legs and have legs  footnote 23 john clendon of the middle temple published in 17091710 tractatus philosophicotheologicus de persona or a treatise of the word person this singular book appears to have been written principally to prove that the doctrine of the trinity was very well explained by an act of parliament 9 and 10 will iii it was complained of in the house of commons march 25th 1710 and was judged to be a scandalous seditious and blasphemous libel  and was burnt by the common hangman at the same time with tindals rights n   i answer thirdly that freethinkers are the most virtuous persons in the world for all freethinkers must certainly differ from the priests and from nine hundred ninetynine of a thousand of those among whom they live and are therefore virtuous of course because everybody hates them  i answer fourthly that the most virtuous people in all ages have been freethinkers of which i shall produce several instances24  footnote 24 what follows is in ridicule of a long list of freethinkers as he calls them with which collins has graced his discourse in which he includes not only the ancient philosophers but the inspired prophets and even king solomon the wise s   socrates was a freethinker for he disbelieved the gods of his country and the common creeds about them and declared his dislike when he heard men attribute repentance anger and other passions to the gods and talk of wars and battles in heaven and of the gods getting women with child and such like fabulous and blasphemous stones i pick out these particulars because they are the very same with what the priests have in their bibles where repentance and anger are attributed to god where it is said there was war in heaven and that the virgin mary was with child by the holy ghost whom the priests call god all fabulous and blasphemous stories now i affirm socrates to have been a true christian you will ask perhaps how that can be since he lived three or four hundred years before christ i answer with justin martyr that christ is nothing else but reason and i hope you do not think socrates lived before reason now this true christian socrates never made notions speculations or mysteries any part of his religion but demonstrated all men to be fools who troubled themselves with enquiries into heavenly things lastly tis plain that socrates was a freethinker because he was calumniated for an atheist as freethinkers generally are only because he was an enemy to all speculations and inquiries into heavenly things for i argue thus that if i never trouble myself to think whether there be a god or no and forbid others to do it i am a freethinker but not an atheist  plato was a freethinker and his notions are so like some in the gospel that a heathen charged christ with borrowing his doctrine from plato but origen25 defends christ very well against this charge by saying he did not understand greek and therefore could not borrow his doctrine from plato however their two religions agreed so well that it was common for christians to turn platonists and platonists christians when the christians found out this one of their zealous priests worse than any atheist forged several things under platos name but conformable to christianity by which the heathens were fraudulently converted  footnote 25 origen a father of the church was born about 185 he carried to extremes the celibate life taught in the gospel and his treatise against celsus contains according to st jerome and eusebius the refutation of all the objections which have been made and all which ever will be made against christianity t s   epicurus was the greatest of all freethinkers and consequently the most virtuous man in the world his opinions in religion were the most complete system of atheism that ever appeared christians ought to have the greatest veneration for him because he taught a higher point of virtue than christ i mean the virtue of friendship which in the sense we usually understand it is not so much as named in the new testament  plutarch was a freethinker notwithstanding his being a priest but indeed he was a heathen priest his freethinking appears by showing the innocence of atheism which at worst is only false reasoning and the mischiefs of superstition and explains what superstition is by calling it a conceit of immortal ills after death the opinion of hell torments dreadful aspects doleful groans and the like he is likewise very satirical upon the public forms of devotion in his own country a qualification absolutely necessary to a freethinker yet those forms which he ridicules are the very same that now pass for true worship in almost all countries i am sure some of them do so in ours such as abject looks distortions wry faces beggarly tones humiliation and contrition  varro26 the most learned among the romans was a freethinker for he said the heathen divinity contained many fables below the dignity of immortal beings such for instance as gods begotten and proceeding from other gods these two words i desire you will particularly remark because they are the very terms made use of by our priests in their doctrine of the trinity he says likewise that there are many things false in religion and so say all freethinkers but then he adds which the vulgar ought not to know but it is expedient they should believe in this last he indeed discovers the whole secret of a statesman and politician by denying the vulgar the privilege of freethinking and here i differ from him however it is manifest from hence that the trinity was an invention of statesmen and politicians  footnote 26 marcus terentius varro born bc 117 was the friend of cicero he was a profound grammarian historian and philosopher the expression swift applies to him as the most learned among the romans is one by which he is generally called t s   the grave and wise cato the censor will for ever live in that noble freethinking sayingi wonder said he how one of our priests can forbear laughing when he sees another for contempt of priests is another grand characteristic of a freethinker this shews that cato understood the whole mystery of the roman religion as by law established i beg you sir not to overlook these last words religion as by law established i translate hanisfax into the general word priest thus i apply the sentence to our priests in england and when dr smallridge sees dr atterbury i wonder how either of them can forbear laughing at the cheat they put upon the people by making them believe their religion as by law established  cicero that consummate philosopher and noble patriot though he was a priest and consequently more likely to be a knave gave the greatest proofs of his freethinking first he professed the sceptic philosophy which doubts of everything then he wrote two treatises27 in the first he shews the weakness of the stoics arguments for the being of the gods in the latter he has destroyed the whole revealed religion of the greeks and romans for why should not theirs be a revealed religion as well as that of christ cicero likewise tells us as his own opinion that they who study philosophy do not believe there are any gods he denies the immortality of the soul and says there can be nothing after death  footnote 27 de natura deomm t s   and because the priests have the impudence to quote cicero in their pulpits and pamphlets against freethinking i am resolved to disarm them of his authority you must know his philosophical works are generally in dialogues where people are brought in disputing against one another now the priests when they see an argument to prove a god offered perhaps by a stoic are such knaves or blockheads to quote it as if it were ciceros own whereas cicero was so noble a freethinker that he believed nothing at all of the matter nor ever shews the least inclination to favour superstition or the belief of a god and the immortality of the soul unless what he throws out sometimes to save himself from danger in his speeches to the roman mob whose religion was however much more innocent and less absurd than that of popery at least and i could say morebut you understand me  seneca was a great freethinker and had a noble notion of the worship of the gods for which our priests would call any man an atheist he laughs at morning devotions or worshipping upon sabbathdays he says god has no need of ministers and servants because he himself serves mankind this religious man like his religious brethren the stoics denies the immortality of the soul and says all that is feigned to be so terrible in hell is but a fable death puts an end to all our misery c yet the priests were anciently so fond of seneca that they forged a correspondence of letters between him and st paul  solomon himself whose writings are called the word of god was such a freethinker that if he were now alive nothing but his building of churches could have kept our priests from calling him an atheist he affirms the eternity of the world almost in the same manner with manilius28 the heathen philosophical poet which opinion entirely overthrows the history of the creation by moses and all the new testament he denies the immortality of the soul assures us that men die like beasts and that both go to one place  footnote 28 marcus manilius who probably flourished under theodosius the great was a latin poet who wrote a poem entitled astronomica ts   the prophets of the old testament were generally freethinkers you must understand that their way of learning to prophesy was by music and drinking29 these prophets writ against the established religion of the jews which those people looked upon as the institution of god himself as if they believed it was all a cheat that is to say with as great liberty against the priests and prophets of israel as dr tindal did lately against the priests and prophets of our israel who has clearly shewn them and their religion to be cheats to prove this you may read several passages in isaiah ezekiel amos jeremiah c wherein you will find such instances of freethinking that if any englishman had talked so in our days their opinions would have been registered in dr sacheverells trial and in the representation of the lower house of convocation and produced as so many proofs of the profaneness blasphemy and atheism of the nation there being nothing more profane blasphemous or atheistical in those representations than what these prophets have spoke whose writings are yet called by our priests the word of god and therefore these prophets are as much atheists as myself or as any of my freethinking brethren whom i lately named to you  footnote 29 collins after making the charge which has been repeated by all freethinkers down to thomas paine that the prophets acquired their fervour of spirit by the aid of music and wine allows nevertheless that they were great freethinkers and writ with as great liberty against the established religion of the jews which the people looked on as the institution of god himself as if they looked upon it all to be imposturediscourse p 153 et sequen s   josephus was a great freethinker i wish he had chosen a better subject to write on than those ignorant barbarous ridiculous scoundrels the jews whom god if we may believe the priests thought fit to choose for his own people i will give you some instances of his freethinking he says cain travelled through several countries and kept company with rakes and profligate fellows he corrupted the simplicities of former times c which plainly supposes men before adam and consequently that the priests history of the creation by moses is an imposture he says the israelites passing through the red sea was no more than alexanders passing at the pamphilian sea that as for the appearance of god at mount sinai the reader may believe it as he pleases that moses persuaded the jews he had god for his guide just as the greeks pretended they had their laws from apollo these are noble strains of freethinking which the priests knew not how to solve but by thinking as freely for one of them says that josephus writ this to make his work acceptable to the heathens by striking out everything that was incredible  origen who was the first christian that had any learning has left a noble testimony of his freethinking for a general council has determined him to be damned which plainly shews he was a freethinker and was no saint for people were only sainted because of their want of learning and excess of zeal so that all the fathers who are called saints by the priests were worse than atheists  minutius felix30 seems to be a true modern latitudinarian freethinking christian for he is against altars churches public preaching and public assemblies and likewise against priests for he says there were several great flourishing empires before there were any orders of priests in the world  footnote 30 marcus minutius felix is said to have been born in africa he flourished in the third century and wrote a defence of christianity in dialogue form entitled octavius the work has been translated into english by lord hailes ts  synesius31 who had too much learning and too little zeal for a saint was for some time a great freethinker he could not believe the resurrection till he was made a bishop and then pretended to be convinced by a lying miracle  footnote 31 synesius of cyrene born 379 is the platonic philosopher who became bishop of ptolemais ts  to come to our own country my lord bacon was a great freethinker when he tells us that whatever has the least relation to religion is particularly liable to suspicion by which he seems to suspect all the facts whereon most of the superstitions that is to say what the priests call the religions of the world are grounded he also prefers atheism before superstition  mr hobbes was a person of great learning virtue and freethinking except in the high church politics  but archbishop tillotson is the person whom all english freethinkers own as their head and his virtue is indisputable for this manifest reason that dr hickes a priest calls him an atheist says he caused several to turn atheists and to ridicule the priesthood and religion these must be allowed to be noble effects of freethinking this great prelate assures us that all the duties of the christian religion with respect to god are no other but what natural light prompts men to except the two sacraments and praying to god in the name and mediation of christ as a priest and prelate he was obliged to say something of christianity but pray observe sir how he brings himself off he justly affirms that even these things are of less moment than natural duties and because mothers nursing their children is a natural duty it is of more moment than the two sacraments or than praying to god in the name and by the mediation of christ this freethinking archbishop could not allow a miracle sufficient to give credit to a prophet who taught anything contrary to our natural notions by which it is plain he rejected at once all the mysteries of christianity  i could name oneandtwenty more great men who were all freethinkers but that i fear to be tedious for tis certain that all men of sense depart from the opinions commonly received and are consequently more or less men of sense according as they depart more or less from the opinions commonly received neither can you name an enemy to freethinking however he be dignified or distinguished whether archbishop bishop priest or deacon who has not been either a crackbrained enthusiast a diabolical villain or a most profound ignorant brute  thus sir i have endeavoured to execute your commands and you may print this letter if you please but i would have you conceal my name for my opinion of virtue is that we ought not to venture doing ourselves harm by endeavouring to do good   i am yours c    i have here given the public a brief but faithful abstract of this most excellent essay wherein i have all along religiously adhered to our authors notions and generally to his words without any other addition than that of explaining a few necessary consequences for the sake of ignorant readers for to those who have the least degree of learning i own they will be wholly useless i hope i have not in any single instance misrepresented the thoughts of this admirable writer if i have happened to mistake through inadvertency i entreat he will condescend to inform me and point out the place upon which i will immediately beg pardon both of him and the world the design of his piece is to recommend freethinking and one chief motive is the example of many excellent men who were of that sect he produces as the principal points of their freethinking that they denied the being of a god the torments of hell the immortality of the soul the trinity incarnation the history of the creation by moses with many other such fabulous and blasphemous stories as he judiciously calls them and he asserts that whoever denies the most of these is the completest freethinker and consequently the wisest and most virtuous man the author sensible of the prejudices of the age does not directly affirm himself an atheist he goes no further than to pronounce that atheism is the most perfect degree of freethinking and leaves the reader to form the conclusion however he seems to allow that a man may be a tolerable freethinker though he does believe a god provided he utterly rejects providence revelation the old and new testament future rewards and punishments the immortality of the soul and other the like impossible absurdities which mark of superabundant caution sacrificing truth to the superstition of priests may perhaps be forgiven but ought not to be imitated by any who would arrive even in this authors judgment at the true perfection of freethinking                            some thoughts  on  freethinking  written in england but left unfinished   discoursing one day with a prelate of the kingdom of ireland who is a person of excellent wit and learning he offered a notion applicable to the subject we were then upon which i took to be altogether new and right he said that the difference betwixt a madman and one in his wits in what related to speech consisted in this that the former spoke out whatever came into his mind and just in the confused manner as his imagination presented the ideas the latter only expressed such thoughts as his judgment directed him to choose leaving the rest to die away in his memory and that if the wisest man would at any time utter his thoughts in the crude indigested manner as they come into his head he would be looked upon as raving mad and indeed when we consider our thoughts as they are the seeds of words and actions we cannot but agree that they ought to be kept under the strictest regulation and that in the great multiplicity of ideas which ones mind is apt to form there is nothing more difficult than to select those which are most proper for the conduct of life so that i cannot imagine what is meant by the mighty zeal in some people for asserting the freedom of thinking because if such thinkers keep their thoughts within their own breasts they can be of no consequence farther than to themselves if they publish them to the world they ought to be answerable for the effects their thoughts produce upon others there are thousands in this kingdom who in their thoughts prefer a republic or absolute power of a prince before a limited monarchy yet if any of these should publish their opinions and go about by writing or discourse to persuade the people to innovations in government they would be liable to the severest punishments the law can inflict and therefore they are usually so wise as to keep their sentiments to themselves but with respect to religion the matter is quite otherwise and the public at least here in england seems to be of opinion with tiberius that deorum injuriae diis curae they leave it to god almighty to vindicate the injuries done to himself who is no doubt sufficiently able by perpetual miracles to revenge the affronts of impious men and it should seem that is what princes expect from him though i cannot readily conceive the grounds they go upon nor why since they are gods vicegerents they do not think themselves at least equally obliged to preserve their masters honour as their own since this is what they expect from those they depute and since they never fail to represent the disobedience of their subjects as offences against god it is true the visible reason of this neglect is obvious enough the consequences of atheistical opinions published to the world are not so immediate or so sensible as doctrines of rebellion and sedition spread in a proper season however i cannot but think the same consequences are as natural and probable from the former though more remote and whether these have not been in view among our great planters of infidelity in england i shall hereafter examine                            a letter  to  a young clergyman  lately entered into  holy orders  171920   note  no stronger proof could be adduced of swifts genuine and earnest belief in the dignity of a clergyman of the church than this letter in spite of the sarcasms which here and there are levelled against the mediocre members of the class it is evident swift felt that these might be made worthy teachers and preachers of the doctrines of an institution founded in his opinion for the best regulation of mankind the letter serves also to present us with an outline of a picture of the clergyman of his day and if this picture be not flattering it seems faithfully to reflect the social conditions which we know to have prevailed at the time  the letter was written in the years of quiet which swift enjoyed between the pamphleteering crusade against the whigs when harley and st john were in power and the famous social and political troubles which began with woods halfpence  the text of this letter is practically that of the first edition but i have collated this with the texts given by hawkesworth scott the first volume of the miscellanies of 1728 and the second volume of the miscellanies of 1745 in the original edition and in the reprints published to the time of faulkners collected edition the title reads a letter to a young gentleman etc  ts     a   letter   to a   young gentleman   lately enterd into   holy orders  by a person of quality  it is certainly known that the following treatise was writ in ireland by the reverend dr swift dean of st patricks in that kingdom   dublin january the 9th 171920  sir  although it was against my knowledge or advice that you entered into holy orders under the present dispositions of mankind toward the church yet since it is now supposed too late to recede at least according to the general practice and opinion i cannot forbear offering my thoughts to you upon this new condition of life you are engaged in  i could heartily wish that the circumstances of your fortune had enabled you to have continued some years longer in the university at least till you were ten years standing to have laid in a competent stock of human learning and some knowledge in divinity before you attempted to appear in the world for i cannot but lament the common course which at least nine in ten of those who enter into the ministry are obliged to run when they have taken a degree and are consequently grown a burden to their friends who now think themselves fully discharged they get into orders as soon as they can upon which i shall make no remarks first solicit a readership and if they be very fortunate arrive in time to a curacy here in town or else are sent to be assistants in the country where they probably continue several years many of them their whole lives with thirty or forty pounds ayear for their support till some bishop who happens to be not overstocked with relations or attached to favourites or is content to supply his diocese without colonies from england bestows upon them some inconsiderable benefice when it is odds they are already encumbered with a numerous family i should be glad to know what intervals of life such persons can possibly set apart for the improvement of their minds or which way they could be furnished with books the library they brought with them from their college being usually not the most numerous or judiciously chosen if such gentlemen arrive to be great scholars it must i think be either by means supernatural or by a method altogether out of any road yet known to the learned but i conceive the fact directly otherwise and that many of them lose the greatest part of the small pittance they receive at the university  i take it for granted that you intend to pursue the beaten track and are already desirous to be seen in a pulpit only i hope you will think it proper to pass your quarantine among some of the desolate churches five miles round this town where you may at least learn to read and to speak before you venture to expose your parts in a city congregation not that these are better judges but because if a man must needs expose his folly it is more safe and discreet to do so before few witnesses and in a scattered neighbourhood and you will do well if you can prevail upon some intimate and judicious friend to be your constant hearer and allow him with the utmost freedom to give you notice of whatever he shall find amiss either in your voice or gesture for want of which early warning many clergymen continue defective and sometimes ridiculous to the end of their lives neither is it rare to observe among excellent and learned divines a certain ungracious manner or an unhappy tone of voice which they never have been able to shake off  i should likewise have been glad if you had applied yourself a little more to the study of the english language than i fear you have done the neglect whereof is one of the most general defects among the scholars of this kingdom who seem not to have the least conception of a style but run on in a flat kind of phraseology often mingled with barbarous terms and expressions peculiar to the nation neither do i perceive that any person either finds or acknowledges his wants upon this head or in the least desires to have them supplied proper words in proper places make the true definition of a style but this would require too ample a disquisition to be now dwelt on however i shall venture to name one or two faults which are easy to be remedied with a very small portion of abilities  the first is the frequent use of obscure terms which by the women are called hard words and by the better sort of vulgar fine language than which i do not know a more universal inexcusable and unnecessary mistake among the clergy of all distinctions but especially the younger practitioners i have been curious enough to take a list of several hundred words in a sermon of a new beginner which not one of his hearers among a hundred could possibly understand neither can i easily call to mind any clergyman of my own acquaintance who is wholly exempt from this error although many of them agree with me in the dislike of the thing but i am apt to put myself in the place of the vulgar and think many words difficult or obscure which they will not allow to be so because those words are obvious to scholars i believe the method observed by the famous lord falkland1 in some of his writings would not be an ill one for young divines i was assured by an old person of quality who knew him well that when he doubted whether a word was perfectly intelligible or no he used to consult one of his ladys chambermaids not the waitingwoman because it was possible she might be conversant in romances and by her judgment was guided whether to receive or reject it and if that great person thought such a caution necessary in treatises offered to the learned world it will be sure at least as proper in sermons where the meanest hearer is supposed to be concerned and where very often a ladys chambermaid may be allowed to equal half the congregation both as to quality and understanding but i know not how it comes to pass that professors in most arts and sciences are generally the worst qualified to explain their meanings to those who are not of their tribe a common farmer shall make you understand in three words that his foot is out of joint or his collarbone broken wherein a surgeon after a hundred terms of art if you are not a scholar shall leave you to seek it is frequently the same case in law physic and even many of the meaner arts  footnote 1 lucius cary second viscount falkland 16101643 who was killed at the battle of newbury in the great civil war was a generous patron of learning and of the literary men of his day he was himself a fine scholar and able writer clarendon has recorded his character in the seventh book of his history of the great rebellion a person of such prodigious parts of learning and knowledge of that inimitable sweetness and delight in conversation of so flowing and obliging an humanity and goodness to mankind that if there were no other brand upon this odious and accursed civil war than that single loss it must be infamous and execrable to all posterity falkland has been made the hero of a romance by lord lytton t s    and upon this account it is that among hard words i number likewise those which are peculiar to divinity as it is a science because i have observed several clergymen otherwise little fond of obscure terms yet in their sermons very liberal of those which they find in ecclesiastical writers as if it were our duty to understand them which i am sure it is not and i defy the greatest divine to produce any law either of god or man which obliges me to comprehend the meaning of omniscience omnipresence ubiquity attribute beatific vision with a thousand others so frequent in pulpits any more than that of eccentric idiosyncracy entity and the like i believe i may venture to insist farther that many terms used in holy writ particularly by st paul might with more discretion be changed into plainer speech except when they are introduced as part of a quotation2  footnote 2 swift refers to this point in his thoughts on religion and regrets that the explanation of matters of doctrine which st paul expressed in the current eastern vocabulary should have been perpetuated in terms founded on the same terminology t s   i am the more earnest in this matter because it is a general complaint and the justest in the world for a divine has nothing to say to the wisest congregation of any parish in this kingdom which he may not express in a manner to be understood by the meanest among them and this assertion must be true or else god requires from us more than we are able to perform however not to contend whether a logician might possibly put a case that would serve for an exception i will appeal to any man of letters whether at least nineteen in twenty of those perplexing words might not be changed into easy ones such as naturally first occur to ordinary men and probably did so at first to those very gentlemen who are so fond of the former  we are often reproved by divines from the pulpits on account of our ignorance in things sacred and perhaps with justice enough however it is not very reasonable for them to expect that common men should understand expressions which are never made use of in common life no gentleman thinks it safe or prudent to send a servant with a message without repeating it more than once and endeavouring to put it into terms brought down to the capacity of the bearer yet after all this care it is frequent for servants to mistake and sometimes to occasion misunderstandings among friends although the common domestics in some gentlemens families have more opportunities of improving their minds than the ordinary sort of tradesmen  it is usual for clergymen who are taxed with this learned defect to quote dr tillotson and other famous divines in their defence without considering the difference between elaborate discourses upon important occasions delivered to princes or parliaments written with a view of being made public and a plain sermon intended for the middle or lower size of people neither do they seem to remember the many alterations additions and expungings made by great authors in those treatises which they prepare for the public besides that excellent prelate abovementioned was known to preach after a much more popular manner in the city congregations and if in those parts of his works he be any where too obscure for the understandings of many who may be supposed to have been his hearers it ought to be numbered among his omissions  the fear of being thought pedants hath been of pernicious consequence to young divines this hath wholly taken many of them off from their severer studies in the university which they have exchanged for plays poems and pamphlets in order to qualify them for teatables and coffeehouses this they usually call polite conversation knowing the world and reading men instead of books these accomplishments when applied to the pulpit appear by a quaint terse florid style rounded into periods and cadences commonly without either propriety or meaning i have listend with my utmost attention for half an hour to an orator of this species without being able to understand much less to carry away one single sentence out of a whole sermon others to shew that their studies have not been confined to sciences or ancient authors will talk in the style of a gaming ordinary and white friars3 when i suppose the hearers can be little edified by the terms palming shuffling biting bamboozling and the like if they have not been sometimes conversant among pickpockets and sharpers and truly as they say a man is known by his company so it should seem that a mans company may be known by his manner of expressing himself either in public assemblies or private conversation  footnote 3 see note on alsatia p 100 t s   it would be endless to run over the several defects of style among us i shall therefore say nothing of the mean and paltry which are usually attended by the fustian much less of the slovenly or indecent two things i will just warn you against the first is the frequency of flat unnecessary epithets and the other is the folly of using old threadbare phrases which will often make you go out of your way to find and apply them are nauseous to rational hearers and will seldom express your meaning as well as your own natural words  although as i have already observed our english tongue is too little cultivated in this kingdom yet the faults are nine in ten owing to affectation and not to the want of understanding when a mans thoughts are clear the properest words will generally offer themselves first and his own judgment will direct him in what order to place them so as they may be best understood where men err against this method it is usually on purpose and to shew their learning their oratory their politeness or their knowledge of the world in short that simplicity without which no human performance can arrive to any great perfection is nowhere more eminently useful than in this  i have been considering that part of oratory which relates to the moving of the passions this i observe is in esteem and practice among some church divines as well as among all the preachers and hearers of the fanatic or enthusiastic strain i will here deliver to you perhaps with more freedom than prudence my opinion upon the point  the two great orators of greece and rome demosthenes and cicero though each of them a leader or as the greeks call it a demagogue in a popular state yet seem to differ in their practice upon this branch of their art the former who had to deal with a people of much more politeness learning and wit laid the greatest weight of his oratory upon the strength of his arguments offered to their understanding and reason whereas tully considered the dispositions of a sincere more ignorant and less mercurial nation by dwelling almost entirely on the pathetic part  but the principal thing to be remembered is that the constant design of both these orators in all their speeches was to drive some one particular point either the condemnation or acquittal of an accused person a persuasive to war the enforcing of a law and the like which was determined upon the spot according as the orators on either side prevailed and here it was often found of absolute necessity to inflame or cool the passions of the audience especially at rome where tully spoke and with whose writings young divines i mean those among them who read old authors are more conversant than with those of demosthenes who by many degrees excelled the other at least as an orator but i do not see how this talent of moving the passions can be of any great use toward directing christian men in the conduct of their lives at least in these northern climates where i am confident the strongest eloquence of that kind will leave few impressions upon any of our spirits deep enough to last till the next morning or rather to the next meal4  footnote 4 swifts own sermons rarely appealed to the emotions they were in his own phrase political pamphlets and aimed at convincing the reason t s   but what hath chiefly put me out of conceit with this moving manner of preaching is the frequent disappointment it meets with i know a gentleman who made it a rule in reading to skip over all sentences where he spied a note of admiration at the end i believe those preachers who abound in epiphonemas5 if they look about them would find one part of their congregation out of countenance and the other asleep except perhaps an old female beggar or two in the aisles who if they be sincere may probably groan at the sound  footnote 5 epiphonema is a figure in rhetoric signifying a sententious kind of exclamation s   nor is it a wonder that this expedient should so often miscarry which requires so much art and genius to arrive at any perfection in it as any man will find much sooner than learn by consulting cicero himself  i therefore entreat you to make use of this faculty if you ever be so unfortunate as to think you have it as seldom and with as much caution as you can else i may probably have occasion to say of you as a great person said of another upon this very subject a lady asked him coming out of church whether it were not a very moving discourse yes said he i was extremely sorry for the man is my friend  if in company you offer something for a jest and nobody second you in your own laughter nor seems to relish what you said you may condemn their taste if you please and appeal to better judgments but in the meantime it must be agreed you make a very indifferent figure and it is at least equally ridiculous to be disappointed in endeavouring to make other folks grieve as to make them laugh  a plain convincing reason may possibly operate upon the mind both of a learned and ignorant hearer as long as they live and will edify a thousand times more than the art of wetting the handkerchiefs of a whole congregation if you were sure to attain it  if your arguments be strong in gods name offer them in as moving a manner as the nature of the subject will properly admit wherein reason and good advice will be your safest guides but beware of letting the pathetic part swallow up the rational for i suppose philosophers have long agreed that passion should never prevail over reason  as i take it the two principal branches of preaching are first to tell the people what is their duty and then to convince them that it is so the topics for both these we know are brought from scripture and reason upon this first i wish it were often practised to instruct the hearers in the limits extent and compass of every duty which requires a good deal of skill and judgment the other branch is i think not so difficult but what i would offer them both is this that it seems to be in the power of a reasonable clergyman if he will be at the pains to make the most ignorant man comprehend what is his duty and to convince him by argument drawn to the level of his understanding that he ought to perform it  but i must remember that my design in this paper was not so much to instruct you in your business either as a clergyman or a preacher as to warn you against some mistakes which are obvious to the generality of mankind as well as to me and we who are hearers may be allowed to have some opportunities in the quality of being standersby only perhaps i may now again transgress by desiring you to express the heads of your divisions in as few and clear words as you possibly can otherwise i and many thousand others will never be able to retain them nor consequently to carry away a syllable of the sermon  i shall now mention a particular wherein your whole body will be certainly against me and the laity almost to a man on my side however it came about i cannot get over the prejudice of taking some little offence at the clergy for perpetually reading their sermons6 perhaps my frequent hearing of foreigners who never made use of notes may have added to my disgust and i cannot but think that whatever is read differs as much from what is repeated without book as a copy does from an original at the same time i am highly sensible what an extreme difficulty it would be upon you to alter this method and that in such a case your sermons would be much less valuable than they are for want of time to improve and correct them i would therefore gladly come to a compromise with you in this matter i knew a clergyman of some distinction who appeared to deliver his sermon without looking into his notes which when i complimented him upon he assured me he could not repeat six lines but his method was to write the whole sermon in a large plain hand with all the forms of margin paragraph marked page and the like then on sunday morning he took care to run it over five or six times which he could do in an hour and when he deliverd it by pretending to turn his face from one side to the other he would in his own expression pick up the lines and cheat his people by making them believe he had it all by heart he farther added that whenever he happened by neglect to omit any of these circumstances the vogue of the parish was our doctor gave us but an indifferent sermon today now among us many clergymen act too directly contrary to this method that from a habit of saving time and paper which they acquired at the university they write in so diminutive a manner with such frequent blots and interlineations that they are hardly able to go on without perpetual hesitations or extemporary expletives and i desire to know what can be more inexcusable than to see a divine and a scholar at a loss in reading his own compositions which it is supposed he has been preparing with much pains and thought for the instruction of his people the want of a little more care in this article is the cause of much ungraceful behaviour you will observe some clergymen with their heads held down from the beginning to the end within an inch of the cushion to read what is hardly legible which besides the untoward manner hinders them from making the best advantage of their voice others again have a trick of popping up and down every moment from their paper to the audience like an idle schoolboy on a repetition day  footnote 6 the custom of reading sermons notes scott seems originally to have arisen in opposition to the practice of dissenters many of whom affected to trust to their inspiration in their extempore harangues t s   let me entreat you therefore to add one halfcrown a year to the article of paper to transcribe your sermons in as large and plain a manner as you can and either make no interlineations or change the whole leaf for we your hearers would rather you should be less correct than perpetually stammering which i take to be one of the worst solecisms in rhetoric and lastly read your sermon once or twice for a few days before you preach it to which you will probably answer some years hence that it was but just finished when the last bell rang to church and i shall readily believe but not excuse you  i cannot forbear warning you in the most earnest manner against endeavouring at wit in your sermons because by the strictest computation it is very near a million to one that you have none and because too many of your calling have consequently made themselves everlastingly ridiculous by attempting it i remember several young men in this town who could never leave the pulpit under half a dozen conceits and this faculty adhered to those gentlemen a longer or shorter time exactly in proportion to their several degrees of dulness accordingly i am told that some of them retain it to this day i heartily wish the brood were at an end  before you enter into the common insufferable cant of taking all occasions to disparage the heathen philosophers i hope you will differ from some of your brethren by first enquiring what those philosophers can say for themselves the system of morality to be gathered out of the writings or sayings of those ancient sages falls undoubtedly very short of that delivered in the gospel and wants besides the divine sanction which our saviour gave to his whatever is further related by the evangelists contains chiefly matters of fact and consequently of faith such as the birth of christ his being the messiah his miracles his death resurrection and ascension none of which can properly come under the appellation of human wisdom being intended only to make us wise unto salvation and therefore in this point nothing can justly be laid to the charge of the philosophers further than that they were ignorant of certain facts that happened long after their death but i am deceived if a better comment could be anywhere collected upon the moral part of the gospel than from the writings of those excellent men even that divine precept of loving our enemies is at large insisted on by plato who puts it as i remember into the mouth of socrates7 and as to the reproach of heathenism i doubt they had less of it than the corrupted jews in whose time they lived for it is a gross piece of ignorance among us to conceive that in those polite and learned ages even persons of any tolerable education much less the wisest philosophers did acknowledge or worship any more than one almighty power under several denominations to whom they allowed all those attributes we ascribe to the divinity and as i take it human comprehension reacheth no further neither did our saviour think it necessary to explain to us the nature of god because i suppose it would be impossible without bestowing on us other faculties than we possess at present but the true misery of the heathen world appears to be what i before mentioned the want of a divine sanction without which the dictates of the philosophers failed in the point of authority and consequently the bulk of mankind lay indeed under a great load of ignorance even in the article of morality but the philosophers themselves did not take the matter in this light it will afford field enough for a divine to enlarge on by showing the advantages which the christian world has over the heathen and the absolute necessity of divine revelation to make the knowledge of the true god and the practice of virtue more universal in the world  footnote 7 this is in the crito of plato where socrates says it is wrong to do harm to our enemies t s   i am not ignorant how much i differ in this opinion from some ancient fathers in the church who arguing against the heathens made it a principal topic to decry their philosophy as much as they could which i hope is not altogether our present case besides it is to be considered that those fathers lived in the decline of literature and in my judgment who should be unwilling to give the least offence appear to be rather most excellent holy persons than of transcendent genius and learning their genuine writings for many of them have extremely suffered by spurious editions are of admirable use for confirming the truth of ancient doctrines and discipline by shewing the state and practice of the primitive church but among such of them as have fallen in my way i do not remember any whose manner of arguing or exhorting i could heartily recommend to the imitation of a young divine when he is to speak from the pulpit perhaps i judge too hastily there being several of them in whose writings i have made very little progress and in others none at all for i perused only such as were recommended to me at a time when i had more leisure and a better disposition to read than have since fallen to my share8  footnote 8 swift must refer here to the years he spent at moor park in the house of sir william temple the tale of a tub however shows that he had not idled his time and that his acquaintance with the writings of the fathers was fairly intimate t s   to return then to the heathen philosophers i hope you will not only give them quarter but make their works a considerable part of your study to these i will venture to add the principal orators and historians and perhaps a few of the poets by the reading of which you will soon discover your mind and thoughts to be enlarged your imagination extended and refined your judgment directed your admiration lessened and your fortitude increased all which advantages must needs be of excellent use to a divine whose duty it is to preach and practise the contempt of human things  i would say something concerning quotations wherein i think you cannot be too sparing except from scripture and the primitive writers of the church as to the former when you offer a text as a proof of an illustration we your hearers expect to be fairly used and sometimes think we have reason to complain especially of you younger divines which makes us fear that some of you conceive you have no more to do than to turn over a concordance and there having found the principal word introduce as much of the verse as will serve your turn though in reality it makes nothing for you i do not altogether disapprove the manner of interweaving texts of scripture through the style of your sermons wherein however i have sometimes observed great instances of indiscretion and impropriety against which i therefore venture to give you a caution  as to quotations from ancient fathers i think they are best brought in to confirm some opinion controverted by those who differ from us in other cases we give you full power to adopt the sentence for your own rather than tell us as st austin excellently observes but to mention modern writers by name or use the phrase of a late excellent prelate of our church and the like is altogether intolerable and for what reason i know not makes every rational hearer ashamed of no better a stamp is your heathen philosopher and famous poet and roman historian at least in common congregations who will rather believe you on your own word than on that of plato or homer  i have lived to see greek and latin almost entirely driven out of the pulpit for which i am heartily glad the frequent use of the latter was certainly a remnant of popery which never admitted scripture in the vulgar language and i wonder that practice was never accordingly objected to us by the fanatics  the mention of quotations puts me in mind of commonplace books which have been long in use by industrious young divines and i hear do still continue so i know they are very beneficial to lawyers and physicians because they are collections of facts or cases whereupon a great part of their several faculties depend of these i have seen several but never yet any written by a clergyman only from what i am informed they generally are extracts of theological and moral sentences drawn from ecclesiastical and other authors reduced under proper heads usually begun and perhaps finished while the collectors were young in the church as being intended for materials or nurseries to stock future sermons you will observe the wise editors of ancient authors when they meet a sentence worthy of being distinguished take special care to have the first word printed in capital letters that you may not overlook it such for example as the inconstancy of fortune the goodness of peace the excellency of wisdom the certainty of death that prosperity makes men insolent and adversity humble and the like eternal truths which every ploughman knows well enough before aristotle or plato were born9  if theological commonplace books be no better filled i think they had better be laid aside and i could wish that men of tolerable intellectuals would rather trust their own natural reason improved by a general conversation with books to enlarge on points which they are supposed already to understand if a rational man reads an excellent author with just application he shall find himself extremely improved and perhaps insensibly led to imitate that authors perfections although in a little time he should not remember one word in the book nor even the subject it handled for books give the same turn to our thoughts and way of reasoning that good and ill company do to our behaviour and conversation without either loading our memories or making us even sensible of the change and particularly i have observed in preaching that no men succeed better than those who trust entirely to the stock or fund of their own reason advanced indeed but not overlaid by commerce with books whoever only reads in order to transcribe wise and shining remarks without entering into the genius and spirit of the author as it is probable he will make no very judicious extract so he will be apt to trust to that collection in all his compositions and be misled out of the regular way of thinking in order to introduce those materials which he has been at the pains to gather and the product of all this will be found a manifest incoherent piece of patchwork  footnote 9 thus in first edition scott and hawkesworth have though he never heard of aristotle or plato ts  some gentlemen abounding in their university erudition are apt to fill their sermons with philosophical terms and notions of the metaphysical or abstracted kind which generally have one advantage to be equally understood by the wise the vulgar and the preacher himself i have been better entertained and more informed by a chapter10 in the pilgrims progress than by a long discourse upon the will and the intellect and simple or complex ideas others again are fond of dilating on matter and motion talk of the fortuitous concourse of atoms of theories and phenomena directly against the advice of st paul who yet appears to have been conversant enough in those kinds of studies  footnote 10 thus in first edition scott and hawkesworth have a few pages instead of a chapter t s   i do not find that you are anywhere directed in the canons or articles to attempt explaining the mysteries of the christian religion and indeed since providence intended there should be mysteries i do not see how it can be agreeable to piety orthodoxy or good sense to go about such a work for to me there seems to be a manifest dilemma in the case if you explain them they are mysteries no longer if you fail you have laboured to no purpose what i should think most reasonable and safe for you to do upon this occasion is upon solemn days to deliver the doctrine as the church holds it and confirm it by scripture for my part having considered the matter impartially i can see no great reason which those gentlemen you call the freethinkers can have for their clamour against religious mysteries since it is plain they were not invented by the clergy to whom they bring no profit nor acquire any honour for every clergyman is ready either to tell us the utmost he knows or to confess that he does not understand them neither is it strange that there should be mysteries in divinity as well as in the commonest operations of nature  and here i am at a loss what to say upon the frequent custom of preaching against atheism deism freethinking and the like as young divines are particularly fond of doing especially when they exercise their talent in churches frequented by persons of quality which as it is but an ill compliment to the audience so i am under some doubt whether it answers the end  because persons under those imputations are generally no great frequenters of churches and so the congregation is but little edified for the sake of three or four fools who are past grace neither do i think it any part of prudence to perplex the minds of welldisposed people with doubts which probably would never have otherwise come into their heads but i am of opinion and dare be positive in it that not one in an hundred of those who pretend to be freethinkers are really so in their hearts for there is one observation which i never knew to fail and i desire you will examine it in the course of your life that no gentleman of a liberal education and regular in his morals did ever profess himself a freethinker where then are these kind of people to be found among the worst part of the soldiery made up of pages younger brothers of obscure families and others of desperate fortunes or else among idle town fops and now and then a drunken squire of the country therefore nothing can be plainer than that ignorance and vice are two ingredients absolutely necessary in the composition of those you generally call freethinkers who in propriety of speech are no thinkers at all and since i am in the way of it pray consider one thing farther as young as you are you cannot but have already observed what a violent run there is among too many weak people against university education be firmly assured that the whole cry is made up by those who were either never sent to a college or through their irregularities and stupidity never made the least improvement while they were there i have at least11 forty of the latter sort now in my eye several of them in this town whose learning manners temperance probity goodnature and politics are all of a piece others of them in the country oppressing their tenants tyrannizing over the neighbourhood cheating the vicar talking nonsense and getting drunk at the sessions it is from such seminaries as these that the world is provided with the several tribes and denominations of freethinkers who in my judgment are not to be reformed by arguments offered to prove the truth of the christian religion because reasoning will never make a man correct an ill opinion which by reasoning he never acquired for in the course of things men always grow vicious before they become unbelievers but if you would once convince the town or country profligate by topics drawn from the view of their own quiet reputation health and advantage their infidelity would soon drop off this i confess is no easy task because it is almost in a literal sense to fight with beasts now to make it clear that we are to look for no other original of this infidelity whereof divines so much complain it is allowed on all hands that the people of england are more corrupt in their morals than any other nation at this day under the sun and this corruption is manifestly owing to other causes both numerous and obvious much more than to the publication of irreligious books which indeed are but the consequence of the former for all the writers against christianity since the revolution have been of the lowest rank among men in regard to literature wit and good sense and upon that account wholly unqualified to propagate heresies unless among a people already abandoned  footnote 11 scott and hawkesworth print above forty t s  in an age where everything disliked by those who think with the majority is called disaffection it may perhaps be ill interpreted when i venture to tell you that this universal depravation of manners is owing to the perpetual bandying of factions among us for thirty years past when without weighing the motives of justice law conscience or honour every man adjusts his principles to those of the party he hath chosen and among whom he may best find his own account but by reason of our frequent vicissitudes men who were impatient of being out of play have been forced to recant or at least to reconcile their former tenets with every new system of administration add to this that the old fundamental custom of annual parliaments being wholly laid aside and elections growing chargeable since gentlemen found that their country seats brought them in less than a seat in the house the voters that is to say the bulk of the common people have been universally seduced into bribery perjury drunkenness malice and slanders  not to be further tedious or rather invidious these are a few among other causes which have contributed to the ruin of our morals and consequently to the contempt of religion for imagine to yourself if you please a landed youth whom his mother would never suffer to look into a book for fear of spoiling his eyes got into parliament and observing all enemies to the clergy heard with the utmost applause what notions he must imbibe how readily he will join in the cry what an esteem he will conceive of himself and what a contempt he must entertain not only for his vicar at home but for the whole order  i therefore again conclude that the trade of infidelity hath been taken up only for an expedient to keep in countenance that universal corruption of morals which many other causes first contributed to introduce and to cultivate and thus mr hobbes saying upon reason may be much more properly applied to religion that if religion will be against a man a man will be against religion though after all i have heard a profligate offer much stronger arguments against paying his debts than ever he was known to do against christianity indeed the reason was because in that juncture he happened to be closer pressed by the bailiff than the parson  ignorance may perhaps be the mother of superstition but experience hath not proved it to be so of devotion for christianity always made the most easy and quickest progress in civilized countries i mention this because it is affirmed that the clergy are in most credit where ignorance prevails and surely this kingdom would be called the paradise of clergymen if that opinion were true for which they instance england in the times of popery but whoever knows anything of three or four centuries before the reformation will find the little learning then stirring was more equally divided between the english clergy and laity than it is at present there were several famous lawyers in that period whose writings are still in the highest repute and some historians and poets who were not of the church12 whereas nowadays our education is so corrupted that you will hardly find a young person of quality with the least tincture of knowledge at the same time that many of the clergy were never more learned or so scurvily treated here among us at least a man of letters out of the three professions is almost a prodigy and those few who have preserved any rudiments of learning are except perhaps one or two smatterers the clergys friends to a man and i dare appeal to any clergyman in this kingdom whether the greatest dunce in the parish be not always the most proud wicked fraudulent and intractable of his flock  footnote 12 what swift calls learning was in his day the property so to speak of professional men such as divines lawyers and university teachers the common man was too poor or too much taxed to acquire it the aristocrat often too lazy or too fond of pleasureseeking to bother about it the prereformation days to which swift refers could boast such men as fabyan hall chaucer gower and caxton as well as lord berners sir thomas more and lydgate who were not in any sense professional men ts  i think the clergy have almost given over perplexing themselves and their hearers with abstruse points of predestination election and the like at least it is time they should and therefore i shall not trouble you further upon this head  i have now said all i could think convenient with relation to your conduct in the pulpit your behaviour in life13 is another scene upon which i shall readily offer you my thoughts if you appear to desire them from me by your approbation of what i have here written if not i have already troubled you too much  footnote 13 scott and hawkesworth print your behaviour in the world the above is the reading of the first edition t s    i am sir   your affectionate   friend and servant   ab    january 9th   171920                             some arguments against enlarging  the power of bishops in  letting of leases   note  the years between that which saw the publication of the drapier letters and that which rang with the fame of gullivers travels were busy fighting years for swift apart from his vigorous championship of the test and his war against the dissenters he espoused the cause of the inferior clergy of his own church as against the bishops the business of filling the vacant sees of ireland had degenerated into what we should now call jobbery and during the period of sir robert walpoles administration it was rarely that an irishman was selected on any question therefore which affected the welfare of the lower clergy it will at once be seen that the lords spiritual sitting in the irish upper house would find little difficulty in coming to a solution that the solution should also be one which only increased the clergys difficulties might be expected from a body which aimed chiefly at acquiring wealth and power for itself  in the reign of charles i an act was passed prohibiting all bishops and other ecclesiastical corporations from setting their lands for above the term of twentyone years the rent reserved to be half the real value of such lands at the time they were set as swift points out about the time of the reformation a trade was carried on by the popish bishops who felt that their terms of office would be short and who consequently to get what benefit they could while in office made long leases and feefarms of great part of their lands reserving very inconsiderable rents sometimes only a chiefry it was owing to a continuance in this traffic by the bishops when they became protestants and to a recognition of the injustice of such alienation that the legislature passed the act in 1723 however an attempt was made for its repeal swift was not the man to permit the bishops to have their way if he could help it his opinion of irish bishops is well known no blame he said rested with the court for these appointments excellent and moral men had been selected upon every occasion of vacancy but it unfortunately happened that as these worthy divines crossed hounslow heath on their way to ireland to take possession of their bishoprics they have been regularly robbed and murdered by the highwaymen frequenting that common who seize upon their robes and patents come over to ireland and are consecrated bishops in their stead to prevent therefore the encroachments of such individuals he wrote this tract in which he clearly demonstrates the justice and salutariness of charless act his contention as monck mason points out history of st patricks cathedral p 392 note 1 is confirmed by all writers upon the subject and quotes from cartes life of james duke of ormond where it is stated that the bishoprics in ireland had the greatest part of them been depauperated in the change of religion by absolute grants and long leases made generally by the popish bishops that conformedsome of them not able to maintain a bishop several were by these means reduced to £50 a year as waterford kilfenora and others and some to five marks as cloyne and kilmacduagh to swift is largely due the fact that the house of commons when they received the bill from the lords threw it out  scott in his note on this pamphlet amended from one by lord orrery takes his usual course when considering swifts attitude of opposition he implies a motive or prejudice in his opinion swift considered the bill for the repeal of charless act an indirect mode of gratifying the existing bishops whom he did not regard with peculiar respect or complacency at the expense of the church establishment and that therefore the spirit of his opposition is in this instance peculiarly caustic as a matter of fact the spirit of swifts opposition was always peculiarly caustic in this case no more so than in any other but to imply that his motive was a self gratifying one only is to treat swift unfairly if the bishops required an example as to how they should deal with their lands they could easily have found one in swift himself in all the renewals of the leases of the deanery lands swift never sought his own immediate advantage his terms were based on the consideration that the lands were his only in trust for a successor to take one instance only the instance of the parish of kilberry in county kildare cited by monck mason p 27 note h in 1695 the rent of this parish was reserved at £100 english sterling in 1717 swift raised this rent to £150 in 1731 to £170 and in 1741 to £200 per annum with a proportionable loss of fine upon each occasion  the tract is dated october 21st 1723 but as i have not come across a copy of the original separate issue i have based the text on that given by faulkner vol iv 1735 and the title page here reproduced is from that edition the fifth volume of miscellanies also issued in 1735 contains this tract and i have compared the texts of the two the notes given in scotts edition are in the main altered from faulkners edition  ts     some   arguments   against enlarging the   power of bishops   in letting of   leases   with   remarks on some queries   lately published  mibi credite major haereditas venit unicuique vestraem in iisdem bonis ae jure  ae legibus quam ab iis ae quibus illa ipsa bona relicta sunt  cicero pro a caecina  written in the year 1723  printed in the year mdccxxxiii   in handling this subject i shall proceed wholly upon the supposition that those of our party who profess themselves members of the church established and under the apostolical government of bishops do desire the continuance and transmission of it to posterity at least in as good a condition as it is at present because as this discourse is not calculated for dissenters of any kind so neither will it suit the talk or sentiments of those persons who with the denomination of churchmen are oppressors of the inferior clergy and perpetually quarrelling at the great incomes of the bishops which is a traditional cant delivered down from former times and continued with great reason although it be now near 200 years since almost three parts in four of the church revenues have been taken from the clergy besides the spoils that have been gradually made ever since of glebes and other lands by the confusion of times the fraud of encroaching neighbours or the power of oppressors too great to be encountered  about the time of the reformation many popish bishops of this kingdom knowing they must have been soon ejected if they would not change their religion made long leases and feefarms of great part of their lands reserving very inconsiderable rents sometimes only a chiefry by a power they assumed directly contrary to many ancient canons yet consistent enough with the common law this trade held on for many years after the bishops became protestants and some of their names are still remembered with infamy on account of enriching their families by such sacrilegious alienations by these means episcopal revenues were so low reduced that three or four sees were often united to make a tolerable competency for some remedy to this evil king james the first by a bounty that became a good christian prince bestowed several forfeited lands on the northern bishoprics but in all other parts of the kingdom the church continued still in the same distress and poverty some of the sees hardly possessing enough to maintain a country vicar about the middle of king charles the firsts reign the legislature here thought fit to put a stop at least to any farther alienations and so a law was enacted prohibiting all bishops and other ecclesiastical corporations from setting their lands for above the term of twentyone years the rent reserved to be one half of the real value of such lands at the time they were set without which condition the lease to be void  soon after the restoration of king charles the second the parliament taking into consideration the miserable estate of the church certain lands by way of augmentation were granted to eight bishops in the act of settlement and confirmed in the act of explanation of which bounty as i remember three sees were in a great measure defeated but by what accidents it is not here of any importance to relate  this at present is the condition of the church in ireland with regard to episcopal revenues which i have thus briefly and perhaps imperfectly deduced for some information to those whose thoughts do not lead them to such considerations  by virtue of the statute already mentioned under king charles the first limiting ecclesiastical bodies to the term of twentyone years under the reserved rent of half real value the bishops have had some share in the gradual rise of lands without which they could not have been supported with any common decency that might become their station it is above eighty years since the passing of that act the see of meath one of the best in the kingdom was then worth about £400 per annum the poorer ones in the same proportion if this were their present condition i cannot conceive how they would have been able to pay for their patents or buy their robes but this will certainly be the condition of their successors if such a bill should pass as they say is now intended which i will suppose and believe many persons who may give a vote for it are not aware of  however this is the act which is now attempted to be repealed or at least eluded some are for giving bishops leave to let feefarms others would allow them to let leases for lives and the most moderate would repeal that clause by which the bishops are bound to let their lands at half value  the reasons for the rise of value in lands are of two kinds of the first kind are long peace and settlement after the devastations of war plantations improvements of bad soil recovery of bogs and marshes advancement of trade and manufactures increase of inhabitants encouragement of agriculture and the like  but there is another reason for the rise of land more gradual constant and certain which will have its effects in countries that are very far from flourishing in any of the advantages i have just mentioned i mean the perpetual decrease in the value of gold and silver i shall discourse upon these two different kinds with a view towards the bill now attempted  as to the first i cannot see how this kingdom is at any height of improvement while four parts in five of the plantations for 30 years past have been real disimprovements nine in ten of the quickset hedges being ruined for want of care or skill and as to forest trees they being often taken out of woods and planted in single rows on the tops of ditches it is impossible they should grow to be of use beauty or shelter neither can it be said that the soil of ireland is improved to its full height while so much lies all winter under water and the bogs made almost desperate by the ill cutting of the turf there hath indeed been some little improvement in the manufactures of linen and woollen although very short of perfection but our trade was never in so low a condition and as to agriculture of which all wise nations have been so tender the desolation made in the country by engrossing graziers and the great yearly importation of corn from england are lamentable instances under what discouragement it lies  but notwithstanding all these mortifications i suppose there is no wellwisher to his country without a little hope that in time the kingdom may be on a better foot in some of the articles above mentioned but it would be hard if ecclesiastical bodies should be the only persons excluded from any share in public advantages which yet can never happen without a greater share of profit to their tenants if god sends rain equally upon the just and the unjust why should those who wait at his altars and are instructors of the people be cut off from partaking in the general benefits of law or of nature  but as this way of reasoning may seem to bear a more favourable eye to the clergy than perhaps will suit with the present disposition or fashion of the age i shall therefore dwell more largely upon the second reason for the rise of land which is the perpetual decrease of the value of gold and silver  this may be observed from the course of the roman history above two thousand years before those inexhaustible silver mines of potosi were known the value of an obolus and of every other coin between the time of romulus and that of augustus gradually sunk about five parts in six as appears by several passages out of the best authors and yet the prodigious wealth of that state did not arise from the increase of bullion in the world by the discovery of new mines but from a much more accidental cause which was the spreading of their conquests and thereby importing into rome and italy the riches of the east and west  when the seat of empire was removed to constantinople the tide of money flowed that way without ever returning and was scattered in asia but when that mighty empire was overthrown by the northern people such a stop was put to all trade and commerce that vast sums of money were buried to escape the plundering of the conquerors and what remained was carried off by those ravagers  it were no difficult matter to compute the value of money in england during the saxon reigns but the monkish and other writers since the conquest have put that matter in a clearer light by the several accounts they have given us of the value of corn and cattle in years of dearth and plenty every one knows that king johns whole portion before he came to the crown was but five thousand pounds without a foot of land  i have likewise seen the stewards accounts of an ancient noble family in england written in latin between three and four hundred years ago with the several prices of wine and victuals to confirm my observations  i have been at the trouble of computing as others have done the different values of money for about four hundred years past henry duke of lancaster who lived about that period founded an hospital in leicester for a certain number of old men charging his lands with a groat a week to each for their maintenance which is to this day duly paid them in those times a penny was equal to tenpence halfpenny and somewhat more than half a farthing in ours which makes about eight ninths difference  this is plain also from the old custom upon many estates in england to let for leases of lives renewable at pleasure where the reserved rent is usually about twelvepence a pound which then was near the half real value and although the fines be not fixed yet the landlord gets altogether not above three shillings in the pound of the worth of his land and the tenants are so wedded to this custom that if the owner suffer three lives to expire none of them will take a lease on other conditions or if he brings in a foreigner who will agree to pay a reasonable rent the other tenants by all manner of injuries will make that foreigner so uneasy that he must be forced to quit the farm as the late earl of bath felt by the experience of above ten thousand pounds loss  the gradual decrease for about two hundred years after was not considerable and therefore i do not rely on the account given by some historians that harry the seventh left behind him eighteen hundred thousand pounds for although the west indies were discovered before his death and although he had the best talents and instruments for exacting of money ever possessed by any prince since the time of vespasian whom he resembled in many particulars yet i conceive that in his days the whole coin of england could hardly amount to such a sum for in the reign of philip and mary sir thomas cokayne of derbyshire 1 the best housekeeper of his quality in the county allowed his lady fifty pounds a year for maintaining the family one pound a year wages to each servant and two pounds to the steward as i was told by a person of quality who had seen the original account of his economy now this sum of fifty pound added to the advantages of a large domain might be equal to about five hundred pounds a year at present or somewhat more than fourfifths  footnote 1 sir thomas cokayne 15191592 known as a professed hunter and not a scholler he was the eldest son of francis cokayne or cockaine of ashbourne derbyshire one of his sons edward was the father of thomas cokayne the lexicographer sir thomas in 1591 published a short treatise of hunting compyled for the delight of noblemen and gentlemen t s  the great plenty of silver in england began in queen elizabeths reign when drake and others took vast quantities of coin and bullion from the spaniards either upon their own american coasts or in their return to spain however so much hath been imported annually from that time to this that the value of money in england and most parts of europe is sunk above one half within the space of an hundred years notwithstanding the great export of silver for about eighty years past to the east indies from whence it never returns but gold being not liable to the same accident and by new discoveries growing every day more plentiful seems in danger of becoming a drug  this hath been the progress of the value of money in former ages and must of necessity continue so for the future without some new invasion of goths and vandals to destroy law property and religion alter the very face of nature and turn the world upside down  i must repeat that what i am to say upon this subject is intended only for the conviction of those among our own party who are true lovers of the church and would be glad it should continue in a tolerable degree of prosperity to the end of the world  the church is supposed to last for ever both in its discipline and doctrine which is a privilege common to every petty corporation who must likewise observe the laws of their foundation if a gentlemans estate which now yields him a thousand pounds a year had been set for ever at the highest value even in the flourishing days of king charles the second would it now amount to above four or five hundred at most what if this had happened two or three hundred years ago would the reserved rent at this day be any more than a small chiefry suppose the revenues of a bishop to have been under the same circumstances could he now be able to perform works of hospitality and charity thus if the revenues of a bishop be limited to a thousand pounds a year how will his successor be in a condition to support his station with decency when the same denomination of money shall not answer an half a quarter or an eighth part of that sum which must unavoidably be the consequence of any bill to elude the limiting act whereby the church was preserved from utter ruin  the same reason holds good in all corporations whatsoever who cannot follow a more pernicious practice than that of granting perpetuities for which many of them smart to this day although the leaders among them are often so stupid as not to perceive it or sometimes so knavish as to find their private account in cheating the community  several colleges in oxford were aware of this growing evil about an hundred years ago and instead of limiting their rents to a certain sum of money prevailed with their tenants to pay the price of so many barrels of corn to be valued as the market went at two seasons as i remember in the year for a barrel of corn is of a real intrinsic value which gold and silver are not and by this invention these colleges have preserved a tolerable subsistence for their fellows and students to this day  the present bishops will indeed be no sufferers by such a bill because their ages considered they cannot expect to see any great decrease in the value of money or at worst they can make it up in the fines which will probably be greater than usual upon the change of leases into feefarms or lives or without the power of obliging their tenants to a real half value and as i cannot well blame them for taking such advantages considering the nature of human kind when the question is only whether the money shall be put into their own or another mans pocket so they will be never excusable before god or man if they do not to the death oppose declare and protest against any such bill as must in its consequences complete the ruin of the church and of their own order in this kingdom  if the fortune of a private person be diminished by the weakness or inadvertency of his ancestors in letting leases for ever at low rents the world lies open to his industry for purchasing of more but the church is barred by a dead hand or if it were otherwise yet the custom of making bequests to it hath been out of practice for almost two hundred years and a great deal directly contrary hath been its fortune  i have been assured by a person of some consequence to whom i am likewise obliged for the account of some other facts already related that the late bishop of salisbury2 the greatest whig of that bench in his days confessed to him that the liberty which bishops in england have of letting leases for lives would in his opinion be one day the ruin of episcopacy there and thought the church in this kingdom happy by the limitation act  footnote 2 dr barnet  and have we not already found the effect of this different proceeding in both kingdoms have not two english prelates quitted their peerage and seats in parliament in a nation of freedom for the sake of a more ample revenue even in this unhappy kingdom rather than lie under the mortification of living below their dignity at home for which however they cannot be justly censured i know indeed some persons who offer as an argument for repealing the limiting bill that it may in future ages prevent the practice of providing this kingdom with bishops from england when the only temptation will be removed and they allege that as things have gone for some years past gentlemen will grow discouraged from sending their sons to the university and from suffering them to enter into holy orders when they are likely to languish under a curacy or small vicarage to the end of their lives but this is all a vain imagination for the decrease in the value of money will equally affect both kingdoms and besides when bishoprics here grow too small to invite over men of credit and consequence they will be left more fully to the disposal of a chief governor who can never fail of some worthless illiterate chaplain fond of a title and precedence thus will that whole bench in an age or two be composed of mean ignorant fawning gownmen humble suppliants and dependants upon the court for a morsel of bread and ready to serve every turn that shall be demanded from them in hopes of getting some commendam tacked to their sees which must then be the trade as it is now too much in england to the great discouragement of the inferior clergy neither is that practice without example among us  it is now about eightyfive years since the passing of that limiting act and there is but one instance in the memory of man of a bishops lease broken upon the plea of not being statutable which in everybodys opinion could have been lost by no other person than he who was then tenant and happened to be very ungracious in his county in the present bishop of meaths3 case that plea did not avail although the lease were notoriously unstatutable the rent reserved being as i have been told not a seventh part of the real value yet the jury upon their oaths very gravely found it to be according to the statute and one of them was heard to say that he would eat his shoes before he would give a verdict for the bishop a very few more have made the same attempt with as little success every bishop and other ecclesiastical body reckon forty pounds in an hundred to be a reasonable half value or if it be only a third part it seldom or never breeds any difference between landlord and tenant but when the rent is from five to nine or ten parts less than the worth the bishop if he consults the good of his see will be apt to expostulate and the tenant if he be an honest man will have some regard to the reasonableness and justice of the demand so as to yield to a moderate advancement rather than engage in a suit where law and equity are directly against him by these means the bishops have been so true to their trusts as to procure some small share in the advancement of rents although it be notorious that they do not receive the third penny fines included of the real value of their lands throughout the kingdom  footnote 3 dr evans a welchman faulkner 1735  i was never able to imagine what inconvenience could accrue to the public by one or two thousand pounds a year in the hands of a protestant bishop any more than of a lay person4 the former generally speaking liveth as piously and hospitably as the other pays his debts as honestly and spends as much of his revenue among his tenants besides if they be his immediate tenants you may distinguish them at first sight by their habits and horses or if you go to their houses by their comfortable way of living but the misfortune is that such immediate tenants generally speaking have others under them and so a third and fourth in subordination till it comes to the welder as they call him who sits at a rackrent and lives as miserably as an irish farmer upon a new lease from a lay landlord but suppose a bishop happens to be avaricious as being composed of the same stuff with other men the consequence to the public is no worse than if he were a squire for he leaves his fortune to his son or near relation who if he be rich enough will never think of entering into the church  footnote 4 this part of the paragraph is to be applied to the period when the whole was written which was in 1723 when several of queen annes bishops were living note in edition of 1761 as amended from the edition of 1735 ts  and as there can be no disadvantage to the public in a protestant country that a man should hold lands as a bishop any more than if he were a temporal person so it is of great advantage to the community where a bishop lives as he ought to do he is bound in conscience to reside in his diocese and by a solemn promise to keep hospitality his estate is spent in the kingdom not remitted to england he keeps the clergy to their duty and is an example of virtue both to them and the people suppose him an ill man yet his very character will withhold him from any great or open exorbitancies but in fact it must be allowed that some bishops of this kingdom within twenty years past have done very signal and lasting acts of public charity great instances whereof are the late5 and present6 primate the lord archbishop of dublin7 that now is who hath left memorials of his bounty in many parts of his province i might add the bishop of raphoe8 and several others not forgetting the late dean of down dr pratt who bestowed one thousand pounds upon the university which foundation that i may observe by the way if the bill proposed should pass would be in the same circumstances with the bishops nor ever able again to advance the stipends of the fellows and students as lately they found it necessary to do the determinate sum appointed by the statute for commons being not half sufficient by the fall of money to afford necessary sustenance but the passing of such a bill must put an end to all ecclesiastical beneficence for the time to come and whether this will be supplied by those who are to reap the benefit better than it hath been done by the grantees of impropriate tithes who received them upon the old church conditions of keeping hospitality it will be easy to conjecture  footnote 5 dr marsh  footnote 6 dr lindsay  footnote 7 dr king  footnote 8 dr forster  to allege that passing such a bill would be a good encouragement to improve bishops lands is a great error is it not the general method of landlords to wait the expiration of a lease and then cant9 their lands to the highest bidder and what should hinder the same course to be taken in church leases when the limitation is removed of paying half the real value to the bishop in riding through the country how few improvements do we see upon the estates of laymen farther than about their own domains to say the truth it is a great misfortune as well to the public as to the bishops themselves that their lands are generally let to lords and great squires who in reason were never designed to be tenants and therefore may naturally murmur at the payment of rent as a subserviency they were not born to if the tenants to the church were honest farmers they would pay their fines and rents with cheerfulness improve their lands and thank god they were to give but a moderate half value for what they held i have heard a man of a thousand pounds a year talk with great contempt of bishops leases as being on a worse foot than the rest of his estate and he had certainly reason my answer was that such leases were originally intended only for the benefit of industrious husbandmen who would think it a great blessing to be so provided for instead of having his farm screwed up to the height not eating one comfortable meal in a year nor able to find shoes for his children  footnote 9 to cant means to call for bidders at an auction sale probably derived from the o french cant  quantum  how much ts  i know not any advantage that can accrue by such a bill except the preventing of perjury in jurymen and false dealing in tenants which is a remedy like that of giving my money to an highwayman before he attempts to take it by force and so i shall be sure to prevent the sin of robbery  i had wrote thus far and thought to have put an end when a bookseller sent me a small pamphlet entitled the case of the laity with some queries full of the strongest malice against the clergy that i have anywhere met with since the reign of toland and others of that tribe these kinds of advocates do infinite mischief to our good cause by giving grounds to the unjust reproaches of tories and jacobites who charge us with being enemies to the church if i bear an hearty unfeigned loyalty to his majesty king george and the house of hanover not shaken in the least by the hardships we lie under which never can be imputable to so gracious a prince if i sincerely abjure the pretender and all popish successors if i bear a due veneration to the glorious memory of the late king william who preserved these kingdoms from popery and slavery with the expense of his blood and hazard of his life and lastly if i am for a proper indulgence to all dissenters i think nothing more can be reasonably demanded of me as a whig and that my political catechism is full and complete but whoever under the shelter of that party denomination and of many great professions of loyalty would destroy or undermine or injure the church established i utterly disown him and think he ought to choose another name of distinction for himself and his adherents i came into the cause upon other principles which by the grace of god i mean to preserve as long as i live shall we justify the accusations of our adversaries hoc ithacus velitthe tories and jacobites will behold us with a malicious pleasure determined upon the ruin of our friends for is not the present set of bishops almost entirely of that number as well as a great majority of the principal clergy and a short time will reduce the whole by vacancies upon death  an impartial reader if he pleases to examine what i have already said will easily answer the bold queries in the pamphlet i mentioned he will be convinced that the reason still strongly exists for which that limiting law was enacted a reasonable man will wonder where can be the insufferable grievance that an ecclesiastical landlord should expect a moderate or third part value in rent for his lands when his title is at least as ancient and as legal as that of a layman who is yet but seldom guilty of giving such beneficial bargains has the nation been thrown into confusion and have many poor families been ruined by rackrents paid for the lands of the church does the nation cry out to have a law that must in time send their bishops abegging but god be thanked the clamour of enemies to the church is not yet the cry and i hope will never prove the voice of the nation the clergy i conceive will hardly allow that the people maintain them any more than in the sense that all landlords whatsoever are maintained by the people such assertions as these and the insinuations they carry along with them proceed from principles which cannot be avowed by those who are for preserving the happy constitution in church and state whoever were the proposers of such queries it might have provoked a bold writer to retaliate perhaps with more justice than prudence by shewing at whose door the grievance lies and that the bishops at least are not to answer for the poverty of tenants  to gratify this great reformer who enlarges the episcopal rentroll almost one half let me suppose that all the church lands in the kingdom were thrown up to the laity would the tenants in such a case sit easier in their rents than they do now or would the money be equally spent in the kingdom no the farmer would be screwed up to the utmost penny by the agents and stewards of absentees and the revenues employed in making a figure at london to which city a full third part of the whole income of ireland is annually returned to answer that single article of maintenance for irish landlords  another of his quarrels is against pluralities and nonresidence as to the former it is a word of ill name but not well understood the clergy having been stripped of the greatest part of their revenues the glebes being generally lost the tithes in the hands of laymen the churches demolished and the country depopulated in order to preserve a face of christianity it was necessary to unite small vicarages sufficient to make a tolerable maintenance for a minister the profit of ten or a dozen of these unions do seldom amount to above eighty or an hundred pounds a year if there be a very few dignitaries whose preferments are perhaps more liable to this accusation it is to be supposed they may be favourites of the time or persons of superior merit for whom there hath ever been some indulgence in all governments  as to nonresidence i believe there is no christian country upon earth where the clergy have less to answer for upon that article i am confident there are not ten clergymen in the kingdom who properly speaking can be termed nonresidents for surely we are not to reckon in that number those who for want of glebes are forced to retire to the nearest neighbouring village for a cabin to put their heads in the leading man of the parish when he makes the greatest clamour being least disposed to accommodate the minister with an acre of ground and indeed considering the difficulties the clergy lie under upon this head it hath been frequent matter of wonder to me how they are able to perform that part of their duty as well as they do  there is a noble author10 who hath lately addressed to the house of commons an excellent discourse for the encouragement of agriculture full of most useful hints which i hope that honourable assembly will consider as they deserve i am not a stranger to his lordship and excepting in what relates to the church there are few persons with whose opinions i am better pleased to agree and am therefore grieved when i find him charging the inconveniencies in the payment of tithes upon the clergy and their proctors his lordship is above considering a very known and vulgar truth that the meanest farmer hath all manner of advantages against the most powerful clergyman by whom it is impossible he can be wronged although the minister were ever so evil disposed the whole system of teasing perplexing and defrauding the proctor or his master being as well known to every ploughman as the reaping or sowing of his corn and much more artfully practised besides the leading man in the parish must have his tithes at his own rate which is hardly ever above one quarter of the value and i have heard it computed by many skilful observers whose interest was not concerned that the clergy did not receive throughout the kingdom one half of what the laws have made their due  footnote 10 the late lord molesworth  as to his lordships discontent against the bishops courts i shall not interpose further than in venturing my private opinion that the clergy would be very glad to recover their just dues by a more short decisive and compulsive method than such a cramped and limited jurisdiction will allow  his lordship is not the only person disposed to give the clergy the honour of being the sole encouragers of all new improvements if hops hemp flax and twenty things more are to be planted the clergy alone must reward the industrious farmer by abatement of the tithe what if the owner of nine parts in ten would please to abate proportionably in his rent for every acre thus improved would not a man just dropped from the clouds upon a full hearing judge the demand to be at least as reasonable  i believe no man will dispute his lordships title to his estate nor will i the jus divinum of tithes which he mentions with some emotion i suppose the affirmative would be of little advantage to the clergy for the same reason that a maxim in law hath more weight in the world than an article of faith and yet i think there may be such a thing as sacrilege because it is frequently mentioned by greek and roman authors as well as described in holy writ this i am sure of that his lordship would at any time excuse a parliament for not concerning itself in his properties without his own consent  the observations i have made upon his lordships discourse have not i confess been altogether proper to my subject however since he hath been pleased therein to offer some proposals to the house of commons with relation to the clergy i hope he will excuse me for differing from him which proceeds from his own principle the desire of defending liberty and property that he hath so strenuously and constantly maintained  but the other writer openly declares for a law empowering the bishops to set feefarms and says whoever intimates that they will deny their consent to such a reasonable law which the whole nation cries for are enemies to them and the church whether this be his real opinion or only a strain of mirth and irony the matter is not much however my sentiments are so directly contrary to his that i think whoever impartially reads and considers what i have written upon this argument hath either no regard for the church established under the hierarchy of bishops or will never consent to any law that shall repeal or elude the limiting clause relating to the real half value contained in the act of parliament decimo caroli for the preservation of the inheritance rights and profits of lands belonging to the church and persons ecclesiastical which was grounded upon reasons that do still and must for ever subsist  october 21 1723                             reasons humbly offered  to his grace  william lord archbishop of  dublin c  the humble representation of the clergy  of the city of dublin   note  scotts text has been collated with that given in volume eight of the quarto edition of swifts works 1765 in that edition the title is given as the representation of the clergy of dublin c  ts     reasons humbly offered to his   grace william lord archbishop   of dublin c1   the humble representation of the clergy   of the city of dublin  footnote 1 william king dd 16501729 archbishop of dublin was born in antrim and educated at a school at dungannon and trinity college dublin he was installed dean of st patricks in 16889 february 1st for his open espousal of the prince of orange he was confined to the castle and suffered many indignities in 16901 january 9th he was promoted to the see of derry his conduct through life was that of an ardent irish protestant patriot he fought against sectarianism roman catholicism and the interference of the english parliament in irish affairs he opposed the toleration bill and protested against the act confirming the articles of limerick his relationship with swift became close when he sent the vicar of laracor to london to obtain for the irish clergy the restoration of the firstfruits and twentieth parts but it was a relationship never cemented by feelings warmer than those of esteem king acknowledged the ability of swift but found him ambitious and overbearingly proud throughout life he remained a consistent high churchman and a strenuous supporter of the rights of the church in ireland but his attempt in 1727 to interfere with the affairs of the deanery of st patricks brought down upon him swifts wrath and an open quarrel ensued which was partly softened by the archbishop retiring from the matter and tacitly acknowledging swifts right  kings chief published work is his treatise de origine mali published in 1702 and received with respectful consideration by the eminent thinkers of the day he wrote other minor works but none of any distinguished merit he succeeded narcissus marsh as archbishop of dublin in 17023 march 11th swifts letters to king during the formers embassy on the matter of firstfruits make a most interesting chapter in the six volumes which scott devotes to swifts correspondence t s  jan 1724  my lord  your grace having been pleased to communicate to us a certain brief by letters patents for the relief of one charles mcarthy whose house in collegegreen dublin was burnt by an accidental fire and having desired us to consider of the said brief and give our opinions thereof to your grace  we the clergy of the city of dublin in compliance with your graces desire and with great acknowledgments for your paternal tenderness towards us having maturely considered the said brief by letters patents compared the several parts of it with what is enjoined us by the rubric which is confirmed by act of parliament and consulted persons skilled in the laws of the church do in the names of ourselves and of the rest of our brethren the clergy of the diocese of dublin most humbly represent to your grace  first that by this brief your grace is required and commanded to recommend and command all the parsons vicars c to advance so great an act of charity  we shall not presume to determine how far your grace may be commanded by the said brief but we humbly conceive that the clergy of your diocese cannot by any law now in being be commanded by your grace to advance the said act of charity any other ways than by reading the said brief in our several churches as prescribed by the rubric  secondly whereas it is said in the said brief that the parsons vicars c upon the first lords day or opportunity after the receipt of the copy of the said brief shall deliberately and affectionately publish and declare the tenor thereof to his majestys subjects and earnestly persuade exhort and stir them up to contribute freely and cheerfully towards the relief of the said sufferer  we do not comprehend what is meant by the word opportunity we never do preach upon any day except the lords day or some solemn days legally appointed neither is it possible for the strongest constitution among us to obey this command which includes no less than a whole sermon upon any other opportunity than when our people are met together in the church and to perform this work in every house where the parishes are very populous consisting sometimes here in town of 900 or 1000 houses would take up the space of a year although we should preach in two families every day and almost as much time in the country where the parishes are of large extent the roads bad and the people too poor to receive us and give charity at once  but if it be meant that these exhortations are commanded to be made in the church upon the lords day we are humbly of opinion that it is left to the discretion of the clergy to choose what subjects they think most proper to preach on and at what times and if they preach either false doctrine or seditious principles they are liable to be punished  it may possibly happen that the sufferer recommended may be a person not deserving the favour intended by the brief in which case no minister who knows the sufferer to be an undeserving person can with a safe conscience deliberately and affectionately publish the brief much less earnestly persuade exhort and stir up the people to contribute freely and cheerfully towards the relief of such a sufferer2  footnote 2 this mcarthys house was burnt in the month of august 1723 and the universal opinion of mankind was that mcarthy himself was the person who had set fire to the house note in edition of swifts works vol viii 1765 4to  thirdly whereas in the said brief the ministers and curates are required on the weekdays next after the lords day when the brief was read to go from house to house with their churchwardens to ask and receive from all persons the said charity we cannot but observe here that the said ministers are directly made collectors of the said charity in conjunction with the churchwardens which however we presume was not intended as being against all law and precedent and therefore we apprehend there may be some inconsistency which leaves us at a loss how to proceed for in the next paragraph the ministers and curates are only required where they conveniently can to accompany the churchwardens or procure some other of the chief inhabitants to do the same and in a following paragraph the whole work seems left entirely to the churchwardens who are required to use their utmost diligence to gather and collect the said charity and to pay the same in ten days after to the parson vicar c  in answer to this we do represent to your grace our humble opinion that neither we nor our churchwardens can be legally commanded or required to go from house to house to receive the said charity because your grace hath informed us in your order at your visitation an dom 1712 that neither we nor our churchwardens are bound to make any collections for the poor save in the church which also appears plainly by the rubric that appoints both time and place as your grace hath observed in your said order  we do likewise assure your grace that it is not in our power to procure some of the chief inhabitants of our parishes to accompany the churchwardens from house to house in these collections and we have reason to believe that such a proposal made to our chief inhabitants particularly in this city where our chief inhabitants are often peers of the land would be received in a manner very little to our own satisfaction or to the advantage of the said collections  fourthly the brief doth will require and command the bishops and all other dignitaries of the church that they make their contributions distinctly to be returned in the several provinces to the several archbishops of the same  upon which we take leave to observe that the terms of expression here are of the strongest kind and in a point that may subject the said dignitaries for we shall say nothing of the bishops to great inconveniencies  the said dignitaries are here willed required and commanded to make their contributions distinctly by which it should seem that they are absolutely commanded to make contributions for the word distinctly is but a circumstance and may be understood not very agreeable to a voluntary cheerful contribution and therefore if any bishop or dignitary should refuse to make his contribution perhaps for very good reasons he may be thought to incur the crime of disobedience to his majesty which all good subjects abhor when such a command is according to law  most dignities of this kingdom consist only of parochial tithes and the dignitaries are ministers of parishes a doubt may therefore arise whether the said dignitaries are willed required and commanded to make their contributions in both capacities distinctly as dignitaries and jointly as parsons or vicars  many dignities in this kingdom are the poorest kind of benefices and it should seem hard to put poor dignitaries under the necessity either of making greater contributions than they can afford or of exposing themselves to the censure of wanting charity by making their contributions public  our saviour commands us in works of charity to let not our left hand know what our right hand doeth which cannot well consist with our being willed required and commanded by any earthly power where no law is prescribed to publish our charity to the world if we have a mind to conceal it  fifthly whereas it is said in the said brief that the parson vicar c of every parish shall in six days after the receipt of the said charity return it to his respective chancellor c this may be a great grievance hazard and expense to the said parson in remote and desolate parts of the country where often an honest messenger if such a one can be got must be hired to travel forty or fifty miles going and coming which will probably cost more than the value of the contribution he carries with him and this charge if briefs should happen to be frequent would be enough to undo many a poor clergyman in the kingdom  sixthly we observe in the said brief that the provost and fellows of the university judges officers of the courts and professors of laws common and civil are neither willed required nor commanded to make their contributions but that so good a work is only recommended to them whereas we conceive that all his majestys subjects are equally obliged with or without his majestys commands to promote works of charity according to their power and that the clergy in their ecclesiastical capacity are only liable to such commands as the rubric or any other law shall enjoin being born to the same privileges of freedom with the rest of his majestys subjects  we cannot but observe to your grace that in the english act of the fourth year of queen anne for the better collecting charity money on briefs by letterspatent c the ministers are obliged only to read the briefs in their churches without any particular exhortations neither are they commanded to go from house to house with the churchwardens nor to send the money collected to their respective chancellors but pay it to the undertaker or agent of the sufferer so that we humbly hope the clergy of this kingdom shall not without any law in being be put to greater hardships in this case than their brethren in england where the legislature intending to prevent the abuses in collecting charity money on briefs did not think fit to put the clergy under any of those difficulties we now complain of in the present brief by letters patent for the relief of charles mcarthy aforesaid  the collections upon the lords day are the principal support of our own numerous poor in our several parishes and therefore every single brief with the benefit of a full collection over the whole kingdom must deprive several thousands of poor of their weekly maintenance for the sake only of one person who often becomes a sufferer by his own folly or negligence and is sure to overvalue his losses double or treble so that if this precedent be followed as it certainly will if the present brief should succeed we may probably have a new brief every week and thus for the advantage of fiftytwo persons whereof not one in ten is deserving and for the interest of a dozen dexterous clerks and secretaries the whole poor in the kingdom will be likely to starve  we are credibly informed that neither the officers of the lord primate in preparing the report of his graces opinion nor those of the greatseal in passing the patent for briefs will remit any of their fees both which do amount to a considerable sum and thus the good intentions of welldisposed people are in a great measure disappointed a large part of their charity being anticipated and alienated by fees and gratuities  lastly we cannot but represent to your grace our great concern and grief to see the pains and labour of our churchwardens so much increased by the injunctions and commands put upon them in this brief to the great disadvantage of the clergy and the people as well as to their own trouble damage and loss of time to which great additions have been already made by laws appointing them to collect the taxes for the watch and the poorhouse which they bear with great unwillingness and if they shall find themselves further laden with such briefs as this of mcarthy it will prove so great a discouragement that we shall never be able to provide honest and sufficient persons for that weighty office of churchwarden so necessary to the laity as well as the clergy in all things that relate to the order and regulation of parishes  upon all these considerations we humbly hope that your grace of whose fatherly care vigilance and tenderness we have had so many and great instances will represent our case to his most excellent majesty or to the chief governor in this kingdom in such a manner that we may be neither under the necessity of declining his majestys commands in his letters patent or of taking new and grievous burthens upon ourselves and our churchwardens to which neither the rubric nor any other law in force oblige us to submit                             on  the   bill  for  the clergys residing on their livings   note  in the note to the tract some arguments against enlarging the power of bishops in letting leases p 219 it was pointed out that the bill against which this tract was written was an attempt on the part of the bishops to get back a power which they once had abused failing in this attempt in 1723 they renewed the attack in 1731 by promoting two bills one called a bill of residence the other a bill of division  the ostensible object of the bill of residence was to compel the clergy to reside on their livings by this bill any person taking a benefice with cure of souls of the annual value of £100 was forced if the land attached to that benefice had no house fit for residence to build one thereon in any situation the bishop might think suitable this house to cost one year and a halfs income and to be completed within a time fixed by the bishop it will at once be seen that the power over the inferior clergy which this bill placed in the bishops hands was by no means insignificant and swift felt that to make such a bill law would not only tend to impoverish the inferior clergy but would place them in a position of subjection at once degrading and dispiriting he opposed the bill with the consequence that the house of commons rejected it  by the bill of division it was intended to be enacted that whenever a church should become vacant although the incumbent should refuse his consent it might be lawful for the chief governor with the assent of the major part of the privy council six at least consenting by and with the consent of the ordinary and the patron to subdivide any parish into as many portions as they might think fit provided that after such division the church of the old parish should continue worth at the least £300 per annum this bill which passed the house of lords two days after the bill of residence swift opposed in a spirited and somewhat bitter manner his opposition largely influenced the lower house in rejecting it the two tracts which state the grounds of his opposition to both bills are the present one and the following tract considerations upon two bills sent down from the house of lords to the house of commons in ireland relating to the clergy  scott notes that the tone of aigreur which is more distinctly felt in the second of these tracts intimates a deep dissatisfaction with late ecclesiastical preferments which may perhaps be traced as much to personal disappointment as to any better cause a statement which it was hardly worth making since however deep may have been swifts personal feelings he never allowed them to be the impelling motive to his work it should suffice us to know that the cause which swift espoused was a disinterested one as vicar of laracor he knew what it was to make a shift of living on an insufficient income and it may have been this experience as much as personal disappointment which gave pungency to his criticism it is easy enough to find questionable motives for a satirist especially when that satirist is swift let us not however forget that in his case the personal element was never permitted to overweight the impersonal purpose other men when they reach prosperity often forget or ignore the hard conditions of their previous state to swift these conditions were always existing factors in his considerations for the amelioration of his fellowmen this it is which gives to his writings so much of the tone of aigreur  in his letter to john stearne bishop of clogher dated july 1733 which is one of swifts most characteristic epistlescharacteristic because the embodiment of truthful candourhe gives no equivocal expression of opinion on these two bills he calls them abominable bills for enslaving and beggaring the clergy which took their birth from hell i call god to witness he adds that i did then and do now and shall for ever firmly believe that every bishop who gave his vote for either of these bills did it with no other view bating further promotion than a premeditated design from the spirit of ambition and love of arbitrary power to make the whole body of the clergy their slaves and vassals until the day of judgment under the load of poverty and contempt  about the same time 1732 appeared another pamphlet entitled the reconciler  shewing how all the good ends proposed by either of those bills may by a more gentle and easy method be attained without injury to the rights of my lords the bishops or rigour and violence to the inferior clergy in the main the writer agrees with swift but the tract is valuable as showing that the controversy was no small one and it furnishes also what is apparently an impartial history of the whole affair three irish prelates voted against the bills on a divisiontheophilus bolton archbishop of cashel charles carr bishop of killaloe and robert howard bishop of elphin  the text of this tract is based on that which appeared in a volume of miscellanies in prose and verse in the year 1789 it has been collated with those given by scott hawkesworth and other editors  ts     on the bill for the clergys   residing on their livings   those gentlemen who have been promoted to bishoprics in this kingdom for several years past are of two sorts first certain private clergymen from england who by the force of friends industry solicitation or other means and merits to me unknown have been raised to that character by the mero motu of the crown  of the other sort are some clergymen born in this kingdom who have most distinguished themselves by their warmth against popery their great indulgence to dissenters and all true loyal protestants by their zeal for the house of hanover abhorrence of the pretender and an implicit readiness to fall into any measures that will make the government easy to those who represent his majestys person  some of the former kind are such as are said to have enjoyed tolerable preferments in england and it is therefore much to their commendation that they have condescended to leave their native country and come over hither to be bishops merely to promote christianity among us and therefore in my opinion both their lordships and the many defenders they bring over may justly claim the merit of missionaries sent to convert a nation from heresy and heathenism  before i proceed farther it may be proper to relate some particulars wherein the circumstances of the english clergy differ from those of ireland  the districts of parishes throughout england continue much the same as they were before the reformation and most of the churches are of the gothic architecture built some hundred years ago but the tithes of great numbers of churches having been applied by the popes pretended authority to several abbeys and even before the reformation bestowed by that sacrilegious tyrant henry viii on his ravenous favourites the maintenance of an incumbent in most parts of the kingdom is contemptibly small and yet a vicar there of forty pounds a year can live with more comfort than one of three times the nominal value with us for his forty pounds are duly paid him because there is not one farmer in a hundred who is not worth five times the rent he pays to his landlord and fifty times the sum demanded for the tithes which by the small compass of his parish he can easily collect or compound for and if his behaviour and understanding be supportable he will probably receive presents now and then from his parishioners and perhaps from the squire who although he may sometimes be apt to treat his parson a little superciliously will probably be softened by a little humble demeanour the vicar is likewise generally sure to find upon his admittance to his living a convenient house and barn in repair with a garden and a field or two to graze a few cows and one horse for himself and his wife he hath probably a market very near him perhaps in his own village no entertainment is expected from his visitor beyond a pot of ale and a piece of cheese he hath every sunday the comfort of a full congregation of plain cleanly people of both sexes well to pass and who speak his own language the scene about him is fully cultivated i mean for the general and well inhabited he dreads no thieves for anything but his apples for the trade of universal stealing is not so epidemic there as with us his wife is little better than goody in her birth education or dress and as to himself we must let his parentage alone if he be the son of a farmer it is very sufficient and his sister may very decently be chambermaid to the squires wife he goes about on working days in a graziers coat and will not scruple to assist his workmen in harvest time he is usually wary and thrifty and often more able to provide for a numerous family than some of ours can do with a rectory called 300l a year his daughters shall go to service or be sent prentice to the sempstress of the next town and his sons are put to honest trades this is the usual course of an english country vicar from twenty to sixty pounds a year  as to the clergy of our own kingdom their livings are generally larger not originally or by the bounty of princes parliaments or charitable endowments for the same degradations and as to glebes a much greater have been made here but by the destruction and desolation in the long wars between the invaders and the natives during which time a great part of the bishops lands and almost all the glebes were lost in the confusion the first invaders had almost the whole kingdom divided amongst them new invaders succeeded and drove out their predecessors as native irish these were expelled by others who came after and upon the same pretensions thus it went on for several hundred years and in some degree even to our own memories and thus it will probably go on although not in a martial way to the end of the world for not only the purchasers of debentures forfeited in 1641 were all of english birth but those after the restoration and many who came hither even since the revolution are looked upon as perfect irish directly contrary to the practice of all wise nations and particularly of the greeks and romans in establishing their colonies by which name ireland is very absurdly called  under these distractions the conquerors always seized what lands they could with little ceremony whether they belonged to the church or not thus the glebes were almost universally exposed to the first seizers and could never be recovered although the grants with the particular denominations are manifest and still in being the whole lands of the see of waterford were wholly taken by one family the like is reported of other bishoprics  king james the first who deserves more of the church of ireland than all other princes put together having the forfeitures of vast tracts of land in the northern parts i think commonly called the escheated counties having granted some hundred thousand acres of these lands to certain scotch and english favourites was prevailed on by some great prelates to grant to some sees in the north and to many parishes there certain parcels of land for the augmentation of poor bishoprics did likewise endow many parishes with glebes for the incumbents whereof a good number escaped the depredations of 1641 and 1688 these lands when they were granted by king james consisted mostly of woody ground wherewith those parts of this island were then overrun this is well known universally allowed and by some in part remembered the rest being in some places not stubbed out to this day and the value of the lands was consequently very inconsiderable till scotch colonies came over in swarms upon great encouragement to make them habitable at least for such a race of strongbodied people who came hither from their own bleak barren highlands as it were into a paradise who soon were able to get straw for their bedding instead of a bundle of heath spread on the ground and sprinkled with water here by degrees they acquired some degree of politeness and civility from such neighbouring irish as were still left after tyrones last rebellion and are since grown almost entirely possessors of the north thus at length the woods being rooted up the land was brought in and tilled and the glebes which could not before yield twopence an acre are equal to the best sometimes affording the minister a good demesne and some land to let  these wars and desolations in their natural consequences were likewise the cause of another effect i mean that of uniting several parishes under one incumbent for as the lands were of little value by the want of inhabitants to cultivate them and many of the churches levelled to the ground particularly by the fanatic zeal of those rebellious saints who murdered their king destroyed the church and overthrew monarchy for all which there is a humiliation day appointed by law and soon approaching so in order to give a tolerable maintenance to a minister and the country being too poor as well as devotion too low to think of building new churches it was found necessary to repair some one church which had least suffered and join sometimes three or more enough for a bare support to some clergyman who knew not where to provide himself better this was a case of absolute necessity to prevent heathenism as well as popery from overrunning the nation the consequence of these unions was very different in different parts for in the north by the scotch settlement their numbers daily increasing by new additions from their own country and their prolific quality peculiar to northern people and lastly by their universally feeding upon oats which grain under its several preparations and denominations is the only natural luxury of that hardy people the value of tithes increased so prodigiously that at this day i confess several united parishes ought to be divided taking in so great a compass that it is almost impossible for the people to travel timely to their own parish church or their little churches to contain half their number though the revenue would be sufficient to maintain two or perhaps three worthy clergymen with decency provided the times mend or that they were honestly dealt with which i confess is seldom the case i shall name only one and it is the deanery of derry the revenue whereof if the dean could get his dues exceeding that of some bishoprics both by the compass and fertility of the soil the number as well as industry of the inhabitants the conveniency of exporting their corn to dublin and foreign parts and lastly by the accidental discovery of marl in many places of the several parishes yet all this revenue is wholly founded upon corn for i am told there is hardly an acre of glebe for the dean to plant and build on  i am therefore of opinion that a real undefalcated revenue of six hundred pounds a year is a sufficient income for a country dean in this kingdom and since the rents consist wholly of tithes two parishes to the amount of that value should be united and the dean reside as minister in that of down and the remaining parishes be divided among worthy clergymen to about 300l a year to each the deanery of derry which is a large city might be left worth 800l a year and rapho according as it shall be thought proper these three are the only opulent deaneries in the whole kingdom and as i am informed consist all of tithes which was an unhappy expedient in the church occasioned by the sacrilegious robberies during the several times of confusion and war insomuch that at this day there is hardly any remainder left of dean and chapter lands in ireland that delicious morsel swallowed so greedily in england under the fanatic usurpations  as to the present scheme of a bill for obliging the clergy to residence now or lately in the privy council i know no more of the particulars than what hath been told me by several clergymen of distinction who say that a petition in the name of them all hath been presented to the lord lieutenant and council that they might be heard by their counsel against the bill and that the petition was rejected with some reasons why it was rejected for the bishops know best what is proper for the clergy it seems the bill consists of two parts first a power in the bishops with consent of the archbishop and the patron to take off from any parish whatever it is worth above £300 a year and this to be done without the incumbents consent which before was necessary in all divisions the other part of the bill obligeth all clergymen from forty pounds a year and upwards to reside and build a house in his parish but those of £40 are remitted till they shall receive £100 out of the revenue of firstfruits granted by her late majesty                             considerations  upon  two bills c   note  in the year 1731 a bill was brought into the house of lords by a great majority of the right reverend the bishops for enabling them to divide the livings of the inferior clergy which bill was approved of in the privycouncil of ireland and passed by the lords in parliament it was afterwards sent to the house of commons for their approbation but was rejected by them with a great majority the supposed author of the following considerations who hath always been the best friend to the inferior clergy of the church of england as may be seen by many parts of his writings opposed this pernicious project with great success which if it had passed into law would have been of the worst consequence to this nation advertisement to the reprint of this pamphlet in swifts works vol vi dublin faulkner 1738  fuller details of the circumstances which gave swift the opportunity for writing this tract are given in the note prefixed to the previous pamphlet see p 250  the text here given is that of the first edition  ts     considerations   upon two   bills   sent down from the r h the   h of l   to the hble   h of c   relating to the   clergy   of   id  london  printed for a moore near st pauls and sold by the booksellers of westminster and southwark 1732   i have often for above a month past desired some few clergymen who are pleased to visit me that they would procure an extract of two bills brought into the council by some of the bishops and both of them since passed in the house of lords but i could never obtain what i desired whether by the forgetfulness or negligence of those whom i employed or the difficulty of the thing itself therefore if i shall happen to mistake in any fact of consequence i desire my remarks upon it may pass for nothing for my information is no better than what i received in words from several divines who seemed to agree with each other i have not the honour to be acquainted with any one single prelate of the kingdom and am a stranger to their characters further than as common fame reports them which is not to be depended on therefore i cannot be supposed to act upon a principle of resentment i esteem their functions if i may be allowed to say so without offence as truly apostolical and absolutely necessary to the perfection of a christian church  there are no qualities more incident to the frailty and corruption of human kind than an indifference or insensibility for other mens sufferings and a sudden forgetfulness of their own former humble state when they rise in the world these two dispositions have not i think anywhere so strongly exerted themselves as in the order of bishops with regard to the inferior clergy for which i can find no reasons but such as naturally should seem to operate a quite contrary way the maintenance of the clergy throughout the kingdom is precarious and uncertain collected from a most miserable race of beggarly farmers at whose mercy every minister lies to be defrauded his office as rector or vicar if it be duly executed is very laborious as soon as he is promoted to a bishopric the scene is entirely and happily changed his revenues are large and as surely paid as those of the king his whole business is once ayear to receive the attendance the submission and the proxymoney of all his clergy in whatever part of the diocese he shall please to think most convenient for himself neither is his personal presence necessary for the business may be done by a vicargeneral the fatigue of ordination is just what the bishops please to make it and as matters have been for some time and may probably remain the fewer ordinations the better the rest of their visible office consists in the honour of attending parliaments and councils and bestowing preferments in their own gift in which last employment and in their spiritual and temporal courts the labour falls to their vicarsgeneral secretaries proctors apparitors seneschals and the like now i say in so quick a change where their brethren in a few days are become their subjects it would be reasonable at least to hope that the labour confinement and subjection from which they have so lately escaped like a bird out of the snare of the fowler might a little incline them to remember the condition of those who were but last week their equals probably their companions or their friends and possibly as reasonable expectants there is a known story of colonel tidcomb who while he continued a subaltern officer was every day complaining against the pride oppression and hard treatment of colonels toward their officers yet in a very few minutes after he had received his commission for a regiment walking with a friend on the mall he confessed that the spirit of colonelship was coming fast upon him which spirit is said to have daily increased to the hour of his death  it is true the clergy of this kingdom who are promoted to bishoprics have always some great advantages either that of rich deaneries opulent and multiplied rectories and dignities strong alliances by birth or marriage fortified by a superlative degree of zeal and loyalty but however they were all at first no more than young beginners and before their great promotion were known by their plain christian names among their old companions the middling rate of clergymen nor could therefore be strangers to their condition or with any good grace forget it so soon as it hath sometimes happened  i confess i do not remember to have observed any body of men acting with so little concert as our clergy have done in a point where their opinions appeared to be unanimous a point where their whole temporal support was concerned as well as their power of serving god and his church in their spiritual functions this hath been imputed to their fear of disobliging or hopes of further favours upon compliance because it was observed that some who appeared at first with the greatest zeal thought fit suddenly to absent themselves from the usual meetings yet we know what expert solicitors the quakers the dissenters and even the papists have sometimes found to drive a point of advantage or present an impending evil  i have not seen any extract from the two bills introduced into the privy council by the bishops where the clergy upon some failure in favour or through the timorousness of many among their brethren were refused to be heard by the council it seems these bills were both returned agreed to by the king and council in england and the house of lords hath with great expedition passed them both and it is said they are immediately to be sent down to the commons for their consent  the particulars as they have been imperfectly reported to me are as follow  by one of the bills the bishops have power to oblige the country clergy to build a mansionhouse upon whatever part of their glebes their lordships shall command and if the living be above £50 ayear the minister is bound to build after three years a house that shall cost one year and a halfs rent of his income for instance if a clergyman with a wife and seven children gets a living of £55 per annum he must after three years build a house that shall cost £77 10s and must support his family during the time the bishop shall appoint for the building of it with the remainder but if the living be under £50 ayear the minister shall be allowed an £100 out of the firstfruits  but there is said to be one circumstance a little extraordinary that if there be a single spot in the glebe more barren more marshy more exposd to winds more distant from the church or skeleton of a church or from any conveniency of building the rector or vicar may be obliged by the caprice or pique of the bishop to build under pain of sequestration an office which ever falls into the most knavish hands upon whatever point his lordship shall command although the farmers have not paid one quarter of his due  i believe under the present distresses of the kingdom which inevitably without a miracle must increase for ever there are not ten country clergymen in ireland reputed to possess a parish of £100 per annum who for some years past have actually received £60 and that with the utmost difficulty and vexation i am therefore at a loss what kind of valuators the bishops will make use of and whether the starving vicar shall be forced to build his house with the money he never received  the other bill which passed in two days after the former is said to concern the division of parishes into as many parcels as the bishop shall think fit only leaving £300 ayear to the mother church which £300 by another act passed some years ago they can divide likewise and crumble as low as their will and pleasure will dispose them so that instead of 600 clergymen which i think is the usual computation we may have in a small compass of years almost as many thousands to live with decency and comfort provide for their children c be charitable to the poor and maintain hospitality  but it is very reasonable to hope and heartily to be wished by all those who have the least regard to our holy religion as hitherto established or to a learned pious diligent conversible clergyman or even to common humanity that the honourable house of commons will in their great wisdom justice and tenderness to innocent men consider these bills in another light it is said they well know this kingdom not to be so over stocked with neighbouring gentry but a discreet learned clergyman with a competency fit for one of his education may be an entertaining a useful and sometimes a necessary companion that although such a clergyman may not be able constantly to find beef and wine for his own family yet he may be allowed sometimes to afford both to a neighbour without distressing himself and the rather because he may expect at least as good a return it will probably be considered that in many desolate parts there may not be always a sufficient number of persons considerable enough to be trusted with commissions of the peace which several of the clergy now supply much better than a little hedge contemptible illiterate vicar from twenty to fifty pounds ayear the son of a weaver pedlar tailor or miller can be presumed to do  the landlords and farmers by this scheme can find no profit but will certainly be losers for instance if the large northern livings be split into a dozen parishes or more it will be very necessary for the little threadbare gownman with his wife his proctor and every child who can crawl to watch the fields at harvest time for fear of losing a single sheaf which he could not afford under peril of a days starving for according to the scotch proverb a hungry louse bites sore this would of necessity breed an infinite number of brangles and litigious suits in the spiritual courts and put the wretched pastor at perpetual variance with his whole parish but as they have hitherto stood a clergyman established in a competent living is not under the necessity of being so sharp vigilant and exacting on the contrary it is well known and allowed that the clergy round the kingdom think themselves well treated if they lose only one single third of their legal demands  the honourable house may perhaps be inclined to conceive that my lords the bishops enjoy as ample a power both spiritual and temporal as will fully suffice to answer every branch of their office that they want no laws to regulate the conduct of those clergymen over whom they preside that if nonresidence be a grievance it is the patrons fault who makes not a better choice or caused the plurality that if the general impartial character of persons chosen into the church had been more regarded and the motive of party alliance kindred flatterers ill judgment or personal favour regarded less there would be fewer complaints of nonresidence neglect of care blameable behaviour or any other part of misconduct not to mention ignorance and stupidity  i could name certain gentlemen of the gown whose awkward spruce prim sneering and smirking countenances the very tone of their voices and an ungainly strut in their walk without one single talent for any one office have contrived to get good preferment by the mere force of flattery and cringing for which two virtues the only two virtues they pretend to they were however utterly unqualified and whom if i were in power although they were my nephews or had married my nieces i could never in point of good conscience or honour have recommended to a curacy in connaught  the honourable house of commons may likewise perhaps consider that the gentry of this kingdom differ from all others upon earth being less capable of employments in their own country than any others who come from abroad and that most of them have little expectation of providing for their younger children otherwise than by the church in which there might be some hopes of getting a tolerable maintenance for after the patrons should have settled their sons their nephews their nieces their dependants and their followers invited over from tother side there would still remain an overplus of smaller church preferments to be given to such clergy of the nation who shall have their quantum of whatever merit may be then in fashion but by these bills they will be all as absolutely excluded as if they had passed under the denomination of tories unless they can be contented at the utmost with £50 ayear which by the difficulties of collecting tithes in ireland and the daily increasing miseries of the people will hardly rise to half the sum  it is observed that the divines sent over hither to govern this church have not seemed to consider the difference between both kingdoms with respect to the inferior clergy as to themselves indeed they find a large revenue in lands let at one quarter value which consequently must be paid while there is a penny left among us and the public distress so little affects their interests that their fines are now higher than ever they content themselves to suppose that whatever a parish is said to be worth comes all into the parsons pocket  the poverty of great numbers among the clergy of england hath been the continual complaint of all men who wish well to the church and many schemes have been thought on to redress it yet an english vicar of £40 ayear lives much more comfortably than one of double the value in ireland his farmers generally speaking are able and willing to pay him his full dues he hath a decent church of ancient standing filled every lords day with a large congregation of plain people well clad and behaving themselves as if they believed in god and christ he hath a house and barn in repair a field or two to graze his cows with a garden and orchard no guest expects more from him than a pot of ale he lives like an honest plain farmer as his wife is dressed but little better than goody he is sometimes graciously invited by the squire where he sits at humble distance if he gets the love of his people they often make him little useful presents he is happy by being born to no higher expectation for he is usually the son of some ordinary tradesman or middling farmer his learning is much of a size with his birth and education no more of either than what a poor hungry servitor can be expected to bring with him from his college it would be tedious to shew the reverse of all this in our distant poorer parishes through most parts of ireland wherein every reader may make the comparison  lastly the honourable house of commons may consider whether the scheme of multiplying beggarly clergymen through the whole kingdom who must all have votes for choosing parliament men provided they can prove their freeholds to be worth 40s per annum ultra reprisas may not by their numbers have great influence upon elections being entirely under the dependance of their bishops for by a moderate computation after all the divisions and subdivisions of parishes that my lords the bishops have power to make by their new laws there will as soon as the present set of clergy go off be raised an army of ecclesiastical militants able enough for any kind of service except that of the altar  i am indeed in some concern about a fund for building a thousand or two churches wherein these probationers may read their wall lectures and begin to doubt they must be contented with barns which barns will be one great advancing step towards an accommodation with our true protestant brethren the dissenters  the scheme of encouraging clergymen to build houses by dividing a living of £500 ayear into ten parts is a contrivance the meaning whereof hath got on the wrong side of my comprehension unless it may be argued that bishops build no houses because they are so rich and therefore the inferior clergy will certainly build if you reduce them to beggary but i knew a very rich man of quality in england who could never be persuaded to keep a servant out of livery because such servants would be expensive and apt in time to look like gentlemen whereas the others were ready to submit to the basest offices and at a cheaper pennyworth might increase his retinue  i hear it is the opinion of many wise men that before these bills pass both houses they should be sent back to england with the following clauses inserted  first that whereas there may be about a dozen double bishoprics in ireland those bishoprics should be split and given to different persons and those of a single denomination be also divided into two three or four parts as occasion shall require otherwise there may be a question started whether twentytwo prelates can effectually extend their paternal care and unlimited power for the protection and correction of so great a number of spiritual subjects but this proposal will meet with such furious objections that i shall not insist upon it for i well remember to have read what a terrible fright the frogs were in upon a report that the sun was going to marry  another clause should be that none of these twenty thirty forty or fifty pounders may be suffered to marry under the penalty of immediate deprivation their marriages declared null and their children bastards for some desponding people take the kingdom to be not in a condition of encouraging so numerous a breed of beggars  a third clause will be necessary that these humble gentry should be absolutely disqualified from giving votes in elections for parliament men  others add a fourth which is a clause of indulgence that these reduced divines may be permitted to follow any lawful ways of living that will not call them too often or too far from their spiritual offices for unless i misapprehend they are supposed to have episcopal ordination for example they may be lappers of linen bailiffs of the manor they may let blood or apply plasters for three miles round they may get a dispensation to hold the clerkship and sextonship of their own parish in commendam their wives and daughters may make shirts for the neighbourhood or if a barrack be near for the soldiers in linen countries they may card and spin and keep a few looms in the house they may let lodgings and sell a pot of ale without doors but not at home unless to sober company and at regular hours it is by some thought a little hard that in an affair of the last consequence to the very being of the clergy in the points of liberty and property as well as in their abilities to perform their duty this whole reverend body who are the established instructors of the nation in christianity and moral virtues and are the only persons concerned should be the sole persons not consulted let any scholar shew the like precedent in christendom for twelve hundred years past an act of parliament for settling or selling an estate in a private family is never passed till all parties give consent but in the present case the whole body of the clergy is as themselves apprehend determined to utter ruin without once expecting or asking their opinion and this by a scheme contrived only by one part of the convocation while the other part which hath been chosen in the usual forms wants only the regal permission to assemble and consult about the affairs of the church as their predecessors have always done in former ages where it is presumed the lower house hath a power of proposing canons and a negative voice as well as the upper and god forbid say these objectors that there should be a real separate interest between the bishops and clergy any more than there is between a man and his wife a king and his people or christ and his church  it seems there is a provision in the bill that no parish shall be cut into scraps without the consent of several persons who can be no sufferers in the matter but i cannot find that the clergy lay much weight on this caution because they argue that the very persons from whom these bills took their rise will have the greatest share in the decision  i do not by any means conceive the crying sin of the clergy in this kingdom to be that of nonresidence i am sure it is many degrees less so here than in england unless the possession of pluralities may pass under that name and if this be a fault it is well known to whom it must be imputed i believe upon a fair inquiry and i hear an inquiry is to be made they will appear to be most pardonably few especially considering how many parishes have not an inch of glebe and how difficult it is upon any reasonable terms to find a place of habitation and therefore god knows whether my lords the bishops will be soon able to convince the clergy or those who have any regard for that venerable body that the chief motive in their lordships minds by procuring these bills was to prevent the sin of nonresidence while the universal opinion of almost every clergyman in the kingdom without distinction of party taking in even those who are not likely to be sufferers stands directly against them  if some livings in the north may be justly thought too large a compass of land which makes it inconvenient for the remotest inhabitant to attend the service of the church which in some instances may be true no reasonable clergyman would oppose a proper remedy by particular acts of parliament  thus for instance the deanery of down a country deanery i think without a cathedral depending wholly upon an union of parishes joined together in a time when the land lay waste and thinly inhabited since those circumstances are so prodigiously changed for the better may properly be lessened leaving a decent competency to the dean and placing rectories in the remaining churches which are now served only by stipendiary curates  the case may be probably the same in other parts and such a proceeding discreetly managed would be truly for the good of the church  for it is to be observed that the dean and chapter lands which in england were all seized under the fanatic usurpation are things unknown in ireland having been long ravished from the church by a succession of confusions and tithes applied in their stead to support that ecclesiastical dignity  the late archbishop of dublin1 had a very different way of encouraging the clergy of his diocese to residence when a lease had run out seven years or more he stipulated with the tenant to resign up twenty or thirty acres to the minister of the parish where it lay convenient without lessening his former rent and with no great abatement of the fine and this he did in the parts near dublin where land is at the highest rates leaving a small chiefry for the minister to pay hardly a sixth part of the value i doubt not that almost every bishop in the kingdom may do the same generous act with less damage to their sees than his late grace of dublin much of whose lands were out in feefarms or leases for lives and i am sorry that the good example of that prelate hath not been followed  footnote 1 the right rev dr william king see p 241 t s  but a great majority of the clergys friends cannot hitherto reconcile themselves to this project which they call a levelling principle that must inevitably root out the seeds of all honest emulation the legal parent of the greatest virtues and most generous actions among men but which in the general opinion for i do not pretend to offer my own will never more have room to exert itself in the breast of any clergyman whom this kingdom shall produce  but whether the consequences of these bills may by the virtues and frailties of future bishops sent over hither to rule the church terminate in good or evil i shall not presume to determine since god can work the former out of the latter but one thing i can venture to assert that from the earliest ages of christianity to the minute i am now writing there never was a precedent of such a proceeding much less to be feared hoped or apprehended from such hands in any christian country and so it may pass for more than a phoenix because it hath risen without any assistance from the ashes of its sire  the appearance of so many dissenters at the hearing of this cause is what i am told hath not been charged to the account of their prudence or moderation because that action hath been censured as a mark of triumph and insult before the victory is complete since neither of these bills hath yet passed the house of commons and some are pleased to think it not impossible that they may be rejected neither do i hear that there is an enacting clause in either of the bills to apply any part of the divided or subdivided tithes towards increasing the stipends of the sectaries so that these gentlemen seem to be gratified like him who after having been kicked downstairs took comfort when he saw his friend kicked down after him  i have heard many more objections against several particulars of both these bills but they are of a high nature and carry such dreadful innuendos that i dare not mention them resolving to give no offence because i well know how obnoxious i have long been although i conceive without any fault of my own to the zeal and principles of those who place all difference in opinion concerning public matters to the score of disaffection whereof i am at least as innocent as the loudest of my detractors    dublin   feb 24 17312                             some  reasons  against  the bill for settling the tithe  of  hemp flax c by a modus   note  about the end of 1733 the irish house of commons had under consideration a bill for the encouragement of the growth of flax and the manufacture of linen this bill contained a clause by which the tithe upon flax should be commuted by a modus or money composition the clergy to whom this tithe was an important source of revenue and naturally not wishing to lose its advantage took steps to petition parliament to be heard by counsel against the bill swift signed the petition which set forth the injury which would be done to their order if the clause in the bill then before the house were allowed to become law in addition to this he committed and arranged his arguments to writing and issued them in the following pamphlet the activity against the bill proved so efficacious that the house of commons dropped it it may be remarked that swifts interference was purely disinterested since no part of the revenue of st patricks as monck mason points out comes from the district appropriated to the culture of flax nor did swift or any of his predecessors or successors ever receive one shilling upon account of that tithe  this attempt on the part of the house of commons to regulate the affairs of the clergy of ireland seems to have been one of a series which divided laity and clergy into two strongly opposing parties on the one side were the house of commons and its supporters on the other the general body of the irish clergy with for a time at any rate swift at the head the tithe of pasturage or as it was called the tithe of agistment was being strongly resisted at the time and many of the clergy were forced to sue in court before they could obtain it the matter of this tithe had been already before an irish court in 1707 and had been settled in favour of the suing clergyman one archdeacon neal and although the cause was removed to kings bench in england the previous judgment was confirmed in spite of this decision however the tithe continued to be a subject of litigation and the landed proprietors even formed themselves into associations for the purpose of resisting the clergys claim in 1734 the house of commons aggravated matters by passing resolutions against the claims many of which were then the subject of legal actions and prevented decisions being come to while it had the matter under its consideration from the pamphlets written at the time it may easily be seen that this interference on the part of the lower house was both unseemly and unjust its conduct so roused swift that his indignation found expression in one of his bitterest and most terrible poetical satiresthe legion cluba satire so bitter and so scathing that reading it now after the lapse of more than a century and a half one shudders at its invectivea blasting flood of filth and vitriol out of some hellish fountain mr churton collins calls it we are told that its composition brought on a violent attack of vertigo and it remained unfinished  the text here given is that of the first edition collated with those given by faulkner hawkesworth and scott  ts     some   reasons   against the   bill for settling the tyth of hemp flax c by a modus  mdccxxiv   the clergy did little expect to have any cause of complaint against the present house of commons who in the last sessions were pleased to throw out a bill1 sent them from the lords which that reverend body apprehended would be very injurious to them if it passed into a law and who in the present sessions defeated the arts and endeavours of schismatics to repeal the sacramental test  footnote 1 for the bishops to divide livings see the two preceding tracts t s  for although it hath been allowed on all hands that the former of those bills might by its necessary consequences be very displeasing to the lay gentlemen of the kingdom for many reasons purely secular and that this last attempt for repealing the test did much more affect at present the temporal interest than the spiritual yet the whole body of the lower clergy have upon both these occasions expressed equal gratitude to that honourable house for their justice and steadiness as if the clergy alone were to receive the benefit  it must needs be therefore a great addition to the clergys grief that such an assembly as the present house of commons should now with an expedition more than usual agree to a bill for encouraging the linen manufacture with a clause whereby the church is to lose two parts in three of the legal tithe in flax and hemp  some reasons why the clergy think such a law will be a great hardship upon them are i conceive those that follow i shall venture to enumerate them with all deference due to that honourable assembly  first the clergy suppose that they have not by any fault or demerit incurred the displeasure of the nations representatives neither can the declared loyalty of the present set from the highest prelate to the lowest vicar be in the least disputed because there are hardly ten clergymen through the whole kingdom for more than nineteen years past who have not been either preferred entirely upon account of their declared affection to the hanover line or higher promoted as the due reward of the same merit  there is not a landlord in the whole kingdom residing some part of the year at his countryseat who is not in his own conscience fully convinced that the tithes of his minister have gradually sunk for some years past onethird or at least onefourth of their former value exclusive of all nonsolvencies  the payment of tithes in this kingdom is subject to so many frauds brangles and other difficulties not only from papists and dissenters but even from those who profess themselves protestants that by the expense the trouble and vexation of collecting or bargaining for them they are of all other rents the most precarious uncertain and ill paid  the landlords in most parishes expect as a compliment that they shall pay little more than half the value of their tithes for the lands they hold in their own hands which often consist of large domains and it is the ministers interest to make them easy upon that article when he considers what influence those gentlemen have upon their tenants  the clergy cannot but think it extremely severe that in a bill for encouraging the linen manufacture they alone must be the sufferers who can least afford it if as i am told there be a tax of three thousand pounds a year paid by the public for a further encouragement to the said manufacture are not the clergy equal sharers in the charge with the rest of their fellow subjects what satisfactory reason can be therefore given why they alone should bear the whole additional weight unless it will be alleged that their property is not upon an equal foot with the properties of other men they acquire their own small pittance by at least as honest means as their neighbours the landlords possess their estates and have been always supposed except in rebellious or fanatical times to have as good a title for no families now in being can shew a more ancient indeed if it be true that some persons i hope they were not many were seen to laugh when the rights of the clergy were mentioned in this case an opinion may possibly be soon advanced that they have no rights at all and this is likely enough to gain ground in proportion as the contempt of all religion shall increase which is already in a very forward way  it is said there will be also added to this bill a clause for diminishing the tithe of hops in order to cultivate that useful plant among us and here likewise the load is to lie entirely on the shoulders of the clergy while the landlords reap all the benefit it will not be easy to foresee where such proceedings are like to stop or whether by the same authority in civil times a parliament may not as justly challenge the same power in reducing all things titheable not below the tenth part of the product which is and ever will be the clergys equitable right but from a tenthpart to a sixtieth or eightieth and from thence to nothing  i have heard it granted by skilful persons that the practice of taxing the clergy by parliament without their own consent is a new thing not much above the date of seventy years before which period in times of peace they always taxed themselves but things are extremely altered at present it is not now sufficient to tax them in common with their fellow subjects without imposing an additional tax upon them from which or from anything equivalent all their fellowsubjects are exempt and this in a country professing christianity  the greatest part of the clergy throughout this kingdom have been stripped of their glebes by the confusion of times by violence fraud oppression and other unlawful means all which glebes are now in the hands of the laity so that they now are generally forced to lie at the mercy of landlords for a small piece of ground in their parishes at a most exorbitant rent and usually for a short term of years whereon to build a house and enable them to reside yet in spite of these disadvantages i am a witness that they are generally more constant residents than their brethren in england where the meanest vicar hath a convenient dwelling with a barn a garden and a field or two for his cattle besides the certainty of his little income from honest farmers able and willing not only to pay him his dues but likewise to make him presents according to their ability for his better support in all which circumstances the clergy of ireland meet with a treatment directly contrary  it is hoped the honourable house will consider that it is impossible for the most illminded avaricious or cunning clergyman to do the least injustice to the meanest cottager in his parish in any bargain for tithes or other ecclesiastical dues he can at the utmost only demand to have his tithe fairly laid out and does not once in a hundred times obtain his demand but every tenant from the poorest cottager to the most substantial farmer can and generally doth impose upon the minister by fraud by theft by lies by perjuries by insolence and sometimes by force notwithstanding the utmost vigilance and skill of himself and his proctor insomuch that it is allowed that the clergy in general receive little more than onehalf of their legal dues not including the charges they are at in collecting or bargaining for them  the land rents of ireland are computed to about two millions whereof onetenth amounts to two hundred thousand pounds the benefited clergymen excluding those of this city are not reckoned to be above five hundred by which computation they should each of them possess two hundred pounds a year if those tithes were equally divided although in well cultivated corn countries it ought to be more whereas they hardly receive one half of that sum with great defalcations and in very bad payments there are indeed a few glebes in the north pretty considerable but if these and all the rest were in like manner equally divided they would not add five pounds a year to every clergyman therefore whether the condition of the clergy in general among us be justly liable to envy or able to bear a heavy burden which neither the nobility nor gentry nor tradesmen nor farmers will touch with one of their fingers this i say is submitted to the honourable house  one terrible circumstance in this bill is that of turning the tithe of flax and hemp into what the lawyers call a modus or a certain sum in lieu of a tenth part of the product and by this practice of claiming a modus in many parishes by ancient custom the clergy in both kingdoms have been almost incredible sufferers thus in the present case the tithe of a tolerable acre of flax which by a medium is worth twelve shillings is by the present bill reduced to four shillings neither is this the worst part in a modus every determinate sum must in process of time sink from a fourth to a fourandtwentieth part or a great deal lower by that necessary fall attending the value of money which is now at least nine tenths lower all over europe than it was four hundred years ago by a gradual decline and even a third part at least within our own memories in purchasing almost everything required for the necessities or conveniencies of life as any gentleman can attest who hath kept house for twenty years past and this will equally affect poor countries as well as rich for although i look upon it as an impossibility that this kingdom should ever thrive under its present disadvantages which without a miracle must still increase yet when the whole cash of the nation shall sink to fifty thousand pounds we must in all our traffic abroad either of import or export go by the general rate at which money is valued in those countries that enjoy the common privileges of human kind for this reason no corporation if the clergy may presume to call themselves one should by any means grant away their properties in perpetuity upon any consideration whatsoever which is a rock that many corporations have split upon to their great impoverishment and sometimes to their utter undoing because they are supposed to subsist for ever and because no determination of money is of any certain perpetual intrinsic value this is known enough in england where estates let for ever some hundred years ago by several ancient noble families do not at this present pay their posterity a twentieth part of what they are now worth at an easy rate  a tax affecting one part of a nation which already bears its full share in all parliamentary impositions cannot possibly be just except it be inflicted as a punishment upon that body of men which is taxed for some great demerit or danger to the public apprehended from those upon whom it is laid thus the papists and nonjurors have been doubly taxed for refusing to give proper securities to the government which cannot be objected against the clergy and therefore if this bill should pass i think it ought to be with a preface shewing wherein they have offended and for what disaffection or other crime they are punished  if an additional excise upon ale or a duty upon flesh and bread were to be enacted neither the victualler butcher or baker would bear any more of the charge than for what themselves consumed but it would be an equal general tax through the whole kingdom whereas by this bill the clergy alone are avowedly condemned to be deprived of their ancient inherent undisputed rights in order to encourage a manufacture by which all the rest of the kingdom are supposed to be gainers  this bill is directly against magna charta whereof the first clause is for confirming the inviolable rights of holy church as well as contrary to the oath taken by all our kings at their coronation where they swear to defend and protect the church in all its rights  a tax laid upon employments is a very different thing the possessors of civil and military employments are no corporation neither are they any part of our constitution their salaries pay and perquisites are all changeable at the pleasure of the prince who bestows them although the army be paid from funds raised and appropriated by the legislature but the clergy as they have little reason to expect so they desire no more than their ancient legal dues only indeed with the removal of many grievous impediments in the collection of them which it is to be feared they must wait for until more favourable times it is well known that they have already of their own accord shewn great indulgence to their people upon this very article of flax seldom taking above a fourth part of their tithe for small parcels and oftentimes nothing at all from new beginners waiting with patience until the farmers were able and until greater quantities of land were employed in that part of husbandry never suspecting that their good intentions should be perverted in so singular a manner to their detriment by that very assembly which during the time that convocations which are an original part of our constitution ever since christianity became national among us are thought fit to be suspended god knows for what reason or from what provocations i say from that very assembly who during the intervals of convocations should rather be supposed to be guardians of the rights and properties of the clergy than to make the least attempt upon either  i have not heard upon inquiry that any of those gentlemen who among us without doors are called the court party discover the least zeal in this affair if they had thoughts to interpose it might be conceived they would shew their displeasure against this bill which must very much lessen the value of the kings patronage upon promotion to vacant sees in the disposal of deaneries and other considerable preferments in the church which are in the donation of the crown whereby the viceroys will have fewer good preferments to bestow on their dependants as well as upon the kindred of members who may have a sufficient stock of that sort of merit whatever it may be which may in future times most prevail  the dissenters by not succeeding in their endeavours to procure a repeal of the test have lost nothing but continue in full enjoyment of their toleration while the clergy without giving the least offence are by this bill deprived of a considerable branch of their ancient legal rights whereby the schismatical party will have the pleasure of gratifying their revenge hoc graii voluere  the farmer will find no relief by this modus because when his present lease shall expire his landlord will infallibly raise the rent in an equal proportion upon every part of land where flax is sown and have so much a better security for payment at the expense of the clergy  if we judge by things past it little avails that this bill is to be limited to a certain time of ten twenty or thirty years for no landlord will ever consent that a law shall expire by which he finds himself a gainer and of this there are many examples as well in england as in this kingdom  the great end of this bill is by proper encouragement to extend the linen manufacture into those counties where it hath hitherto been little cultivated but this encouragement of lessening the tithe of flax and hemp is one of such a kind as it is to be feared will have a directly contrary effect because if i am rightly informed no set of men hath for their number and fortunes been more industrious and successful than the clergy in introducing that manufacture into places which were unacquainted with it by persuading their people to sow flax and hemp by procuring seed for them and by having them instructed in the management thereof and this they did not without reasonable hopes of increasing the value of their parishes after some time as well as of promoting the benefit of the public but if this modus should take place the clergy will be so far from gaining that they will become losers by any extraordinary care by having their best arable lands turned to flax and hemp which are reckoned great impoverishers of land they cannot therefore be blamed if they should shew as much zeal to prevent its being introduced or improved in their parishes as they hitherto have shewed in the introducing and improving of it this i am told some of them have already declared at least so far as to resolve not to give themselves any more trouble than other men about promoting a manufacture by the success of which they only of all men are to be sufferers perhaps the giving them even a further encouragement than the law doth as it now stands to a set of men who might on many accounts be so useful to this purpose would be no bad method of having the great end of the bill more effectually answered but this is what they are far from desiring all they petition for is no more than to continue on the same footing with the rest of their fellowsubjects  if this modus of paying by the acre be to pass into a law it were to be wished that the same law would appoint one or more sworn surveyors in each parish to measure the lands on which flax and hemp are sown as also would settle the price of surveying and determine whether the incumbent or farmer is to pay for each annual survey without something of this kind there must constantly be disputes between them and the neighbouring justices of peace must be teazed as often as those disputes happen  i had written thus far when a paper was sent to me with several reasons against the bill some whereof although they have been already touched are put in a better light and the rest did not occur to me i shall deliver them in the authors own words  nb some alterations have been made in the bill about the modus since the above paper was writ but they are of little moment                             some  further   reasons  against  the bill for settling the tithe  of  hemp flax c   i that tithes are the patrimony of the church and if not of divine original yet at least of great antiquity  ii that all purchases and leases of titheable lands for many centuries past have been made and taken subject to the demand of tithes and those lands sold and taken just so much the cheaper on that account  iii that if any lands are exempted from tithes or the legal demands of such tithes lessened by act of parliament so much value is taken from the proprietor of the tithes and vested in the proprietor of the lands or his head tenants  iv that no innocent unoffending person can be so deprived of his property without the greatest violation of common justice  v that to do this upon a prospect of encouraging the linen or any other manufacture is acting upon a very mistaken and unjust supposition inasmuch as the price of the lands so occupied will be no way lessened to the farmer by such a law  vi that the clergy are content cheerfully to bear as they now do any burden in common with their fellowsubjects either for the support of his majestys government or the encouragement of the trade of the nation but think it very hard that they should be singled out to pay heavier taxes than others at a time when by the decrease of the value of their parishes they are less able to bear them  vii that the legislature hath heretofore distinguished the clergy by exemptions and not by additional loads and the present clergy of the kingdom hope they have not deserved worse of the legislature than their predecessors  viii that by the original constitution of these kingdoms the clergy had the sole right of taxing themselves and were in possession of that right as low as the restoration and if that right be now devolved upon the commons by the cession of the clergy the commons can be considered in this case in no other light than as the guardians of the clergy  ix that besides those tithes always in the possession of the clergy there are some portion of tithes lately come into their possession by purchase that if this clause should take place they would not be allowed the benefit of these purchases upon an equal footing of advantage with the rest of their fellowsubjects and that some tithes in the hands of impropriators are under settlements and mortgages  x that the gentlemen of this house should consider that loading the clergy is loading their own younger brothers and children with this additional grievance that it is taking from the younger and poorer to give to the elder and richer and  lastly that if it were at any time just and proper to do this it would however be too severe to do it now when all the tithes of the kingdom are known for some years past to have sunk above onethird part in their value  any income in the hands of the clergy is at least as useful to the public as the same income in the hands of the laity  it were more reasonable to grant the clergy in three parts of the nation an additional support than to diminish their present subsistence  great employments are and will be in the hands of englishmen nothing left for the younger sons of irishmen but vicarages tidewaiters places c therefore no reason to make them worse  the modus upon the flax in england affects only lands reclaimed since the year 1690 and is at the rate of five shillings the english acre which is equivalent to eight shillings and eightpence irish and that to be paid before the farmer removed it from the field flax is a manufacture of little consequence in england but is the staple in ireland and if it increases as it probably will must in many places jostle out corn because it is more gainful  the clergy of the established church have no interest like those of the church of rome distinct from the true interest of their country and therefore ought to suffer under no distinct impositions or taxes of any kind  the bill for settling the modus of flax in england was brought in in the first year of the reign of king george i when the clergy lay very unjustly under the imputation of some disaffection and to encourage the bringing in of some fens in lincolnshire which were not to be continued under flax but it left all lands where flax had been sown before that time under the same condition of tithing in which they were before the passing of that bill whereas this bill takes away what the clergy are actually possessed of  that the woollen manufacture is the staple of england as the linen is that of ireland yet no attempt was ever made in england to reduce the tithe of wool for the encouragement of that manufacture  this manufacture hath already been remarkably favoured by the clergy who have hitherto been generally content with less than halfsome with sixpence a gardenand some have taken nothing  employments they say have been taxed the reasons for which taxation will not hold with regard to property at least till employments become inheritances  the commons always have had so tender a regard to property that they never would suffer any law to pass whereby any particular persons might be aggrieved without their own consent                             an essay  on the  fates of clergymen   note  this essay was first printed in nos v and vii of the intelligencer dublin 1728 in that periodical it bore the title a description of what the world calls discretion and had the following lines from ben jonson as a text    described its thus defined would you it have   then the worlds honest mans an errant knave  the text here printed is based on the original issue and collated with the miscellanies vol iii of 1732 and the miscellanies vol ii 1747  ts     an essay on the fates of   clergymen   there is no talent so useful towards rising in the world or which puts men more out of the reach of fortune than that quality generally possessed by the dullest sort of people and is in common speech called discretion a species of lower prudence by the assistance of which people of the meanest intellectuals without any other qualification pass through the world in great tranquillity and with universal good treatment neither giving nor taking offence courts are seldom unprovided of persons under this character on whom if they happen to be of great quality most employments even the greatest naturally fall when competitors will not agree and in such promotions nobody rejoices or grieves the truth of this i could prove by several instances within my own memory for i say nothing of present times  and indeed as regularity and forms are of great use in carrying on the business of the world so it is very convenient that persons endued with this kind of discretion should have that share which is proper to their talents in the conduct of affairs but by no means meddle in matters which require genius learning strong comprehension quickness of conception magnanimity generosity sagacity or any other superior gift of human minds because this sort of discretion is usually attended with a strong desire of money and few scruples about the way of obtaining it with servile flattery and submission with a want of all public spirit or principle with a perpetual wrong judgment when the owners come into power and high place how to dispose of favour and preferment having no measures for merit and virtue in others but those very steps by which themselves ascended nor the least intention of doing good or hurt to the public farther than either one or tother is likely to be subservient to their own security or interest thus being void of all friendship and enmity they never complain or find fault with the times and indeed never have reason to do so  men of eminent parts and abilities as well as virtues do sometimes rise in the court sometimes in the law and sometimes even in the church such were the lord bacon the earl of strafford archbishop laud in the reign of king charles i and others in our own times whom i shall not name but these and many more under different princes and in different kingdoms were disgraced or banished or suffered death merely in envy to their virtues and superior genius which emboldened them in great exigencies and distresses of state wanting a reasonable infusion of this aldermanly discretion to attempt the service of their prince and country out of the common forms  this evil fortune which generally attends extraordinary men in the management of great affairs has been imputed to divers causes that need not be here set down when so obvious a one occurs if what a certain writer observes be true that when a great genius appears in the world the dunces are all in confederacy against him and if this be his fate when he employs his talents1 wholly in his closet without interfering with any mans ambition or avarice what must he expect when he ventures out to seek for preferment in a court but universal opposition when he is mounting the ladder and every hand ready to turn him off when he is at the top and in this point fortune generally acts directly contrary to nature for in nature we find that bodies full of life and spirits mount easily and are hard to fall whereas heavy bodies are hard to rise and come down with greater velocity in proportion to their weight but we find fortune every day acting just the reverse of this  footnote 1 and thus although he employs his talents this is the reading of the intelligencer ts  this talent of discretion as i have described it in its several adjuncts and circumstances is nowhere so serviceable as to the clergy to whose preferment nothing is so fatal as the character of wit politeness in reading or manners or that kind of behaviour which we contract by having too much conversation with persons of high station and eminency these qualifications being reckoned by the vulgar of all ranks to be marks of levity which is the last crime the world will pardon in a clergyman to this i may add a free manner of speaking in mixed company and too frequent an appearance in places of much resort which are equally noxious to spiritual promotion  i have known indeed a few exceptions to some parts of these observations2 i have seen some of the dullest men alive aiming at wit and others with as little pretensions affecting politeness in manners and discourse but never being able to persuade the world of their guilt they grew into considerable stations upon the firm assurance which all people had of their discretion because they were of a size too low to deceive the world to their own disadvantage but this i confess is a trial too dangerous often to engage in  footnote 2 this word is regulations in the intelligencer ts  there is a known story of a clergyman who was recommended for a preferment by some great men at court to an archbishop3 his grace said he had heard that the clergyman used to play at whist and swobbers4 that as to playing now and then a sober game at whist for pastime it might be pardoned but he could not digest those wicked swobbers and it was with some pains that my lord somers could undeceive him i ask by what talents we may suppose that great prelate ascended so high or what sort of qualifications he would expect in those whom he took into his patronage or would probably recommend to court for the government of distant churches  footnote 3 archbishop tenison who by all contemporary accounts was a very dull man there was a bitter sarcasm upon him usually ascribed to swift that he was as hot and heavy as a tailors goose s  in the intelligencer the word archbishop is replaced by the letters abct ts  footnote 4 swobbers were four privileged cards used at one time for betting purposes in the game of whist ts  two clergymen in my memory stood candidates for a small free school in yorkshire where a gentleman of quality and interest in the country who happened to have a better understanding than his neighbours procured the place for him who was the better scholar and more gentlemanly person of the two very much to the regret of all the parish the other being disappointed came up to london where he became the greatest pattern of this lower discretion that i have known and possessed it with as heavy intellectuals which together with the coldness of his temper and gravity of his deportment carried him safe through many difficulties and he lived and died in a great station while his competitor is too obscure for fame to tell us what became of him  this species of discretion which i so much celebrate and do most heartily recommend hath one advantage not yet mentioned that it will carry a man safe through all the malice and variety of parties so far that whatever faction happens to be uppermost his claim is usually allowed for a share of what is going and the thing seems to me highly reasonable for in all great changes the prevailing side is usually so tempestuous that it wants the ballast of those whom the world calls moderate men and i call men of discretion whom people in power may with little ceremony load as heavy as they please drive them through the hardest and deepest roads without danger of foundering or breaking their backs and will be sure to find them neither rusty nor vicious  i5 will here give the reader a short history of two clergymen in england the characters of each and the progress of their fortunes in the world by which the force of worldly discretion and the bad consequences from the want of that virtue will strongly appear  footnote 5 in the intelligencer no v this paragraph reads as follows in some following paper i will give the reader a short history of two clergymen in england the characters of each and the progress of their fortunes in the world by which the force of worldly discretion and the bad consequences from the want of that virtue will strongly appear in no vii the subject is continued as in the next paragraph ts  corusodes an oxford student and a farmers son was never absent from prayers or lecture nor once out of his college after tom had tolled he spent every day ten hours in his closet in reading his courses dozing clipping papers or darning his stockings which last he performed to admiration he could be soberly drunk at the expense of others with college ale and at those seasons was always most devout he wore the same gown five years without draggling or tearing he never once looked into a playbook or a poem he read virgil and ramus in the same cadence but with a very different taste he never understood a jest or had the least conception of wit  for one saying he stands in renown to this day being with some other students over a pot of ale one of the company said so many pleasant things that the rest were much diverted only corusodes was silent and unmoved when they parted he called this merry companion aside and said sir i perceive by your often speaking and your friends laughing that you spoke many jests and you could not but observe my silence but sir this is my humour i never make a jest myself nor ever laugh at another mans  corusodes thus endowed got into holy orders having by the most extreme parsimony saved thirtyfour pounds out of a very beggarly fellowship he went up to london where his sister was waitingwoman to a lady and so good a solicitor that by her means he was admitted to read prayers in the family twice aday at fourteen1 shillings a month he had now acquired a low obsequious awkward bow and a talent of gross flattery both in and out of season he would shake the butler by the hand he taught the page his catechism and was sometimes admitted to dine at the stewards table in short he got the good word of the whole family and was recommended by my lady for chaplain to some other noble houses by which his revenue besides vales amounted to about thirty pounds ayear his sister procured him a scarf from my lord who had a small design of gallantry upon her and by his lordships solicitation he got a lectureship in town of sixty pounds ayear where he preached constantly in person in a grave manner with an audible voice a style ecclesiastic and the matter such as it was well suited to the intellectuals of his hearers some time after a country living fell in my lords disposal and his lordship who had now some encouragement given him of success in his amour bestowed the living on corusodes who still kept his lectureship and residence in town where he was a constant attendant at all meetings relating to charity without ever contributing further than his frequent pious exhortations if any woman of better fashion in the parish happened to be absent from church they were sure of a visit from him in a day or two to chide and to dine with them  footnote 6 scott has ten shillings ts  he had a select number of poor constantly attending at the street door of his lodgings for whom he was a common solicitor to his former patroness dropping in his own halfcrown among the collection and taking it out when he disposed of the money at a person of qualitys house he would never sit down till he was thrice bid and then upon the corner of the most distant chair his whole demeanour was formal and starch which adhered so close that he could never shake it off in his highest promotion  his lord was now in high employment at court and attended by him with the most abject assiduity and his sister being gone off with child to a private lodging my lord continued his graces to corusodes got him to be a chaplain in ordinary and in due time a parish in town and a dignity in the church  he paid his curates punctually at the lowest salary and partly out of the communion money but gave them good advice in abundance he married a citizens widow who taught him to put out small sums at ten per cent and brought him acquainted with jobbers in changealley by her dexterity he sold the clerkship of his parish when it became vacant  he kept a miserable house but the blame was laid wholly upon madam for the good doctor was always at his books or visiting the sick or doing other offices of charity and piety in his parish  he treated all his inferiors of the clergy with a most sanctified pride was rigorously and universally censorious upon all his brethren of the gown on their first appearance in the world or while they continued meanly preferred but gave large allowance to the laity of high rank or great riches using neither eyes nor ears for their faults he was never sensible of the least corruption in courts parliaments or ministries but made the most favourable constructions of all public proceedings and power in whatever hands or whatever party was always secure of his most charitable opinion he had many wholesome maxims ready to excuse all miscarriages of state men are but men erunt vitia donec homines and quod supra nos nil ad nos with several others of equal weight  it would lengthen my paper beyond measure to trace out the whole system of his conduct his dreadful apprehensions of popery his great moderation toward dissenters of all denominations with hearty wishes that by yielding somewhat on both sides there might be a general union among protestants his short inoffensive sermons in his turns at court and the matter exactly suited to the present juncture of prevailing opinions the arts he used to obtain a mitre by writing against episcopacy and the proofs he gave of his loyalty by palliating or defending the murder of a martyred prince  endowed with all these accomplishments we leave him in the full career of success mounting fast toward the top of the ladder ecclesiastical which he hath a fair probability to reach without the merit of one single virtue moderately stocked with the least valuable parts of erudition utterly devoid of all taste judgment or genius and in his grandeur naturally choosing to haul up others after him whose accomplishments most resemble his own except his beloved sons nephews or other kindred be in competition or lastly except his inclinations be diverted by those who have power to mortify or further advance him  eugenio set out from the same university and about the same time with corusodes he had the reputation of an arch lad at school and was unfortunately possessed with a talent for poetry on which account he received many chiding letters from his father and grave advice from his tutor he did not neglect his college learning but his chief study was the authors of antiquity with a perfect knowledge in the greek and roman tongues he could never procure himself to be chosen fellow for it was objected against him that he had written verses and particularly some wherein he glanced at a certain reverend doctor famous for dulness that he been seen bowing to ladies as he met them in the streets and it was proved that once he had been found dancing in a private family with half a dozen of both sexes  he was the younger son to a gentleman of good birth but small estate and his father dying he was driven to london to seek his fortune he got into orders and became reader in a parish church at twenty pounds ayear was carried by an oxford friend to wills coffeehouse frequented in those days by men of wit where in some time he had the bad luck to be distinguished his scanty salary compelled him to run deep in debt for a new gown and cassock and now and then forced him to write some paper of wit or humour or preach a sermon for ten shillings to supply his necessities he was a thousand times recommended by his poetical friends to great persons as a young man of excellent parts who deserved encouragement and received a thousand promises but his modesty and a generous spirit which disdained the slavery of continual application and attendance always disappointed him making room for vigilant dunces who were sure to be never out of sight  he had an excellent faculty in preaching if he were not sometimes a little too refined and apt to trust too much to his own way of thinking and reasoning  when upon the vacancy of a preferment he was hardly drawn to attend upon some promising lord he received the usual answer that he came too late for it had been given to another the very day before and he had only this comfort left that everybody said it was a thousand pities something could not be done for poor mr eugenio  the remainder of his story will be dispatched in a few words wearied with weak hopes and weaker pursuits he accepted a curacy in derbyshire of thirty pounds ayear and when he was fiveandforty had the great felicity to be preferred by a friend of his fathers to a vicarage worth annually sixty pounds in the most desert parts of lincolnshire where his spirit quite sunk with those reflections that solitude and disappointments bring he married a farmers widow and is still alive utterly undistinguished and forgotten only some of the neighbours have accidentally heard that he had been a notable man in his youth                             concerning that  universal hatred  which prevails  against the clergy   may 24 1736  i have been long considering and conjecturing what could be the causes of that great disgust of late against the clergy of both kingdoms beyond what was ever known till that monster and tyrant henry viii who took away from them against law reason and justice at least twothirds of their legal possessions and whose successors except queen mary went on with their rapine till the accession of king james i that detestable tyrant henry viii although he abolished the popes power in england as universal bishop yet what he did in that article however just it were in itself was the mere effect of his irregular appetite to divorce himself from a wife he was weary of for a younger and more beautiful woman whom he afterwards beheaded but at the same time he was an entire defender of all the popish doctrines even those which were the most absurd and while he put people to death for denying him to be head of the church he burned every offender against the doctrines of the roman faith and cut off the head of sir thomas more a person of the greatest virtue this kingdom ever produced for not directly owning him to be head of the church among all the princes who ever reigned in the world there was never so infernal a beast as henry viii in every vice of the most odious kind without any one appearance of virtue but cruelty lust rapine and atheism were his peculiar talents he rejected the power of the pope for no other reason than to give his full swing to commit sacrilege in which no tyrant since christianity became national did ever equal him by many degrees the abbeys endowed with lands by the mistaken notions of welldisposed men were indeed too numerous and hurtful to the kingdom and therefore the legislature might after the reformation have justly applied them to some pious or public uses  in a very few centuries after christianity became national in most parts of europe although the church of rome had already introduced many corruptions in religion yet the piety of early christians as well as new converts was so great and particularly of princes as well as noblemen and other wealthy persons that they built many religious houses for those who were inclined to live in a recluse or solitary manner endowing those monasteries with land it is true we read of monks some ages before who dwelt in caves and cells in desert places but when public edifices were erected and endowed they began gradually to degenerate into idleness ignorance avarice ambition and luxury after the usual fate of all human institutions the popes who had already aggrandized themselves laid hold of the opportunity to subject all religious houses with their priors and abbots to their peculiar authority whereby these religious orders became of an interest directly different from the rest of mankind and wholly at the popes devotion i need say no more on this article so generally known and so frequently treated or of the frequent endeavours of some other princes as well as our own to check the growth and wealth and power of the regulars  in later times this mistaken piety of erecting and endowing abbeys began to decrease and therefore when some newinvented sect of monks and friars began to start up not being able to procure grants of land they got leave from the pope to appropriate the tithes and glebes of certain parishes as contiguous or near as they could find obliging themselves to send out some of their body to take care of the peoples souls and if some of those parishes were at too great a distance from the abbey the monks appointed to attend them were paid for the cure either a small stipend of a determined sum or sometimes a third part or what are now called the vicarial tithes  as to the churchlands it hath been the opinion of many writers that in england they amounted to a third part of the whole kingdom and therefore if that wicked prince abovementioned when he had cast off the popes power had introduced some reformation in religion he could not have been blamed for taking away the abbeylands by authority of parliament but when he continued the most cruel persecutor of all those who differed in the least article of the popish religion which was then the national and established faith his seizing on those lands and applying them to profane uses was absolute sacrilege in the strongest sense of the word having been bequeathed by princes and pious men to sacred uses  in the reign of this prince the church and court of rome had arrived to such a height of corruption in doctrine and discipline as gave great offence to many wise learned and pious men through most parts of europe and several countries agreed to make some reformation in religion but although a proper and just reformation were allowed to be necessary even to preserve christianity itself yet the passions and vices of men had mingled themselves so far as to pervert and confound all the good endeavours of those who intended well and thus the reformation in every country where it was attempted was carried on in the most impious and scandalous manner that can possibly be conceived to which unhappy proceedings we owe all the just reproachings that roman catholics have cast upon us ever since for when the northern kingdoms and states grew weary of the popes tyranny and when their preachers beginning with the scandalous abuses of indulgencies and proceeding farther to examine several points of faith had credit enough with their princes who were in some fear lest such a change might affect the peace of their countries because their bishops had great influence on the people by their wealth and power these politic teachers had a ready answer to this purpose sir your majesty need not be in any pain or apprehension take away the lands and sink the authority of the bishops bestow those lands on your courtiers on your nobles and your great officers in your army and then you will be secure of the people this advice was exactly followed and in the protestant monarchies abroad little more than the shadow of episcopacy is left but in the republics is wholly extinct  in england the reformation was brought in after a somewhat different manner but upon the same principle of robbing the church however henry viii with great dexterity discovered an invention to gratify his insatiable thirst for blood on both religions

just then published the note introducing the reprint is signed tb but neither the note nor tbs remarks are of much importance the present text is that of scott and collated with the quarto edition of swifts works vol viii 1765  ts     thoughts on religion   i am in all opinions to believe according to my own impartial reason which i am bound to inform and improve as far as my capacity and opportunities will permit  it may be prudent in me to act sometimes by other mens reason but i can think only by my own  if another mans reason fully convinceth me it becomes my own reason  to say a man is bound to believe is neither truth nor sense  you may force men by interest or punishment to say or swear they believe and to act as if they believed you can go no further  every man as a member of the commonwealth ought to be content with the possession of his own opinion in private without perplexing his neighbour or disturbing the public  violent zeal for truth hath an hundred to one odds to be either petulancy ambition or pride  there is a degree of corruption wherein some nations as bad as the world is will proceed to an amendment till which time particular men should be quiet  to remove opinions fundamental in religion is impossible and the attempt wicked whether those opinions be true or false unless your avowed design be to abolish that religion altogether so for instance in the famous doctrine of christs divinity which hath been universally received by all bodies of christians since the condemnation of arianism under constantine and his successors wherefore the proceedings of the socinians are both vain and unwarrantable because they will be never able to advance their own opinion or meet any other success than breeding doubts and disturbances in the world qui ratione suae disturbant moenia mundi  the want of belief is a defect that ought to be concealed when it cannot be overcome  the christian religion in the most early times was proposed to the jews and heathens without the article of christs divinity which i remember erasmus accounts for by its being too strong a meat for babes perhaps if it were now softened by the chinese missionaries the conversion of those infidels would be less difficult and we find by the alcoran it is the great stumblingblock of the mahometans but in a country already christian to bring so fundamental a point of faith into debate can have no consequences that are not pernicious to morals and public peace  i have been often offended to find st pauls allegories and other figures of grecian eloquence converted by divines into articles of faith  gods mercy is over all his works but divines of all sorts lessen that mercy too much  i look upon myself in the capacity of a clergyman to be one appointed by providence for defending a post assigned me and for gaining over as many enemies as i can although i think my cause is just yet one great motive is my submitting to the pleasure of providence and to the laws of my country  i am not answerable to god for the doubts that arise in my own breast since they are the consequence of that reason which he hath planted in me if i take care to conceal those doubts from others if i use my best endeavours to subdue them and if they have no influence on the conduct of my life  i believe that thousands of men would be orthodox enough in certain points if divines had not been too curious or too narrow in reducing orthodoxy within the compass of subtleties niceties and distinctions with little warrant from scripture and less from reason or good policy  i never saw heard nor read that the clergy were beloved in any nation where christianity was the religion of the country nothing can render them popular but some degree of persecution  those fine gentlemen who affect the humour of railing at the clergy are i think bound in honour to turn parsons themselves and shew us better examples  miserable mortals can we contribute to the honour and glory of god i wish that expression were struck out of our prayerbooks  liberty of conscience properly speaking is no more than the liberty of possessing our own thoughts and opinions which every man enjoys without fear of the magistrate but how far he shall publicly act in pursuance of those opinions is to be regulated by the laws of the country perhaps in my own thoughts i prefer a wellinstituted commonwealth before a monarchy and i know several others of the same opinion now if upon this pretence i should insist upon liberty of conscience form conventicles of republicans and print books preferring that government and condemning what is established the magistrate would with great justice hang me and my disciples it is the same case in religion although not so avowed where liberty of conscience under the present acceptation equally produces revolutions or at least convulsions and disturbances in a state which politicians would see well enough if their eyes were not blinded by faction and of which these kingdoms as well as france sweden and other countries are flaming instances cromwells notion upon this article was natural and right when upon the surrender of a town in ireland the popish governor insisted upon an article for liberty of conscience cromwell said he meddled with no mans conscience but if by liberty of conscience the governor meant the liberty of the mass he had express orders from the parliament of england against admitting any such liberty at all  it is impossible that anything so natural so necessary and so universal as death should ever have been designed by providence as an evil to mankind  although reason were intended by providence to govern our passions yet it seems that in two points of the greatest moment to the being and continuance of the world god hath intended our passions to prevail over reason the first is the propagation of our species since no wise man ever married from the dictates of reason the other is the love of life which from the dictates of reason every man would despise and wish it at an end or that it never had a beginning                             further thoughts on  religion   the scripture system of mans creation is what christians are bound to believe and seems most agreeable of all others to probability and reason adam was formed from a piece of clay and eve from one of his ribs the text mentioneth nothing of his makers intending him for except to rule over the beasts of the field and birds of the air as to eve it doth not appear that her husband was her monarch only she was to be his help meet and placed in some degree of subjection however before his fall the beasts were his most obedient subjects whom he governed by absolute power after his eating the forbidden fruit the course of nature was changed the animals began to reject his government some were able to escape by flight and others were too fierce to be attacked the scripture mentioneth no particular acts of royalty in adam over his posterity who were cotemporary with him or of any monarch until after the flood whereof the first was nimrod the mighty hunter who as milton expresseth it made men and not beasts his prey for men were easier caught by promises and subdued by the folly or treachery of their own species whereas the brutes prevailed only by their courage or strength which among them are peculiar to certain kinds lions bears elephants and some other animals are strong or valiant and their species never degenerates in their native soil except they happen to be enslaved or destroyed by human fraud but men degenerate every day merely by the folly the perverseness the avarice the tyranny the pride the treachery or inhumanity of their own kind   three prayers  used by the dean for mrs johnson  in her last sickness 17271  footnote 1 dr swift after his return to ireland in the beginning of october 1727 having visited her stella frequently during her sickness not only as a friend but a clergyman he used the following prayers on that occasion which are here printed from his own handwriting note in volume viii of swifts works dublin 1746   i  a prayer for stella  almighty and most gracious lord god extend we beseech thee thy pity and compassion towards this thy languishing servant teach her to place her hope and confidence entirely in thee give her a true sense of the emptiness and vanity of all earthly things make her truly sensible of all the infirmities of her life past and grant to her such a true sincere repentance as is not to be repented of preserve her o lord in a sound mind and understanding during this thy visitation keep her from both the sad extremes of presumption and despair if thou shalt please to restore her to her former health give her grace to be ever mindful of that mercy and to keep those good resolutions she now makes in her sickness so that no length of time nor prosperity may entice her to forget them let no thought of her misfortunes distract her mind and prevent the means towards her recovery or disturb her in her preparations for a better life we beseech thee also o lord of thy infinite goodness to remember the good actions of this thy servant that the naked she hath clothed the hungry she hath fed the sick and the fatherless whom she hath relieved may be reckoned according to thy gracious promise as if they had been done unto thee hearken o lord to the prayers offered up by the friends of this thy servant in her behalf and especially those now made by us unto thee give thy blessing to those endeavours used for her recovery but take from her all violent desire either of life or death further than with resignation to thy holy will and now o lord we implore thy gracious favour towards us here met together grant that the sense of this thy servants weakness may add strength to our faith that we considering the infirmities of our nature and the uncertainty of life may by this example be drawn to repentance before it shall please thee to visit us in the like manner accept these prayers we beseech thee for the sake of thy dear son jesus christ our lord who with thee and the holy ghost liveth and reigneth ever one god world without end amen   ii  a prayer used by the dean for mrs johnson in her  last  sickness written oct 17 1727  most merciful father accept our humblest prayers in behalf of this thy languishing servant forgive the sins the frailties and infirmities of her life past accept the good deeds she hath done in such a manner that at whatever time thou shalt please to call her she may be received into everlasting habitations give her grace to continue sincerely thankful to thee for the many favours thou hast bestowed upon her the ability and inclination and practice to do good and those virtues which have procured the esteem and love of her friends and a most unspotted name in the world o god thou dispensest thy blessings and thy punishments as it becometh infinite justice and mercy and since it was thy pleasure to afflict her with a long constant weakly state of health make her truly sensible that it was for very wise ends and was largely made up to her in other blessings more valuable and less common continue to her o lord that firmness and constancy of mind where with thou hast most graciously endowed her together with that contempt of worldly things and vanities that she hath shewn in the whole conduct of her life o allpowerful being the least motion of whose will can create or destroy a world pity us the mournful friends of thy distressed servant who sink under the weight of her present condition and the fear of losing the most valuable of our friends restore her to us o lord if it be thy gracious will or inspire us with constancy and resignation to support ourselves under so heavy an affliction restore her o lord for the sake of those poor who by losing her will be desolate and those sick who will not only want her bounty but her care and tending or else in thy mercy raise up some other in her place with equal disposition and better abilities lessen o lord we beseech thee her bodily pains or give her a double strength of mind to support them and if thou wilt soon take her to thyself turn our thoughts rather upon that felicity which we hope she shall enjoy than upon that unspeakable loss we shall endure let her memory be ever dear unto us and the example of her many virtues as far as human infirmity will admit our constant imitation accept o lord these prayers poured from the very bottom of our hearts in thy mercy and for the merits of our blessed saviour amen   iii  written nov 6 1727  o merciful father who never afflictest thy children but for their own good and with justice over which thy mercy always prevaileth either to turn them to repentance or to punish them in the present life in order to reward them in a better take pity we beseech thee upon this thy poor afflicted servant languishing so long and so grievously under the weight of thy hand give her strength o lord to support her weakness and patience to endure her pains without repining at thy correction forgive every rash and inconsiderate expression which her anguish may at any time force from her tongue while her heart continueth in an entire submission to thy will suppress in her o lord all eager desires of life and lessen her fears of death by inspiring into her an humble yet assured hope of thy mercy give her a sincere repentance for all her transgressions and omissions and a firm resolution to pass the remainder of her life in endeavouring to her utmost to observe all thy precepts we beseech thee likewise to compose her thoughts and preserve to her the use of her memory and reason during the course of her sickness give her a true conception of the vanity folly and insignificancy of all human things and strengthen her so as to beget in her a sincere love of thee in the midst of her sufferings accept and impute all her good deeds and forgive her all those offences against thee which she hath sincerely repented of or through the frailty of memory hath forgot and now o lord we turn to thee in behalf of ourselves and the rest of her sorrowful friends let not our grief afflict her mind and thereby have an ill effect on her present distempers forgive the sorrow and weakness of those among us who sink under the grief and terror of losing so dear and useful a friend accept and pardon our most earnest prayers and wishes for her longer continuance in this evil world to do what thou art pleased to call thy service and is only her bounden duty that she may be still a comfort to us and to all others who will want the benefit of her conversation her advice her good offices or her charity and since thou hast promised that where two or three are gathered together in thy name thou wilt be in the midst of them to grant their request o gracious lord grant to us who are here met in thy name that those requests which in the utmost sincerity and earnestness of our hearts we have now made in behalf of this thy distressed servant and of ourselves may effectually be answered through the merits of jesus christ our lord amen   an evening prayer  from the original manuscript found amongst dr lyons papers  oh almighty god the searcher of all hearts and from whom no secrets are hid who hast declared that all such as shall draw nigh to thee with their lips when their hearts are far from thee are an abomination unto thee cleanse we beseech thee the thoughts of our hearts by the inspiration of thy holy spirit that no wandering vain nor idle thoughts may put out of our minds that reverence and godly fear that becomes all those who come in thy presence  we know o lord that while we are in these bodies we are absent from the lord for no man can see thy face and live the only way that we can draw near unto thee in this life is by prayer but o lord we know not how to pray nor what to ask for as we ought we cannot pretend by our supplications or prayers to turn or change thee for thou art the same yesterday today and for ever but the coming into thy presence the drawing near unto thee is the only means to be changed ourselves to become like thee in holiness and purity to be followers of thee as thy dear children o therefore turn not away thy face from us but let us see so much of the excellencies of thy divine nature of thy goodness and justice and mercy and forbearance and holiness and purity as may make us hate everything in ourselves that is unlike to thee that so we may abhor and repent of and forsake those sins that we so often fall into when we forget thee lord we acknowledge and confess we have lived in a course of sin and folly and vanity from our youth up forgetting our latter end and our great account that we must one day make and turning a deaf ear to thy many calls to us either by thy holy word by our teachers or by our own consciences and even thy more severe messages by afflictions sicknesses crosses and disappointments have not been of force enough to turn us from the vanity and folly of our own ways what then can we expect in justice when thou shalt enter into judgment with us but to have our portion with the hypocrites and unbelievers to depart for ever from the presence of the lord to be turned into hell with those that forget god but o god most holy o god most mighty o holy and most merciful saviour deliver us not into the bitter pains of eternal death but have mercy upon us most merciful father and forgive us our sins for thy names sake for thou hast declared thyself to be a god slow to anger full of goodness forbearance and longsuffering and forgiving iniquity transgression and sin o lord therefore shew thy mercy upon us o let it be in pardoning our sins past and in changing our natures in giving us a new heart and a new spirit that we may lead a new life and walk before thee in newness of life that so sin may not have dominion over us for the time to come o let thy good spirit without which we can do nothing o let that work in us both to will and do such things as may be well pleasing to thee o let it change our thoughts and minds and take them off the vain pleasures of this world and place them there where only the true joys are to be found o fill our minds every day more and more with the happiness of that blessed state of living for ever with thee that we may make it our great work and business to work out our salvationto improve in the knowledge of thee whom to know is life eternal but lord since we cannot know thee but by often drawing near unto thee and coming into thy presence which in this life we can do only by prayer o make us therefore ever sensible of these great benefits of prayer that we may rejoice at all opportunities of coming into thy presence and may ever find ourselves the better and more heavenly minded by it and may never wilfully neglect any opportunity of thy worship and service awaken thoroughly in us a serious sense of these things that so today while it is called today we may see and know the things that belong to our peace before they be hid from our eyes before that long night cometh when no man can work o that every night may so effectually put us in mind of our last that we may every day take care so to live as we shall then wish we had lived when we come to die that so when that night shall come we may as willingly put off these bodies as we now put off our clothes and may rejoice to rest from our labours and that our war with the world the devil and our own corrupt nature is at an end in the meanwhile we beseech thee to take us and ours and all that belongs to us into thy fatherly care this night let thy holy angels be our guard while we are not in a condition to defend ourselves that we may not be under the power of devils or wicked men and preserve us also o lord from every evil accident that after a comfortable and refreshing sleep we may find ourselves and all that belongs to us in peace and safety and now o lord being ourselves still in the body and compassed about with infirmities we can neither be ignorant nor unmindful of the sufferings of our fellowcreatures o lord we must acknowledge that they are all but the effects of sin and therefore we beseech thee so to sanctify their several chastisements to them that at length they may bring forth the peaceable fruits of righteousness and then be thou graciously pleased to remove thy heavy and afflicting hand from them and o that the rest of mankind who are not under such trials may by thy goodness be led to repentance that the consciences of hardhearted sinners may be awakened and the understandings of poor ignorant creatures enlightened and that all that love and fear thee may ever find the joy and comfort of a good conscience beyond all the satisfactions that this world can afford and now blessed lord from whom every good gift comes it is meet right and our bounden duty that we should offer up unto thee our thanks and praise for all thy goodness towards us for preserving peace in our land the light of thy gospel and the true religion in our churches for giving us the fruits of the earth in due season and preserving us from the plague and sickness that rages in other lands we bless thee for that support and maintenance which thou art pleased to afford us and that thou givest us a heart to be sensible of this thy goodness and to return our thanks at this time for the same and as to our persons for that measure of health that any of us do enjoy which is more than any of us do deserve we bless thee more particularly for thy protection over us the day past that thy good spirit has kept us from falling into even the greatest sins which by our wicked and corrupt nature we should greedily have been hurried into and that by the guard of thy holy angels we have been kept safe from any of those evils that might have befallen us and which many are now groaning under who rose up in the morning in safety and peace as well as we but above all for that great mercy of contriving and effecting our redemption by the death of our saviour jesus christ whom of thy great love to mankind thou didst send into this world to take upon him our flesh to teach us thy will and to bear the guilt of our transgressions to die for our sins and to rise again for our justification and for enabling us to lay hold of that salvation by the gracious assistances of thy holy spirit lord grant that the sense of this wonderful love of thine to us may effectually encourage us to walk in thy fear and live to thy glory that so when we shall put off this mortal state we may be made partakers of that glory that shall then be revealed which we beg of thee for the sake of thy son jesus christ who died to procure it for us and in whose name and words we do offer up the desires of our souls unto thee saying  our father c   observations  on  heylins history of the presbyterians1  footnote 1 written by the dean in the beginning of the book on one of the blank leaves note in vol ix 1775 edition of swifts works  this book by some errors and neglects in the style seems not to have received the authors2 last correction it is written with some vehemence very pardonable in one who had been an observer and a sufferer in england under that diabolical fanatic sect which then destroyed church and state but by comparing in my memory what i have read in other histories he neither aggravates nor falsifies any facts his partiality appears chiefly in setting the actions of the calvinists in the strongest light without equally dwelling on those of the other side which however to say the truth was not his proper business and yet he might have spent some more words on the inhuman massacre of paris and other parts of france which no provocation and yet the king had the greatest possible could excuse or much extenuate the author according to the current opinion of the age he lived in had too high notions of regal power led by the common mistake of the term supreme magistrate and not rightly distinguishing between the legislature and administration into which mistake the clergy fell or continued in the reign of charles ii as i have shewn and explained in a treatise c j swift march 6 17278  footnote 2 peter heylin dd 16001662 was born at burford
