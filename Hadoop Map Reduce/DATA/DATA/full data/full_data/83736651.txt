     ariadne florentina                              lecture i               definition of the art of engraving   1 the entrance on my duty for today begins the fourth year of my official work in oxford and i doubt not that some of my audience are asking themselves very doubtfullyat all events i ask myself very anxiouslywhat has been done  for practical result i have not much to show i announced a fortnight since that i would meet the day before yesterday any gentleman who wished to attend this course for purposes of study my class so minded numbers four of whom three wish to be artists and ought not therefore by rights to be at oxford at all and the fourth is the last remaining unit of the class i had last year  2 yet i neither in this reproach myself nor if i could would i reproach the students who are not here i do not reproach myself for it was impossible for me to attend properly to the schools and to write the grammar for them at the same time and i do not blame the absent students for not attending a school from which i have generally been absent myself in all this there is much to be mended but in true light nothing to be regretted  i say i had to write my school grammar these three volumes of lectures under my handa contain carefully set down the things i want you first to know none of my writings are done fluently the second volume of modern painters was all of it written twicemost of it four timesover and these lectures have been written i dont know how many times you may think that this was done merely in an authors vanity not in a tutors care to the vanity i plead guiltyno man is more intensely vain than i am but my vanity is set on having it known of me that i am a good master not in having it said of me that i am a smooth author my vanity is never more wounded than in being called a fine writer meaningthat nobody need mind what i say  3 well then besides this vanity i have some solicitude for your progress you may give me credit for it or not as you choose but it is sincere and that your advance may be safe i have taken the best pains i could in laying down laws for it in these three years i have got my grammar written and with the help of many friends all working instruments in good order and now we will try what we can do not that even now you are to depend on my presence with you in personal teaching i shall henceforward think of the lectures less of the schools more but my best work for the schools will often be by drawing in florence or in lancashirenot here  4 i have already told you several times that the course through which i mean every student in these schools should pass is one which shall enable them to understand the elementary principles of the finest art it will necessarily be severe and seem to lead to no immediate result some of you will on the contrary wish to be taught what is immediately easy and gives prospect of a manifest success  but suppose they should come to the professor of logic and rhetoric and tell him they want to be taught to preach like mr spurgeon or the bishop of   he would say to themi cannot and if i could i would not tell you how to preach like mr spurgeon or the bishop of  your own character will form your style your own zeal will direct it your own obstinacy or ignorance may limit or exaggerate it but my business is to prevent as far as i can your having any particular style and to teach you the laws of all language and the essential power of your own  in like manner this course which i propose to you in art will be calculated only to give you judgment and method in future study to establish to your conviction the laws of general art and to enable you to draw if not with genius at least with sense and propriety  the course so far as it consists in practice will be defined in my instructions for the schools and the theory connected with that practice is set down in the three lectures at the end of the first course i deliveredthose on line light and color  you will have therefore to get this bookb and it is the only one which you will need to have of your ownthe others are placed for reference where they will be accessible to you  5 in the 139th paragraph it states the order of your practical study in these terms  i wish you to begin by getting command of linethat is to say by learning to draw a steady line limiting with absolute correctness the form or space you intend it to limit to proceed by getting command over flat tints so that you may be able to fill the spaces you have inclosed evenly either with shade or color according to the school you adopt and finally to obtain the power of adding such fineness of drawing within the masses as shall express their undulation and their characters of form and texture  and now since in your course of practice you are first required to attain the power of drawing lines accurately and delicately so in the course of theory or grammar i wish you first to learn the principles of linear design exemplified by the schools which § 137 you will find characterized as the schools of line  6 if i had command of as much time as i should like to spend with you on this subject i would begin with the early forms of art which used the simplest linear elements of design but for general service and interest it will be better that i should sketch what has been accomplished by the greatest masters in that manner the rather that their work is more or less accessible to all and has developed into the vast industries of modern engraving one of the most powerful existing influences of education and sources of pleasure among civilized people  and this investigation so far from interrupting will facilitate our examination of the history of the nobler arts you will see in the preface to my lectures on greek sculpture that i intend them to be followed by a course on architecture and that by one on florentine sculpture but the art of engraving is so manifestly at florence though not less essentially elsewhere a basis of style both in architecture and sculpture that it is absolutely necessary i should explain to you in what the skill of the engraver consists before i can define with accuracy that of more admired artists for engraving though not altogether in the method of which you see examples in the printshops of the high street is indeed a prior art to that either of building or sculpture and is an inseparable part of both when they are rightly practiced  7 and while we thus examine the scope of this first of the arts it will be necessary that we learn also the scope of mind of the early practicers of it and accordingly acquaint ourselves with the main events in the biography of the schools of florence to understand the temper and meaning of one great master is to lay the best if not the only foundation for the understanding of all and i shall therefore make it the leading aim of this course of lectures to remind you of what is known and direct you to what is knowable of the life and character of the greatest florentine master of engraving sandro botticelli and incidentally to give you some idea of the power of the greatest master of the german or any northern school hans holbein  8 you must feel however that i am using the word engraving in a somewhat different and you may imagine a wider sense than that which you are accustomed to attach to it so far from being a wider sense it is in reality a more accurate and restricted one while yet it embraces every conceivable right application of the art and i wish in this first lecture to make entirely clear to you the proper meaning of the word and proper range of the art of engraving in my next following lecture to show you its place in italian schools and then in due order the place it ought to take in our own and in all schools  9 first then today of the differentia or essential quality of engraving as distinguished from other arts  what answer would you make to me if i asked casually what engraving was perhaps the readiest which would occur to you would be the translation of pictures into black and white by means admitting reduplication of impressions but if that be done by lithography we do not call it engravingwhereas we speak contentedly and continually of seal engraving in which there is no question of black and white and as scholars you know that this customary mode of speaking is quite accurate and that engraving means primarily making a permanent cut or furrow in something the central syllable of the word has become a sorrowful one meaning the most permanent of furrows  10 but are you prepared absolutely to accept this limitation with respect to engraving as a pictorial art will you call nothing an engraving except a group of furrows or cavities cut in a hard substance what shall we say of mezzotint engraving for instance in which though indeed furrows and cavities are produced mechanically as a ground the artists work is in effacing them and when we consider the power of engraving in representing pictures and multiplying them are we to recognize and admire no effects of light and shade except those which are visibly produced by dots or furrows i mean will the virtue of an engraving be in exhibiting these imperfect means of its effect or in concealing them  11 here for instance is the head of a soldier by dürera mere gridiron of black lines would this be better or worse engraving if it were more like a photograph or lithograph and no lines seensuppose more like the head of mr santley now in all the musicshops and really quite deceptive in light and shade when seen from over the way do you think dürers work would be better if it were more like that and would you have me therefore leaving the question of technical method of production altogether to the craftsman consider pictorial engraving simply as the production of a lightandshade drawing by some method permitting its multiplication for the public  12 this you observe is a very practical question indeed for instance the illustrations of my own lectures on sculpture are equivalent to permanent photographs there can be little doubt that means will be discovered of thus producing perfect facsimiles of artists drawings so that if no more than facsimile be required the old art of cutting furrows in metal may be considered as at this day virtually ended and indeed it is said that line engravers cannot any more get apprentices and that a pure steel or copper plate is not likely to be again produced when once the old living masters of the bright field shall have been all laid in their earthfurrows  13 suppose then that this come to pass and more than this suppose that wood engraving also be superseded and that instead of imperfect transcripts of drawings on woodblocks or metalplates photography enabled us to give quite cheaply and without limit to number facsimiles of the finished lightandshade drawings of artists themselves another group of questions instantly offers itself on these new conditions namely what are the best means for a lightandshade drawingthe pen or the pencil the charcoal or the flat wash that is to say the pen producing shade by black lines as old engraving did the pencil producing shade by gray lines variable in force the charcoal producing a smoky shadow with no lines in it or the washed tint producing a transparent shadow with no lines in it which of these methods is the bestor have they each and all virtues to be separately studied and distinctively applied  14 see how curiously the questions multiply on us 1st is engraving to be only considered as cut work 2d for present designs multipliable without cutting by the sunshine what methods or instruments of drawing will be best and now 3dly before we can discuss these questions at all is there not another lying at the root of bothnamely what a lightandshade drawing itself properly is and how it differs or should differ from a painting whether by mere deficiency or by some entirely distinct merit  15 for instance you know how confidently it is said in common talk about turner that his works are intelligible and beautiful when engraved though incomprehensible as paintings admitting this to be so do you suppose it is because the translation into light and shade is deficient in some qualities which the painting had or that it possesses some quality which the painting had not does it please more because it is deficient in the color which confused a feeble spectator and offended a dogmatic oneor because it possesses a decision in its steady linear labor which interprets or corrects the swift penciling of the artist  16 do you notice the two words i have just used decision and lineardecision again introducing the idea of cuts or divisions as opposed to gradations linear as opposed to massive or broad  yet we use all these words at different times in praise while they evidently mark inconsistent qualities softness and decision breadth and delineation cannot coexist in equal degrees there must surely therefore be a virtue in the engraving inconsistent with that of the painting and vice versâ  now be clear about these three questions which we have today to answer       a is all engraving to be cut work       b if it need not be cut work but only the reproduction of a      drawing what methods of executing a lightandshade drawing      will be best       c is the shaded drawing itself to be considered only as a      deficient or imperfect painting or as a different thing from a      painting having a virtue of its own belonging to black and      white as opposed to color  17 i will give you the answers at once briefly and amplify them afterwards       a all engraving must be cut workthat is its differentia      unless your effect be produced by cutting into some solid      substance it is not engraving at all       b the proper methods for lightandshade drawing vary      according to subject and the degree of completeness      desiredsome of them having much in common with engraving      and others with painting       c the qualities of a lightandshade drawing ought to be      entirely different from those of a painting it is not a      deficient or partial representation of a colored scene or      picture but an entirely different reading of either so that      much of what is intelligible in a painting ought to be      unintelligible in a lightandshade study and vice versâ  you have thus three artsengraving lightandshade drawing and painting  now i am not going to lecture in this course on painting nor on lightandshade drawing but on engraving only but i must tell you something about lightandshade drawing first or at least remind you of what i have before told  18 you see that the three elementary lectures in my first volume are on line light and colorthat is to say on the modes of art which produce linear designswhich produce effects of lightand which produce effects of color  i must for the sake of new students briefly repeat the explanation of these  here is an arabian vase in which the pleasure given to the eye is only by linesno effect of light or of color is attempted here is a moonlight by turner in which there are no lines at all and no colors at all the pleasure given to the eye is only by modes of light and shade or effects of light finally here is an early florentine painting in which there are no lines of importance and no effect of light whatever but all the pleasure given to the eye is in gayety and variety of color  19 i say the pleasure given to the eye the lines on this vase write something but the ornamentation produced by the beautiful writing is independent of its meaning so the moonlight is pleasant first as light and the figures first as color it is not the shape of the waves but the light on them not the expression of the figures but their color by which the ocular pleasure is to be given  these three examples are violently marked ones but in preparing to draw any object you will find that practically you have to ask yourself shall i aim at the color of it the light of it or the lines of it you cant have all three you cant even have any two out of the three in equal strength the best art indeed comes so near nature as in a measure to unite all but the best is not and cannot be as good as nature and the mode of its deficiency is that it must lose some of the color some of the light or some of the delineation and in consequence there is one great school which says we will have the color and as much light and delineation as are consistent with it another which says we will have shade and as much color and delineation as are consistent with it the third we will have delineation and as much color and shade as are consistent with it  20 and though much of the two subordinate qualities may in each school be consistent with the leading one yet the schools are evermore separate as for instance in other matters one man says i will have my fee and as much honesty as is consistent with it another i will have my honesty and as much fee as is consistent with it though the man who will have his fee be subordinately honestthough the man who will have his honor subordinately rich are they not evermore of diverse schools  so you have in art the utterly separate provinces though in contact at their borders of                        the delineators                       the chiaroscurists and                       the colorists  21 the delineators are the men on whom i am going to give you this course of lectures they are essentially engravers an engraved line being the best means of delineation the chiaroscurists are essentially draughtsmen with chalk charcoal or single tints many of them paint but always with some effort and pain lionardo is the type of them but the entire dutch school consists of them laboriously painting without essential genius for color  the colorists are the true painters and all the faultless as far that is to say as mens work can be so and consummate masters of art belong to them  22 the distinction between the colorist and chiaroscurist school is trenchant and absolute and may soon be shown you so that you will never forget it here is a florentine picture by one of the pupils of giotto of very good representative quality and which the university galleries are rich in possessing at the distance at which i hold it you see nothing but a checkerwork of brilliant and as it happens even glaring colors if you come near you will find this patchwork resolve itself into a visitation and birth of st john but that st elizabeths red dress and the virgins blue and white one and the brown posts of the door and the blue spaces of the sky are painted in their own entirely pure colors each shaded with more powerful tints of itselfpale blue with deep blue scarlet with crimson yellow with orange and green with richer green  the whole is therefore as much a mosaic work of brilliant color as if it were made of bits of glass there is no effect of light attempted or so much as thought of you dont know even where the sun is nor have you the least notion what time of day it is the painter thinks you cannot be so superfluous as to want to know what time of day it is  23 here on the other hand is a dutch picture of good average quality also out of the university galleries it represents a group of cattle and a herdsman watching them and you see in an instant that the time is evening the sun is setting and there is warm light on the landscape the cattle and the standing figure  nor does the picture in any conspicuous way seem devoid of color on the contrary the herdsman has a scarlet jacket which comes out rather brilliantly from the mass of shade round it and a person devoid of color faculty or ill taught might imagine the picture to be really a fine work of color  but if you will come up close to it you will find that the herdsman has brown sleeves though he has a scarlet jacket and that the shadows of both are painted with precisely the same brown and in several places with continuous touches of the pencil it is only in the light that the scarlet is laid on  this at once marks the picture as belonging to the lower or chiaroscurist school even if you had not before recognized it as such by its pretty rendering of sunset effect  24 you might at first think it a painting which showed greater skill than that of the school of giotto but the skill is not the primary question the power of imagination is the first thing to be asked about this italian work imagines and requires you to imagine also a st elizabeth and st mary to the best of your power but this dutch one only wishes you to imagine an effect of sunlight on cowskin which is a far lower strain of the imaginative faculty  also as you may see the effect of sunlight on cowskin in reality any summer afternoon but cannot so frequently see a st elizabeth it is a far less useful strain of the imaginative faculty  and generally speaking the dutch chiaroscurists are indeed persons without imagination at allwho not being able to get any pleasure out of their thoughts try to get it out of their sensations note however also their technical connection with the greek school of shade see my sixth inaugural lecture § 158 in which color was refused not for the sake of deception but of solemnity  25 with these final motives you are not now concerned your present business is the quite easy one of knowing and noticing the universal distinction between the methods of treatment in which the aim is light and in which it is color and so to keep yourselves guarded from the danger of being misled by the often very ingenious talk of persons who have vivid color sensations without having learned to distinguish them from what else pleases them in pictures there is an interesting volume by professor taine on the dutch school containing a valuable historical analysis of the influences which formed it but full of the gravest errors resulting from the confusion in his mind between color and tone in consequence of which he imagines the dutch painters to be colorists  26 it is so important for you to be grounded securely in these first elements of pictorial treatment that i will be so far tedious as to show you one more instance of the relative intellectual value of the pure color and pure chiaroscuro school not in dutch and florentine but in english art here is a copy of one of the lost frescoes of our painted chamber of westminsterfourteenthcentury work entirely conceived in color and calculated for decorative effect there is no more light and shade in it than in a queen of hearts in a pack of cardsall that the painter at first wants you to see is that the young lady has a white forehead and a golden crown and a fair neck and a violet robe and a crimson shield with golden leopards on it and that behind her is clear blue sky then farther he wants you to read her name debonnairete which when you have read he farther expects you to consider what it is to be debonnaire and to remember your chaucers description of the virtue      she was not brown nor dun of hue     but white as snowe fallen new     with eyen glad and browes bent     her hair down to her heeles went     and she was simple as dove on tree     full debonnair of heart was she  27 you see chaucer dwells on the color just as much as the painter does but the painter has also given her the english shield to bear meaning that goodhumor or debonnairete cannot be maintained by selfindulgenceonly by fortitude farther note with chaucer the eyen glad and brows bent higharched and calm the strong life hair down to the heels and that her gladness is to be without subtletythat is to say without the slightest pleasure in any form of advantagetaking or any shrewd or mocking wit she was simple as dove on tree and you will find that the colorpainting both in the fresco and in the poem is in the very highest degree didactic and intellectual and distinguished as being so from all inferior forms of art farther that it requires you yourself first to understand the nature of simplicity and to like simplicity in young ladies better than subtlety and to understand why the second of loves five kind arrows beauté being the first      simplece ot nom la seconde     qui maint homme parmi le monde     et mainte dame fait amer  nor must you leave the picture without observing that there is another reason for debonnairetes bearing the royal shieldof all shields that rather than another debonneaire meant originally out of a good eagles nest the aire signifying the eagles nest or eyrie especially because it is flat the latin area being the root of all  and this coming out of a good nest is recognized as of all things needfulest to give the strength which enables people to be goodhumored and thus you have debonnaire forming the third word of the group with gentle and kind all first signifying of good race  you will gradually see as we go on more and more why i called my third volume of lectures eagles nest for i am not fantastic in these titles as is often said but try shortly to mark my chief purpose in the book by them  28 now for comparison with this old art here is a modern engraving in which color is entirely ignored and light and shade alone are used to produce what is supposed to be a piece of impressive religious instruction but it is not a piece of religious instruction at allonly a piece of religious sensation prepared for the sentimental pleasure of young ladies whom since i am honored today by the presence of many i will take the opportunity of warning against such forms of false theological satisfaction this engraving represents a young lady in a very long and though plain very becoming white dress tossed upon the waves of a terrifically stormy sea by which neither her hair nor her becoming dress is in the least wetted and saved from despair in that situation by closely embracing a very thick and solid stone cross by which farsought and original metaphor young ladies are expected after some effort to understand the recourse they may have for support to the cross of christ in the midst of the troubles of this world  29 as those troubles are for the present in all probability limited to the occasional loss of their thimbles when they have not taken care to put them into their workboxesthe concern they feel at the unsympathizing gayety of their companionsor perhaps the disappointment at not hearing a favorite clergyman preachfor i will not suppose the young ladies interested in this picture to be affected by any chagrin at the loss of an invitation to a ball or the like worldlinessit seems to me the stress of such calamities might be represented in a picture by less appalling imagery and i can assure my fair little lady friendsif i still have anythat whatever a young girls ordinary troubles or annoyances may be her true virtue is in shaking them off as a roseleaf shakes off rain and remaining debonnaire and bright in spirits or even as the rose would be the brighter for the troubles and not at all in allowing herself to be either drifted or depressed to the point of requiring religious consolation but if any real and deep sorrow such as no metaphor can represent fall upon her does she suppose that the theological advice of this piece of modern art can be trusted if she will take the pains to think truly she will remember that christ himself never says anything about holding by his cross he speaks a good deal of bearing it but never for an instant of holding by it it is his hand not his cross which is to save either you or st peter when the waves are rough and the utterly reckless way in which modern religious teachers whether in art or literature abuse the metaphor somewhat briefly and violently leant on by st paul simply prevents your understanding the meaning of any word which christ himself speaks on this matter so you see this popular art of light and shade catching you by your mere thirst of sensation is not only undidactic but the reverse of didacticdeceptive and illusory  30 this popular art you hear me say scornfully and i have told you in some of my teaching in aratra pentelici that all great art must be popular yes but great art is popular as bread and water are to children fed by a father and vile art is popular as poisonous jelly is to children cheated by a confectioner and it is quite possible to make any kind of art popular on those last terms the color school may become just as poisonous as the colorless in the hands of fools or of rogues here is a book i bought only the other dayone of the things got up cheap to catch the eyes of mothers at bookstallspuss in boots illustrated a most definite work of the color schoolred jackets and white paws and yellow coaches as distinct as giotto or raphael would have kept them but the thing is done by fools for money and becomes entirely monstrous and abominable here again is color art produced by fools for religion here is indian sacred paintinga black god with a hundred arms with a green god on one side of him and a red god on the other still a most definite work of the color school giotto or raphael could not have made the black more resolutely black though the whole color of the school of athens is kept in distinct separation from one black square in it nor the green more unquestionably green yet the whole is pestilent and loathsome  31 now but one point more and i have done with this subject for today  you must not think that this manifest brilliancy and harlequinsjacket character is essential in the color school the essential matter is only that everything should be of its own definite color it may be altogether sober and dark yet the distinctness of hue preserved with entire fidelity here for instance is a picture of hogarthsone of quite the most precious things we have in our galleries it represents a meeting of some learned societygentlemen of the last century very gravely dressed but who nevertheless as gentlemen pleasantly did in that dayyou remember goldsmiths weakness on the pointwear coats of tints of dark red blue or violet there are some thirty gentlemen in the room and perhaps seven or eight different tints of subdued claretcolor in their coats and yet every coat is kept so distinctly of its own proper claretcolor that each gentlemans servant would know his masters  yet the whole canvas is so gray and quiet that as i now hold it by this dutch landscape with the vermilion jacket you would fancy hogarths had no color in it at all and that the dutchman was halfway to becoming a titian whereas hogarths is a consummate piece of the most perfect colorist school which titian could not beat in its way and the dutchman could no more paint half an inch of it than he could summon a rainbow into the clouds  32 here then you see are altogether five works all of the absolutely pure color school    1 one indianreligious art   2 one florentinereligious art   3 one englishfrom painted chamber westminsterethic art   4 one englishhogarthnaturalistic art   5 one englishtoday sold in the high streetcaricaturist art  and of these the florentine and old english are divine work godinspired full indeed of faults and innocencies but divine as good children are  then this by hogarth is entirely wise and right but worldlywise not divine  while the old indian and this with which we feed our children at this hour are entirely damnable artevery bit of it done by the direct inspiration of the devilfeeble ridiculousyet mortally poisonous to every noble quality in body and soul  33 i have now i hope guarded you sufficiently from the danger either of confusing the inferior school of chiaroscuro with that of color or of imagining that a work must necessarily be good on the sole ground of its belonging to the higher group i can now proceed securely to separate the third school that of delineation from both and to examine its special qualities  it begins see inaugural lectures § 137 in the primitive work of races insensible alike to shade and to color and nearly devoid of thought and of sentiment but gradually developing into both  now as the design is primitive so are the means likely to be primitive a line is the simplest work of art you can produce what are the simplest means you can produce it with  a cumberland leadpencil is a work of art in itself quite a nineteenthcentury machine pen and ink are complex and scholarly and even chalk or charcoal not always handy  but the primitive line the first and last generally the best of lines is that which you have elementary faculty of at your fingers ends and which kittens can draw as well as youthe scratch  the first i say and the last of lines permanent exceedinglyeven in flesh or on mahogany tables often more permanent than we desire but when studiously and honorably made divinely permanent or delightfullyas on the venerable desks of our public schools most of them now specimens of wood engraving dear to the heart of england  34 engraving then is in brief terms the art of scratch it is essentially the cutting into a solid substance for the sake of making your ideas as permanent as possible graven with an iron pen in the rock forever permanence you observe is the object not multiplicabilitythat is quite an accidental sometimes not even a desirable attribute of engraving duration of your workfame and undeceived vision of all men on the pane of glass of the window on a wet day or on the pillars of the castle of chillon or on the walls of the pyramidsa primitive artyet first and last with us  since then engraving we say is essentially cutting into the surface of any solid as the primitive design is in lines or dots the primitive cutting of such design is a scratch or a hole and scratchable solids being essentially threestone wood metalwe shall have three great schools of engraving to investigate in each material  35 on tablet of stone on tablet of wood on tablet of steelthe first giving the law to everything the second true athenian like athenas first statue in olivewood making the law legible and homely and the third true vulcanian having the splendor and power of accomplished labor  now of stone engraving which is joined inseparably with sculpture and architecture i am not going to speak at length in this course of lectures i shall speak only of wood and metal engraving but there is one circumstance in stone engraving which it is necessary to observe in connection with the other two branches of the art  the great difficulty for a primitive engraver is to make his scratch deep enough to be visible visibility is quite as essential to your fame as permanence and if you have only your furrow to depend on the engraved tablet at certain times of day will be illegible and passed without notice  but suppose you fill in your furrow with something black then it will be legible enough at once and if the black fall out or wash out still your furrow is there and may be filled again by anybody  therefore the noble stone engravers using marble to receive their furrow fill that furrow with marble ink  and you have an engraved plate to purposewith the whole sky for its margin look herethe front of the church of san michele of luccawhite marble with green serpentine for ink or herethe steps of the giants stair with lead for ink or herethe floor of the pisan duomo with porphyry for ink such cutting filled in with color or with black branches into all sorts of developmentsflorentine mosaic on the one hand niello on the other and infinite minor arts  36 yet we must not make this filling with color part of our definition of engraving to engrave is in final strictness to decorate a surface with furrows cameos in accuratest terms are minute sculptures not engravings a plowed field is the purest type of such art and is on hilly land an exquisite piece of decoration  therefore it will follow that engraving distinguishes itself from ordinary drawing by greater need of muscular effort  the quality of a pen drawing is to be produced easilydeliberately alwaysc but with a point that glides over the paper engraving on the contrary requires always force and its virtue is that of a line produced by pressure or by blows of a chisel  it involves therefore always ideas of power and dexterity but also of restraint and the delight you take in it should involve the understanding of the difficulty the workman dealt with you perhaps doubt the extent to which this feeling justly extends in the first volume of modern painters expressed under the head ideas of power but why is a large stone in any building grander than a small one simply because it was more difficult to raise it so also an engraved line is and ought to be recognized as more grand than a pen or pencil line because it was more difficult to execute it  in this mosaic of lucca front you forgive much and admire much because you see it is all cut in stone so in wood and steel you ought to see that every line has been costly but observe costly of deliberative no less than athletic or executive power the main use of the restraint which makes the line difficult to draw is to give time and motive for deliberation in drawing it and to insure its being the best in your power  37 for as with deliberation so without repentance your engraved line must be it may indeed be burnished or beaten out again in metal or patched and botched in stone but always to disadvantage and at pains which must not be incurred often and there is a singular evidence in one of dürers finest plates that in his time or at least in his manner of work it was not possible at all among the disputes as to the meaning of dürers knight and death you will find it sometimes suggested or insisted that the horses raised foot is going to fall into a snare what has been fancied a noose is only the former outline of the horses foot and limb uneffaced  the engraved line is therefore to be conclusive not experimental i have determined this says the engraver much excellent pen drawing is excellent in being tentativein being experimental indeterminate not through want of meaning but through fullness of ithalting wisely between two opinionsfeeling cautiously after clearer opinions but your engraver has made up his opinion this is so and must forever be so he tells you a very proper thing for a thoughtful man to say a very improper and impertinent thing for a foolish one to say foolish engraving is consummately foolish work lookall the worldlook for evermore says the foolish engraver see what a fool i have been how many lines i have laid for nothing how many lines upon lines with no precept much less superprecept  38 here then are two definite ethical characters in all engraved work it is athletic and it is resolute add one more that it is obedientin their infancy the nurse but in their youth the slave of the higher arts servile both in the mechanism and labor of it and in its function of interpreting the schools of painting as superior to itself  and this relation to the higher arts we will study at the source of chief power in all the normal skill of christendom florence and chiefly as i said in the work of one florentine master sandro botticelli  footnotes  a inaugural series aratra pentelici and eagles nest  b my inaugural series of seven lectures now published uniform in size with this edition 1890  c compare inaugural lectures § 144                              lecture ii      the relation of engraving to other arts in florence   39 from what was laid before you in my last lecture you must now be aware that i do not mean by the word engraving merely the separate art of producing plates from which black pictures may be printed  i mean by engraving the art of producing decoration on a surface by the touches of a chisel or a burin and i mean by its relation to other arts the subordinate service of this linear work in sculpture in metal work and in painting or in the representation and repetition of painting  and first therefore i have to map out the broad relations of the arts of sculpture metal work and painting in florence among themselves during the period in which the art of engraving was distinctly connected with themd  40 you will find or may remember that in my lecture on michael angelo and tintoret i indicated the singular importance in the history of art of a space of forty years between 1480 and the year in which raphael died 1520 within that space of time the change was completed from the principles of ancient to those of existing arta manifold change not definable in brief terms but most clearly characterized and easily remembered as the change of conscientious and didactic art into that which proposes to itself no duty beyond technical skill and no object but the pleasure of the beholder of that momentous change itself i do not purpose to speak in the present course of lectures but my endeavor will be to lay before you a rough chart of the course of the arts in florence up to the time when it took place a chart indicating for you definitely the growth of conscience in work which is distinctively conscientious and the perfecting of expression and means of popular address in that which is distinctively didactic  41 means of popular address observe which have become singularly important to us at this day nevertheless remember that the power of printing or reprinting black picturespractically contemporary with that of reprinting black lettersmodified the art of the draughtsman only as it modified that of the scribe beautiful and unique writing as beautiful and unique painting or engraving remain exactly what they were but other useful and reproductive methods of both have been superadded of these it is acutely said by dr alfred woltmanne       a far more important part is played in the artlife of germany      by the technical arts for the multiplying of works for      germany while it was the land of bookprinting is also the      land of pictureprinting indeed woodengraving which      preceded the invention of bookprinting prepared the way for      it and only left one step more necessary for it      bookprinting and pictureprinting have both the same inner      cause for their origin namely the impulse to make each mental      gain a common blessing not merely princes and rich nobles were      to have the privilege of adorning their private chapels and      apartments with beautiful religious pictures the poorest man      was also to have his delight in that which the artist had      devised and produced it was not sufficient for him when it      stood in the church as an altarshrine visible to him and to      the congregation from afar he desired to have it as his own      to carry it about with him to bring it into his own home the      grand importance of woodengraving and copperplate is not      sufficiently estimated in historical investigations they were      not alone of use in the advance of art they form an epoch in      the entire life of mind and culture the idea embodied and      multiplied in pictures became like that embodied in the printed      word the herald of every intellectual movement and conquered      the world  42 conquered the world the rest of the sentence is true but this hyperbolic and greatly false it should have been said that both painting and engraving have conquered much of the good in the world and hitherto little or none of the evil  nor do i hold it usually an advantage to art in teaching that it should be common or constantly seen in becoming intelligibly and kindly beautiful while it remains solitary and unrivaled it has a greater power westminster abbey is more didactic to the english nation than a million of popular illustrated treatises on architecture  nay even that it cannot be understood but with some difficulty and must be sought before it can be seen is no harm the noblest didactic art is as it were set on a hill and its disciples come to it the vilest destructive and corrosive art stands at the street corners crying turn in hither come eat of my bread and drink of my wine which i have mingled  and dr woltmann has allowed himself too easily to fall into the common notion of liberalism that bad art disseminated is instructive and good art isolated not so the question is first i assure you whether what art you have got is good or bad if essentially bad the more you see of it the worse for you entirely popular art is all that is noble in the cathedral the council chamber and the marketplace not the paltry colored print pinned on the wall of a private room  43 i despise the poordo i think you not so they only despise the poor who think them better off with police news and colored tracts of the story of joseph and potiphars wife than they were with luini painting on their church walls and donatello carving the pillars of their marketplaces  nevertheless the effort to be universally instead of locally didactic modified advantageously as you know and in a thousand ways varied the earlier art of engraving and the development of its popular power whether for good or evil came exactlyso fate appointedat a time when the minds of the masses were agitated by the struggle which closed in the reformation in some countries and in the desperate refusal of reformation in othersf the two greatest masters of engraving whose lives we are to study were both of them passionate reformers holbein no less than luther botticelli no less than savonarola  44 reformers i mean in the full and accurately the only sense not preachers of new doctrines but witnesses against the betrayal of the old ones which were on the lips of all men and in the lives of none nay the painters are indeed more pure reformers than the priests they rebuked the manifest vices of men while they realized whatever was loveliest in their faith priestly reform soon enraged itself into mere contest for personal opinions while without rage but in stern rebuke of all that was vile in conduct or thoughtin declaration of the alwaysreceived faiths of the christian church and in warning of the power of faith and deathg over the petty designs of menbotticelli and holbein together fought foremost in the ranks of the reformation  45 today i will endeavor to explain how they attained such rank then in the next two lectures the technics of boththeir way of speaking and in the last two what they had got to say  first then we ask how they attained this rankwho taught them what they were finally best to teach how far must every peoplehow far did this florentine peopleteach its masters before they could teach it  even in these days when every man is by hypothesis as good as another does not the question sound strange to you you recognize in the past as you think clearly that national advance takes place always under the guidance of masters or groups of masters possessed of what appears to be some new personal sensibility or gift of invention and we are apt to be reverent to these alone as if the nation itself had been unprogressive and suddenly awakened or converted by the genius of one man  no idea can be more superficial every nation must teach its tutors and prepare itself to receive them but the fact on which our impression is foundedthe rising apparently by chance of men whose singular gifts suddenly melt the multitude already at the point of fusion or suddenly form and inform the multitude which has gained coherence enough to be capable of formationenables us to measure and map the gain of national intellectual territory by tracing first the lifting of the mountain chains of its genius  46 i have told you that we have nothing to do at present with the great transition from ancient to modern habits of thought which took place at the beginning of the sixteenth century i only want to go as far as that pointwhere we shall find the old superstitious art represented finally by perugino and the modern scientific and anatomical art represented primarily by michael angelo and the epithet bestowed on perugino by michael angelo goffo nell arte dunce or blockhead in artbeing as far as my knowledge of history extends the most cruel the most false and the most foolish insult ever offered by one great man to anotherdoes you at least good service in showing how trenchant the separation is between the two orders of artistshhow exclusively we may follow out the history of all the goffi nell arte and write our florentine dunciad and laus stultitiæ in peace and never trench upon the thoughts or ways of these proud ones who showed their fathers nakedness and snatched their masters fame  47 the florentine dunces in art are a multitude but i only want you to know something about twenty of them  twentyyou think that a grievous number it may perhaps appease you a little to be told that when you really have learned a very little accurately about these twenty dunces there are only five more men among the artists of christendom whose works i shall ask you to examine while you are under my care that makes twentyfive altogetheran exorbitant demand on your attention you still think and yet but a little while ago you were all agog to get me to go and look at mrs as sketches and tell you what was to be thought about them and ive had the greatest difficulty to keep mrs bs photographs from being shown side by side with the raphael drawings in the university galleries and you will waste any quantity of time in looking at mrs as sketches or mrs bs photographs and yet you look grave because out of nineteen centuries of european artlabor and thought i ask you to learn something seriously about the works of fiveandtwenty men  48 it is hard upon you doubtless considering the quantity of time you must

here are the names of the twentyfive meni and opposite each a line indicating the length of his life and the position of it in his century the diagram still however needs a few words of explanation very chiefly for those who know anything of my writings there is needed explanation of its not including the names of titian reynolds velasquez turner and other such men always reverently put before you at other times  they are absent because i have no fear of your not looking at these all your lives through if you care about art you will be looking at them but while you are here at oxford i want to make you learn what you should know of these earlier many of them weaker men who yet for the very reason of their greater simplicity of power are better guides for you and of whom some will remain guides to all generations and as regards the subject of our present course i have a still more weighty reasonvandyke gainsborough titian reynolds velasquez and the rest are essentially portrait painters they give you the likeness of a man they have nothing to say either about his future life or his gods that is the look of him they say here on earth we know no more  49 but these whose names i have engraved have something to saygenerally mucheither about the future life of man or about his gods they are therefore literally seers or prophets false prophets it may be or foolish ones of that you must judge but you must read before you can judge and read or hear them consistently for you dont know them till you have heard them out but with sir joshua or titian one portrait is as another it is here a pretty lady there a great lord but speechless allwhereas with these twentyfive men each picture or statue is not merely another person of a pleasant society but another chapter of a sibylline book  50 for this reason then i do not want sir joshua or velasquez in my defined group and for my present purpose i can spare from it even four othersnamely three who have too special gifts and must each be separately studiedcorreggio carpaccio tintoretand one who has no special gift but a balanced group of manycima this leaves twentyone for classification of whom i will ask you to lay hold thus you must continually have felt the difficulty caused by the names of centuries not tallying with their yearsthe year 1201 being the first of the thirteenth century and so on i am always plagued by it myself much as i have to think and write with reference to chronology and i mean for the future in our art chronology to use as far as possible a different form of notation  51 in my diagram the vertical lines are the divisions of tens of years the thick black lines divide the centuries the horizontal lines then at a glance tell you the length and date of each artists life in one or two instances i cannot find the date of birth in one or two more of death and the line indicates then only the ascertainedj period during which the artist worked  and thus represented you see nearly all their lives run through the year of a new century so that if the lines representing them were needles and the black bars of the years 1300 1400 1500 were magnets i could take up nearly all the needles by lifting the bars  52 i will actually do this then in three other simple diagrams i place a rod for the year 1300 over the lines of life and i take up all it touches i have to drop niccola pisano but i catch five now with my rod of 1400 i have dropped orcagna indeed but i again catch five now with my rod of 1500 i indeed drop filippo lippi and verrocchio but i catch seven and here i have three pennons with the staves of the years 1300 1400 and 1500 running through themholding the names of nearly all the men i want you to study in easily remembered groups of five five and seven and these three groups i shall hereafter call the 1300 group 1400 group and 1500 group                                           1300

but not in disrespect in hope on the contrary to make you remember them very separately indeedfor this following reason  we are in the careless habit of speaking of men who form a great number of pupils and have a host of inferior satellites round them as masters of great schools  but before you call a man a master you should ask are his pupils greater or less than himself if they are greater than himself he is a master indeedhe has been a true teacher but if all his pupils are less than himself he may have been a great man but in all probability has been a bad master or no master  now these men whom i have signally left out of my groups are true masters  niccola pisano taught all italy but chiefly his own son who succeeded and in some things very much surpassed him  orcagna taught all italy after him down to michael angelo and these twolippi the religious schools verrocchio the artist schools of their century  lippi taught sandro botticelli and verrocchio taught lionardo da vinci lorenzo di credi and perugino have i not good reason to separate the masters of such pupils from the schools they created  54 but how is it that i can drop just the cards i want out of my pack  well certainly i force and fit matters a little i leave some men out of my list whom i should like to have in itbenozzo gozzoli for instance and mino da fiesole but i can do without them and so can you also for the present i catch luca by a hairsbreadth only with my 1400 rod but on the whole with very little coaxing i get the groups in this memorable and quite literally handy form for see i write my lists of five five and seven on bits of pasteboard i hinge my rods to these and you can brandish the school of 1400 in your left hand and of 1500 in your right likerailway signalsand i wish all railway signals were as clear once learn thoroughly the groups in this artificially contracted form and you can refine and complete afterwards at your leisure  55 and thus actually flourishing my two pennons and getting my grip of the men in either hand i find a notable thing concerning my two flags the men whose names i hold in my left hand are all sculptors the men whose names i hold in my right are all painters  you will infallibly suspect me of having chosen them thus on purpose no honor brighti chose simply the greatest menthose i wanted to talk to you about i arranged them by their dates i put them into three conclusive pennons and behold what follows  56 farther note this in the 1300 group four out of the five men are architects as well as sculptors and painters in the 1400 group there is one architect in the 1500 none and the meaning of that is that in 1300 the arts were all united and duly led by architecture in 1400 sculpture began to assume too separate a power to herself in 1500 painting arrogated all and at last betrayed all from which with much other collateral evidence you may justly conclude that the three arts ought to be practiced together and that they naturally are so i long since asserted that no man could be an architect who was not a sculptor as i learned more and more of my business i perceived also that no man could be a sculptor who was not an architectthat is to say who had not knowledge enough and pleasure enough in structural law to be able to build on occasion better than a mere builder and so finally i now positively aver to you that nobody in the graphic arts can be quite rightly a master of anything who is not master of everything  57 the junction of the three arts in mens minds at the best times is shortly signified in these words of chaucer loves garden                          everidele     enclosed was and walled well     with high walls embatailled     portrayed without and well entayled     with many rich

en fuzk et en pierres     en mettaux en os et en cire     et en toute autre matire  58 i made a little sketch when last in florence of a subject which will fix the idea of this unity of the arts in your minds at the base of the tower of giotto are two rows of hexagonal panels filled with basreliefs some of these are by unknown handssome by andrea pisano some by luca della robbia two by giotto himself of these i sketched the panel representing the art of painting  you have in that basrelief one of the foundationstones of the most perfectly built tower in europe you have that stone carved by its architects own hand you find further that this architect and sculptor was the greatest painter of his time and the friend of the greatest poet and you have represented by him a painter in his shopbottegaas symbolic of the entire art of painting  59 in which representation please note how carefully giotto shows you the tabernacles or niches in which the paintings are to be placed not independent of their frames these panels of his you see  have you ever considered in the early history of painting how important also is the history of the frame maker it is a matter i assure you needing your very best consideration for the frame was made before the picture the painted window is much but the aperture it fills was thought of before it the fresco by giotto is much but the vault it adorns was planned first who thought of thesewho built  questions taking us far back before the birth of the shepherd boy of fésolequestions not to be answered by history of painting only still less of painting in italy only  60 and in pointing out to you this fact i may once for all prove to you the essential unity of the arts and show you how impossible it is to understand one without reference to another which i wish you to observe all the more closely that you may use without danger of being misled the data of unequaled value which have been collected by crowe and cavalcaselle in the book which they have called a history of painting in italy but which is in fact only a dictionary of details relating to that history such a title is an absurdity on the face of it for first you can no more write the history of painting in italy than you can write the history of the south wind in italy the sirocco does indeed produce certain effects at genoa and others at rome but what would be the value of a treatise upon the winds which for the honor of any country assumed that every city of it had a native sirocco  but furtherimagine what success would attend the meteorologist who should set himself to give an account of the south wind but take no notice of the north  and finally suppose an attempt to give you an account of either wind but none of the seas or mountain passes by which they were nourished or directed  61 for instance i am in this course of lectures to give you an account of a single and minor branch of graphic artengraving but observe how many references to local circumstances it involves there are three materials for it we saidstone wood and metal stone engraving is the art of countries possessing marble and gems wood engraving of countries overgrown with forest metal engraving of countries possessing treasures of silver and gold and the style of a stone engraver is formed on pillars and pyramids the style of a wood engraver under the eaves of larch cottages the style of a metal engraver in the treasuries of kings do you suppose i could rightly explain to you the value of a single touch on brass by finiguerra or on box by bewick unless i had grasp of the great laws of climate and country and could trace the inherited sirocco or tramontana of thought to which the souls and bodies of the men owed their existence  62 you see that in this flag of 1300 there is a dark strong line in the center against which you read the name of arnolfo  in writing our florentine dunciad or history of fools can we possibly begin with a better day than all fools day on all fools daythe first if you like better so to call it of the month of openingin the year 1300 is signed the document making arnolfo a citizen of florence and in 1310 he dies chief master of the works of the cathedral there to this man crowe and cavalcaselle give half a page out of three volumes of five hundred pages each  but lower down in my flag not put there because of any inferiority but by order of chronology you will see a name sufficiently familiar to youthat of giotto and to him our historians of painting in italy give some hundred pages under the impression stated by them at page 243 of their volume that in his hands art in the peninsula became entitled for the first time to the name of italian  63 art became italian yes but what art your authors give a perspectiveor what they call suchof the upper church of assisi as if that were merely an accidental occurrence of blind walls for giotto to paint on  but how came the upper church of assisi there how came it to be vaultedto be aisled how came giotto to be asked to paint upon it  the art that built it good or bad must have been an italian one before giotto he could not have painted on the air let us see how his panels were made for him  64 this captainthe center of our first grouparnolfo has always hitherto been called arnolfo di lapoarnolfo the son of lapo  modern investigators come down on us delightedly to tell usarnolfo was not the son of lapo  in these days you will have half a dozen doctors writing each a long book and the sense of all will bearnolfo wasnt the son of lapo much good may you get of that  well you will find the fact to be there was a great northman builder a true son of thor who came down into italy in 1200 served the order of st francis there built assisi taught arnolfo how to build with thors hammer and disappeared leaving his name uncertainjacopolaponobody knows what arnolfo always recognizes this man as his true father who put the soullife into him he is known to his florentines always as lapos arnolfo  that or some likeness of that is the vital fact you never can get at the literal limitation of living facts they disguise themselves by the very strength of their life get told again and again in different ways by all manner of peoplethe literalness of them is turned topsyturvy insideout over and over againthen the fools come and read them wrong side upwards or else say there never was a fact at all nothing delights a true blockhead so much as to prove a negativeto show that everybody has been wrong fancy the delicious sensation to an emptyheaded creature of fancying for a moment that he has emptied everybody elses head as well as his own nay that for once his own hollow bottle of a head has had the best of other bottles and has been first emptyfirst to knownothing  65 hold then steadily the first tradition about this arnolfo that his real father was called cambio matters to you not a straw that he never called himself cambios arnolfothat nobody else ever called him so down to vasaris time is an infinitely significant fact to you in my twentysecond letter in fors clavigera you will find some account of the noble habit of the italian artists to call themselves by their masters names considering their master as their true father if not the name of the master they take that of their native place as having owed the character of their life to that they rarely take their own family name sometimes it is not even knownwhen best known it is unfamiliar to us the great pisan artists for instance never bear any other name than the pisan among the other fiveandtwenty names in my list not above six i think the two german with four italian are family names perugino peter of perugia luini bernard of luino quercia james of quercia correggio anthony of correggio are named from their native places nobody would have understood me if i had called giotto ambrose bondone or tintoret robusti or even raphael sanzio botticelli is named from his master ghiberti from his fatherinlaw and ghirlandajo from his work orcagna who did for a wonder name himself from his father andrea cione of florence has been always called angel by everybody else while arnolfo who never named himself from his father is now like to be fathered against his will  but i again beg of you keep to the old story for it represents however inaccurately in detail clearly in sum the fact that some great master of german gothic at this time came down into italy and changed the entire form of italian architecture by his touch so that while niccola and giovanni pisano are still virtually greek artists experimentally introducing gothic forms arnolfo and giotto adopt the entire gothic ideal of form and thenceforward use the pointed arch and steep gable as the limits of sculpture  66 hitherto i have been speaking of the relations of my twentyfive men to each other but now please note their relations altogether to the art before them these twentyfive include i say all the great masters of christian art  before them the art was too savage to be christian afterwards too carnal to be christian  too savage to be christian i will justify that assertion hereafter but you will find that the european art of 1200 includes all the most developed and characteristic conditions of the style in the north which you have probably been accustomed to think of as norman and which you may always most conveniently call so and the most developed conditions of the style in the south which formed out of effete greek persian and roman tradition you may in like manner most conveniently express by the familiar word byzantine whatever you call them they are in origin adverse in temper and remain so up to the year 1200 then an influence appears seemingly that of one man nicholas the pisan our first master observe and a new spirit adopts what is best in each and gives to what it adopts a new energy of its own namely this conscientious and didactic power which is the speciality of its progressive existence and just as the newborn and natural art of athens collects and reanimates pelasgian and egyptian tradition purifying their worship and perfecting their work into the living heathen faith of the world so this newborn and natural art of florence collects and animates the norman and byzantine tradition and forms out of the perfected worship and work of both the honest christian faith and vital craftsmanship of the world  67 get this first summary therefore well into your minds the word norman i use roughly for northsavageroughly but advisedly i mean lombard scandinavian frankish everything northsavage that you can think of except saxon i have a reason for that exception never mind it just nowl  all northsavage i call norman all southsavage i call byzantine this latter including dead native greek primarilythen dead foreign greek in romethen arabianpersianphoenicianindianall you can think of in art of hot countries up to this year 1200 i rank under the one term byzantine now all this cold artnorman and all this hot artbyzantine is virtually dead till 1200 it has no conscience no didactic powerm it is devoid of both in the sense that dreams are  then in the thirteenth century men wake as if they heard an alarum through the whole vault of heaven and true human life begins again and the cradle of this life is the val darno there the northern and southern nations meet there they lay down their enmities there they are first baptized unto johns baptism for the remission of sins there is born and thence exiledthought faithless for breaking the font of baptism to save a child from drowning in his bel san giovannithe greatest of christian poets he who had pity even for the lost  68 now therefore my whole history of christian architecture and painting begins with this baptistery of florence and with its associated cathedral arnolfo brought the one into the form in which you now see it he laid the foundation of the other and that to purpose and he is therefore the captain of our first school  for this florentine baptisteryn is the great one of the world here is the center of christian knowledge and power  and it is one piece of large engraving white substance cut into and filled with black and darkgreen  no more perfect work was afterwards done and i wish you to grasp the idea of this building clearly and irrevocablyfirst in order as i told you in a previous lecture to quit yourselves thoroughly of the idea that ornament should be decorated construction and secondly as the noblest type of the intaglio ornamentation which developed itself into all minor application of black and white to engraving  69 that it should do so first at florence was the natural sequence and the just reward of the ancient skill of etruria in chased metalwork the effects produced in gold either by embossing or engraving were the direct means of giving interest to his surfaces at the command of the auri faber or orfevre and every conceivable artifice of studding chiseling and interlacing was exhausted by the artists in gold who were at the head of the metalworkers and from whom the ranks of the sculptors were reinforced  the old french word orfroiz aurifrigia expresses essentially what we call frosted work in gold that which resembles small dew or crystals of hoarfrost the frigia coming from the latin frigus to chase or enchase is not properly said of the gold but of the jewel which it secures with hoops or ridges french enchassero then the armorer or cup and casket maker added to this kind of decoration that of flat inlaid enamel and the silverworker finding that the raised filigree still a staple at genoa only attracted tarnish or got crushed early sought to decorate a surface which would bear external friction with labyrinths of safe incision  70 of the security of incision as a means of permanent decoration as opposed to ordinary carving here is a beautiful instance in the base of one of the external shafts of the cathedral of lucca thirteenthcentury work which by this time had it been carved in relief would have been a shapeless remnant of indecipherable bosses but it is still as safe as if it had been cut yesterday because the smooth round mass of the pillar is entirely undisturbed into that furrows are cut with a chisel as much under command and as powerful as a burin the effect of the design is trusted entirely to the depth of these incisionshere dying out and expiring in the light of the marble there deepened by drill holes into as definitely a black line as if it were drawn with ink and describing the outline of the leafage with a delicacy of touch and of perception which no man will ever surpass and which very few have rivaled in the proudest days of design  71 this security in silver plates was completed by filling the furrows with the black paste which at once exhibited and preserved them the transition from that niellowork to modern engraving is one of no real moment my object is to make you understand the qualities which constitute the merit of the engraving whether charged with niello or ink and this i hope ultimately to accomplish by studying with you some of the works of the four men botticelli and mantegna in the south dürer and holbein in the north whose names i have put in our last flag above and beneath those of the three mighty painters perugino the captain bellini on one sideluini on the other  the four following lecturesp will contain data necessary for such study you must wait longer before i can place before you those by which i can justify what must greatly surprise some of my audiencemy having given perugino the captains place among the three painters  72 but i do so at least primarily because what is commonly thought affected in his design is indeed the true remains of the great architectural symmetry which was soon to be lost and which makes him the true follower of arnolfo and brunelleschi and because he is a sound craftsman and workman to the very hearts core a noble gracious and quiet laborer from youth to deathnever weary never impatient never untender never untrue not tintoret in power not raphael in flexibility not holbein in veracity not luini in lovetheir gathered gifts he has in balanced and fruitful measure fit to be the guide and impulse and father

northmenbetween the byzantine and romanand between the byzantine and arab which form minor but not less trenchant divisions of artprovince for subsequent delineation if you can refer to my stones of venice see § 20 of its first chapter  m again much too broad a statement not to be qualified but by a length of explanation here impossible my lectures on architecture now in preparation val darno

present published justify its title because i have not thought it necessary to write the vivavoce portions of it which amplified the 69th paragraph i will give the substance of them in better form elsewhere meantime the part of the lecture here given may be in its own way useful                             lecture iii                 the technics of wood engraving   73 i am today to begin to tell you what it is necessary you should observe respecting methods of manual execution in the two great arts of engraving only to begin to tell you there need be no end of telling you such things if you care to hear them the theory of art is soon mastered but dal detto al fatto ve gran tratto and as i have several times told you in former lectures every day shows me more and more the importance of the hand  74 of the hand as a servant observenot of the hand as a master for there are two great kinds of manual work one in which the hand is continually receiving and obeying orders the other in which it is acting independently or even giving orders of its own and the dependent and submissive hand is a noble hand but the independent or imperative hand is a vile one  that is to say as long as the pen or chisel or other graphic instrument is moved under the direct influence of mental attention and obeys orders of the brain it is working noblythe moment it moves independently of them and performs some habitual dexterity of its own it is base  75 dexterityi saysome righthandedness of its own we might wisely keep that word for what the hand does at the minds bidding and use an opposite wordsinisterityfor what it does at its own for indeed we want such a word in speaking of modern art it is all full of sinisterity hands independent of brainsthe left hand by division of labor not knowing what the right doesstill less what it ought to do  76 turning then to our special subject all engraving i said is intaglio in the solid but the solid in wood engraving is a coarse substance easily cut and in metal a fine substance not easily therefore in general you may be prepared to accept ruder and more elementary work in one than the other and it will be the means of appeal to blunter minds  you probably already know the difference between the actual methods of producing a printed impression from wood and metal but i may perhaps make the matter a little more clear in metal engraving you cut ditches fill them with ink and press your paper into them in wood engraving you leave ridges rub the tops of them with ink and stamp them on your paper  the instrument with which the substance whether of the wood or steel is cut away is the same it is a solid plowshare which instead of throwing the earth aside throws it up and out producing at first a simple ravine or furrow in the wood or metal which you can widen by another cut or extend by successive cuts this fig 1 is the general shape of the solid plowshare but it is of course made sharper or blunter at pleasure the furrow produced is at first the wedgeshaped or cuneiform ravine already so much dwelt upon in my lectures on greek sculpture  illustration fig 1  77 since then in wood printing you print from the surface left solid and in metal printing from the hollows cut into it it follows that if you put few touches on wood you draw as on a slate with white lines leaving a quantity of black but if you put few touches on metal you draw with black lines leaving a quantity of white  now the eye is not in the least offended by quantity of white but is or ought to be greatly saddened and offended by quantity of black hence it follows that you must never put little work on wood you must not sketch upon it you may sketch on metal as much as you please  78 paradox you will say as usual are not all our journalsand the best of them punch par excellencefull of the most brilliantly swift and slight sketches engraved on wood while lineengravings take ten years to produce and cost ten guineas each when they are done  yes that is so but observe in the first place what appears to you a sketch on wood is not so at all but a most laborious and careful imitation of a sketch on paper whereas when you see what appears to be a sketch on metal it is one and in the second place so far as the popular fashion is contrary to this natural methodso far as we do in reality try to produce effects of sketching in wood and of finish in metalour work is wrong  those apparently careless and free sketches on the wood ought to have been stern and deliberate those exquisitely toned and finished engravings on metal ought to have looked instead like free ink sketches on white paper that is the theorem which i propose to you for consideration and which in the two branches of its assertion i hope to prove to you the first part of it that woodcutting should be careful in this present lecture the second that metalcutting should be at least in a far greater degree than it is now slight and free in the following one  79 next observe the distinction in respect of thickness no less than number of lines which may properly be used in the two methods  in metal engraving it is easier to lay a fine line than a thick one and however fine the line may be it lastsbut in wood engraving it requires extreme precision and skill to leave a thin dark line and when left it will be quickly beaten down by a careless printer therefore the virtue of wood engraving is to exhibit the qualities and power of thick lines and of metal engraving to exhibit the qualities and power of thin ones  all thin dark lines therefore in wood broadly speaking are to be used only in case of necessity and thick lines on metal only in case of necessity  80 though however thin dark lines cannot easily be produced in wood thin light ones may be struck in an instant nevertheless even thin light ones must not be used except with extreme caution for observe they are equally useless as outline and for expression of mass you know how far from exemplary or delightful your boys first quite voluntary exercises in white line drawing on your slate were you could indeed draw a goblin satisfactorily in such methoda round o with arms and legs to it and a scratch under two dots in the middle would answer the purpose but if you wanted to draw a pretty face you took pencil or pen and papernot your slate now that instinctive feeling that a white outline is wrong is deeply founded for nature herself draws with diffused light and concentrated darknever except in storm or twilight with diffused dark and concentrated light and the thing we all like best to see drawnthe human facecannot be drawn with white touches but by extreme labor for the pupil and iris of the eye the eyebrow the nostril and the lip are all set in dark on pale ground you cant draw a white eyebrow a white pupil of the eye a white nostril and a white mouth on a dark ground try it and see what a specter you get but the same number of dark touches skillfully applied will give the idea of a beautiful face and what is true of the subtlest subject you have to represent is equally true of inferior ones nothing lovely can be quickly represented by white touches you must hew out if your means are so restricted the form by sheer labor and that both cunning and dextrous the florentine masters and dürer often practice the achievement and there are many drawings by the lippis mantegna and other leading italian draughtsmen completed to great perfection with the white line but only for the sake of severest study nor is their work imitable by inferior men and such studies however accomplished always mark a disposition to regard chiaroscuro too much and local color too little  we conclude then that we must never trust in wood to our power of outline with white and our general laws thus far determined will bethick lines in wood thin ones in metal complete drawing on wood sketches if we choose on metal  81 but why in wood lines at all why not cut out white spaces and use the chisel as if its incisions were so much white paint many fine pieces of woodcutting are indeed executed on this principle bewick does nearly all his foliage so and continually paints the light plumes of his birds with single touches of his chisel as if he were laying on white  but this is not the finest method of woodcutting it implies the idea of a system of light and shade in which the shadow is totally black now no light and shade can be good much less pleasant in which all the shade is stark black therefore the finest woodcutting ignores light and shade and expresses only form and dark local color and it is convenient for simplicitys sake to anticipate what i should otherwise defer telling you until next lecture that fine metal engraving like fine woodcutting ignores light and shade and that in a word all good engraving whatsoever does so  82 i hope that my saying so will make you eager to interrupt me what rembrandts etchings and luptons mezzotints and le keuxs lineworkdo you mean to tell us that these ignore light and shade  i never said that mezzotint ignored light and shade or ought to do so mezzotint is properly to be considered as chiaroscuro drawing on metal but i do mean to tell you that both rembrandts etchings and le keuxs finished linework are misapplied labor in so far as they regard chiaroscuro and that consummate engraving never uses it as a primal element of pleasure  illustration the last furrow  fig 2 facsimile from holbeins woodcut  83 we have now got our principles so far defined that i can proceed to illustration of them by example  here are facsimiles very marvelous onesq of two of the best wood engravings ever produced by arttwo subjects in holbeins dance of death you will probably like best that i should at once proceed to verify my last and most startling statement that fine engraving disdained chiaroscuro  this vignette fig 2 represents a sunset in the open mountainous fields of southern germany and holbein is so entirely careless about the light and shade which a dutchman would first have thought of as resulting from the sunset that as he works he forgets altogether where his light comes from here actually the shadow of the figure is cast from the side right across the picture while the sun is in front and there is not the slightest attempt to indicate gradation of light in the sky darkness in the forest or any other positive element of chiaroscuro  this is not because holbein cannot give chiaroscuro if he chooses he is twenty times a stronger master of it than rembrandt but he therefore knows exactly when and how to use it and that wood engraving is not the proper means for it the quantity of it which is needful for his story and will not by any sensational violence either divert or vulgarly enforce the attention he will give and that with an unrivaled subtlety therefore i must ask you for a moment or two to quit the subject of technics and look what these two woodcuts mean  84 the one i have first shown you is of a plowman plowing at evening it is holbeins object here to express the diffused and intense light of a golden summer sunset so far as is consistent with grander purposes a modern french or english chiaroscurist would have covered his sky with fleecy clouds and relieved the plowmans hat and his horses against it in strong black and put sparkling touches on the furrows and grass holbein scornfully casts all such tricks aside and draws the whole scene in pure white with simple outlines  illustration the two preachers  fig 3 facsimile from holbeins woodcut  85 and yet when i put it beside this second vignette fig 3 which is of a preacher preaching in a feebly lighted church you will feel that the diffused warmth of the one subject and diffused twilight in the other are complete and they will finally be to you more impressive than if they had been wrought out with every superficial means of effect on each block  for it is as a symbol not as a scenic effect that in each case the chiaroscuro is given holbein i said is at the head of the painterreformers and his dance of death is the most energetic and telling of all the forms given in this epoch to the rationalist spirit of reform preaching the new gospel of deathit is no matter whether you are priest or layman what you believe or what you do here is the end you shall see in the course of our inquiry that botticelli in like manner represents the faithful and catholic temper of reform  86 the teaching of holbein is therefore always melancholyfor the most part purely rational and entirely furious in its indignation against all who either by actual injustice in this life or by what he holds to be false promise of another destroy the good or the energy of the few days which man has to live against the rich the luxurious the pharisee the false lawyer the priest and the unjust judge holbein uses his fiercest mockery but he is never himself unjust never caricatures or equivocates gives the facts as he knows them with explanatory symbols few and clear  87 among the powers which he hates the pathetic and ingenious preaching of untruth is one of the chief and it is curious to find his biographer knowing this and reasoning as german critics nearly always do from acquired knowledge not perception imagine instantly that he sees hypocrisy in the face of holbeins preacher how skillfully says dr woltmann is the preacher propounding his doctrines how thoroughly is his hypocrisy expressed in the features of his countenance and in the gestures of his hands but look at the cut yourself candidly i challenge you to find the slightest trace of hypocrisy in either feature or gesture holbein knew better it is not the hypocrite who has power in the pulpit it is the sincere preacher of untruth who does mischief there the hypocrites place of power is in trade or in general society none but the sincere ever get fatal influence in the pulpit this man is a refined gentlemanascetic earnest thoughtful and kind he scarcely uses the vantage even of his pulpitcomes aside out of it as an eager man would pleading he is intent on being understoodis understood his congregation are delightedyou might hear a pin drop among them one is asleep indeed who cannot see him being under the pulpit and asleep just because the teacher is as gentle as he is earnest and speaks quietly  88 how are we to know then that he speaks in vain first because among all his hearers you will not find one shrewd face they are all either simple or stupid people there is one nice woman in front of all else holbeins representation had been caricature but she is not a shrewd one  secondly by the light and shade the church is not in extreme darknessfar from that a gray twilight is over everything but the sun is totally shut out of itnot a ray comes in even at the windowthat is darker than the walls or vault  lastly and chiefly by the mocking expression of death mocking but not angry the man has been preaching what he thought true death laughs at him but is not indignant with him  death comes quietly i am going to be preacher now here is your own hourglass ready for me you have spoken many words in your day but of the things which you have spoken this is the sumyour deathwarrant signed and sealed theres your text for today  89 of this other picture the meaning is more plain and far more beautiful the husbandman is old and gaunt and has passed his days not in speaking but pressing the iron into the ground and the payment for his lifes work is that he is clothed in rags and his feet are bare on the clods and he has no hatbut the brim of a hat only and his long unkempt gray hair comes through but all the air is full of warmth and of peace and beyond his village church there is at last light indeed his horses lag in the furrow and his own limbs totter and fail but one comes to help him it is a long field says death but well get to the end of it todayyou and i  90 and now that we know the meaning we are able to discuss the technical qualities farther  both of these engravings you will find are executed with blunt lines but more than that they are executed with quiet lines entirely steady  now here i have in my hand a lively woodcut of the present daya good average type of the modern style of woodcutting which you will all recognizer  the shade in this is drawn on the wood not cut but drawn observe at the rate of at least ten lines in a second holbeins at the rate of about one line in three secondss  91 now there are two different matters to be considered with respect to these two opposed methods of execution the first that the rapid work though easy to the artist is very difficult to the woodcutter so that it implies instantly a separation between the two crafts and that your woodcutter has ceased to be a draughtsman i shall return to this point i wish to insist on the other first namely the effect of the more deliberate method on the drawing itself  92 when the hand moves at the rate of ten lines in a second it is indeed under the government of the muscles of the wrist and shoulder but it cannot possibly be under the complete government of the brains i am able to do this zigzag line evenly because i have got the use of the hand from practice and the faster it is done the evener it will be but i have no mental authority over every line i thus lay chance regulates them whereas when i draw at the rate of two or three seconds to each line my hand disobeys the muscles a littlethe mechanical accuracy is not so great nay there ceases to be any appearance of dexterity at all but there is in reality more manual skill required in the slow work than in the swiftand all the while the hand is thoroughly under the orders of the brains holbein deliberately resolves for every line as it goes along that it shall be so thick so far from the nextthat it shall begin here and stop there and he is deliberately assigning the utmost quantity of meaning to it that a line will carry  93 it is not fair however to compare common work of one age with the best of another here is a woodcut of tenniels which i think contains as high qualities as it is possible to find in modern artt i hold it as beyond others fine because there is not the slightest caricature in it no face no attitude is pushed beyond the degree of natural humor they would have possessed in life and in precision of momentary expression the drawing is equal to the art of any time and shows power which would if regulated be quite adequate to producing an immortal work  94 why then is it not immortal you yourselves in compliance with whose demand it was done forgot it the next week it will become historically interesting but no man of true knowledge and feeling will ever keep this in his cabinet of treasure as he does these woodcuts of holbeins  the reason is that this is base coinalloyed gold there is gold in it but also a quantity of brass and leadwillfully addedto make it fit for the public holbeins is beaten gold seven times tried in the fire of which commonplace but useful metaphor the meaning here is first that to catch the vulgar eye a quantity ofsocalledlight and shade is added by tenniel it is effective to an ignorant eye and is ingeniously disposed but it is entirely conventional and false unendurable by any person who knows what chiaroscuro is  secondly for one line that holbein lays tenniel has a dozen there are for instance a hundred and fiftyseven lines in sir peter teazles wig without counting dots and slight crosshatchingbut the entire face and flowing hair of holbeins preacher are done with fortyfive lines all told  95 now observe what a different state of mind the two artists must be in on such conditionsone never in a hurry never doing anything that he knows is wrong never doing a line badly that he can do better and appealing only to the feelings of sensitive persons and the judgment of attentive ones that is holbeins habit of soul what is the habit of soul of every modern engraver always in a hurry everywhere doing things which he knows to be wrongtenniel knows his light and shade to be wrong as well as i docontinually doing things badly which he was able to do better and appealing exclusively to the feelings of the dull and the judgment of the inattentive  do you suppose that is not enough to make the difference between mortal and immortal artthe original genius being supposed alike in bothu  96 thus far of the state of the artist himself i pass next to the relation between him and his subordinate the woodcutter  the modern artist requires him to cut a hundred and fiftyseven lines in the wig onlythe old artist requires him to cut fortyfive for the face and long hair altogether the actual proportion is roughly and on the average about one to twenty of cost in manual labor ancient to modernthe twentieth part of the mechanical labor to produce an immortal instead of a perishable workthe twentieth part of the labor andwhich is the greatest difference of allthat twentieth part at once less mechanically difficult and more mentally pleasant mr otley in his general history of engraving says the greatest difficulty in wood engraving occurs in clearing out the minute quadrangular lights and in any modern woodcut you will see that where the lines of the drawing cross each other to produce shade the white interstices are cut out so neatly that there is no appearance of any jag or break in the lines they look exactly as if they had been drawn with a pen it is chiefly difficult to cut the pieces clearly out when the lines cross at right angles easier when they form oblique or diamondshaped interstices but in any case some halfdozen cuts and in square crossings as many as twenty are required to clear one interstice therefore if i carelessly draw six strokes with my pen across other six i produce twentyfive interstices each of which will need at least six perhaps twenty careful touches of the burin to clear outsay ten for an average and i demand two hundred and fifty exquisitely precise touches from my engraver to render ten careless ones of mine  97 now i take up punch at his best the whole of the left side of john bulls waistcoatthe shadow on his kneebreeches and greatcoatthe whole of the lord chancellors gown and of john bulls and sir peter teazles complexions are worked with finished precision of crosshatching these have indeed some purpose in their texture but in the most wanton and gratuitous way the wall below the window is crosshatched too and that not with a double but a treble line fig 4  there are about thirty of these columns with thirtyfive interstices each approximately 1050certainly not fewerinterstices to be deliberately cut clear to get that two inches square of shadow now calculateor think enough to feel the impossibility of calculatingthe number of woodcuts used daily for our popular prints and how many men are night and day cutting 1050 square holes to the square inch as the occupation of their manly life and mrs beecher stowe and the north americans fancy they have abolished slavery  illustration fig 4  98 the workman cannot have even the consolation of pride for his task even in its finest accomplishment is not really difficultonly tedious when you have once got into the practice it is as easy as lying to cut regular holes without a purpose is easy enough but to cut irregular holes with a purpose that is difficult foreverno tricks of tool or trade will give you power to do that  the supposed difficultythe thing which at all events it takes time to learn is to cut the interstices neat and each like the other but is there any reason do you suppose for their being neat and each like the other so far from it they would be twenty times prettier if they were irregular and each different from the other and an old woodcutter instead of taking pride in cutting these interstices smooth and alike resolutely cuts them rough and irregular taking care at the same time never to have any more than are wanted this being only one part of the general system of intelligent manipulation which made so good an artist of the engraver that it is impossible to say of any standard old woodcut whether the draughtsman engraved it himself or not i should imagine from the character and subtlety of the touch that every line of the dance of death had been engraved by holbein we know it was not and that there can be no certainty given by even the finest pieces of wood execution of anything more than perfect harmony between the designer and workman and consider how much this harmony demands in the latter not that the modern engraver is unintelligent in applying his mechanical skill very often he greatly improves the drawing but we never could mistake his hand for holbeins  99 the true merit then of wood execution as regards this matter of crosshatching is first that there be no more crossing than necessary secondly that all the interstices be various and rough you may look through the entire series of the dance of death without finding any crosshatching whatever except in a few unimportant bits of background so rude as to need scarcely more than one touch to each interstice albert dürer crosses more definitely but yet in any fold of his drapery every white spot differs in size from every other and the arrangement of the whole is delightful by the kind of variety which the spots on a leopard have  on the other hand where either expression or form can be rendered by the shape of the lights and darks the old engraver becomes as careful as in an ordinary ground he is careless  the endeavor with your own hand and common pen and ink to copy a small piece of either of the two holbein woodcuts figures 2 and 3 will prove this to you better than any words  100 i said that had tenniel been rightly trained there might have been the making of a holbein or nearly a holbein in him i do not know but i can turn from his work to that of a man who was not trained at all and who was without training holbeins equal  equal in the sense that this brown stone in my left hand is the equal though not the likeness of that in my right they are both of the same true and pure crystal but the one is brown with iron and never touched by forming hand the other has never been in rough companionship and has been exquisitely polished so with these two men the one was the companion of erasmus and sir thomas more his father was so good an artist that you cannot always tell their drawings asunder but the other was a farmers son and learned his trade in the back shops of newcastle  yet the first book i asked you to get was his biography and in this frame are set together a drawing by hans holbein and one by thomas bewick i know which is most scholarly but i do not know which is best  101 it is much to say for the selftaught englishmanyet do not congratulate yourselves on his simplicity i told you a little while since that the english nobles had left the history of birds to be written and their spots to be drawn by a printers ladbut i did not tell you their farther loss in the fact that this printers lad could have written their own histories and drawn their own spots if they had let him but they had no history to be written and were too closely maculate to be portrayedwhite ground in most places altogether obscured had there been mores and henrys to draw bewick could have drawn them and would have found his function as it was the nobles of his day left him to draw the frogs and pigs and sparrowsof his day which seemed to him in his solitude the best types of its nobility no sight or thought of beautiful things was ever granted himno heroic creature goddessbornhow much less any native deityever shone upon him to his utterly english mind the straw of the sty and its tenantry were abiding truththe cloud of olympus and its tenantry a childs dream he could draw a pig but not an aphrodite  102 the three pieces of woodcut from his fables the two lower ones enlarged in the opposite plate show his utmost strength and utmost rudeness i must endeavor to make you thoroughly understand boththe magnificent artistic power the flawless virtue veracity tendernessthe infinite humor of the man and yet the difference between england and florence in the use they make of such gifts in their children  for the moment however i confine myself to the examination of technical points and we must follow our former conclusions a little further  illustration i  things celestial and terrestrial as apparent to the english mind  103 because our lines in wood must be thick it becomes an extreme virtue in wood engraving to economize linesnot merely as in all other art to save time and power but because our lines being necessarily blunt we must make up our minds to do with fewer by many than are in the object but is this necessarily a disadvantage  absolutely an immense disadvantagea woodcut never can be so beautiful or good a thing as a painting or line engraving but in its own separate and useful way an excellent thing because practiced rightly it exercises in the artist and summons in you the habit of abstraction that is to say of deciding what are the essential points in the things you see and seizing these a habit entirely necessary to strong humanity and so natural to all humanity that it leads in its indolent and undisciplined states to all the vulgar amateurs liking of sketches better than pictures the sketch seems to put the thing for him into a concentrated and exciting form  104 observe therefore to guard you from this error that a bad sketch is good for nothing and that nobody can make a good sketch unless they generally are trying to finish with extreme care but the abstraction of the essential particulars in his subject by a linemaster has a peculiar didactic value for painting when it is complete leaves it much to your own judgment what to look at and if you are a fool you look at the wrong thingbut in a fine woodcut the master says to you you shall look at this or at nothing  105 for example here is a little tailpiece of bewicks to the fable of the frogs and the storkv he is as i told you as stout a reformer as holbeinw or botticelli or luther or savonarola and as an impartial reformer hits right and left at lower or upper classes if he sees them wrong most frequently he strikes at vice without reference to class but in this vignette he strikes definitely at the degradation of the viler popular mind which is incapable of being governed because it cannot understand the nobleness of kingship he has writtenbetter than written engraved sure to suffer no slip of typehis legend under the drawing so that we know his meaning  set them up with a king indeed  106 there is an audience of seven frogs listening to a speaker or croaker in the middle and bewick has set himself to show in all but especially in the speaker essential frogginess of mindthe marsh temper he could not have done it half so well in painting as he has done by the abstraction of woodoutline the characteristic of a manly mind or body is to be gentle in temper and firm in constitution the contrary essence of a froggy mind and body is to be angular in temper and flabby in constitution i have enlarged bewicks oratorfrog for you plate i c and i think you will feel that he is entirely expressed in those essential particulars  this being perfectly good woodcutting notice especially its deliberation no scrawling or scratching or crosshatching or free work of any sort most deliberate laying down of solid lines and dots of which you cannot change one the real difficulty of wood engraving is to cut every one of these black lines or spaces of the exactly right shape and not at all to crosshatch them cleanly  107 next examine the technical treatment of the pig above i have purposely chosen this as an example of a white object on dark ground and the frog as a dark object on light ground to explain to you what i mean by saying that fine engraving regards local color but not light and shade you see both frog and pig are absolutely without light and shade the frog indeed casts a shadow but his hind leg is as white as his throat in the pig you dont even know which way the light falls but you know at once that the pig is white and the frog brown or green  108 there are however two pieces of chiaroscuro implied in the treatment of the pig it is assumed that his curly tail would be light against the backgrounddark against his own rump this little piece of heraldic quartering is absolutely necessary to solidify him he would have been a white ghost of a pig flat on the background but for that alternative tail and the bits of dark behind the ears secondly where the shade is necessary to suggest the position of his ribs it is given with graphic and chosen points of dark as few as possible not for the sake of the shade at all but of the skin and bone  109 that then being the law of refused chiaroscuro observe further the method of outline we said that we were to have thick lines in wood if possible look what thickness of black outline bewick has left under our pigs chin and above his nose  but that is not a line at all you think  noa modern engraver would have made it one and prided himself on getting it fine bewick leaves it actually thicker than the snout but puts all his ingenuity of touch to vary the forms and break the extremities of his white cuts so that the eye may be refreshed and relieved by new forms at every turn the group of white touches filling the space between snout and ears might be a wreath of fineweather clouds so studiously are they grouped and broken  and nowhere you see does a single black line cross another  look back to figure 4 page 54 and you will know henceforward the difference between good and bad woodcutting  110 we have also in the lower woodcut a notable instance of bewicks power of abstraction you will observe that one of the chief characters of this frog which makes him humorousnext to his vain endeavor to get some firmness into his fore feetis his obstinately angular humpback and you must feel when you see it so marked how important a general character of a frog it is to have a humpbacknot at the shoulders but the loins  111 here then is a case in which you will see the exact function that anatomy should take in art  all the most scientific anatomy in the world would never have taught bewick much less you how to draw a frog  but when once you have drawn him or looked at him so as to know his points it then becomes entirely interesting to find out why he has a humpback so i went myself yesterday to professor rolleston for a little anatomy just as i should have gone to professor phillips for a little geology and the professor brought me a fine little active frog and we put him on the table and made him jump all over it and then the professor brought in a charming squelette of a frog and showed me that he needed a projecting bone from his rump as a bird needs it from its breastthe one to attach the strong muscles of the hind legs as the other to attach those of the fore legs or wings so that the entire leaping power of the frog is in his humpback as the flying power of the bird is in its breastbone and thus this frog parliament is most literally a rump parliamenteverything depending on the hind legs and nothing on the brains which makes it wonderfully like some other parliaments we know of nowadays with mr ayrton and mr lowe for their æsthetic and acquisitive eyes and a rump of railway directors  112 now to conclude for want of time onlyi have but touched on the beginning of my subjectunderstand clearly and finally this simple principle of all art that the best is that which realizes absolutely if possible here is a viper by carpaccio you are afraid to go near it here is an armchair by carpaccio you who came in late and are standing to my regret would like to sit down in it this is consummate art but you can only have that with consummate means and exquisitely trained and hereditary mental power  with inferior means and average mental power you must be content to give a rude abstraction but if rude abstraction is to be made think what a difference there must be between a wise mans and a fools and consider what heavy responsibility lies upon you in your youth to determine among realities by what you will be delighted and among imaginations by whose you will be led  footnotes  q by mr burgess the toil and skill necessary to produce a facsimile of this degree of precision will only be recognized by the reader who has had considerable experience of actual work  r the ordinary titlepage of punch  s in the lectureroom the relative rates of execution were shown i arrive at this estimate by timing the completion of two small pieces of shade in the two methods  t john bull as sir oliver surface with sir peter teazle and joseph surface it appeared in punch early in 1863  u in preparing these passages for the press i feel perpetual need of qualifications and limitations for it is impossible to surpass the humor or precision of expressional touch in the really golden parts of tenniels works and they may be immortal as representing what is best in their day  v from bewicks Æsops fables  w see ante § 43                              lecture iv                the technics of metal engraving   113 we are today to examine the proper methods for the technical management of the most perfect of the arms of precision possessed by the artist for you will at once understand that a line cut by a finelypointed instrument upon the smooth surface of metal is susceptible of the utmost fineness that can be given to the definite work of the human hand in drawing with pen upon paper the surface of the paper is slightly rough necessarily two points touch it instead of one and the liquid flows from them more or less irregularly whatever the draughtsmans skill but you cut a metallic surface with one edge only the furrow drawn by a skater on the surface of ice is like it on a large scale your surface is polished and your line may be wholly faultless if your hand is  114 and because in such material effects may be produced which no penmanship could rival most people i fancy think that a steel plate half engraves itself that the workman has no trouble with it compared to that of a pen draughtsman  to test your feeling in this matter accurately here is a manuscript book written with pen and ink and illustrated with flourishes and vignettes  you will all i think be disposed on examining it to exclaim how wonderful and even to doubt the possibility of every page in the book being completed in the same manner again here are three of my own drawings executed with the pen and indian ink when i was fifteen they are copies from large lithographs by prout and i imagine that most of my pupils would think me very tyrannical if i requested them to do anything of the kind themselves and yet when you see in the shop windows a line engraving like thisx or thisx either of which contains alone as much work as fifty pages of the manuscript book or fifty such drawings as mine you look upon its effect as quite a matter of courseyou never say how wonderful that is nor consider how you would like to have to live by producing anything of the same kind yourselves  illustration ii  the star of florence  115 yet you cannot suppose it is in reality easier to draw a line with a cutting point not seeing the effect at all or if any effect seeing a gleam of light instead of darkness than to draw your black line at once on the white paper you cannot really thinky that there is something complacent sympathetic and helpful in the nature of steel so that while a penandink sketch may always be considered an achievement proving cleverness in the sketcher a sketch on steel comes out by mere favor of the indulgent metal or that the plate is woven like a piece of pattern silk and the pattern is developed by pasteboard cards punched full of holes not so look close at this engraving or take a smaller and simpler one turners mercury and argusimagine it to be a drawing in pen and ink and yourself required similarly to produce its parallel true the steel point has the one advantage of not blotting but it has tenfold or twentyfold disadvantage in that you cannot slur nor efface except in a very resolute and laborious way nor play with it nor even see what you are doing with it at the moment far less the effect that is to be you must feel what you are doing with it and know precisely what you have got to do how deep how broad how far apart your lines must be etc and etc a couple of lines of etceteras would not be enough to imply all you must know but suppose the plate were only a pen drawing take your penyour finestand just try to copy the leaves that entangle the head of io and her head itself remembering always that the kind of work required here is mere childs play compared to that of fine figure engraving nevertheless take a small magnifying glass to thiscount the dots and lines that gradate the nostrils and the edges of the facial bone notice how the light is left on the top of the head by the stopping at its outline of the coarse touches which form the shadows under the leaves examine it well and theni humbly ask of youtry to do a piece of it yourself you clever sketcheryou young lady or gentleman of geniusyou eyeglassed dilettanteyou current writer of criticism royally plurali beseech youdo it yourself do the merely etched

easier piecetake either of the light sprays of foliage that rise against the fortress on the right pass your lens over themlook how their fine outline is first drawn leaf by leaf then how the distant

square quarter of an inchsay three thousand to the incheach with skillful intent put in its place and then consider what the ordinary sketchers work must appear to the men who have been trained to this  116 but might not more have been done by three thousand lines to a square inch you will perhaps ask well possibly it may be with lines as with soldiers three hundred knowing their work thoroughly may be stronger than three thousand less sure of their aim we shall have to press close home this question about numbers and purpose presentlyit is not the question now suppose certain results requiredatmospheric effects surface textures transparencies of shade confusions of lightthen more could not be done with less there are engravings of this modern school of which with respect to their particular aim it may be said most truly they cannot be better done  here is one just finishedor at least finished to the eyes of ordinary mortals though its fastidious master means to retouch ita quite pure line engraving by mr charles henry jeens in calling it pure line i mean that there are no mixtures of mezzotint or any mechanical tooling but all is steady handwork from a picture by mr armytage which without possessing any of the highest claims to admiration is yet free from the vulgar vices which disgrace most of our popular religious art and is so sweet in the fancy of it as to deserve better than many works of higher power the pains of the engraver to make it a common possession it is meant to help us to imagine the evening of the day when the father and mother of christ had been seeking him through jerusalem they have come to a well where women are drawing water st joseph passes onbut the tired madonna leaning on the wells margin asks wistfully of the women if they have seen such and such a child astray now will you just look for a while into the lines by which the expression of the weary and anxious face is rendered see how unerring they arehow calm and clear and think how many questions have to be determined in drawing the most minute portion of any oneits curveits thicknessits distance from the nextits own preparation for ending invisibly where it ends think what the precision must be in these that trace the edge of the lip and make it look quivering with disappointment or in these which have made the eyelash heavy with restrained tears  117 or if as must be the case with many of my audience it is impossible for you to conceive the difficulties here overcome look merely at the draperies and other varied substances represented in the plate see how silk and linen and stone and pottery and flesh are all separated in texture and gradated in light by the most subtle artifices and appliances of lineof which artifices and the nature of the mechanical labor throughout i must endeavor to give you today a more distinct conception than you are in the habit of forming but as i shall have to blame some of these methods in their general result and i do not wish any word of general blame to be associated with this most excellent and careful plate by mr jeens i will pass for special examination to one already in your reference series which for the rest exhibits more various treatment in its combined landscape background and figures the belle jardinière of raphael drawn and engraved by the baron desnoyers  you see in the first place that the ground stones and other coarse surfaces are distinguished from the flesh and draperies by broken and wriggled lines those broken lines cannot be executed with the burin they are etched in the early states of the plate and are a modern artifice never used by old engravers partly because the older men were not masters of the art of etching but chiefly because even those who were acquainted with it would not employ lines of this nature they have been developed by the importance of landscape in modern engraving and have produced some valuable results in small plates especially of architecture but they are entirely erroneous in principle for the surface of stones and leaves is not broken or jagged in this manner but consists of mossy or blooming or otherwise organic texture which cannot be represented by these coarse lines their general consequence has therefore been to withdraw the mind of the observer from all beautiful and tender characters in foreground and eventually to destroy the very school of landscape engraving which gave birth to them  considered however as a means of relieving more delicate textures they are in some degree legitimate being in fact a kind of chasing or jagging one part of the plate surface in order to throw out the delicate tints from the rough field but the same effect was produced with less pains and far more entertainment to the eye by the older engravers who employed purely ornamental variations of line thus in plate iv opposite § 137 the drapery is sufficiently distinguished from the grass by the treatment of the latter as an ornamental arabesque the grain of wood is elaborately engraved by marc antonio with the same purpose in the plate given in your standard series  118 next however you observe what difference of texture and force exists between the smooth continuous lines themselves which are all really engraved you must take some pains to understand the nature of this operation  the line is first cut lightly through its whole course by absolute decision and steadiness of hand which you may endeavor to imitate if you like in its simplest phase by drawing a circle with your compasspen and then grasping your penholder so that you can push the point like a plow describing other circles inside or outside of it in exact parallelism with the mathematical line and at exactly equal distances to approach or depart with your point at finely gradated intervals may be your next exercise if you find the first unexpectedly easy  119 when the line is thus described in its proper course it is plowed deeper where depth is needed by a second cut of the burin first on one side then on the other the cut being given with gradated force so as to take away most steel where the line is to be darkest every line of gradated depth in the plate has to be thus cut eight or ten times over at least with retouchings to smooth and clear all in the close jason has to plow his field tenfurrow deep with his fiery oxen well in hand all the while  when the essential lines are thus produced in their several directions those which have been drawn across each other so as to give depth of shade or richness of texture have to be farther enriched by dots in the interstices else there would be a painful appearance of network everywhere and these dots require each four or five jags to produce them and each of these jags must be done with what artists and engravers alike call feelingthe sensibility that is of a hand completely under mental government so wrought the dots look soft and like touches of paint but mechanically dug in they are vulgar and hard  120 now observe that for every piece of shadow throughout the work the engraver has to decide with what quantity and kind of line he will produce it exactly the same quantity of black and therefore the same depth of tint in general effect may be given with six thick lines or with twelve of half their thickness or with eighteen of a third of the thickness the second six second twelve or second eighteen may cross the first six first twelve or first eighteen or go between them and they may cross at any angle and then the third six may be put between the first six or between the second six or across both and at any angle in the network thus produced any kind of dots may be put in the severally shaped interstices and for any of the series of superadded lines dots of equivalent value in shade may be substituted some engravings are wrought in dots altogether choice infinite with multiplication of infinity is at all events to be made for every minute space from one side of the plate to the other  121 the excellence of a beautiful engraving is primarily in the use of these resources to exhibit the qualities of the original picture with delight to the eye in the method of translation and the language of engraving when once you begin to understand it is in these respects so fertile so ingenious so ineffably subtle and severe in its grammar that you may quite easily make it the subject of your lifes investigation as you would the scholarship of a lovely literature  but in doing this you would withdraw and necessarily withdraw your attention from the higher qualities of art precisely as a grammarian who is that and nothing more loses command of the matter and substance of thought and the exquisitely mysterious mechanisms of the engravers method have in fact thus entangled the intelligence of the careful draughtsmen of europe so that since the final perfection of this translators power all the men of finest patience and finest hand have stayed content with itthe subtlest draughtsmanship has perished from the canvasz and sought more popular praise in this labyrinth of disciplined language and more or less dulled or degraded thought and in sum i know no cause more direct or fatal in the destruction of the great schools of european art than the perfectness of modern line engraving  122 this great and profoundly to be regretted influence i will prove and illustrate to you on another occasion my object today is to explain the perfectness of the art itself and above all to request you if you will not look at pictures instead of photographs at least not to allow the cheap merits of the chemical operation to withdraw your interest from the splendid human labor of the engraver here is a little vignette from stothard for instance in rogers poems to the lines      soared in the swing half pleased and half afraid      neath sister elms that waved their summer shade  you would think would you not and rightly that of all difficult things to express with crossed black lines and dots the face of a young girl must be the most difficult yet here you have the face of a bright girl radiant in light transparent mysterious almost breathingher dark hair involved in delicate wreath and shade her eyes full of joy and sweet playfulnessand all this done by the exquisite order and gradation of a very few lines which if you will examine them through a lens you find dividing and checkering the lip and cheek and chin so strongly that you would have fancied they could only produce the effect of a grim iron mask but the intelligences of order and form guide them into beauty and inflame them with delicatest life  123 and do you see the size of this head about as large as the bud of a forgetmenot can you imagine the fineness of the little pressures of the hand on the steel in that space which at the edge of the almost invisible lip fashioned its less or more of smile  my chemical friends if you wish ever to know anything rightly concerning the arts i very urgently advise you to throw all your vials and washes down the guttertrap and if you will ascribe as you think it so clever to do in your modern creeds all virtue to the sun use that virtue through your own heads and fingers and apply your solar energies to draw a skillful line or two for once or twice in your life you may learn more by trying to engrave like goodall the tip of an ear or the curl of a lock of hair than by photographing the entire population of the united states of americablack white and neutraltint  and one word by the way touching the complaints i hear at my having set you to so fine work that it hurts your eyes you have noticed that all great sculptorsand most of the great painters of florencebegan by being goldsmiths why do you think the goldsmiths apprenticeship is so fruitful primarily because it forces the boy to do small work and mind what he is about do you suppose michael angelo learned his business by dashing or hitting at it he laid the foundation of all his after power by doing precisely what i am requiring my own pupils to docopying german engravings in facsimile and for your eyesyou all sit up at night till you havent got any eyes worth speaking of go to bed at halfpast nine and get up at four and youll see something out of them in time  124 nevertheless whatever admiration you may be brought to feel and with justice for this lovely workmanshipthe more distinctly you comprehend its merits the more distinctly also will the question rise in your mind how is it that a performance so marvelous has yet taken no rank in the records of art of any permanent or acknowledged kind how is it that these vignettes from stothard and turneraa like the woodcuts from tenniel scarcely make the name of the engraver known and that they never are found side by side with this older and apparently ruder art in the cabinets of men of real judgment the reason is precisely the same as in the case of the tenniel woodcut this modern line engraving is alloyed gold rich in capacity astonishing in attainment it nevertheless admits willful fault and misses what it ought first to have attained it is therefore to a certain measure vile in its perfection while the older work is noble even in its failure and classic no less in what it deliberately refuses than in what it rationally and rightly prefers and performs  125 here for instance i have enlarged the head of one of dürers madonnas for you out of one of his most careful platesab you think it very ugly well so it is dont be afraid to think so nor to say so frightfully ugly vulgar also it is the head simply of a fat dutch girl with all the pleasantness left out there is not the least doubt about that dont let anybody force albert dürer down your throats nor make you expect pretty things from him stothards young girl in the swing or sir joshuas age of innocence is in quite angelic sphere of another world compared to this black domain of poor laborious albert we are not talking of female beauty so please you just now gentlemen but of engraving and the merit the classical indefeasible immortal merit of this head of a dutch girl with all the beauty left out is in the fact that every line of it as engraving is as good as can begood not with the mechanical dexterity of a watchmaker but with the intellectual effort and sensitiveness of an artist who knows precisely what can be done and ought to be attempted with his assigned materials he works easily fearlessly flexibly the dots are not all measured in distance the lines not all mathematically parallel or divergent he has even missed his mark at the mouth in one place and leaves the mistake frankly but there are no petrified mistakes nor is the eye so accustomed to the look of the mechanical furrow as to accept it for final excellence the engraving is full of the painters higher power and wider perception it is classically perfect because duly subordinate and presenting for your applause only the virtues proper to its own sphere among these i must now reiterate the first of all is the decorative arrangement of lines  126 you all know what a pretty thing a damask tablecloth is and how a pattern is brought out by threads running one way in one space and across in another so in lace a certain delightfulness is given by the texture of meshed lines  similarly on any surface of metal the object of the engraver is or ought to be to cover it with lovely lines forming a lacework and including a variety of spaces delicious to the eye  and this is his business primarily before any other matter can be thought of his work must be ornamental you know i told you a sculptors business is first to cover a surface with pleasant bosses whether they mean anything or not so an engravers is to cover it with pleasant lines whether they mean anything or not that they should mean something and a good deal of something is indeed desirable afterwards but first we must be ornamental  127 now if you will compare plate ii at the beginning of this lecture which is a characteristic example of good florentine engraving and represents the planet and power of aphrodite with the aphrodite of bewick in the upper division of plate i you will at once understand the difference between a primarily ornamental and a primarily realistic style the first requirement in the florentine work is that it shall be a lovely arrangement of lines a pretty thing upon a page bewick has a secondary notion of making his vignette a pretty thing upon a page but he is overpowered by his vigorous veracity and bent first on giving you his idea of venus quite right he would have been mind you if he had been carving a statue of her on mount eryx but not when he was engraving a vignette to Æsops fables to engrave well is to ornament a surface well not to create a realistic impression i beg your pardon for my repetitions but the point at issue is the root of the whole business and i must get it well asserted and variously  let me pass to a more important example  128 three years ago in the rough first arrangement of the copies in the educational series i put an outline of the top of apollos scepter which in the catalogue was said to be probably by baccio bandini of florence for your first real exercise it remains so the olive being put first only for its mythological rank  the series of engravings to which the plate from which that exercise is copied belongs are part of a number executed chiefly i think from early designs of sandro botticelli and some in great part by his hand he and his assistant baccio worked together and in such harmony that bandini probably often does what sandro wants better than sandro could have done it himself and on the other hand there is no design of bandinis over which sandro does not seem to have had influence  and wishing now to show you three examples of the finest work of the old the renaissance and the modern schoolsof the old i will take baccio bandinis astrologia plate iii opposite of the renaissance dürers adam and eve and of the modern this head of the daughter of herodias engraved from luini by beaugrand which is as affectionately and sincerely wrought though in the modern manner as any plate of the old schools  illustration iii  at evning from the top of fésole  129 now observe the progress of the feeling for light and shade in the three examples  the first is nearly all white paper you think of the outline as the constructive element throughout  the second is a vigorous piece of white and blacknot of light and shadefor all the high lights are equally white whether of flesh or leaves or goats hair  the third is complete in chiaroscuro as far as engraving can be  now the dignity and virtue of the plates is in the exactly inverse ratio of their fullness in chiaroscuro  bandinis is excellent work and of the very highest school dürers entirely accomplished work but of an inferior school and beaugrands excellent work but of a vulgar and nonclassical school  and these relations of the schools are to be determined by the quality in the lines we shall find that in proportion as the light and shade is neglected the lines are studied that those of bandini are perfect of dürer perfect only with a lower perfection but of beaugrand entirely faultful  130 i have just explained to you that in modern engraving the lines are cut in clean furrow widened it may be by successive cuts but whether it be fine or thick retaining always when printed the aspect of a continuous line drawn with the pen and entirely black throughout its whole course  now we may increase the delicacy of this line to any extent by simply printing it in gray color instead of black i obtained some very beautiful results of this kind in the later volumes of modern painters with mr armytages help by using subdued purple tints but in any case the line thus engraved must be monotonous in its character and cannot be expressive of the finest qualities of form  accordingly the old florentine workmen constructed the line itself in important places of successive minute touches so that it became a chain of delicate links which could be opened or closed at pleasureac if you will examine through a lens the outline of the face of this astrology you will find it is traced with an exquisite series of minute touches susceptible of accentuation or change absolutely at the engravers pleasure and in result corresponding to the finest conditions of a pencil line drawing by a consummate master in the fine plates of this period you have thus the united powers of the pen and pencil and both absolutely secure and multipliable  131 i am a little proud of having independently discovered and had the patience to carry out this florentine method of execution for myself when i was a boy of thirteen my good drawingmaster had given me some copies calculated to teach me freedom of hand the touches were rapid and vigorousmany of them in mechanically regular zigzags far beyond any capacity of mine to imitate in the bold way in which they were done but i was resolved to have them somehow and actually facsimiled a considerable portion of the drawing in the florentine manner with the finest point i could cut to my pencil taking a quarter of an hour to forge out the likeness of one return in the zigzag which my master carried down through twenty returns in two seconds and so successfully that he did not detect my artifice till i showed it himon which he forbade me ever to do the like again and it was only thirty years afterwards that i found i had been quite right after all and working like baccio bandini but the patience which carried me through that early effort served me well through all the thirty years and enabled me to analyze and in a measure imitate the method of work employed by every master so that whether you believe me or not at first you will find what i tell you of their superiority or inferiority to be true  132 when lines are studied with this degree of care you may be sure the master will leave room enough for you to see them and enjoy them and not use any at random all the finest engravers therefore leave much white paper and use their entire power on the outlines  133 next to them come the men of the renaissance schools headed by dürer who less careful of the beauty and refinement of the line delight in its vigor accuracy and complexity and the essential difference between these men and the moderns is that these central masters cut their line for the most part with a single furrow giving it depth by force of hand or wrist and retouching not in the furrow itself but with others beside itad such work can only be done well on copper and it can display all faculty of hand or wrist precision of eye and accuracy of knowledge which a human creature can possess but the dotted or hatched line is not used in this central style and the higher conditions of beauty never thought of  in the astrology of bandiniand remember that the astrologia of the florentine meant what we mean by astronomy and much morehe wishes you first to look at the face the lip half open faltering in wonder the amazed intense dreaming gaze the pure dignity of forehead undisturbed by terrestrial thought none of these things could be so much as attempted in dürers method he can engrave flowing hair skin of animals bark of trees wreathings of metalwork with the free hand also with labored chiaroscuro or with sturdy line he can reach expressions of sadness or gloom or pain or soldierly strengthbut pure beautynever  134 lastly you have the modern school deepening its lines in successive cuts the instant consequence of the introduction of this method is the restriction of curvature you cannot follow a complex curve again with precision through its furrow if you are a dextrous plowman you can drive your plow any number of times along the simple curve but you cannot repeat again exactly the motions which cut a variable oneae you may retouch it energize it and deepen it in parts but you cannot cut it all through again equally and the retouching and energizing in parts is a living and intellectual process but the cutting all through equally a mechanical one the difference is exactly such as that between the dexterity of turning out two similar moldings from a lathe and carving them with the free hand like a pisan sculptor and although splendid intellect and subtlest sensibility have been spent on the production of some modern plates the mechanical element introduced by their manner of execution always overpowers both nor can any plate of consummate value ever be produced in the modern method  135 nevertheless in landscape there are two examples in your reference series of insuperable skill and extreme beauty millers plate before instanced of the grand canal venice and e goodalls of the upper fall of the tees the men who engraved these plates might have been exquisite artists but their patience and enthusiasm were held captive in the false system of lines and we lost the painters while the engravings wonderful as they are are neither of them worth a turner etching scratched in ten minutes with the point of an old fork and the common types of such elaborate engraving are none of them worth a single frog pig or puppy out of the corner of a bewick vignette  136 and now i think you cannot fail to understand clearly what you are to look for in engraving as a separate art from that of painting turn back to the astrologia as a perfect type of the purest school she is gazing at stars and crowned with them but the stars are black instead of shining you cannot have a more decisive and absolute proof that you must not look in engraving for chiaroscuro  nevertheless her body is half in shade and her left foot and she casts a shadow and there is a bar of shade behind her  all these are merely so much acceptance of shade as may relieve the forms and give value to the linear portions the face though turned from the light is shadowless  again every lock of the hair is designed and set in its place with the subtlest care but there is no luster attemptedno textureno mystery the plumes of the wings are set studiously in their placesthey also lusterless that even their filaments are not drawn and that the broad curve embracing them ignores the anatomy of a birds wing are conditions of design not execution of these in a future lectureaf  illustration iv  by the springs of parnassus  137 the poesia plate iv opposite is a still more severe though not so generic an example its decorative foreground reducing it almost to the rank of goldsmiths ornamentation i need scarcely point out to you that the flowing water shows neither luster nor reflection but notice that the observers attention is supposed to be so close to every dark touch of the graver that he will see the minute dark spots which indicate the sprinkled shower falling from the vase into the pool  138 this habit of strict and calm attention constant in the artist and expected in the observer makes all the difference between the art of intellect and of mere sensation for every detail of this plate has a meaning if you care to understand it this is poetry sitting by the fountain of castalia which flows first out of a formal urn to show that it is not artless but the rocks of parnassus are behind and on the top of themonly one tree like a mushroom with a thick stalk you at first are inclined to say how very absurd to put only one tree on parnassus but this one tree is the immortal plane tree planted by agamemnon and at once connects our poesia with the iliad then this is the hem of the robe of poetrythis is the divine vegetation which springs up under her feetthis is the heaven and earth united by her powerthis is the fountain of castalia flowing out afresh among the grassand these are the drops with which out of a pitcher poetry is nourishing the fountain of castalia  all which you may find out if you happen to know anything about castalia or about poetry and pleasantly think more upon for yourself but the poor dunces sandro and baccio feeling themselves but goffi nell arte have no hope of telling you all this except suggestively they cant engrave grass of parnassus nor sweet springs so as to look like water but they can make a pretty damasked surface with ornamental leaves and flowing lines and so leave you something to think ofif you will  139 but a great many people wont and a great many more cant and surely the finished engravings are much more delightful and the only means we have of giving any idea of finished pictures out of our reach  yes all that is true and when we examine the effects of line engraving upon taste in recent art we will discuss these matters for the present let us be content with knowing what the best work is and why it is so although however i do not now press further my cavils at the triumph of modern line engraving i must assign to you in few words the reason of its recent decline engravers complain that photography and cheap woodcutting have ended their finer craft no complaint can be less grounded they themselves destroyed their own craft by vulgarizing it content in their beautiful mechanism they ceased to learn and to feel as artists they put themselves under the order of publishers and printsellers they worked indiscriminately from whatever was put into their handsfrom bartlett as willingly as from turner and from mulready as carefully as from raphael they filled the windows of printsellers the pages of gift books with elaborate rubbish and piteous abortions of delicate industry they worked cheap and cheapersmoothly and more smoothlythey got armies of assistants and surrounded themselves with schools of mechanical tricksters learning their stale tricks with blundering avidity they had fallenbefore the days of photographyinto providers of frontispieces for housekeepers pocketbooks i do not know if photography itself their redoubted enemy has even now ousted them from that last refuge  140 such the fault of the engraververy pardonable scarcely avoidablehowever fatal fault mainly of humility but what has your fault been gentlemen what the patrons fault who have permitted so wide waste of admirable labor so pathetic a uselessness of obedient genius it was yours to have directed yours to have raised and rejoiced in the skill the modesty the patience of this entirely gentle and industrious racecopyists with their heart the common paintercopyists who encumber our european galleries with their easels and pots are almost without exception persons too stupid to be painters and too lazy to be engravers the real copyiststhe men who can put their soul into anothers workare employed at home in their narrow rooms striving to make their good work profitable to all men and in their submission to the public taste they are truly national servants as much as prime ministers are they fulfill the demand of the nation what as a people you wish to have for possession in art these men are ready to give you  and what have you hitherto asked of themramsgate sands and dolly vardens and the paddington stationthese i think are typical of your chief demands the cartoons of raphaelwhich you dont care to see themselves and by way of a flight into the empyrean the madonna di san sisto and literally there are hundreds of cities and villages in italy in which roof and wall are blazoned with the noblest divinity and philosophy ever imagined by men and of all this treasure i can as far as i know give you not one example in line engraving by an english hand  well you are in the main matter right in this you want essentially ramsgate sands and the paddington station because there you can see yourselves  make yourselves then worthy to be seen forever and let english engraving become noble as the record of english loveliness and honor  footnotes  x millers large plate of the grand canal venice after turner and goodalls of tivoli after turner the other examples referred to are left in the university galleries  y this paragraph was not read at the lecture time not allowingit is part of what i wrote on engraving some years ago in the papers for the art journal called the cestus of aglaia refer now to on the old road  z an effort has lately been made in france by meissonier gérome and their school to recover it with marvelous collateral skill of engravers the etching of géromes louis xiv and molière is one of the completest pieces of skillful mechanism ever put on metal  aa i must again qualify the too sweeping statement of the text i think as time passes some of these nineteenth century line engravings will become monumental the first vignette of the garden with the cut hedges and fountain for instance in rogers poems is so consummate in its use of every possible artifice of delicate line note the look of tremulous atmosphere got by the undulatory etched lines on the pavement and the broken masses worked with dots of the fountain foam that i think it cannot but with some of its companions survive the refuse of its school and become classic i find in like manner even with all their faults and weaknesses the vignettes to heynes virgil to be real artpossessions  ab plate xi in the appendix taken from the engraving of the virgin sitting in the fenced garden with two angels crowning her  ac the method was first developed in engraving designs on silvernumbers of lines being executed with dots by the punch for varietys sake for niello and printing a transverse cut was substituted for the blow the entire style is connected with the later roman and byzantine method of drawing lines with the drill hole in marble see above lecture ii section 70  ad this most important and distinctive character was pointed out to me by mr burgess  ae this point will be further examined and explained in the appendix  af see appendix article i                              lecture v           design in the german schools of engraving   141 by reference to the close of the preface to eagles nest you will see gentlemen that i meant these lectures from the first rather to lead you to the study of the characters of two great men than to interest you in the processes of a secondary form of art as i draw my materials into the limited form necessary for the hour i find my divided purpose doubly failing and would fain rather use my time today in supplying the defects of my last lecture than in opening the greater subject which i must treat with still more lamentable inadequacy nevertheless you must not think it is for want of time that i omit reference to other celebrated engravers and insist on the special power of these two only many not inconsiderable reputations are founded merely on the curiosity of collectors of prints or on partial skill in the management of processes others though resting on more secure bases are still of no importance to you in the general history of art whereas you will find the work of holbein and botticelli determining for you without need of any farther range the principal questions of moment in the relation of the northern and southern schools of design nay a wider method of inquiry would only render your comparison less accurate in result it is only in holbeins majestic range of capacity and only in the particular phase of teutonic life which his art adorned that the problem can be dealt with on fair terms we northerns can advance no fairly comparable antagonist to the artists of the south except at that one moment and in that one man rubens cannot for an instant be matched with tintoret nor memling with lippi while reynolds only rivals titian in what he learned from him but in holbein and botticelli we have two men trained independently equal in power of intellect similar in material and mode of work contemporary in age correspondent in disposition the relation between them is strictly typical of the constant aspects to each other of the northern and southern schools  142 their point of closest contact is in the art of engraving and this art is developed entirely as the servant of the great passions which perturbed or polluted europe in the fifteenth century the impulses which it obeys are all new and it obeys them with its own nascent plasticity of temper painting and sculpture are only modified by them but engraving is educated  these passions are in the main three namely  1 the thirst for classical literature and the forms of proud and false taste which arose out of it in the position it had assumed as the enemy of christianity  2 the pride of science enforcing in the particular domain of art accuracy of perspective shade and anatomy never before dreamed of  3 the sense of error and iniquity in the theological teaching of the christian church felt by the highest intellects of the time and necessarily rendering the formerly submissive religious art impossible  today then our task is to examine the peculiar characters of the design of the northern schools of engraving as affected by these great influences  143 i have not often however used the word design and must clearly define the sense in which i now use it it is vaguely used in common artparlance often as if it meant merely the drawing of a picture as distinct from its color and in other still more inaccurate ways the accurate and proper sense underlying all these i must endeavor to make clear to you  design properly signifies that power in any artwork which has a purpose other than of imitation and which is designed composed or separated to that end it implies the rejection of some things and the insistence upon others with a given objectag  let us take progressive instances here is a group of prettily dressed peasant children charmingly painted by a very able modern artistnot absolutely without design for he really wishes to show you how pretty peasant children can be and in so far is wiser and kinder than murillo who likes to show how ugly they can be also his group is agreeably arranged and its component children carefully chosen nevertheless any summers day near any country village you may come upon twenty groups in an hour as pretty as this and may seeif you have eyeschildren in them twenty times prettier than these a photograph if it could render them perfectly and in color would far excel the charm of this painting for in it good and clever as it is there is nothing supernatural and much that is subnatural  144 beside this group of in every sense of the word artless little country girls i will now set onein the best sense of the wordartful little country girla sketch by gainsborough  you never saw her like before never will again now that gainsborough is dead no photographyno scienceno industry will touch or reach for an instant this supernaturalness you will look vainly through the summer fields for such a child nor up the lawn nor by the wood is she whence do you think this marvelous charm has come alas if we knew would not we all be gainsboroughs this only you may practically ascertain as surely as that a flower will die if you cut its root away that you cannot alter a single touch in gainsboroughs work without injury to the whole half a dozen spots more or less in the printed gowns of these other children whom i first showed you will not make the smallest difference to them nor a lock or two more or less in their hair nor a dimple or two more or less in their cheeks but if you alter one wave of the hair of gainsboroughs girl the child is gone yet the art is so subtle that i do not expect you to believe this it looks so instinctive so easy so chanceuxthe french word is better than ours yes and in their more accurate sense also il a de la chance a stronger designer than he was with him he could not tell you himself how the thing was done  145 i proceed to take a more definite instancethis greek head of the lacinian juno the design or appointing of the forms now entirely prevails over the resemblance to nature no real hair could ever be drifted into these wild lines which mean the wrath of the adriatic winds round the cape of storms  and yet whether this be uglier or prettier than gainsboroughs childand you know already what i think about it that no greek goddess was ever half so pretty as an english girl of pure clay and temperuglier or prettier it is more dignified and impressive it at least belongs to the domain of a lordlier more majestic more guiding and ordaining art  146 i will go back another five hundred years and place an egyptian beside the greek divinity the resemblance to nature is now all but lost the ruling law has become all the lines are reduced to an easily counted number and their arrangement is little more than a decorative sequence of pleasant curves cut in porphyryin the upper part of their contour following the outline of a womans face in profile overcrested by that of a hawk on a kind of pedestal but that the signengraver meant by his hawk immortality and by her pedestal the house or tavern of truth is of little importance now to the passing traveler not yet preparing to take the sarcophagus for his place of rest  147 how many questions are suggested to us by these transitions is beauty contrary to law and grace attainable only through license what we gain in language shall we lose in thought and in what we add of labor more and more forget its ends  not so  look at this piece of sandros work the libyan sibylah  it is as ordered and normal as the egyptiansas graceful and facile as gainsboroughs it retains the majesty of old religion it is invested with the joy of newly awakened childhood  mind i do not expect youdo not wish youto enjoy botticellis dark engraving as much as gainsboroughs aerial sketch for due comparison of the men painting should be put beside painting but there is enough even in this copy of the florentine plate to show you the junction of the two powers in itof prophecy and delight  148 will these two powers do you suppose be united in the same manner in the contemporary northern art that northern school is my subject today and yet i give you as type of the intermediate condition between egypt and englandnot holbein but botticelli i am obliged to do this because in the southern art the religious temper remains unconquered by the doctrines of the reformation botticelli waswhat luther wished to be but could not bea reformer still believing in the church his mind is at peace and his art therefore can pursue the delight of beauty and yet remain prophetic but it was far otherwise in germany there the reformation of manners became the destruction of faith and art therefore not a prophecy but a protest it is the chief work of the greatest protestant who ever livedai which i ask you to study with me today  149 i said that the power of engraving had developed itself during the introduction of three newpractically and vitally new that is to sayelements into the minds of men elements which briefly may be expressed thus      1 classicism and literary science      2 medicine and physical scienceaj      3 reformation and religious science  and first of classicism  you feel do not you in this typical work of gainsboroughs that his subject as well as his picture is artless in a lovely sensenay not only artless but ignorant and unscientific in a beautiful way you would be afterwards remorseful i think and angry with yourselfseeing the effect produced on her faceif you were to ask this little lady to spell a very long word also if you wished to know how many times the sevens go in fortynine you would perhaps wisely address yourself elsewhere on the other hand you do not doubt that this ladyak knows very well how many times the sevens go in fortynine and is more mistress of arts than any of us are masters of them  150 you have then in the one case a beautiful simplicity and a blameless ignorance in the other a beautiful artfulness and a wisdom which you do not dreador at least even though dreading love but you know also that we may remain in a hateful and culpable ignorance and as i fear too many of us in competitive effort feel become possessed of a hateful knowledge  ignorance therefore is not evil absolutely but innocent may be lovable  knowledge also is not good absolutely but guilty may be hateful  so therefore when i now repeat my former statement that the first main opposition between the northern and southern schools is in the simplicity of the one and the scholarship of the other that statement may imply sometimes the superiority of the north and sometimes of the south you may have a heavenly simplicity opposed to a hellish that is to say a lustful and arrogant scholarship or you may have a barbarous and presumptuous ignorance opposed to a divine and disciplined wisdom ignorance opposed to learning in both cases but evil to good as the case may be  151 for instance the last time i was standing before raphaels arabesques in the loggias of the vatican i wrote down in my pocketbook the description or more modestly speaking the inventory of the small portion of that infinite wilderness of sensual fantasy which happened to be opposite me it consisted of a womans face with serpents for hair and a virgins breasts with stumps for arms ending in blue butterflies wings the whole changing at the waist into a goats body which ended below in an obelisk upsidedown to the apex at the bottom of which were appended by graceful chains an altar and two bunches of grapes  now you know in a moment by a glance at this designbeautifully struck with free hand and richly gradated in colorthat the master was familiar with a vast range of art and literature that he knew all about egyptian sphinxes and greek gorgons about egyptian obelisks and hebrew altars about hermes and venus and bacchus and satyrs and goats and grapes  you know alsoor ought to know in an instantthat all this learning has done him no good that he had better have known nothing than any of these things since they were to be used by him only to such purpose and that his delight in armless breasts legless trunks and obelisks upsidedown has been the last effort of his expiring sensation in the grasp of corrupt and altogether victorious death and you have thus in gainsborough as compared with raphael a sweet sacred and living simplicity set against an impure profane and paralyzed knowledge  152 but next let us consider the reverse conditions  let us take instance of contrast between faultful and treacherous ignorance and divinely pure and fruitful knowledge  in the place of honor at the end of one of the rooms of your royal academyyears agostood a picture by an english academician announced as a representation of moses sustained by aaron and hur during the discomfiture of amalek in the entire range of the pentateuch there is no other scene in which the visible agents are mortal only requiring so much knowledge and thought to reach even a distant approximation to the probabilities of the fact one saw in a moment that the painter was both powerful and simple after a sort that he had really sought for a vital conception and had originally and earnestly read his text and formed his conception and one saw also in a moment that he had chanced upon this subject in reading or hearing his bible as he might have chanced on a dramatic scene accidentally in the street that he knew nothing of the character of mosesnothing of his lawnothing of the character of aaron nor of the nature of a priesthoodnothing of the meaning of the event which he was endeavoring to represent of the temper in which it would have been transacted by its agents or of its relations to modern life  153 on the contrary in the fresco of the earlier scenes in the life of moses by sandro botticelli you knownot in a moment for the knowledge of knowledge cannot be so obtained but in proportion to the discretion of your own reading and to the care you give to the picture you may knowthat here is a sacredly guided and guarded learning here a master indeed at whose feet you may sit safely who can teach you better than in words the significance of both moses law and aarons ministry and not only these but if he chose could add to this an exposition as complete of the highest philosophies both of the greek nation and of his own and could as easily have painted had it been asked of him draco or numa or justinian as the herdsman of jethro  154 it is rarely that we can point to an opposition between faultful because insolent ignorance and virtuous because gracious knowledge so direct and in so parallel elements as in this instance in general the analysis is much more complex it is intensely difficult to indicate the mischief of involuntary and modest ignorance calamitous only in a measure fruitful in its lower field yet sorrowfully condemned to that lower fieldnot by sin but fate  when first i introduced you to bewick we closed our too partial estimate of his entirely magnificent powers with one sorrowful concessionhe could draw a pig but not a venus  eminently he could so becausewhich is still more sorrowfully to be concededhe liked the pig best i have put now in your educational series a whole galaxy of pigs by him but hunting all the fables through i find only one venus and i think you will all admit that she is an unsatisfactory venusal there is honest simplicity here but you regret it you miss something that you find in holbein much more in botticelli you see in a moment that this man knows nothing of sphinxes or muses or graces or aphrodites and besides that knowing nothing he would have no liking for them even if he saw them but much prefers the style of a welltodo english housekeeper with corkscrew curls and a portly person  155 you miss something i said in bewick which you find in holbein but do you suppose holbein himself or any other northern painter could wholly quit himself of the like accusations i told you in the second of these lectures that the northern temper refined from savageness and the southern redeemed from decay met in florence holbein and botticelli are the purest types of the two races holbein is a civilized boor botticelli a reanimate greek holbein was polished by companionship with scholars and kings but remains always a burgher of augsburg in essential nature bewick and he are alike in temper only the one is untaught the other perfectly taught but botticelli needs no teaching he is by his birth scholar and gentleman to the hearts core christianity itself can only inspire him not refine him he is as tried gold chased by the jewelerthe roughest part of him is the outside  now how differently must the newly recovered scholastic learning tell upon these two men it is all out of holbeins way foreign to his nature useless at the best probably cumbrous but botticelli receives it as a child in later years recovers the forgotten dearness of a nursery tale and is more himself and again and again himself as he breathes the air of greece and hears in his own italy the lost voice of the sibyl murmur again by the avernus lake  156 it is not as we have seen every one of the southern race who can thus receive it but it graces them all is at once a part of their being destroys them if it is to destroy the more utterly because it so enters into their natures it destroys raphael but it graces him and is a part of him it all but destroys mantegna but it graces him and it does not hurt holbein just because it does not grace himnever is for an instant a part of him it is with raphael as with some charming young girl who has a new and beautifully made dress brought to her which entirely becomes herso much that in a little while thinking of nothing else she becomes it and is only the decoration of her dress but with holbein it is as if you brought the same dress to a stout farmers daughter who was going to dine at the hall and begged her to put it on that she might not discredit the company she puts it on to please you looks entirely ridiculous in it but is not spoiled by itremains herself in spite of it  157 you probably have never noticed the extreme awkwardness of holbein in wearing this new dress you would the less do so because his own people think him all the finer for it as the farmers wife would probably think her daughter dr woltmann for instance is enthusiastic in praise of the splendid architecture in the background of his annunciation a fine mess it must have made in the minds of simple german maidens in their notion of the virgin at home i cannot show you this annunciation but i have under my hand one of holbeins bible cuts of the deepest seriousness and importhis illustration of the canticles showing the church as the bride of christ  illustration  you could not find a subject requiring more tenderness purity or dignity of treatment in this maid symbolizing the church you ask for the most passionate humility the most angelic beauty behold thou art fair my dove now here is holbeins ideal of that fairness here is his church as the bride  i am sorry to associate this figure in your minds even for a moment with the passages it is supposed to illustrate but the lesson is too important to be omitted remember holbein represents the temper of northern reformation he has all the nobleness of that temper but also all its baseness he represents indeed the revolt of german truth against italian lies but he represents also the revolt of german animalism against hebrew imagination this figure of holbeins is halfway from solomons mystic bride to rembrandts wife sitting on his knee while he drinks  but the key of the question is not in this florentine animalism has at this time also enough to say for itself but florentine animalism at this time feels the joy of a gentleman not of a churl and a florentine whatever he doesbe it virtuous or sinful chaste or lascivious severe or extravagantdoes it with a grace  158 you think perhaps that holbeins solomons bride is so ungraceful chiefly because she is overdressed and has too many feathers and jewels no a florentine would have put any quantity of feathers and jewels on her and yet never lost her grace you shall see him do it and that to a fantastic degree for i have an example under my hand look back first to bewicks venus lecture iii you cant accuse her of being overdressed she complies with every received modern principle of taste sir joshuas precept that drapery should be drapery and nothing more is observed more strictly even by bewick than by michael angelo if the absence of decoration could exalt the beauty of his venus here had been her perfection  now look back to plate ii lecture iv by sandro venus in her planet the ruling star of florence anything more grotesque in conception more unrestrained in fancy of ornament you cannot find even in the final days of the renaissance yet venus holds her divinity through all she will become majestic to you as you gaze and there is not a line of her chariot wheels of her buskins or of her throne which you may not see was engraved by a gentleman  illustration v  heat considered as a mode of motion  florentine natural philosophy  159 again plate v opposite is a facsimile of another engraving of the same seriesthe sun in leo it is even more extravagant in accessories than the venus you see the suns epaulets before you see the sun the spiral scrolls of his chariot and the black twisted rays of it might so far as types of form only are considered be a design for some modern courtdress star to be made in diamonds and yet all this wild ornamentation is if you will examine it more purely greek in spirit than the apollo belvedere  you know i have told you again and again that the soul of greece is her veracity that what to other nations were fables and symbolisms to her became living factsliving gods the fall of greece was instant when her gods again became fables the apollo belvedere is the work of a sculptor to whom apollonism is merely an elegant idea on which to exhibit his own skill he does not himself feel for an instant that the handsome man in the unintelligible attitudeam with drapery hung over his left arm as it would be hung to dry over a clothesline is the power of the sun but the florentine believes in apollo with his whole mind and is trying to explain his strength in every touch  for instance i said just now you see the suns epaulets before the sun well dont you usually as it rises do you not continually mistake a luminous cloud for it or wonder where it is behind one again the face of the apollo belvedere is agitated by anxiety passion and pride is the suns likely to be so rising on the evil and the good this prince sits crowned and calm look at the quiet fingers of the hand holding the scepterat the restraint of the reins merely by a depression of the wrist  160 you have to look carefully for those fingers holding the scepter because the handwhich a great anatomist would have made so exclusively interestingis here confused with the ornamentation of the arm of the chariot on which it rests but look what the ornamentation isfruit and leaves abundant in the mouth of a cornucopia a quite vulgar and meaningless ornament in ordinary renaissance work is it so here think you are not the leaves and fruits of earth in the suns handan  you thought perhaps when i spoke just now of the action of the right hand that less than a depression of the wrist would stop horses such as those you fancy botticelli drew them so because he had never seen a horse or because able to draw fingers he could not draw hoofs how fine it would be to have instead a prancing fourinhand in the style of piccadilly on the derbyday or at least horses like the real greek horses of the parthenon  yes and if they had had real ground to trot on the florentine would have shown you he knew how they should trot but these have to make their way up the hillside of other lands look to the example in your standard series hermes eriophoros you will find his motion among clouds represented precisely in this laboring failing halfkneeling attitude of limb these forms toiling up through the rippled sands of heaven arenot horsesthey are clouds themselves like horses but only a little like look how their hoofs lose themselves buried in the ripples of cloud it makes one think of the quicksands of morecambe bay  and their tailswhat extraordinary tufts of tails ending in points yes but do you not see nearly joining with them what is not a horse tail at all but a flame of fire kindled at apollos knee all the rest of the radiance about him shoots from him but this is rendered up to him as the fruits of the earth are in one of his hands its fire is in the other and all the warmth as well as all the light of it are his  we had a little natural philosophy gentlemen as well as theology in florence once upon a time  161 natural philosophy and also natural art for in this the greek reanimate was a nobler creature than the greek who had died his art had a wider force and warmer glow i have told you that the first greeks were distinguished from the barbarians by their simple humanity the second greeksthese florentine greeks reanimateare human more strongly more deeply leaping from the byzantine death at the call of christ loose him and let him go and there is upon them at once the joy of resurrection and the solemnity of the grave  illustration vi  fairness of the sea and air  in venice and athens  162 of this resurrection of the greek and the form of the tomb he had been buried in those four days i have to give you some account in the last lecture i will only today show you an illustration of it which brings us back to our immediate question as to the reasons why northern art could not accept classicism when in the closing lecture of aratra penteliciao i compared florentine with greek work it was to point out to you the eager passions of the first as opposed to the formal legalism and proprieties of the other greek work i told you while truthful was also restrained and never but under majesty of law while gothic work was true in the perfect law of liberty or franchise and now i give you in facsimile plate vi the two aphrodites thus comparedthe aphrodite thalassia of the tyrrhene seas and the aphrodite urania of the greek skies you may not at first like the tuscan best and why she is the best though both are noble again i must defer explaining to next lecture but now turn back to bewicks venus and compare her with the tuscan venus of the stars plate ii and then here in plate vi with the tuscan venus of the seas and the greek venus of the sky why is the english one vulgar what is it in the three others which makes them if not beautiful at least refinedevery one of them designed and drawn indisputably by a gentleman  i never have been so puzzled by any subject of analysis as for these ten years i have been by this every answer i give however plausible it seems at first fails in some way or in some cases but there is the point for you more definitely put i think than in any of my former booksat present for want of time i must leave it to your own thoughts  163 ii the second influence under which engraving developed itself i said was that of medicine and the physical sciences gentlemen the most audacious and the most valuable statement which i have yet made to you on the subject of practical art in these rooms is that of the evil resulting from the study of anatomy it is a statement so audacious that not only for some time i dared not make it to you but for ten years at least i dared not make it to myself i saw indeed that whoever studied anatomy was in a measure injured by it but i kept attributing the mischief to secondary causes it cant be this drink itself that poisons them i said always this drink is medicinal and strengthening i see that it kills them but it must be because they drink it cold when they have been hot or they take something else with it that changes it into poison the drink itself must be good well gentlemen i found out the drink itself to be poison at last by the breaking of my choicest venice glass i could not make out what it was that had killed tintoret and laid it long to the charge of chiaroscuro it was only after my thorough study of his paradise in 1870 that i gave up this idea finding the chiaroscuro which i had thought exaggerated was in all original and undarkened passages beautiful and most precious and then at last i got hold of the true clue il disegno di michel agnolo and the moment i had dared to accuse that it explained everything and i saw that the betraying demons of italian art led on by michael angelo had been not pleasure but knowledge not indolence but ambition and not love but horror  164 but when first i ventured to tell you this i did not know myself the fact of all most conclusive for its confirmation it will take me a little while to put it before you in its total force and i must first ask your attention to a minor point in one of the smaller rooms of the munich gallery is holbeins painting of st margaret and st elizabeth of hungarystandard of his early religious work here is a photograph from the st elizabeth and in the same frame a french lithograph of it i consider it one of the most important pieces of comparison i have arranged for you showing you at a glance the difference between true and false sentiment of that difference generally we cannot speak today but one special result of it you are to observethe omission in the french drawing of holbeins daring representation of disease which is one of the vital honors of the picture quite one of the chief strengths of st elizabeth in the roman catholic view was in the courage of her dealing with disease chiefly leprosy now observe i say roman catholic view very earnestly just now i am not at all sure that it is so in a catholic viewthat is to say in an eternally christian and divine view and this doubt very nearly now a certainty only came clearly into my mind the other day after many and many a years meditation on it i had read with great reverence all the beautiful stories about christs appearing as a leper and the like and had often pitied and rebuked myself alternately for my intense dislike and horror of disease i am writing at this moment within fifty yards of the grave of st francis and the story of the likeness of his feelings to mine had a little comforted me and the tradition of his conquest of them again humiliated me and i was thinking very gravely of this and of the parallel instance of bishop hugo of lincoln always desiring to do service to the dead as opposed to my own unmitigated and louisquinzelike horror of funeralswhen by chance in the cathedral of palermo a new light was thrown for me on the whole matter  165 i was drawing the tomb of frederick ii which is shut off by a grating from the body of the church and i had in general quite an unusual degree of quiet and comfort at my work but sometimes it was paralyzed by the unconscious interference of one of the men employed in some minor domestic services about the church when he had nothing to do he used to come and seat himself near my grating not to look at my work the poor wretch had no eyes to speak of nor in any way meaning to be troublesome but there was his habitual seat his nose had been carried off by the most loathsome of diseases there were two vivid circles of scarlet round his eyes and as he sat he announced his presence every quarter of a minute if otherwise i could have forgotten it by a peculiarly disgusting loud and long expectoration on the second or third day just i had forced myself into some forgetfulness of him and was hard at my work i was startled from it again by the bursting out of a loud and cheerful conversation close to me and on looking round saw a lively young fledgling of a priest seventeen or eighteen years old in the most eager and spirited chat with the man in the chair he talked laughed and spat himself companionably in the merriest way for a quarter of an hour evidently without feeling the slightest disgust or being made serious for an instant by the aspect of the destroyed creature before him  166 his own face was simply that of the ordinary vulgar type of thoughtless young italians rather beneath than above the usual standard and i was certain as i watched him that he was not at all my superior but very much my inferior in the coolness with which he beheld what was to me so dreadful i was positive that he could look this man in the face precisely because he could not look discerningly at any beautiful or noble thing and that the reason i dared not was because i had spiritually as much better eyes than the priest as bodily than his companion  having got so much of clear evidence given me on the matter it was driven home for me a week later as i landed on the quay of naples almost the first thing that presented itself to me was the sign of a traveling theatrical company displaying the principal scene of the drama to be enacted on their classical stage fresh from the theater of taormina i was curious to see the subject of the neapolitan popular drama it was the capture by the police of a man and his wife who lived by boiling children one section of the police was coming in armed to the teeth through the passage another section of the police armed to the teeth and with high feathers in its caps was coming up through a trapdoor in fine dramatic unconsciousness to the last moment like the clown in a pantomime the childboiler was represented as still industriously chopping up a child pieces of which ready for the pot lay here and there on the table in the middle of the picture the childboilers wife however just as she was taking the top off the pot to put the meat in had caught a glimpse of the foremost policeman and stopped as much in rage as in consternation  167 now it is precisely the same feeling or want of feeling in the lower italian nor always in the lower classes only which makes him demand the kind of subject for his secular drama and the crucifixion and pietà for his religious drama the only part of christianity he can enjoy is its horror and even the saint and saintess are not always denying themselves severely either by the contemplation of torture or the companionship with disease  nevertheless we must be cautious on the other hand to allow full value to the endurance by tender and delicate persons of what is really loathsome or distressful to them in the service of others and i think this picture of holbeins indicative of the exact balance and rightness of his own mind in this matter and therefore of his power to conceive a true saint also he had to represent st catherines chief efforthe paints her ministering to the sick and among them is a leper and finding it thus his duty to paint leprosy he courageously himself studies it from the life not to insist on its horror but to assert it to the needful point of fact which he does with medical accuracy  now here is just a case in which science in a subordinate degree is really required for a spiritual and moral purpose and you find holbein does not shrink from it even in this extreme case in which it is most painful  168 if therefore you do find him in other cases not using it you may be sure he knew it to be unnecessary  now it may be disputable whether in order to draw a living madonna one needs to know how many ribs she has but it would have seemed indisputable that in order to draw a skeleton one must know how many ribs it has  holbein is par excellence the draughtsman of skeletons his painted dance of death was and his engraved dance of death is principal of such things without any comparison or denial he draws skeleton after skeleton in every possible gesture but never so much as counts their ribs he neither knows nor cares how many ribs a skeleton has there are always enough to rattle  monstrous you think in impudenceholbein for his carelessness and i for defending him nay i triumph in him nothing has ever more pleased me than this grand negligence nobody wants to know how many ribs a skeleton has any more than how many bars a gridiron has so long as the one can breathe and the other broil and still less when the breath and the fire are both out  169 but is it only of the bones think you that holbein is carelessap nay incredible though it may seem to youbut to me explanatory at once of much of his excellencehe did not know anatomy at all i told you in my prefaceaq already quoted holbein studies the face first the body secondarily but i had no idea myself how completely he had refused the venomous science of his day i showed you a dead christ of his long ago can you match it with your academy drawings think you and yet he did not and would not know anatomy he would not but dürer would and didwent hotly into itwrote books upon it and upon proportions of the human body etc etc and all your modern recipes for painting flesh how did his studies prosper his art  people are always talking of his knight and death and his melancholia as if those were his principal works they are his characteristic ones and show what he might have been without his anatomy but they were mere byplay compared to his greater fortune and adam and eve look at these here is his full energy displayed here are both male and female forms drawn with perfect knowledge of their bones and muscles and modes of action and digestionand i hope you are pleased  but it is not anatomy only that master albert studies he has a taste for optics also and knows all about refraction and reflection what with his knowledge of the skull inside and the vitreous lens outside if any man in the world is to draw an eye heres the man to do it surely with a hand which can give lessons to john bellini and a care which would fain do all so that it cant be done better and acquaintance with every crack in the cranium and every humor in the lensif we cant draw an eye we should just like to know who can thinks albert  so having to engrave the portrait of melanchthon instead of looking at melanchthon as ignorant holbein would have been obliged to dowise albert looks at the room window and finds it has four crossbars in it and knows scientifically that the light on melanchthons eye must be a reflection of the window with its four barsand engraves it so accordingly and who shall dare to say now it isnt like melanchthon  unfortunately however it isnt nor like any other person in his senses but like a madman looking at somebody who disputes his hobby while in this drawing of holbeins where a dim gray shadow leaves a mere crumb of white paperaccidentally it seems for all the fine scientific reflectionbehold it is an eye indeed and of a noble creature  170 what is the reason do you ask me and is all the common teaching about generalization of details true then  no not a syllable of it is true holbein is right not because he draws more generally but more truly than dürer dürer draws what he knows is there but holbein only what he sees and as i have told you often before the really scientific artist is he who not only asserts bravely what he does see but confesses honestly what he does not you must not draw all the hairs in an eyelash not because it is sublime to generalize them but because it is impossible to see them how many hairs there are a sign painter or anatomist may count but how few of them you can see it is only the utmost masters carpaccio tintoret reynolds and velasquez who count or know  171 such was the effect then of his science upon dürers ideal of beauty and skill in portraiture what effect had it on the temper and quantity of his work as compared with poor ignorant holbeins you have only three portraits by dürer of the great men of his time and those bad ones while he toils his soul out to draw the hoofs of satyrs the bristles of swine and the distorted aspects of base women and vicious men  what on the contrary has ignorant holbein done for you shakespeare and he divide between them by word and look the story of england under henry and elizabeth  172 of the effect of science on the art of mantegna and marc antonio far more deadly than on dürers i must tell you in a future lecturethe effect of it on their minds i must partly refer to now in passing to the third head of my general statementthe influence of new theology for dürer and mantegna chiefly because of their science forfeited their place not only as painters of men but as servants of god neither of them has left one completely noble or completely didactic picture while holbein and botticelli in consummate pieces of art led the way before the eyes of all men to the purification of their church and land  173 iii but the need of reformation presented itself to these two men last named on entirely different terms  to holbein when the word of the catholic church proved false and its deeds bloody when he saw it selling permission of sin in his native augsburg and strewing the ashes of its enemies on the pure alpine waters of constance what refuge was there for him in more ancient religion shall he worship thor again and mourn over the death of balder he reads nature in her desolate and narrow truth and she teaches him the triumph of death  but for botticelli the grand gods are old are immortal the priests may have taught falsely the story of the virgindid they not also lie in the name of artemis at ephesusin the name of aphrodite at cyprusbut shall therefore chastity or love be dead or the full moon paler over arno saints of heaven and gods of earthshall these perish because vain men speak evil of them let us speak good forever and grave as on the rock for ages to come the glory of beauty and the triumph of faith  174 holbein had bitterer task  of old the one duty of the painter had been to exhibit the virtues of this life and hopes of the life to come holbein had to show the vices of this life and to obscure the hope of the future yes we walk through the valley of the shadow of death and fear all evil for thou art not with us and thy rod and thy staff comfort us not he does not choose this task it is thrust upon himjust as fatally as the burial of the dead is in a plaguestruck city these are the things he sees and must speak he will not become a better artist thereby no drawing of supreme beauty or beautiful things will be possible to him yet we cannot say he ought to have done anything else nor can we praise him specially in doing this it is his fate the fate of all the bravest in that day  illustration the childs bedtime  fig 5 facsimile from holbeins woodcut  175 for instance there is no scene about which a shallow and feeble painter would have been more sure to adopt the commonplaces of the creed of his time than the death of a childchiefly and most of all the death of a country childa little thing fresh from the cottage and the field surely for such an one angels will wait by its sick bed and rejoice as they bear its soul away and over its shroud flowers will be strewn and the birds will sing by its grave so your common sentimentalist would think and paint holbein sees the facts as they verily are up to the point when vision ceases he speaks then no more  the country laborers cottagethe

old creed any subject more definitely and constantly insisted on than the death of a miser he had been happy the old preachers thought till then but his hour has come and the black covetousness of hell is awake and watching the sharp harpy claws will clutch his soul out of his mouth and scatter his treasure for others so the commonplace preacher and painter taught not so holbein the devil want to snatch his soul indeed nay he never had a soul but of the devils giving his misery to begin on his deathbed nay he had never an unmiserable hour of life the fiend is with him nowa paltry abortive fiend with no breath even to blow hot with he supplies the hellblast with a machine it is winter and the rich man has his furred cloak and cap thick and heavy the beggar bareheaded to beseech him skin and rags hanging about him together touches his shoulder but all in vain there is other business in hand more haggard than the beggar himself wasted and palsied the rich man counts with his fingers the gain of the years to come  but of those years infinite that are to be holbein says nothing i know not i see not this only i see on this very winters day the low pale stumblingblock at your feet the altogether by you unseen and forgotten death you shall not pass him by on the other side here is a fasting figure in skin and bone at last that will stop you and for all the hidden treasures of earth here is your spade dig now and find them  177 i have said that holbein was condemned to teach these things he was not happy in teaching them nor thanked for teaching them nor was botticelli for his lovelier teaching but they both could do no otherwise they lived in truth and steadfastness and with both in their marvelous design veracity is the beginning of invention and love its end  i have but time to show you in conclusion how this affectionate selfforgetfulness protects holbein from the chief calamity of the german temper vanity which is at the root of all dürers weakness here is a photograph of holbeins portrait of erasmus and a fine proof of dürers in holbeins the face leads everything and the most lovely qualities of the face lead in that the cloak and cap are perfectly painted just because you look at them neither more nor less than you would have looked at the cloak in reality you dont say how brilliantly they are touched as you would with rembrandt nor how gracefully they are neglected as you would with gainsborough nor how exquisitely they are shaded as you would with lionardo nor how grandly they are composed as you would with titian you say only erasmus is surely there and what a pleasant sight you dont think of holbein at all he has not even put in the minutest letter h that i can see to remind you of him drops his hs i regret to say often enough my hand should be enough for you what matters my name but now look at dürers the very first thing you see and at any distance is this great square tablet with      the image of erasmus drawn from the life by albert dürer         1526  and a great straddling ad besides then you see a cloak and a table and a pot with flowers in it and a heap of books with all their leaves and all their clasps and all the little bits of leather gummed in to mark the places and last of all you see erasmuss face and when you do see it the most of it is wrinkles  all egotism and insanity this gentlemen hard words to use but not too hard to define the faults which rendered so much of dürers great genius abortive and to this day paralyze among the details of a lifeless and ambitious precision the student no less than the artist of german blood for too many an erasmus too many a dürer among them the world is all cloak and clasp instead of face or book and the first object of their lives is to engrave their initials  178 for us in england not even so much is at present to be hoped and yet singularly enough it is more our modesty unwisely submissive than our vanity which has destroyed our english school of engraving  at the bottom of the pretty line engravings which used to represent characteristically our english skill one saw always two inscriptions at the lefthand corner drawn bysoandso at the righthand corner engraved bysoandso only under the worst and cheapest platesfor the stationers almanack or the likeone saw sometimes drawn and engraved bysoandso which meant nothing more than that the publisher would not go to the expense of an artist and that the engraver haggled through as he could one fortunate exception gentlemen you have in the old drawings for your oxford almanack though the publishers i have no doubt even in that case employed the cheapest artist they could findar but in general no engraver thought himself able to draw and no artist thought it his business to engrave  179 but the fact that this and the following lecture are on the subject of design in engraving implies of course that in the work we have to examine it was often the engraver himself who designed and as often the artist who engraved  and you will observe that the only engravings which bear imperishable value are indeed in this kind it is true that in woodcutting both dürer and holbein as in our own days leech and tenniel have workmen under them who can do all they want but in metal cutting it is not so for as i have told you in metal cutting ultimate perfection of line has to be reached and it can be reached by none but a masters hand nor by his unless in the very moment and act of designing never unless under the vivid first force of imagination and intellect can the line have its full value and for this high reason gentlemen that paradox which perhaps seemed to you so daring is nevertheless deeply and finally true that while a woodcut may be laboriously finished a grand engraving on metal must be comparatively incomplete for it must be done throughout with the full fire of temper in it visibly governing its lines as the wind does the fibers of cloud  180 the value hitherto attached to rembrandts etchings and others imitating them depends on a true instinct in the public mind for this virtue of line but etching is an indolent and blundering method at the best and i do not doubt that you will one day be grateful for the severe disciplines of drawing required in these schools in that they will have enabled you to know what a line may be driven by a masters chisel on silver or marble following and fostering as it follows the instantaneous strength of his determined thought  footnotes  ag if you paint a bottle only to amuse the spectator by showing him how like a painting may be to a bottle you cannot be considered in artphilosophy as a designer but if you paint the cork flying out of the bottle and the contents arriving in an arch at the mouth of a recipient glass you are so far forth a designer or signer probably meaning to express certain ultimate facts respecting say the hospitable disposition of the landlord of the house but at all events representing the bottle and glass in a designed and not merely natural manner not merely naturalnay in some sense nonnatural or supernatural and all great artists show both this fantastic condition of mind in their work and show that it has arisen out of a communicative or didactic purpose they are the signpainters of god  i have added this note to the lecture in copying my

florentine schools of engraving   181 in the first of these lectures i stated to you their subject as the investigation of the engraved work of a group of men to whom engraving as a means of popular address was above all precious because their art was distinctively didactic  some of my hearers must be aware that of late years the assertion that art should be didactic has been clamorously and violently derided by the countless crowd of artists who have nothing to represent and of writers who have nothing to say and that the contrary assertionthat art consists only in pretty colors and fine wordsis accepted readily enough by a public which rarely pauses to look at a picture with attention or read a sentence with understanding  182 gentlemen believe me there never was any great advancing art yet nor can be without didactic purpose the leaders of the strong schools are and must be always either teachers of theology or preachers of the moral law i need not tell you that it was as teachers of theology on the walls of the vatican that the masters with whose names you are most familiar obtained their perpetual fame but however great their fame you have not practically i imagine ever been materially assisted in your preparation for the schools either of philosophy or divinity by raphaels school of athens by raphaels theologyor by michael angelos judgment my task today is to set before you some part of the design of the first master of the works in the sistine chapel and i believe that from his teaching you will even in the hour which i ask you now to give learn what may be of true use to you in all your future labor whether in oxford or elsewhere  183 you have doubtless in the course of these lectures been occasionally surprised by my speaking of holbein and sandro botticelli as reformers in the same tone of respect and with the same implied assertion of their intellectual power and agency with which it is usual to speak of luther and savonarola you have been accustomed indeed to hear painting and sculpture spoken of as supporting or enforcing church doctrine but never as reforming or chastising it whether protestant or roman catholic you have admitted what in the one case you held to be the abuse of painting in the furtherance of idolatryin the other its amiable and exalting ministry to the feebleness of faith but neither has recognizedthe protestant his allyor the catholic his enemy in the far more earnest work of the great painters of the fifteenth century the protestant was in most cases too vulgar to understand the aid offered to him by painting and in all cases too terrified to believe in it he drove the giftbringing greek with imprecations from his sectarian fortress or received him within it only on the condition that he should speak no word of religion there  184 on the other hand the catholic in most cases too indolent to read and in all too proud to dread the rebuke of the reforming painters confused them with the crowd of his old flatterers and little noticed their altered language or their graver brow in a little while finding they had ceased to be amusing he effaced their works not as dangerous but as dull and recognized only thenceforward as art the innocuous bombast of michael angelo and fluent efflorescence of bernini but when you become more intimately and impartially acquainted with the history of the reformation you will find that as surely and earnestly as memling and giotto strove in the north and south to set forth and exalt the catholic faith so surely and earnestly did holbein and botticelli strive in the north to chastise and in the south to revive it in what manner i will try today briefly to show you  185 i name these two men as the reforming leaders there were many rank and file who worked in alliance with holbein with botticelli two great ones lippi and perugino but both of these had so much pleasure in their own pictorial faculty that they strove to keep quiet and out of harms wayinvoluntarily manifesting themselves sometimes however and not in the wisest manner lippis running away with a novice was not likely to be understood as a step in church reformation correspondent to luthers marriageas nor have protestant divines even to this day recognized the real meaning of the reports of peruginos infidelity botticelli the pupil of the one and the companion of the other held the truths they taught him through sorrow as well as joy and he is the greatest of the reformers because he preached without blame though the least known because he died without victory  i had hoped to be able to lay before you some better biography of him than the traditions of vasari of which i gave a short abstract some time back in fors clavigera letter xxii but as yet i have only added internal evidence to the popular story the more important points of which i must review briefly it will not waste your time if i readinstead of merely giving you reference tothe passages on which i must comment  186 his father mariano filipepi a florentine citizen brought him up with care and caused him to be instructed in all such things as are usually taught to children before they choose a calling but although the boy readily acquired whatever he wished to learn yet was he constantly discontented neither would he take any pleasure in reading writing or accounts insomuch that the father disturbed by the eccentric habits of his son turned him over in despair to a gossip of his called botticello who was a goldsmith and considered a very competent master of his art to the intent that the boy might learn the same  he took no pleasure in reading writing nor accounts you will find the same thing recorded of cimabue but it is more curious when stated of a man whom i cite to you as typically a gentleman and a scholar but remember in those days though there were not so many entirely correct books issued by the religious tract society for boys to read there were a great many more pretty things in the world for boys to see the val darno was paternoster row to purpose their fathers row with books of his writing on the mountain shelves and the lad takes to looking at things and thinking about them instead of reading about themwhich i commend to you also as much the more scholarly practice of the two to the end though he knows all about the celestial hierarchies he is not strong in his letters nor in his dialect i asked mr tyrwhitt to help me through with a bit of his italian the other day mr tyrwhitt could only help me by suggesting that it was botticelli for soandso and one of the minor reasons which induced me so boldly to attribute these sibyls to him instead of bandini is that the lettering is so ill done the engraver would assuredly have had his lettering all rightor at least neat botticelli blunders through it scratches impatiently out when he goes wrong and as i told you theres no repentance in the engravers trade leaves all the blunders visible  187 i may add one fact bearing on this question lately communicated to meat in the autumn of 1872 i possessed myself of an italian book of pen drawings some i have no doubt by mantegna in his youth others by sandro himself in examining these i was continually struck by the comparatively feeble and blundering way in which the titles were written while all the rest of the handling was really superb and still more surprised when on the sleeves and hem of the robe of one of the principal figures of women helena rapita da paris i found what seemed to be meant for inscriptions intricately embroidered which nevertheless though beautifully drawn i could not read in copying botticellis zipporah this spring i found the border of her robe wrought with characters of the same kind which a young painter working with me who already knows the minor secrets of italian art better than iau assures me are lettersand letters of a language hitherto undeciphered  188 there was at that time a close connection and almost constant intercourse between the goldsmiths and the painters wherefore sandro who possessed considerable ingenuity and was strongly disposed to the arts of design became enamored of painting and resolved to devote himself entirely to that vocation he acknowledged his purpose at once to his father and the latter who knew the force of his inclination took him accordingly to the carmelite monk fra filippo who was a most excellent painter of that time with whom he placed him to study the art as sandro himself had desired devoting himself thereupon entirely to the vocation he had chosen sandro so closely followed the directions and imitated the manner of his master that fra filippo conceived a great love for him and instructed him so effectually that sandro rapidly attained to such a degree in art as none would have predicted for him  i have before pointed out to you the importance of training by the goldsmith sandro got more good of it however than any of the other painters so educatedbeing enabled by it to use gold for light to color in a glowing harmony never reached with equal perfection and rarely attempted in the later schools to the last his paintings are partly treated as work in niello and he names himself in perpetual gratitude from this first artisan master nevertheless the fortunate fellow finds at the right moment another even more to his mind and is obedient to him through his youth as to the other through his childhood and this master loves him and instructs him so effectuallyin grinding colors do you suppose only or in laying of lines only or in anything more than these  189 i will tell you what lippi must have taught any boy whom he loved first humility and to live in joy and peace injuring no manif such innocence might be nothing is so manifest in every face by him as its gentleness and rest secondly to finish his work perfectly and in such temper that the angels might say of itnot he himselfiste perfecit opus do you remember what i told you in the eagles nest § 53 that true humility was in hoping that angels might sometimes admire our work not in hoping that we should ever be able to admire theirs thirdlya little thing it seems but was a great onelove of flowers no one draws such lilies or such daisies as lippi botticelli beat him afterwards in roses but never in lilies fourthly due honor for classical tradition lippi is the only religious painter who dresses john baptist in the camelskin as the greeks dressed heracles in the lionsover the head lastly and chiefly of allle père hyacinthe taught his pupil certain views about the doctrine of the church which the boy thought of more deeply than his tutor and that by a great deal and master sandro presently got himself into such question for painting heresy that if he had been as hotheaded as he was truehearted he would soon have come to bad end by the tarbarrel but he is so sweet and so modest that nobody is frightened so clever that everybody is pleased and at last actually the pope sends for him to paint his own private chapelwhere the first thing my young gentleman does mind you is to paint the devil in a monks dress tempting christ the sauciest thing out and out done in the history of the reformation it seems to me yet so wisely done and with such true respect otherwise shown for what was sacred in the church that the pope didnt mind and all went on as merrily as marriage bells  190 i have anticipated however in telling you this the proper course of his biography to which i now return  while still a youth he painted the figure of fortitude among those pictures of the virtues which antonio and pietro pollaiuolo were executing in the mercatanzia or tribunal of commerce in florence in santo spirito a church of the same city he painted a picture for the chapel of the bardi family this work he executed with great diligence and finished it very successfully depicting certain olive and palm trees therein with extraordinary care  it is by a beautiful chance that the first work of his specified by his italian biographer should be the fortitudeav note also what is said of his tree drawing  having in consequence of this work obtained much credit and reputation sandro was appointed by the guild of porta santa maria to paint a picture in san marco the subject of which is the coronation of our lady who is surrounded by a choir of angelsthe whole extremely well designed and finished by the artist with infinite care he executed various works in the medici palace for the elder lorenzo more particularly a figure of pallas on a shield wreathed with vine branches whence flames are proceeding this he painted of the size of life a san sebastiano was also among the most remarkable of the works executed for lorenzo in the church of santa maria maggiore in florence is a pietà with small figures by this master this is a very beautiful work for different houses in various parts of the city sandro painted many pictures of a round form with numerous figures of women undraped of these there are still two examples at castello a villa of the duke cosimoone representing the birth of venus who is borne to earth by the loves and zephyrs the second also presenting the figure of venus crowned with flowers by the graces she is here intended to denote the spring and the allegory is expressed by the painter with extraordinary grace  our young reformer enters it seems on a very miscellaneous course of study the coronation of our lady st sebastian pallas in vineleaves and venuswithout figleaves not wholly calvinistic fra filippos teaching seems to have been all the better for the boybeing such a boy as he was but i cannot in this lecture enter farther into my reasons for saying so  191 vasari however has shot far ahead in telling us of this picture of the spring which is one of botticellis completest works long before he was able to paint greek nymphs he had done his best in idealism of greater spirits and while yet quite a youth painted at castello the assumption of our lady with the patriarchs the prophets the apostles the evangelists the martyrs the confessors the doctors the virgins and the hierarchies  imagine this subject proposed to a young or even old british artist for his next appeal to public sensation at the academy but do you suppose that the young british artist is wiser and more civilized than lippis scholar because his only idea of a patriarch is of a man with a long beard of a doctor the md with the brass plate over the way and of a virgin miss  of the  theater  not that even sandro was able according to vasaris report to conduct the entire design himself the proposer of the subject assisted him and they made some modifications in the theology which brought them both into troubleso early did sandros innovating work begin into which subjects our gossiping friend waives unnecessary inquiry as follows  but although this picture is exceedingly beautiful and ought to have put envy to shame yet there were found certain malevolent and censorious persons who not being able to affix any other blame to the work declared that matteo and sandro had erred gravely in that matter and had fallen into grievous heresy  now whether this be true or not let none expect the judgment of that question from me it shall suffice me to note that the figures executed by sandro in that work are entirely worthy of praise and that the pains he took in depicting those circles of the heavens must have been very great to say nothing of the angels mingled with the other figures or of the various foreshortenings all which are designed in a very good manner  about this time sandro received a commission to paint a small picture with figures three parts of a braccio highthe subject an adoration of the magi  it is indeed a most admirable work the composition the design and the coloring are so beautiful that every artist who examines it is astonished and at the time it obtained so great a name in florence and other places for the master that pope sixtus iv having erected the chapel built by him in his palace at rome and desiring to have it adorned with paintings commanded that sandro botticelli should be appointed superintendent of the work  192 vasaris words about this time are evidently wrong it must have been many and many a day after he painted matteos picture that he took such high standing in florence as to receive the mastership of the works in the popes chapel at rome of his position and doings there i will tell you presently meantime let us complete the story of his life  by these works botticelli obtained great honor and reputation among the many competitors who were laboring with him whether florentines or natives of other cities and received from the pope a considerable sum of money but this he consumed and squandered totally during his residence in rome where he lived without due care as was his habit  193 well but one would have liked to hear how he squandered his money and whether he was without careof other things than money  it is just possible master vasari that botticelli may have laid out his money at higher interest than you know of meantime he is advancing in life and thought and becoming less and less comprehensible to his biographer and at length having got rid somehow of the money he received from the pope and finished the work he had to do and uncovered itfree in conscience and empty in purse he returned to florence where being a sophistical person he made a comment on a part of dante and drew the inferno and put it in engraving in which he consumed much time and not working for this reason brought infinite disorder into his affairs  194 unpaid work this engraving of dante you perceiveconsuming much time also and not appearing to vasari to be work at all it is but a short sentence gentlementhis in the old edition of vasari and obscurely wordeda very foolish persons contemptuous report of a thing to him totally incomprehensible but the thing itself is outandout the most important fact in the history of the religious art of italy i can show you its significance in not many more words than have served to record it  botticelli had been painting in rome and had expressly chosen to represent therebeing master of works in the presence of the defender of the faiththe foundation of the mosaic law to his mind the eternal law of godthat law of which modern evangelicals sing perpetually their own original psalm oh how hate i thy law it is my abomination all the day returning to florence he reads dantes vision of the hell created by its violation he knows that the pictures he has painted in rome cannot be understood by the people they are exclusively for the best trained scholars in the church dante on the other hand can only be read in manuscript but the people could and would understand his lessons if they were pictured in accessible and enduring form he throws all his own lauded work asideall for which he is most honored and in which his now matured and magnificent skill is as easy to him as singing to a perfect musician and he sets himself to a servile and despised laborhis friends mocking him his resources failing him infinite disorder getting into his affairsof this world  195 never such another thing happened in italy any more botticelli engraved her pilgrims progress for her putting himself in prison to do it she would not read it when done raphael and marc antonio were the theologians for her money pretty madonnas and satyrs with abundance of taillet our pilgrims progress be in these directions if you please  botticellis own pilgrimage however was now to be accomplished triumphantly with such crowning blessings as heaven might grant to him in spite of his friends and his disordered affairs he went his own obstinate way and found another mans words worth engraving as well as dantes not without perpetuating also what he deemed worthy of his own  196 what would that be think you his chosen works before the pope in romehis admired madonnas in florencehis choirs of angels and thickets of flowers some few of these yes as you shall presently see but the best attempt of this kind from his hand is the triumph of faith by fra girolamo savonarola of ferrara of whose sect our artist was so zealous a partisan that he totally abandoned painting and not having any other means of living he fell into very great difficulties but his attachment to the party he had adopted increased he became what was then called a piagnone or mourner and abandoned all labor insomuch that finding himself at length become old being also very poor he must have died of hunger had he not been supported by lorenzo de medici for whom he had worked at the small hospital of volterra and other places who assisted him while he lived as did other friends and admirers of his talents  197 in such dignity and independencehaving employed his talents not wholly at the orders of the dealerdied a poor bedesman of lorenzo de medici the president of that high academy of art in rome whose academicians were perugino ghirlandajo angelico and signorelli and whose students michael angelo and raphael  a worthless illconducted fellow on the whole thinks vasari with a crazy fancy for scratching on copper  well here are some of the scratches for you to see only first i must ask you seriously for a few moments to consider what the two powers were which with this iron pen of his he has set himself to reprove  198 two great forms of authority reigned over the entire civilized world confessedly and by name in the middle ages they reign over it still and must forever though at present very far from confessed and in most places ragingly denied  the first power is that of the teacher or true father the father in god it may behappy the children to whom it isthe actual father also and whose parents have been their tutors but for the most part it will be some one else who teaches them and molds their minds and brain all such teaching when true being from above and coming down from the father of lights with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning is properly that of the holy catholic greek ekklêsia council church or papacy of many fathers in god not of one eternally powerful and divine reverenced of all humble and lowly scholars in jewry in greece in rome in gaul in england and beyond sea from arctic zone to zone  the second authority is the power of national law enforcing justice in conduct by due reward and punishment power vested necessarily in magistrates capable of administering it with mercy and equity whose authority be it of many or few is again divine as proceeding from the king of kings and was acknowledged throughout civilized christendom as the power of the holy empire or holy roman empire because first throned in rome but it is forever also acknowledged namelessly or by name by all loyal obedient just and humble hearts which truly desire that whether for them or against them the eternal equities and dooms of heaven should be pronounced and executed and as the wisdom or word of their father should be taught so the will of their father should be done on earth as it is in heaven  199 you all here know what contention first and then what corruption and dishonor had paralyzed these two powers before the days of which we now speak reproof and either reform or rebellion became necessary everywhere the northern reformers holbein and luther and henry and cromwell set themselves to their task rudely and it might seem carried it through the southern reformers dante and savonarola and botticelli set hand to their task reverently and it seemed did not by any means carry it through but the end is not yet  200 now i shall endeavor today to set before you the art of botticelli especially as exhibiting the modesty of great imagination trained in reverence which characterized the southern reformers and as opposed to the immodesty of narrow imagination trained in selftrust which characterized the northern reformers  the modesty of great imagination that is to say of the power which conceives all things in true relation and not only as they affect ourselves i can show you this most definitely by taking one example of the modern and unschooled temper in bewickaw and setting it beside botticellis treatment of the same subject of thoughtnamely the meaning of war and the reforms necessary in the carrying on of war  201 both the men are entirely at one in their purpose they yearn for peace and justice to rule over the earth instead of the sword but see how differently they will say what is in their hearts to the people they address to bewick war was more an absurdity than it was a horror he had not seen battlefields still less had he read of them in ancient days he cared nothing about heroesgreek roman or norman what he knew and saw clearly was that farmer hodges boy went out of the village one holiday afternoon a fine young fellow rather drunk with a colored ribbon in his hat and came back ten years afterwards with one leg one eye an old red coat and a tobaccopipe in the pocket of it that is what he has got to say mainly so for the pathetic side of the business he draws you two old soldiers meeting as bricklayers laborers and for the absurd side of it he draws a stone sloping sideways with age in a bare field on which you can just read out of a long inscription the words glorious victory but no one is there to read themonly a jackass who uses the stone to scratch himself against  202 now compare with this botticellis reproof of war he had seen it and often and between noble personsknew the temper in which the noblest knights went out to itknew the strength the patience the glory and the grief of it he would fain see his florence in peace and yet he knows that the wisest of her citizens are her bravest soldiers so he seeks for the ideal of a soldier and for the greatest glory of war that in the presence of these he may speak reverently what he must speak he does not go to greece for his hero he is not sure that even her patriotic wars were always right but by his religious faith he cannot doubt the nobleness of the soldier who put the children of israel in possession of their promised land and to whom the sign of the consent of heaven was given by its pausing light in the valley of ajalon must then setting sun and risen moon stay he thinks only to look upon slaughter may no soldier of christ bid them stay otherwise than so he draws joshua but quitting his hold of the sword its hilt rests on his bent knee and he kneels before the sun not commands it and this is his prayer  oh king of kings and lord of lords who alone rulest always in eternity and who correctest all our wanderingsgiver of melody to the choir of the angels listen thou a little to our bitter grief and come and rule us oh thou highest king with thy love which is so sweet  is not that a little better and a little wiser than bewicks jackass is it not also better and wiser than the sneer of modern science what great men are wewe forsooth can make almanacs and know that the earth turns round joshua indeed let us have no more talk of the oldclothesman  all bewicks simplicity is in that but none of bewicks understanding  203 i pass to the attack made by botticelli upon the guilt of wealth so i had at first written but i should rather have written the appeal made by him against the cruelty of wealth then first attaining the power it has maintained to this day  the practice of receiving interest had been confined until this fifteenth century with contempt and malediction to the profession so styled of usurers or to the jews the merchants of augsburg introduced it as a convenient and pleasant practice among christians also and insisted that it was decorous and proper even among respectable merchants in the view of the christian church of their day they might more reasonably have set themselves to defend adulteryax however they appointed dr john eck of ingoldstadt to hold debates in all possible universities at their expense on the allowing of interest and as these augsburgers had in venice their special mart fondaco called of the germans their new notions came into direct collision with old venetian ones and were much hindered by them and all the more because in opposition to dr john eck there was preaching on the other side of the alps the franciscans poor themselves preached mercy to the poor one of them brother marco of san gallo planned the mount of pity for their defense and the merchants of venice set up the first in the world against the german fondaco the dispute burned far on towards our own times you perhaps have heard before of one antonio a merchant of venice who persistently retained the then obsolete practice of lending money gratis and of the peril it brought him into with the usurers but you perhaps did not before know why it was the flesh or heart of flesh in him that they so hated  204 against this newly risen demon of authorized usury holbein and botticelli went out to war together holbein as we have partly seen in his designs for the dance of death struck with all his soldiers strengthay botticelli uses neither satire nor reproach he turns altogether away from the criminals appeals only to heaven for defense against them he engraves the design which of all his work must have cost him hardest toil in its executionthe virgin praying to her son in heaven for pity upon the poor for these are also my childrenaz underneath are the seven works of mercy and in the midst of them the building of the mount of pity in the distance lies italy mapped in cape and bay with the cities which had founded mounts of pityvenice in the distance chief little seen but engraved with the masters loveliest care in the background there is a group of two small figuresthe franciscan brother kneeling and an angel of victory crowning him  205 i call it an angel of victory observe with assurance although there is no legend claiming victory or distinguishing this angel from any other of those which adorn with crowns of flowers the nameless crowds of the blessed for botticelli has other ways of speaking than by written legends i know by a glance at this angel that he has taken the action of it from a greek coin and i know also that he had not in his own exuberant fancy the least need to copy the action of any figure whatever so i understand as well as if he spoke to me that he expects me if i am an educated gentleman to recognize this particular action as a greek angels and to know that it is a temporal victory which it crowns  206 and now farther observe that this classical learning of botticellis received by him as i told you as a native element of his being gives not only greater dignity and gentleness but far wider range to his thoughts of reformation as he asks for pity from the cruel jew to the poor gentile so he asks for pity from the proud christian to the untaught gentile nay for more than pity for fellowship and acknowledgment of equality before god the learned men of his age in general brought back the greek mythology as antichristian but botticelli and perugino as prechristian nor only as prechristian but as the foundation of christianity but chiefly botticelli with perfect grasp of the mosaic and classic theology thought over and seized the harmonies of both and he it was who gave the conception of that great choir of the prophets and sibyls of which michael angelo more or less ignorantly borrowing it in the sistine chapel in great part lost the meaning while he magnified the aspect  207 for indeed all christian and heathen mythology had alike become to michael angelo only a vehicle for the display of his own powers of drawing limbs and trunks and having resolved and made the world of his day believe that all the glory of design lay in variety of difficult attitude he flings the naked bodies about his ceiling with an upholsterers ingenuity of appliance to the corners they could fit but with total absence of any legible meaning nor do i suppose that one person in a million even of those who have some acquaintance with the earlier masters takes patience in the sistine chapel to conceive the original design but botticellis mastership of the works evidently was given to him as a theologian even more than as a painter and the moment when he came to rome to receive it you may hold for the crisis of the reformation in italy the main effort to save her priesthood was about to be made by her wisest reformerface to face with the head of her churchnot in contest with him but in the humblest subjection to him and in adornment of his own chapel for his own delight and more than delight if it might be  208 sandro brings to work not under him but with him the three other strongest and worthiest men he knows perugino ghirlandajo and luca signorelli there is evidently entire fellowship in thought between botticelli and perugino they two together plan the whole and botticelli though the master yields to perugino the principal place the end of the chapter on which is to be the assumption of the virgin it was peruginos favorite subject done with his central strength assuredly the crowning work of his life and of lovely christian art in europe  michael angelo painted it out and drew devils and dead bodies all over the wall instead but there remains to us happily the series of subjects designed by botticelli to lead up to this lost one  209 he came i said not to attack but to restore the papal authority to show the power of inherited honor and universal claim of divine law in the jewish and christian churchthe law delivered first by moses then in final grace and truth by christ  he designed twelve great pictures each containing some twenty figures the size of life and groups of smaller ones scarcely to be counted twelve picturessix to illustrate the giving of the law by moses and six the ratification and completion of it by christ event by event the jurisprudence of each dispensation is traced from dawn to close in this correspondence         1 covenant of circumcision        2 entrance on his ministry by moses        3 moses by the red sea        4 delivery of law on sinai        5 destruction of korah        6 death of moses        7 covenant of baptism        8 entrance on his ministry by christ        9 peter and andrew by the sea of galilee       10 sermon on mount       11 giving keys to st peter       12 last supper  of these pictures sandro painted three himself perugino three and the assumption ghirlandajo one signorelli one and rosselli fourba i believe that sandro intended to take the roof also and had sketched out the main succession of its design and that the prophets and sibyls which he meant to paint he drew first small and engraved his drawings afterwards that some part of the work might be at all events thus communicable to the world outside of the vatican  210 it is not often that i tell you my beliefs but i am forced here for there are no dates to found more on is it not wonderful that among all the infinite mass of fools thoughts about the majestic works of michael angelo in the sistine chapel no slightly more rational person has ever asked what the chapel was first meant to be like and how it was to be roofed  nor can i assume myself still less you that all these prophets and sibyls are botticellis of many there are two engravings with variations some are inferior in parts many altogether he signed none never put grand tablets with s b into his skies had other letters than those to engrave and no time to spare i have chosen out of the series three of the sibyls which have i think clear internal evidence of being his and these you shall compare with michael angelos but first i must put you in mind what the sibyls were  211 as the prophets represent the voice of god in man the sibyls represent the voice of god in nature they are properly all forms of one sibyl greek dios boulê the counsel of god and the chief one at least in the roman mind was the sibyl of cumae from the traditions of her the romans and we through them received whatever lessons the myth or fact of sibyl power has given to mortals  how much have you received or may you yet receive think you of that teaching i call it the myth or fact but remember that as a myth it is a fact this story has concentrated whatever good there is in the imagination or visionary powers in women inspired by nature only the traditions of witch and gypsy are partly its offshoots you despise both perhaps but can you though in utmost pride of your supreme modern wisdom suppose that the charactersay even of so poor and farfallen a sibyl as meg merriliesis only the coinage of scotts brain or that even being no more it is valueless admit the figure of the cumaean sibyl in like manner to be the coinage only of virgils brain as such it and the words it speaks are yet facts in which we may find use if we are reverent to them  to me personally i must take your indulgence for a moment to speak wholly of myself they have been of the truest servicequite material and indisputable  i am writing on st johns day in the monastery of assisi and i had no idea whatever when i sat down to my work this morning of saying any word of what i am now going to tell you i meant only to expand and explain a little what i said in my lecture about the florentine engraving but it seems to me now that i had better tell you what the cumaean sibyl has actually done for me  212 in 1871 partly in consequence of chagrin at the revolution in paris and partly in great personal sorrow i was struck by acute inflammatory illness at matlock and reduced to a state of extreme weakness lying at one time unconscious for some hours those about me having no hope of my life i have no doubt that the immediate cause of the illness was simply eating when i was not hungry so that modern science would acknowledge nothing in the whole business but an extreme and very dangerous form of indigestion and entirely deny any interference of the cumaean sibyl in the matter  i once heard a sermon by dr guthrie in edinburgh upon the wickedness of fasting it was very eloquent and ingenious and finely explained the superiority of the scotch free church to the benighted catholic church in that the free church saw no merit in fasting and there was no mention from beginning to end of the sermon of even the existence of such texts as daniel i 12 or matthew vi 16  without the smallest merit i admit in fasting i was nevertheless reduced at matlock to a state very near starvation and could not rise from my pillow without being lifted for some days and in the first clearly pronounced stage of recovery when the perfect powers of spirit had returned while the body was still as weak as it well could be i had three dreams which made a great impression on me for in ordinary health my dreams are supremely ridiculous if not unpleasant and in ordinary conditions of illness very ugly and always without the slightest meaning but these dreams were all distinct and impressive and had much meaning if i chose to take it  213 the firstbb was of a venetian fisherman who wanted me to follow him down into some water which i thought was too deep but he called me on saying he had something to show me so i followed him and presently through an opening as if in the arsenal wall he showed me the bronze horses of st marks and said see the horses are putting on their harness  the second was of a preparation at rome in st peters or a vast hall as large as st peters for the exhibition of a religious drama part of the play was to be a scene in which demons were to appear in the sky and the stage servants were arranging gray fictitious clouds and painted fiends for it under the direction of the priests there was a woman dressed in black standing at the corner of the stage watching them having a likeness in her face to one of my own dead friends and i knew somehow that she was not that friend but a spirit and she made me understand without speaking that i was to watch for the play would turn out other than the priests expected and i waited and when the scene came on the clouds became real clouds and the fiends real fiends agitating them in slow quivering wild and terrible over the heads of the people and priests i recollected distinctly however when i woke only the figure of the black woman mocking the people and of one priest in an agony of terror with the sweat pouring from his brow but violently scolding one of the stage servants for having failed in some ceremony the omission of which he thought had given the devils their power  the third dream was the most interesting and personal some one came to me to ask me to help in the deliverance of a company of italian prisoners who were to be ransomed for money i said i had no money they answered yes i had some that belonged to me as a brother of st francis if i would give it up i said i did not know even that i was a brother of st francis but i thought to myself that perhaps the franciscans of fésole whom i had helped to make hay in their field in 1845 had adopted me for one only i didnt see how the consequence of that would be my having any money however i said they were welcome to whatever i had and then i heard the voice of an italian woman singing and i have never heard such divine singing before nor sincethe sounds absolutely strong and real and the melody altogether lovely if i could have written it but i could not even remember it when i wokeonly how beautiful it was  214 now these three dreams have every one of them been of much use to me since or so far as they have failed to be useful it has been my own fault and not theirs but the chief use of them at the time was to give me courage and confidence in myself both in bodily distress of which i had still not a little to bear and worse much mental anxiety about matters supremely interesting to me which were turning out ill and through all such troublewhich came upon me as i was recovering as if it meant to throw me back into the gravei held out and recovered repeating always to myself or rather having always murmured in my ears at every new trial one latin line      tu ne cede malis sed contra fortior ito  now i had got this line out of the tablet in the engraving of raphaels vision and had forgotten where it came from and i thought i knew my sixth book of virgil so well that i never looked at it again while i was giving these lectures at oxford and it was only here at assisi the other day wanting to look more accurately at the first scene by the lake avernus that i found i had been saved by the words of the cumaean sibyl  215 quam tua te fortuna sinet the completion of the sentence has yet more and continual teaching in it for me now as it has for all men her opening words which have become hackneyed and lost all present power through vulgar use of them contain yet one of the most immortal truths ever yet spoken for mankind and they will never lose their power of help for noble persons but observe both in that lesson facilis descensus averni etc and in the still more precious because universal one on which the strength of rome was foundedthe burning of the booksthe sibyl speaks only as the voice of nature and of her lawsnot as a divine helper prevailing over death but as a mortal teacher warning us against it and strengthening us for our mortal time but not for eternity of which lesson her own history is a part and her habitation by the avernus lake she desires immortality fondly and vainly as we do ourselves she receives from the love of her refused lover apollo not immortality but length of lifeher years to be as the grains of dust in her hand and even this she finds was a false desire and her wise and holy desire at last isto die she wastes away becomes a shade only and a voice the nations ask her what wouldst thou she answers peace only let my last words be true lultimo mie parlar sie verace  illustration vii  for a time and times  216 therefore if anything is to be conceived rightly and chiefly in the form of the cumaean sibyl it must be of fading virginal beauty of enduring patience of farlooking into futurity for after my death there shall yet return she says another virgin      jam redit et virgoredeunt saturnia regna     ultima cumaei venit jam carminis aetas  here then is botticellis cumaean sibyl she is armed for she is the prophetess of roman fortitudebut her faded breast scarcely raises the corselet her hair floats not falls in waves like the currents of a riverthe sign of enduring life the light is full on her forehead she looks into the distance as in a dream it is impossible for art to gather together more beautifully or intensely every image which can express her true power or lead us to understand her lesson  illustration viii  the nymph beloved of apollo  michael angelo  217 now you do not i am well assured know one of michael angelos sibyls from another unless perhaps the delphian whom of course he makes as beautiful as he can but of this especially italian prophetess one would have thought he might at least in some way have shown that he knew the history even if he did not understand it she might have had more than one book at all events to burn she might have had a stray leaf or two fallen at her feet he could not indeed have painted her only as a voice but his anatomical knowledge need not have hindered him from painting her virginal youth or her wasting and watching age or her inspired hope of a holier future  218 oppositefortunately photograph from the figure itself so that you can suspect me of no exaggerationis michael angelos cumaean sibyl wasting away it is by a grotesque and most strange chance that he should have made the figure of this sibyl of all others in the chapel the most fleshly and gross even proceeding to the monstrous license of showing the nipples of the breast as if the dress were molded over them like plaster thus he paints the poor nymph beloved of apollothe clearest and queenliest in prophecy and command of all the sibylsas an ugly crone with the arms of goliath poring down upon a single book  219 there is one point of fine detail however in botticellis cumaean sibyl and in the next i am going to show you to explain which i must go back for a little while to the question of the direct relation of the italian painters to the greek i dont like repeating in one lecture what i have said in another but to save you the trouble of reference must remind you of what i stated in my fourth lecture on greek birds when we were examining the adoption of the plume crests in armor that the crest signifies command but the diadem obedience and that every crown is primarily a diadem it is the thing that binds before it is the thing that honors  now all the great schools dwell on this symbolism the long flowing hair is the symbol of life and the greek diadêma of the law restraining it royalty or kingliness over life restraining and glorifying in the extremity of restraintin death whether noble as of death to earth or ignoble as of death to heaven the greek diadêma is fastened with the mortcloth bound hand and foot with graveclothes and the face bound about with the napkin  220 now look back to the first greek head i ever showed you used as the type of archaic sculpture in aratra pentelici and then look at the crown in botticellis astrologia it is absolutely the greek formeven to the peculiar oval of the forehead while the diademthe governing lawis set with appointed starsto rule the destiny and thought then return to the cumaean sibyl she as we have seen is the symbol of enduring lifealmost immortal the diadem is withdrawn from the foreheadreduced to a narrow fillethere and the hair thrown free  illustration ix  in the woods of ida  221 from the cumaean sibyls diadem traced only by points turn to that of the hellespontic plate 9 opposite i do not know why botticelli chose her for the spirit of prophecy in old age but he has made this the most interesting plate of the series in the definiteness of its connection with the work from dante which becomes his own prophecy in old age the fantastic yet solemn treatment of the gnarled wood occurs as far as i know in no other engravings but this and the illustrations to dante and i am content to leave it with little comment for the readers quiet study as showing the exuberance of imagination which other men at this time in italy allowed to waste itself in idle arabesque restrained by botticelli to his most earnest purposes and giving the withered treetrunks hewn for the rude throne of the aged prophetess the same harmony with her fading spirit which the rose has with youth or the laurel with victory also in its weird characters you have the best example i can show you of the orders of decorative design which are especially expressible by engraving and which belong to a group of art instincts scarcely now to be understood much less recovered the influence of modern naturalistic imitation being too strong to be conqueredthe instincts namely for the arrangement of pure line in labyrinthine intricacy through which the grace of order may give continual clue the entire body of ornamental design connected with writing in the middle ages seems as if it were a sensible symbol to the eye and brain of the methods of error and recovery the minglings of crooked with straight and perverse with progressive which constitute the great problem of human morals and fate and when i chose the title for the collected series of these lectures i hoped to have justified it by careful analysis of the methods of labyrinthine ornament which made sacred by theseian traditionsbc and beginning in imitation of physical truth with the spiral waves of the waters of babylon as the assyrian carved them entangled in their returns the eyes of men on greek vase and christian manuscripttill they closed in the arabesques which sprang round the last luxury of venice and rome  but the labyrinth of life itself and its more and more interwoven occupation become too manifold and too difficult for me and of the time wasted in the blind lanes of it perhaps that spent in analysis or recommendation of the art to which mens present conduct makes them insensible has been chiefly cast away on the walls of the little room where i finally revise this lecturebd hangs an old silken sampler of greatgrandames work representing the domestic life of abraham chiefly the stories of isaac and ishmael sarah at her tentdoor watching with folded arms the dismissal of hagar above in a wilderness full of fruit trees birds and butterflies little ishmael lying at the root of a tree and the spent bottle under another hagar in prayer and the angel appearing to her out of a wreathed line of gloomily undulating clouds which with a darkrayed sun in the midst surmount the entire composition in two arches out of which descend shafts of i suppose beneficent rain leaving however room in the corner opposite to ishmaels angel for isaacs who stays abraham in the sacrifice the ram in the thicket the squirrel in the plum tree above him and the grapes pears apples roses and daisies of the foreground being all wrought with involution of such ingenious needlework as may well rank in the patience the natural skill and the innocent pleasure of it with the truest works of florentine engraving nay the actual tradition of many of the forms of ancient art is in many places evidentas for instance in the spiral summits of the flames of the wood on the altar which are like a group of firstspringing fern on the wall opposite is a smaller composition representing justice with her balance and sword standing between the sun and moon with a background of pinks borage and corncockle a third is only a cluster of tulips and iris with two byzantine peacocks but the spirits of penelope and ariadne reign vivid in all the workand the richness of pleasurable fancy is as great still in these silken labors as in the marble arches and golden roof of the cathedral of monreale  but what is the use of explaining or analyzing it such work as this means the patience and simplicity of all feminine life and can be produced among us at least no more gothic tracery itself another of the instinctive labyrinthine intricacies of old though analyzed to its last section has become now the symbol only of a foolish ecclesiastical sect retained for their shibboleth joyless and powerless for all good the very labyrinth of the grass and flowers of our fields though dissected to its last leaf is yet bitten bare or trampled to slime by the minotaur of our lust and for the traceried spire of the poplar by the brook we possess but the foursquare furnace tower to mingle its smoke with heavens thundercloudsbe  we will look yet at one sampler more of the engraved work done in the happy time when flowers were pure youth simple and imagination gaybotticellis libyan sibyl  glance back first to the hellespontic noting the close fillet and the cloth bound below the face and then you will be prepared to understand the last i shall show you and the loveliest of the southern pythonesses  illustration x  grass of the desert  222 a less deep thinker than botticelli would have made her parched with thirst and burnt with heat but the voice of god through nature to the arab or the moor is not in the thirst but in the fountainnot in the desert but in the grass of it and this libyan sibyl is the spirit of wild grass and flowers springing in desolate places  you see her diadem is a wreath of them but the blossoms of it are not fastening enough for her hair though it is not long yetshe is only in reality a florentine girl of fourteen or fifteenso the little darling knots it under her ears and then makes herself a necklace of it but though flowing hair and flowers are wild and pretty botticelli had not in these only got the power of spring marked to his mind any girl might wear flowers but few for ornament would be likely to wear grass so the sibyl shall have grass in her diadem not merely interwoven and bending but springing and strong you thought it ugly and grotesque at first did not you it was made so because precisely what botticelli wanted you to look at  but thats not all this conical cap of hers with one bead at the topconsidering how fond the florentines are of graceful headdresses this seems a strange one for a young girl but exactly as i know the angel of victory to be greek at his mount of pity so i know this headdress to be taken from a greek coin and to be meant for a greek symbol it is the petasus of hermesthe mist of morning over the dew lastly what will the libyan sibyl say to you the letters are large on her tablet her message is the oracle from the temple of the dew the dew of thy birth is as the womb of the morningecce venientem diem et latentia aperientem tenebit gremio gentium regina  223 why the daybreak came not then nor yet has come but only a deeper darkness and why there is now neither queen nor king of nations but every man doing that which is right in his own eyes i would fain go on partly to tell you and partly to meditate with you but it is not our work for today the issue of the reformation which these great painters the scholars of dante began we may follow farther in the study to which i propose to lead you of the lives of cimabue and giotto and the relation of their work at assisi to the chapel and chambers of the vatican  224 today let me finish what i have to tell you of the style of southern engraving what sudden bathos in the sentence you think so contemptible the question of style then in painting though not in literature you study the style of homer the style perhaps of isaiah the style of horace and of massillon is it so vain to study the style of botticelli  in all cases it is equally vain if you think of their style first but know their purpose and then their way of speaking is worth thinking of these apparently unfinished and certainly unfilled outlines of the florentineclumsy work as vasari thought themas mr otley and most of our english amateurs still think themare these good or bad engraving  you may ask now comprehending their motive with some hope of answering or being answered rightly and the answer is they are the finest gravers work ever done yet by human hand you may teach by process of discipline and of years any youth of good artistic capacity to engrave a plate in the modern manner but only the noblest passion and the tenderest patience will ever engrave one line like these of sandro botticelli  225 passion and patience nay even these you may have today in england and yet both be in vain only a few years ago in one of our northern ironfoundries a workman of intense power and natural artfaculty set himself to learn engravingmade his own tools gave all the spare hours of his laborious life to learn their use learnt it and engraved a plate which in manipulation no professional engraver would be ashamed of he engraved his blast furnace and the casting of a beam of a steam engine this to him was the power of godit was his life no greater earnestness was ever given by man to promulgate a gospel nevertheless the engraving is absolutely worthless the blast furnace is not the power of god and the life of the strong spirit was as much consumed in the flames of it as ever driven slaves by the burden and heat of the day  how cruel to say so if he yet lives you think no my friends the cruelty will be in you and the guilt if having been brought here to learn that god is your light you yet leave the blast furnace to be the only light of england  226 it has been as i said in the note above § 200 with extreme pain that i have hitherto limited my notice of our own great engraver and moralist to the points in which the disadvantages of english artteaching made him inferior to his trained florentine rival but that these disadvantages were powerless to arrest or ignobly depress himthat however failing in grace and scholarship he should never fail in truth or vitality and that the precision of his unerring handbfhis inevitable eyeand his rightly judging heartshould place him in the first rank of the great artists not of england only but of all the world and of all timethat this was possible to him was simply because he lived a country life bewick himself botticelli himself apelles himself and twenty times apelles condemned to slavery in the hellfire of the iron furnace could have donenothing absolute paralysis of all high human faculty must result from labor near fire the poor engraver of the pistonrod had facultiesnot like bewicks for if he had had those he never would have endured the degradation but assuredly i know this by his work faculties high enough to have made him one of the most accomplished figure painters of his age and they are scorched out of him as the sap from the grass in the oven while on his northumberland hillsides bewick grew into as stately life as their strongest pine  227 and therefore in words of his telling consummate and unchanging truth concerning the life honor and happiness of england and bearing directly on the points of difference between class and class which i have not dwelt on without need i will bring these lectures to a close  i have always through life been of opinion that there is no business of any kind that can be compared to that of a man who farms his own land it appears to me that every earthly pleasure with health is within his reach but numbers of these men the old statesmen were grossly ignorant and in exact proportion to that ignorance they were sure to be offensively proud this led them to attempt appearing above their station which hastened them on to their ruin but indeed this disposition and this kind of conduct invariably leads to such results there were many of these lairds on tyneside as well as many who held their lands on the tenure of suit and service and were nearly on the same level as the lairds some of the latter lost their lands not fairly i think in a way they could not help many of the former by their misdirected pride and folly were driven into towns to slide away into nothingness and to sink into oblivion while their ha houses halls that ought to have remained in their families from generation to generation have moldered away i have always felt extremely grieved to see the ancient mansions of many of the country gentlemen from somewhat similar causes meet with a similar fate the gentry should in an especial manner prove by their conduct that they are guarded against showing any symptom of foolish pride at the same time that they soar above every meanness and that their conduct is guided by truth integrity and patriotism if they wish the people to partake with them in these good qualities they must set them the example without which no real respect can ever be paid to them gentlemen ought never to forget the respectable station they hold in society and that they are the natural guardians of public morals and may with propriety be considered as the head and the heart of the country while a bold peasantry are in truth the arms the sinews and the strength of the same but when these last are degraded they soon become dispirited and mean and often dishonest and useless                                       this singular and worthy manbg was perhaps the most invaluable acquaintance and friend i ever met with his moral lectures and advice to me formed a most important succedaneum to those imparted by my parents his wise remarks his detestation of vice his industry and his temperance crowned with a most lively and cheerful disposition altogether made him appear to me as one of the best of characters in his workshop i often spent my winter evenings this was also the case with a number of young men who might be considered as his pupils many of whom i have no doubt he directed into the paths of truth and integrity and who revered his memory through life he rose early to work lay down when he felt weary and rose again when refreshed his diet was of the simplest kind and he ate when hungry and drank when dry without paying regard to mealtimes by steadily pursuing this mode of life he was enabled to accumulate sums of moneyfrom ten to thirty pounds this enabled him to get books of an entertaining and moral tendency printed and circulated at a cheap rate his great object was by every possible means to promote honorable feelings in the minds of youth and to prepare them for becoming good members of society i have often discovered that he did not overlook ingenious mechanics whose misfortunesperhaps mismanagementhad led them to a lodging in newgate to these he directed his compassionate eye and for the deserving in his estimation he paid their debt and set them at liberty he felt hurt at seeing the hands of an ingenious man tied up in prison where they were of no use either to himself or to the community this worthy man had been educated for a priest but he would say to me of a trouth thomas i did not like their ways so he gave up the thoughts of being a priest and bent his way from aberdeen to edinburgh where he engaged himself to allan ramsay the poet then a bookseller at the latter place in whose service he was both shopman and bookbinder from edinburgh he came to newcastle gilbert had had a liberal education bestowed upon him he had read a great deal and had reflected upon what he had read this with his retentive memory enabled him to be a pleasant and communicative companion i lived in habits of intimacy with him to the end of his life and when he died i with others of his friends attended his remains to the grave at the ballast hills  and what graving on the sacred cliffs of egypt ever honored them as that grassdimmed furrow does the mounds of our northern land  footnotes  as the world was not then ready for le père hyacinthebut the real gist of the matter is that lippi did openly and bravely what the highest prelates in the church did basely and in secret

have to correct the inaccurateand very harmfully inaccurate expression which i used of bewick in loves meinie § 3 a printers lad at newcastle his first master was a goldsmith and engraver else he could never have been an artist i am very heartily glad to make this correction which establishes another link of relation between bewick and botticelli but my error was partly caused by the impression which the above description of his most invaluable friend made on me when i first read it  much else that i meant to correct or promised to explain in this lecture must be deferred to the appendix the superiority of the tuscan to the greek aphrodite i may perhaps even at last leave the reader to admit or deny as he pleases having more important matters of debate on hand but as i mean only to play with proserpina during the spring i will here briefly anticipate a statement i mean in the appendix to enforce namely of the extreme value of colored copies by hand of paintings whose excellence greatly consists in color as auxiliary to engravings of them the prices now given without hesitation for nearly worthless original drawings by fifthrate artists would obtain for the misguided buyers in something like a proportion of ten to one most precious copies of drawings which can only be represented at all in engraving by entire alteration of their treatment and abandonment of their finest purposes i feel this so strongly that i have given my best attention during upwards of ten years to train a copyist to perfect fidelity in rendering the work of turner and having now succeeded in enabling him to produce facsimiles so close as to look like replicas facsimiles which i must sign with my own name and his in the very work of them to prevent their being sold for real turner vignettes i can obtain no custom for him and am obliged to leave him to make his bread by any power of captivation his original sketches may possess in the eyes of a public which maintains a nation of copyists in rome but is content with black and white renderings of great english art though there is scarcely one cultivated english gentleman or lady who has not been twenty times in the vatican for once that they have been in the national gallery                                notes   228 i the following letter from one of my most faithful readers corrects an important piece of

    article i       notes on the present state of engraving in england  229 i have long deferred the completion of this book because i had hoped to find time to show in some fullness the grounds for my conviction that engraving and the study of it since the development of the modern finished school have been ruinous to european knowledge of art but i am more and more busied in what i believe to be better work and can only with extreme brevity state here the conclusions of many years thought  these in several important particulars have been curiously enforced on me by the carelessness shown by the picture dealers about the copies from turner which it has cost mr ward and mebl fifteen years of study together to enable ourselves to make they are only copies say theynobody will look at them  230 it never seems to occur even to the most intelligent persons that an engraving also is only a copy and a copy done with refusal of color and with disadvantage of means in rendering shade but just because this utterly inferior copy can be reduplicated and introduces a different kind of skill in another material people are content to lose all the composition and all the charm of the originalso far as these depend on the chief gift of a paintercolor while they are gradually misled into attributing to the painter himself qualities impertinently added by the engraver to make his plate popular and which is far worse they are as gradually and subtly prevented from looking in the original for the qualities which engraving could never render further it continually happens that the very best colorcompositions engrave worst for they often extend colors over great spaces at equal pitch and the green is as dark as the red and the blue as the brown so that the engraver can only distinguish them by lines in different directions and his plate becomes a vague and dead mass of neutral tint but a bad and forced piece of color or a piece of work of the bolognese school which is everywhere black in the shadows and colorless in the lights will engrave with great ease and appear spirited and forcible hence engravers as a rule are interested in reproducing the work of the worst schools of painting  also the idea that the merit of an engraving consisted in light and shade has prevented the modern masters from even attempting to render works dependent mainly on outline and expression like the early frescoes which should indeed have been the objects of their most attentive and continual skill for outline and expression are entirely within the scope of engraving and the scripture histories of an aisle of a cloister might have been engraved to perfection with little more pains than are given by ordinary workmen to round a limb by correggio or imitate the texture of a dress by sir joshuaand both at last inadequately  231 i will not lose more time in asserting or lamenting the mischief arising out of the existing system but will rapidly state what the public should now ask for  1 exquisitely careful engraved outlines of all remaining frescoes of the thirteenth fourteenth and fifteenth centuries in italy with so much pale tinting as may be explanatory of their main masses and with the local darks and local lights brilliantly relieved the arundel society have published some meritorious plates of this kind from angeliconot however paying respect enough to the local colors but conventionalizing the whole too much into outline  2 finished small plates for book illustration the cheap woodcutting and etching of popular illustrated books have been endlessly mischievous to public taste they first obtained their power in a general reaction of the public mind from the insipidity of the lower school of line engraving brought on it by servile persistence in hack work for ignorant publishers the last dregs of it may still be seen in the sentimental landscapes engraved for cheap ladies pocketbooks but the woodcut can never educationally take the place of serene and accomplished line engraving and the training of young artists in whom the gift of delineation prevails over their sense of color to the production of scholarly but small plates with their utmost honor of skill would give a hitherto unconceived dignity to the character and range of our popular literature  3 vigorous mezzotints from pictures of the great masters which originally present noble contrasts of light and shade many venetian works are magnificent in this character  4 original design by painters themselves decisively engraved in few linesnot etched and with such insistence by dotted work on the main contours as we have seen in the examples given from italian engraving  5 on the other hand the men whose quiet patience and exquisite manual dexterity are at present employed in producing large and costly plates such as that of the belle jardinière de florence by m boucher desnoyers should be entirely released from their servile toil and employed exclusively in producing colored copies or light drawings from the original work the same number of hours of labor applied with the like conscientious skill would multiply precious likenesses of the real picture full of subtle veracities which no steel line could approach and conveying to thousands true knowledge and unaffected enjoyment of painting while the finished plate lies uncared for in the portfolio of the virtuoso serving only so far as it is seen in the printsellers window by the people to make them think that sacred painting must always be dull and unnatural  232 i have named the above engraving because for persons wishing to study the present qualities and methods of linework it is a pleasant and sufficient possession uniting every variety of texture with great serenity of unforced effect and exhibiting every possible artifice and achievement in the distribution of even and rugged or of close and open line artifices for whichwhile i must yet once more and emphatically repeat that they are illegitimate and could not be practiced in a revived school of classic arti would fain secure the readers reverent admiration under the conditions exacted by the school to which they belong let him endeavor with the finest point of pen or pencil he can obtain to imitate the profile of this madonna in its relief against the gray background of the water surface let him examine through a good lens the way in which the lines of the background are ended in a lancepoint as they approach it the exact equality of depth of shade being restored by inserted dots which prepare for the transition to the manner of shade adopted in the flesh then let him endeavor to trace with his own hand some of the curved lines at the edge of the eyelid or in the rounding of the lip or if these be too impossible even a few of the quiet undulations which gradate the folds of the hood behind the hair and he will i trust begin to comprehend the range of delightful work which would be within the reach of such an artist employed with more tractable material on more extended subject  233 if indeed the present system were capable of influencing the mass of the people and enforcing among them the subtle attention necessary to appreciate it something might be pleaded in defense of its severity but all these plates are entirely above the means of the lower middle classes and perhaps not one reader in a hundred can possess himself for the study i ask of him even of the plate to which i have just referred what in the stead of such he can and does possess let him considerand if possible just after examining the noble qualities of this conscientious engraving  234 take up for an average specimen of modern illustrated works the volume of dickenss master humphreys clock containing barnaby rudge  you have in that book an entirely profitless and monstrous story in which the principal characters are a coxcomb an idiot a madman a savage blackguard a foolish tavernkeeper a mean old maid and a conceited apprenticemixed up with a certain quantity of ordinary operatic pastoral stuff about a pretty dolly in ribbons a lover with a wooden leg and an heroic locksmith for these latter the only elements of good or life in the filthy mass of the storybm observe that the author must filch the wreck of those old times of which we fiercely and frantically destroy every living vestige whenever it is possible you cannot have your dolly varden brought up behind the counter of a railway station nor your jolly locksmith trained at a birmingham brassfoundry and of these materials observe that you can only have the ugly ones illustrated the cheap popular art cannot draw for you beauty sense or honesty and for dolly varden or the locksmith you will look through the vignettes in vain but every species of distorted folly and vicethe idiot the blackguard the coxcomb the paltry fool the degraded womanare pictured for your honorable pleasure in every page with clumsy caricature struggling to render its dullness tolerable by insisting on defectif perchance a penny or two more may be coined out of the cockney readers itch for loathsomeness  235 or take up for instance of higher effort the cornhill magazine for this month july 1876 it has a vignette of venice for an illuminated letter that is what your decorative art has become by help of kensington the letter to be produced is a t there is a gondola in the front of the design with the canopy slipped back to the stern like a saddle over a horses tail there is another in the middle distance all gone to seed at the prow with its gondolier emaciated into an oar at the stern then there is a church of the salute and a ducal palacein which i beg you to observe all the felicity and dexterity of modern cheap engraving finally over the ducal palace there is something i know not in the least what meant for like an umbrella dropping out of a balloon which is the ornamental letter t opposite this ornamental design there is an engraving of two young ladies and a parasol between two trunks of trees the white face and black feet of the principal young lady being the points of the design are done with as much carenot with as much dexterityas an ordinary sketch of du mauriers in punch the young ladys dress the next attraction is done in cheap white and black cutting with considerably less skill than that of any ordinary tailors or milliners shopbook pattern drawing for the other young lady and the landscape take your magnifying glass and look at the hacked wood that forms the entire shaded surfaceone mass of idiotic scrabble without the remotest attempt to express a single leaf flower or clod of earth it is such landscape as the public sees out of its railroad window at sixty miles of it in the hourand good enough for such a public  236 then turn to the lastthe poetical plate p 122 lifts herlays her down with care look at the gentleman with a spade promoting the advance over a hillock of hay of the reposing figure in the blacksided tub take your magnifying glass to that and look what a dainty female arm and hand your modern scientific and anatomical schools of art have provided you with look at the tender horizontal flux of the sea round the promontory point above look at the tender engraving of the linear light on the divine horizon above the ravenous seagull here is development and progress for you from the days of peruginos horizon and dantes daybreaks truly here it seems      si che le bianche e le vermiglie guance     per troppa etate divenivan rance  237 i have chosen no gross or mean instances of modern work it is one of the saddest points connected with the matter that the designer of this last plate is a person of consummate art faculty but bound to the wheel of the modern juggernaut and broken on it these woodcuts for barnaby rudge and the cornhill magazine are favorably representative of the entire illustrative art industry of the modern pressindustry enslaved to the ghastly service of catching the last gleams in the glued eyes of the daily more bestial english mobrailroad born and bred which drags itself about the black world it has withered under its breath in one eternal grind and shriekgobblingstaringchatteringgigglingtrampling out every vestige of national honor and domestic peace wherever it sets the staggering hoof of it incapable of reading of hearing of thinking of lookingcapable only of greed for money lust for food pride of dress and the prurient itch of momentary curiosity for the politics last announced by the newsmonger and the religion last rolled by the chemist into electuary for the dead  238 in the miserably competitive labor of finding new stimulus for the appetitedaily more grossof this tyrannous mob we may count as lost beyond any hope the artists who are dull docile or distressed enough to submit to its demands and we may count the dull and the distressed by myriadsand among the docile many of the best intellects we possess the few who have sense and strength to assert their own place and supremacy are driven into discouraged disease by their isolation like turner and blake the one abandoning the design of his liber studiorum after imperfectly and sadly against total public neglect carrying it forward to what it ismonumental nevertheless in landscape engraving the other producing with one only majestic series of designs from the book of job nothing for his lifes work but coarsely iridescent sketches of enigmatic dream  239 and for total result of our english engraving industry during the last hundred and fifty years i find that practically at this moment i cannot get a single piece of true sweet and comprehensible art to place for instruction in any childrens school i can get for ten pounds apiece wellengraved portraits of sir joshuas beauties showing graceful limbs through flowery draperies i can getdirtcheapany quantity of dutch flats ditches and hedges enlivened by cows chewing the cud and dogs behaving indecently i can get heaps upon heaps of temples and forums and altars arranged as for academical competition round seaports with curledup ships that only touch the water with the middle of their bottoms i can get at the price of lumber any quantity of british squires flourishing whips and falling over hurdles and in suburban shops a dolorous variety of widowed mothers nursing babies in a high light with the bible on a table and babys shoes on a chair also of cheap prints painted red and blue of christ blessing little children of joseph and his brethren the infant samuel or daniel in the lions den the supply is ample enough to make every child in these islands think of the bible as a somewhat dull storybook allowed on sundaybut of trained wise and worthy art applied to gentle purposes of instruction no single example can be found in the shops of the british printseller or bookseller and after every dilettante tongue in european society has filled drawingroom and academy alike with idle clatter concerning the divinity of raphael and michael angelo for these last hundred years i cannot at this instant for the first school which i have some power of organizing under st georges laws get a good print of raphaels madonna of the tribune or an ordinarily intelligible view of the side and dome of st peters  240 and there are simply no words for the mixed absurdity and wickedness of the present popular demand for art as shown by its supply in our thoroughfares abroad in the shops of the rue de rivoli brightest and most central of parisian streets the putrescent remnant of what was once catholicism promotes its poor gilded pedlars ware of nativity and crucifixion into such honorable corners as it can find among the more costly and studious illuminations of the brothel and although in pall mall and the strand the largemargined landseerstanfieldor turnerproofs in a few stately windows still represent uncaredfor by the people or inaccessible to them the power of an english school now wholly perishedthese are too surely superseded in the windows that stop the crowd by the thrilling attraction with which doré gérome and tadema have invested the gambling table the dueling ground and the arena or by the more material and almost tangible truth with which the apothecaryartist stereographs the stripped actress and the railway mound  241 under these conditions as i have now repeatedly asserted no professorship nor school of art can be of the least use to the general public no race can understand a visionary landscape which blasts its real mountains into ruin and blackens its riverbeds with foam of poison nor is it of the least use to exhibit ideal diana at kensington while substantial phryne may be worshiped in the strand the only recovery of our artpower possiblenay when once we know the full meaning of it the only one desirablemust result from the purification of the nations heart and chastisement of its life utterly hopeless now for our adult population or in our large cities and their neighborhood but so far as any of the sacred influence of former design can be brought to bear on the minds of the young and so far as in rural districts the first elements of scholarly education can be made pure the foundation of a new dynasty of thought may be slowly laid i was strangely impressed by the effect produced in a provincial seaport school for children chiefly of fishermens families by the gift of a little colored drawing of a single figure from the paradise of angelico in the accademia of florence the drawing was wretched enough seen beside the original i had only bought it from the poor italian copyist for charity but to the children it was like an actual glimpse of heaven they rejoiced in it with pure joy and their mistress thanked me for it more than if i had sent her a whole library of good books of such copies the gracegiving industry of young girls now worse than lost in the spurious charities of the bazaar or selfish ornamentations of the drawingroom might in a years time provide enough for every dameschool in england and a years honest work of the engravers employed on our base novels might represent to our advanced students every frescoed legend of philosophy and morality extant in christendom  242 for my own part i have no purpose in what remains to me of opportunity either at oxford or elsewhere to address any farther course of instruction towards the development of existing schools after seeing the stream of the teviot as black as ink and a putrid carcass of a sheep lying in the dry channel of the jed under jedburgh abbey the entire strength of the summer stream being taken away to supply a single mill i know finally what value the british mind sets on the beauties of nature and shall attempt no farther the excitement of its enthusiasm in that direction i shall indeed endeavor to carry out with mr wards help my twenty years held purpose of making the real character of turners work known to the persons who formerly interested by the engravings from him imagined half the merit was of the engravers giving but i know perfectly that to the general people trained in the midst of the ugliest objects that vice can design in houses mills and machinery all beautiful form and color is as invisible as the seventh heaven it is not a question of appreciation at all the thing is physically invisible to them as human speech is inaudible during a steam whistle  243 and i shall also use all the strength i have to convince those among our artists of the second order who are wise and modest enough not to think themselves the matches of turner or michael angelo that in the present state of art they only waste their powers in endeavoring to produce original pictures of human form or passion modern aristocratic life is too vulgar and modern peasant life too unhappy to furnish subjects of noble study while even were it otherwise the multiplication of designs by painters of secondrate power is no more desirable than the writing of music by inferior composers they may with far greater personal happiness and incalculably greater advantage to others devote themselves to the affectionate and sensitive copying of the works of men of just renown the dignity of this selfsacrifice would soon be acknowledged with sincere respect for copies produced by men working with such motive would differ no less from the common tradearticle of the galleries than the rendering of music by an enthusiastic and highly trained executant differs from the grinding of a street organ and the change in the tone of public feeling produced by familiarity with such work would soon be no less great than in their musical enjoyment if having been accustomed only to hear black christys blind fiddlers and hoarse beggars scrape or howl about their streets they were permitted daily audience of faithful and gentle orchestral rendering of the work of the highest classical masters  244 i have not until very lately rightly appreciated the results of the labor of the arundel society in this direction although from the beginning i have been honored in being a member of its council my action has been hitherto rather of check than help because i thought more of the differences between our copies and the great originals than of their unquestionable superiority to anything the public could otherwise obtain  i was practically convinced of their extreme value only this last winter by staying at the house of a friend in which the arundel engravings were the principal decoration and where i learned more of masaccio from the arundel copy of the contest with simon magus than in the brancacci chapel itself for the daily companionship with the engraving taught me subtleties in its composition which had escaped me in the multitudinous interest of visits to the actual fresco  but the work of the society has been sorely hindered hitherto because it has had at command only the skill of copyists trained in foreign schools of color and accustomed to meet no more accurate requisitions than those of the fashionable traveler i have always hoped for and trust at last to obtain cooperation with our too mildly laborious copyists of english artists possessing more brilliant color faculty and the permission of our subscribers to secure for them the great ruins of the noble past undesecrated by the trim but treacherous plastering of modern emendation  245 finally i hope to direct some of the antiquarian energy often to be found remaining even when love of the picturesque has passed away to encourage the accurate delineation and engraving of historical monuments as a direct function of our schools of art all that i have generally to suggest on this matter has been already stated with sufficient clearness in the first of my inaugural lectures at oxford and my forthcoming elements of drawingbn will contain all the directions i can give in writing as to methods of work for such purpose the publication of these has been hindered for at least a year by the abuses introduced by the modern cheap modes of printing engravings i find the men wont use any ink but what pleases them nor print but with what pressure pleases them and if i can get the foreman to attend to the business and choose the ink right the men change it the moment he leaves the room and threaten to throw up the job when they are detected all this i have long known well is a matter of course in the outcome of modern principles of trade but it has rendered it hitherto impossible for me to produce illustrations which have been ready as far as my work or that of my own assistants is concerned for a year and a half any one interested in hearing of our progressor arrest may write to my turner copyist mr wardbo and in the meantime they can help my designs for art education best by making these turner copies more generally known and by determining when they travel to spend what sums they have at their disposal not in fady photography but in the encouragement of any good watercolor and pencil draughtsmen whom they find employed in the galleries of europe                                  article ii                               detached notes                                     i        on the series of sibyl engravings attributed to botticelli  246 since i wrote the earlier lectures in this volume i have been made more doubtful on several points which were embarrassing enough before by seeing some better socalled impressions of my favorite plates containing light and shade which did not improve them  i do not choose to waste time or space in discussion till i know more of the matter and that more i must leave to my good friend mr reid of the british museum to find out for me for i have no time to take up the subject myself but i give for frontispiece to this appendix the engraving of joshua referred to in the text which however beautiful in thought is an example of the inferior execution and more elaborate shade which puzzle me but whatever is said in the previous pages of the plates chosen for example by whomsoever done is absolutely trustworthy thoroughly fine they are in their existing state and exemplary to all persons and times and of the rest in fitting place i hope to give completeor at least satisfactory account                                      ii    on the three excellent engravers representative of the first middle                            and late schools  illustration xii  the coronation in the garden  247 i have given opposite a photograph slightly reduced from the dürer madonna alluded to often in the text as an example of his best conception of womanhood it is very curious that dürer the least able of all great artists to represent womanhood should of late have been a very principal object of feminine admiration the last thing a woman should do is to write about art they never see anything in pictures but what they are told or resolve to see out of contradictionor the particular things that fall in with their own feelings i saw a curious piece of enthusiastic writing by an edinburgh lady the other day on the photographs i had taken from the tower of giotto she did not care a straw what giotto had meant by them declared she felt it her duty only to announce what they were to her and wrote two pages on the basrelief of heracles and antæusassuming it to be the death of abel  248 it is not however by women only that dürer has been overpraised he stands so alone in his own field that the people who care much for him generally lose the power of enjoying anything else rightly and are continually attributing to the force of his imagination quaintnesses which are merely part of the general mannerism of his day  the following notes upon him in relation to two other excellent engravers were written shortly for extempore expansion in lecturing i give them with the others in this terminal article mainly for use to myself in future reference but also as more or less suggestive to the reader if he has taken up the subject seriously and worth therefore a few pages of this closing sheet  249 the men i have named as representative of all the good ones composing their school are alike resolved their engraving shall be lovely  but botticelli the ancient wants with as little engraving as much sibyl as possible  dürer the central wants with as much engraving as possible anything of sibyl that may chance to be picked up with it  beaugrand the modern wants as much sibyl as possible and as much engraving too  250 i repeatfor i want to get this clear to youbotticelli wants with as little engraving as much sibyl as possible for his head is full of sibyls and his heart he cant draw them fast enough one comes and another and another and all gracious and wonderful and good to be engraved forever if only he had a thousand hands and lives he scratches down one with no haste with no fault divinely careful scrupulous patient but with as few lines as possible another sibyllet me draw another for heavens sake before she has burnt all her books and vanished  dürer is exactly botticellis opposite he is a workman to the heart and will do his work magnificently no matter what i do it on so that my craft be honorably shown anything will do a sibyl a skull a madonna and christ a hat and feather an adam an eve a cock a sparrow a lion with two tails a pig with five legsanything will do for me but see if i dont show you what engraving is be my subject what it may  251 thirdly beaugrand i said wants as much sibyl as possible and as much engraving he is essentially a copyist and has no ideas of his own but deep reverence and love for the work of others he will give his life to represent another mans thought he will do his best with every spot and lineexhibit to you if you will only look the most exquisite completion of obedient skill but will be content if you will not look to pass his neglected years in fruitful peace and count every day well spent that has given softness to a shadow or light to a smile                                     iii      on dürers landscape with reference to the sentence on p 101                         i hope you are pleased  252 i spoke just now only of the illshaped body of this figure of fortune or pleasure beneath her feet is an elaborate landscape it is all drawn out of dürers headhe would look at bones or tendons carefully or at the leaf details of foregroundbut at the breadth and loveliness of real landscape never  he has tried to give you a birdseye view of germany rocks and woods and clouds and brooks and the pebbles in their beds and mills and cottages and fences and what not but it is all a feverish dream ghastly and strange a monotone of diseased imagination  and here is a little bit of the world he would not look atof the great river of his land with a single cluster of its reeds and two boats and an island with a village and the way for the eternal waters opened between the rounded hillsbp  it is just what you may see any day anywhereinnocent seemingly artless but the artlessness of turner is like the face of gainsboroughs village girl and a joy forever                                      iv                         on the study of anatomy  253 the virtual beginner of artistic anatomy in italy was a man called the poultererfrom his grandfathers trade pollajuolo a man of immense power but on whom the curse of the italian mind in this agebq was set at its deepest  any form of passionate excess has terrific effects on body and soul in nations as in men and when this excess is in rage and rage against your brother and rage accomplished in habitual deeds of blooddo you think nature will forget to set the seal of her indignation upon the forehead i told you that the great division of spirit between the northern and southern races had been reconciled in the val darno the font of florence and the font of pisa were as the very springs of the life of the christianity which had gone forth to teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the prince of peace yet these two brother cities were to each otheri do not say as abel and cain but as eteocles and polynices and the words of Æschylus are now fulfilled in them to the uttermost the arno baptizes their dead bodiestheir native valley between its mountains is to them as the furrow of a graveand so much of their land they have as is sepulcher nay not of florence and pisa only was this true venice and genoa died in deathgrapple and eight cities of lombardy divided between them the joy of leveling milan to her lowest stone nay not merely in city against city but in street against street and house against house the fury of the theban dragon flamed ceaselessly and with the same excuse upon mens lips the sign of the shield of polynices justice bringing back the exile was to them all in turn the portent of death and their history in the sum of it and substance is as of the servants of joab and abner by the pool of gibeon they caught every one his fellow by the head and thrust his sword in his fellows side so they fell down together wherefore that place was called the field of the strong men  254 now it is not possible for christian men to live thus except under a fever of insanity i have before in my lectures on prudence and insolence in art deliberately asserted to you the logical accuracy of the term demoniacal possessionbrthe being in the power or possession of a betraying spirit and the definite sign of such insanity is delight in witnessing pain usually accompanied by an instinct that gloats over or plays with physical uncleanness or disease and always by a morbid egotism it is not to be recognized for demoniacal power so much by its viciousness as its paltrinessthe taking pleasure in minute contemptible and loathsome thingsbs now in the middle of the gallery of the brera at milan there is an elaborate study of a dead christ entirely characteristic of early fifteenth century italian madmans work it is calledand was presented to the people asa christ but it is only an anatomical study of a vulgar and ghastly dead body with the soles of the feet set straight at the spectator and the rest foreshortened it is either castagnos or mantegnasin my mind set down to castagno but i have not looked at the picture for years and am not sure at this moment it does not matter a straw which it is exactly characteristic of the madness in which all of thempollajuolo castagno mantegna lionardo da vinci and michael angelo polluted their work with the science of the sepulcherbt and degraded it with presumptuous and paltry technical skill foreshorten your christ and paint him if you can half putrefiedthat is the scientific art of the renaissance  255 it is impossible however in so vast a subject to distinguish always the beginner of things from the establisher to the poulterers son pollajuolo remains the eternal shame of first making insane contest the only subject of art but the two establishers of anatomy were lionardo and michael angelo you hear of lionardo chiefly because of his last supper but italy did not hear of him for that this was not what brought her to worship lionardobut the battle of the standard                                      v                     fragments on holbein and others  256 of holbeins st elizabeth remember she is not a perfect saint elizabeth by any means she is an honest and sweet german ladythe best he could see he could do no betterand so i come back to my old storyno man can do better than he sees if he can reach the nature round him it is well he may fall short of it he cannot rise above it the best in this kind are but shadows                                       yet that intense veracity of holbein is indeed the strength and glory of all the northern schools they exist only in being true their work among men is the definition of what is and the abiding by it they cannot dream of what is not they make fools of themselves if they try think how feeble even shakspere is when he tries his hand at a goddesswomen beautiful and womanly as many as you choose but who cares what his minerva or juno says in the masque of the tempest and for the painterswhen sir joshua tries for a madonna or vandyke for a dianathey cant even paint they become total simpletons look at rubens mythologies in the louvre or at modern french heroics or german pietisms why allcornelius hesse overbeck and davidput together are not worth one de hooghe of an old woman with a broom sweeping a backkitchen the one thing we northerns can do is to find out what is fact and insist on it mean fact it may be or noblebut fact always or we die  257 yet the intensest form of northern realization can be matched in the south when the southerns choose there are two pieces of animal drawing in the sistine chapel unrivaled for literal veracity the sheep at the well in front of zipporah and afterwards when she is going away leading her children her eldest boy like every one else has taken his chief treasure with him and this treasure is his pet dog it is a little sharpnosed white foxterrier full of fire and life but not strong enough for a long walk so little gershom whose name was the stranger because his father had been a stranger in a strange landlittle gershom carries his white terrier under his arm lying on the top of a large bundle to make it comfortable the doggie puts its sharp nose and bright eyes out above his hand with a little roguish gleam sideways in them which meansif i can read rightly a dogs expressionthat he has been barking at moses all the morning and has nearly put him out of temperand without any doubt i can assert to you that there is not any other such piece of animal painting in the worldso brief intense vivid and absolutely balanced in truth as tenderly drawn as if it had been a saint yet as humorously as landseers lord chancellor poodle  258 oppose to    holbeins veracitybotticellis fantasy            shade

death into thirty different deaths and each is but a skeleton but orcagnas death is onethe power of death itself there may thus be as much breadth in thought as in execution                                       259 what then we have to ask is a man conscious of in what he sees  for instance in all cruikshanks etchingshowever slight the outlinethere is an intense consciousness of light and shade and of local color as a part of light and shade but none of color itself he was wholly incapable of coloring and perhaps this very deficiency enabled him to give graphic harmony to engraving                                       bewicksnowpieces etc gray predominant perfect sense of color coming out in patterns of birdsyet so uncultivated that he engraves the brown birds better than pheasant or peacock  for quite perfect consciousness of color makes engraving impossible and you have insteadcorreggio                                      vi                      final notes on light and shade  260 you will find in the 138th and 147th paragraphs of my inaugural lectures statements which if you were reading the book by yourselves would strike you probably as each of them difficult and in some degree inconsistentnamely that the school of color has exquisite character and sentiment but is childish cheerful and fantastic while the school of shade is deficient in character and sentiment but supreme in intellect and veracity the way by light and shade i say is taken by men of the highest powers of thought and most earnest desire for truth  the school of shade i say is deficient in character and sentiment compare any of dürers madonnas with any of angelicos  yet you may discern in the apocalypse engravings that dürers mind was seeking for truths and dealing with questions which no more could have occurred to angelicos mind than to that of a twoyearsold baby  261 the two schools unite in various degrees but are always distinguishably generic the two headmost masters representing each being tintoret and perugino the one deficient in sentiment and continually offending us by the want of it but full of intellectual power and suggestion  the other repeating ideas with so little reflection that he gets blamed for doing the same thing over again vasari but exquisite in sentiment and the conditions of taste which it forms so as to become the master of it to raphael and to all succeeding him and remaining such a type of sentiment too delicate to be felt by the latter practical mind of dutchbred england that goldsmith makes the admiration of him the test of absurd connoisseurship but yet with undercurrent of intellect which gets him accused of freethinking and therefore with undercurrent of entirely exquisite chiaroscuro  light and shade then imply the understanding of thingscolor the imagination and the sentiment of them  262 in turners distinctive work color is scarcely acknowledged unless under influence of sunshine the sunshine is his treasure his lividest gloom contains it his grayest twilight regrets it and remembers blue is always a blue shadow brown or gold always lightnothing is cheerful but sunshine wherever the sun is not there is melancholy or evil apollo is god and all forms of death and sorrow exist in opposition to him  but in peruginos distinctive workand therefore i have given him the captains place over allthere is simply no darkness no wrong every color is lovely and every space is light the world the universe is divine all sadness is a part of harmony and all gloom a part of peace

the executioners in the picture just referred to  bt observe i entirely distinguish the study of anatomyie of intense bone and musclefrom study of the nude as the greeks practiced it this for an entirely great painter is absolutely necessary but yet i believe in the case of botticelli it was nobly restricted the following note by mr tyrwhitt contains i think the probable truth  the facts relating to sandro botticellis models or rather to his favorite model as it appears to me are but few and it is greatly to be regretted that his pictures are seldom datedif it were certain in what order they appeared what follows here might approach moral certainty  there is no doubt that he had great personal regard for fra filippo up to that painters death in 1469 sandro being then twentytwo years old he may probably have got only good from him anyhow he would get a strong turn for realismie the treatment of sacred and all other subjects in a realistic manner he is described in crowe and cavalcaselle from filippino lippis martyrdom of st peter as a sullen and sensual man with beetle brows large fleshy mouth etc etc probably he was a strong man and intense in physical and intellectual habit  this man then begins to paint in his strength with convictionrather happy and innocent than notthat it is right to paint any beautiful thing and best to paint the most beautifulsay in 1470 at twentythree years of age the allegorical spring and the graces and the aphrodite now in the ufficii were painted for cosmo and seem to be taken by vasari and others as early or earlycentral works in his life also the portrait of simonetta vespucei1 he is known to have painted much in early life for the vespucei and the mediciand this daughter of the former house seems to have been inamorata or mistress of giuliano de medici murdered by the pazzi in 1478 now it seems agreed by crowe and cavalcaselle pater etc and i am quite sure of it myself as to the pictures mentionedfirst that the same slender and longthroated model appears in spring the aphrodite calumny and other works2 secondly that she was simonetta the original of the pitti portrait  now i think she must have been induced to let sandro draw from her whole person undraped more or less and that he must have done so as such a man probably would in strict honor as to deed word and definite thought but under occasional accesses of passion of which he said nothing and which in all probability and by grace of god refined down to nil or nearly so as he got accustomed to look in honor at so beautiful a thing he may have left off the undraped after her death first her figure is absolutely fine gothic i dont think any antique is so slender secondly she has the sad passionate and exquisite lombard mouth thirdly her limbs shrink together and she seems not quite to have liked it or been an accustomed model fourthly there is tradition giving her name to all those forms  her lover giuliano was murdered in 1478 and savonarola hanged and burnt in 1498 now can her distress and savonarolas preaching between them have taken in few years all the carnality out of sandro supposing him to have come already by seventyeight to that state in which the sight of her delighted him without provoking ulterior feelings all decent men accustomed to draw from the nude tell us they get to that  sandros dante is dated as published in 1482 he may have been saddening by that time and weary of beauty pure or mixedthough he went on painting madonnas i fancy can simonetta be traced in any of them i think not the sistine paintings extend from 1481 to 1484 however i cannot help thinking zipporah is impressed with her after savonarolas death sandro must have lost heart and gone into dante altogether most ways in literature and art lead to dante and this question about the nude and the purity of botticelli is no exception to the rule  now in the purgatorio lust is the last sin of which we are to be made pure and it has to be burnt out of us being itself as searching as fire as smoldering devouring and all that corruptio optimi pessima and it is the most searching and lasting of evils because it really is a corruption attendant on true love which is eternalwhatever the word means that this is so seems to me to demonstrate the truth of the fall of man from the condition of moral verygoodness in gods sight and i think that dante connected the purifying pains of his intermediate state with actual sufferings in this life working out repentancein himself and others and the torment of this passion to the repentant or resisting or purityseeking soul is decidedly like the pain of physical burning  further its casuistry is impracticable because the more you stir the said fire the stronger hold it takes therefore men and women are rightly secret about it and detailed confessions unadvisable much talk about hypocrisy in this matter is quite wrong and unjust then its connection with female beauty as a cause of love between man and woman seems to me to be the inextricable nodus of the fall the here inseparable mixture of good and evil till soul and body are parted for the sense of seen beauty is the awakening of love at whatever distance from any kind of return or sympathyas with a rose or what not sandro may be the man who has gone nearest to the right separation of delight from desire supposing that he began with religion and a straight conscience saw lovingly the error of fra filippos way saw with intense distant love the error of simonettas and reflected on florence and its way and drew nearer and nearer to savonarola being yet too big a man for asceticism and finally wearied of all things and sunk into poverty and peace  1 pitti stanza di prometeo 348  2 i think zipporah
