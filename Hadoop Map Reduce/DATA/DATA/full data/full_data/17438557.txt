         this work                        is respectfully dedicated                        by their sincere admirer                                            the author                         preface to the first edition  the work now laid before the public originated in indignation at the shallow and false criticism of the periodicals of the day on the works of the great living artist to whom it principally refers it was intended to be a short pamphlet reprobating the matter and style of those critiques and pointing out their perilous tendency as guides of public feeling but as point after point presented itself for demonstration i found myself compelled to amplify what was at first a letter to the editor of a review into something very like a treatise on art to which i was obliged to give the more consistency and completeness because it advocated opinions which to the ordinary connoisseur will sound heretical i now scarcely know whether i should announce it is an essay on landscape painting and apologize for its frequent reference to the works of a particular master or announcing it as a critique on particular works apologize for its lengthy discussion of general principles but of whatever character the work may be considered the motives which led me to undertake it must not be mistaken no zeal for the reputation of any individual no personal feeling of any kind has the slightest weight or influence with me the reputation of the great artist to whose works i have chiefly referred is established on too legitimate grounds among all whose admiration is honorable to be in any way affected by the ignorant sarcasms of pretension and affectation but when public taste seems plunging deeper and deeper into degradation day by day and when the press universally exerts such power as it possesses to direct the feeling of the nation more completely to all that is theatrical affected and false in art while it vents its ribald buffooneries on the most exalted truth and the highest ideal of landscape that this or any other age has ever witnessed it becomes the imperative duty of all who have any perception or knowledge of what is really great in art and any desire for its advancement in england to come fearlessly forward regardless of such individual interests as are likely to be injured by the knowledge of what is good and right to declare and demonstrate wherever they exist the essence and the authority of the beautiful and the true  whatever may seem invidious or partial in the execution of my task is dependent not so much on the tenor of the work as on its incompleteness i have not entered into systematic criticism of all the painters of the present day but i have illustrated each particular excellence and truth of art by the works in which it exists in the highest degree resting satisfied that if it be once rightly felt and enjoyed in these it will be discovered and appreciated wherever it exists in others and although i have never suppressed any conviction of the superiority of one artist over another which i believed to be grounded on truth and necessary to the understanding of truth i have been cautious never to undermine positive rank while i disputed relative rank my uniform desire and aim have been not that the present favorite should be admired less but that the neglected master should be admired more and i know that an increased perception and sense of truth and beauty though it may interfere with our estimate of the comparative rank of painters will invariably tend to increase our admiration of all who are really great and he who now places stanfield and callcott above turner will admire stanfield and callcott more than he does now when he has learned to place turner far above them both  in three instances only have i spoken in direct depreciation of the works of living artists and these are all cases in which the reputation is so firm and extended as to suffer little injury from the opinion of an individual and where the blame has been warranted and deserved by the desecration of the highest powers  of the old masters i have spoken with far greater freedom but let it be remembered that only a portion of the work is now presented to the public and it must not be supposed because in that particular portion and with reference to particular excellencies i have spoken in constant depreciation that i have no feeling of other excellencies of which cognizance can only be taken in future parts of the work let me not be understood to mean more than i have said nor be made responsible for conclusions when i have only stated facts i have said that the old masters did not give the truth of nature if the reader chooses thence to infer that they were not masters at all it is his conclusion not mine  whatever i have asserted throughout the work i have endeavored to ground altogether on demonstrations which must stand or fall by their own strength and which ought to involve no more reference to authority or character than a demonstration in euclid yet it is proper for the public to know that the writer is no mere theorist but has been devoted from his youth to the laborious study of practical art  whatever has been generally affirmed of the old schools of landscapepainting is founded on familiar acquaintance with every important work of art from antwerp to naples but it would be useless where close and immediate comparison with works in our own academy is desirable to refer to the details of pictures at rome or munich and it would be impossible to speak at once with just feeling as regarded the possessor and just freedom as regarded the public of pictures in private galleries whatever particular references have been made for illustration have been therefore confined as far as was in my power to works in the national and dulwich galleries  finally i have to apologize for the imperfection of a work which i could have wished not to have executed but with years of reflection and revisal it is owing to my sense of the necessity of such revisal that only a portion of the work is now presented to the public but that portion is both complete in itself and is more peculiarly directed against the crying evil which called for instant remedy whether i ever completely fulfil my intention will partly depend upon the spirit in which the present volume is received if it be attributed to an invidious spirit or a desire for the advancement of individual interests i could hope to effect little good by farther effort if on the contrary its real feeling and intention be understood i shall shrink from no labor in the execution of a task which may tend however feebly to the advancement of the cause of real art in england and to the honor of those great living masters whom we now neglect or malign to pour our flattery into the ear of death and exalt with vain acclamation the names of those who neither demand our praise nor regard our gratitude                                                               the author                          preface to the second edition  it is allowed by the most able writers on naval and military tactics that although the attack by successive divisions absolutely requires in the attacking party such an inherent superiority in quality of force and such consciousness of that superiority as may enable his front columns or his leading ships to support themselves for a considerable period against overwhelming numbers it yet insures if maintained with constancy the most total ruin of the opposing force convinced of the truth and therefore assured of the ultimate prevalence and victory of the principles which i have advocated and equally confident that the strength of the cause must give weight to the strokes of even the weakest of its defenders i permitted myself to yield to a somewhat hasty and hotheaded desire of being at whatever risk in the thick of the fire and began the contest with a part and that the weakest and least considerable part of the forces at my disposal and i now find the volume thus boldly laid before the public in a position much resembling that of the royal sovereign at trafalgar receiving unsupported the broadsides of half the enemys fleet while unforeseen circumstances have hitherto prevented and must yet for a time prevent my heavier ships of the line from taking any part in the action i watched the first moments of the struggle with some anxiety for the solitary vesselan anxiety which i have now ceased to feelfor the flag of truth waves brightly through the smoke of the battle and my antagonists wholly intent on the destruction of the leading ship have lost their position and exposed themselves in defenceless disorder to the attack of the following columns  if however i have had no reason to regret my hasty advance as far as regards the ultimate issue of the struggle i have yet found it to occasion much misconception of the character and some diminution of the influence of the present essay for though the work has been received as only in sanguine moments i had ventured to hope though i have had the pleasure of knowing that in many instances its principles have carried with them a strength of conviction amounting to a demonstration of their truth and that even where it has had no other influence it has excited interest suggested inquiry and prompted to a just and frank comparison of art with nature yet this effect would have been greater still had not the work been supposed as it seems to have been by many readers a completed treatise containing a systematized statement of the whole of my views on the subject of modern art considered as such it surprises me that the book should have received the slightest attention for what respect could be due to a writer who pretended to criticise and classify the works of the great painters of landscape without developing or even alluding to one single principle of the beautiful or sublime so far from being a completed essay it is little more than the introduction to the mass of evidence and illustration which i have yet to bring forward it treats of nothing but the initiatory steps of art states nothing but the elementary rules of criticism touches only on merits attainable by accuracy of eye and fidelity of hand and leaves for future consideration every one of the eclectic qualities of pictures all of good that is prompted by feeling and of great that is guided by judgment and its function and scope should the less have been mistaken because i have not only most carefully arranged the subject in its commencement but have given frequent references throughout to the essays by which it is intended to be succeeded in which i shall endeavor to point out the signification and the value of those phenomena of external nature which i have been hitherto compelled to describe without reference either to their inherent beauty or to the lessons which may be derived from them  yet to prevent such misconception in future i may perhaps be excused for occupying the readers time with a fuller statement of the feelings with which the work was undertaken of its general plan and of the conclusions and positions which i hope to be able finally to deduce and maintain  nothing perhaps bears on the face of it more appearance of folly ignorance and impertinence than any attempt to diminish the honor of those to whom the assent of many generations has assigned a throne for the truly great of later times have almost without exception fostered in others the veneration of departed power which they felt themselves satisfied in all humility to take their seat at the feet of those whose honor is brightened by the hoariness of time and to wait for the period when the lustre of many departed days may accumulate on their own heads in the radiance which culminates as it recedes the envious and incompetent have usually been the leaders of attack content if like the foulness of the earth they may attract to themselves notice by their noisomeness or like its insects exalt themselves by virulence into visibility while however the envy of the vicious and the insolence of the ignorant are occasionally shown in their nakedness by futile efforts to degrade the dead it is worthy of consideration whether they may not more frequently escape detection in successful efforts to degrade the livingwhether the very same malice may not be gratified the very same incompetence demonstrated in the unjust lowering of present greatness and the unjust exaltation of a perished power as if exerted and manifested in a less safe direction would have classed the critic with nero and caligula with zoilus and perrault be it remembered that the spirit of detraction is detected only when unsuccessful and receives least punishment where it effects the greatest injury and it cannot but be felt that there is as much danger that the rising of new stars should be concealed by the mists which are unseen as that those throned in heaven should be darkened by the clouds which are visible  there is i fear so much malice in the hearts of most men that they are chiefly jealous of that praise which can give the greatest pleasure and are then most liberal of eulogium when it can no longer be enjoyed they grudge not the whiteness of the sepulchre because by no honor they can bestow upon it can the senseless corpse be rendered an object of envy but they are niggardly of the reputation which contributes to happiness or advances to fortune they are glad to obtain credit for generosity and humility by exalting those who are beyond the reach of praise and thus to escape the more painful necessity of doing homage to a living rival they are rejoiced to set up a standard of imaginary excellence which may enable them by insisting on the inferiority of a contemporary work to the things that have been to withdraw the attention from its superiority to the things that are the same undercurrent of jealousy operates in our reception of animadversion men have commonly more pleasure in the criticism which hurts than in that which is innocuous and are more tolerant of the severity which breaks hearts and ruins fortunes than of that which falls impotently on the grave  and thus well says the good and deepminded richard hooker to the best and wisest while they live the world is continually a froward opposite and a curious observer of their defects and imperfections their virtues afterwards it as much admireth and for this cause many times that which deserveth admiration would hardly be able to find favor if they which propose it were not content to profess themselves therein scholars and followers of the ancient for the world will not endure to hear that we are wiser than any have been which went beforebook v ch vii 3 he therefore who would maintain the cause of contemporary excellence against that of elder time must have almost every class of men arrayed against him the generous because they would not find matter of accusation against established dignities the envious because they like not the sound of a living mans praise the wise because they prefer the opinion of centuries to that of days and the foolish because they are incapable of forming an opinion of their own obloquy so universal is not lightly to be risked and the few who make an effort to stem the torrent as it is made commonly in favor of their own works deserve the contempt which is their only reward nor is this to be regretted in its influence on the progress and preservation of things technical and communicable respect for the ancients is the salvation of art though it sometimes blinds us to its ends it increases the power of the painter though it diminishes his liberty and if it be sometimes an incumbrance to the essays of invention it is oftener a protection from the consequences of audacity the whole system and discipline of art the collected results of the experience of ages might but for the fixed authority of antiquity be swept away by the rage of fashion or lost in the glare of novelty and the knowledge which it had taken centuries to accumulate the principles which mighty minds had arrived at only in dying might be overthrown by the frenzy of a faction and abandoned in the insolence of an hour  neither in its general application is the persuasion of the superiority of former works less just than useful the greater number of them are and must be immeasurably nobler than any of the results of present effort because that which is best of the productions of four thousand years must necessarily be in its accumulation beyond all rivalry from the works of any given generation but it should always be remembered that it is improbable that many and impossible that all of such works though the greatest yet produced should approach abstract perfection that there is certainly something left for us to carry farther or complete that any given generation has just the same chance of producing some individual mind of firstrate calibre as any of its predecessors and that if such a mind should arise the chances are that with the assistance of experience and example it would in its particular and chosen path do greater things than had been before done  we must therefore be cautious not to lose sight of the real use of what has been left us by antiquity nor to take that for a model of perfection which is in many cases only a guide to it the picture which is looked to for an interpretation of nature is invaluable but the picture which is taken as a substitute for nature had better be burned and the young artist while he should shrink with horror from the iconoclast who would tear from him every landmark and light which has been bequeathed him by the ancients and leave him in a liberated childhood may be equally certain of being betrayed by those who would give him the power and the knowledge of past time and then fetter his strength from all advance and bend his eyes backward on a beaten pathwho would thrust canvas between him and the sky and tradition between him and god  and such conventional teaching is the more to be dreaded because all that is highest in art all that is creative and imaginative is formed and created by every great master for himself and cannot be repeated or imitated by others we judge of the excellence of a rising writer not so much by the resemblance of his works to what has been done before as by their difference from it and while we advise him in his first trials of strength to set certain models before him with respect to inferior pointsone for versification another for arrangement another for treatmentwe yet admit not his greatness until he has broken away from all his models and struck forth versification arrangement and treatment of his own  three points therefore i would especially insist upon as necessary to be kept in mind in all criticism of modern art first that there are few very few of even the best productions of antiquity which are not visibly and palpably imperfect in some kind or way and conceivably improvable by farther study that every nation perhaps every generation has in all probability some peculiar gift some particular character of mind enabling it to do something different from or something in some sort better than what has been before done and that therefore unless art be a trick or a manufacture of which the secrets are lost the greatest minds of existing nations if exerted with the same industry passion and honest aim as those of past time have a chance in their particular walk of doing something as great or taking the advantage of former example into account even greater and better it is difficult to conceive by what laws of logic some of the reviewers of the following essay have construed its first sentence into a denial of this principlea denial such as their own conventional and shallow criticism of modern works invariably implies i have said that nothing has been for centuries consecrated by public admiration without possessing in a high degree some species of sterling excellence does it thence follow that it possesses in the highest degree every species of sterling excellence yet thus says the sapient reviewer he admits the fact against which he mainly arguesnamely the superiority of these timehonored productions as if the possession of an abstract excellence of some kind necessarily implied the possession of an incomparable excellence of every kind there are few works of man so perfect as to admit of no conception of their being excelledathere are thousands which have been for centuries and will be for centuries more consecrated by public admiration which are yet imperfect in many respects and have been excelled and may be excelled again do my opponents mean to assert that nothing good can ever be bettered and that what is best of past time is necessarily best of all time perugino i suppose possessed some species of sterling excellence but perugino was excelled by raffaelle and so claude possesses some species of sterling excellence but it follows not that he may not be excelled by turner  the second point on which i would insist is that if a mind were to arise of such power as to be capable of equalling or excelling some of the greatest works of past ages the productions of such a mind would in all probability be totally different in manner and matter from all former productions for the more powerful the intellect the less will its works resemble those of other men whether predecessors or contemporaries instead of reasoning therefore as we commonly do in matters of art that because such and such a work does not resemble that which has hitherto been a canon therefore it must be inferior and wrong in principle let us rather admit that there is in its very dissimilarity an increased chance of its being itself a new and perhaps a higher canon if any production of modern art can be shown to have the authority of nature on its side and to be based on eternal truths it is all so much more in its favor so much farther proof of its power that it is totally different from all that have been before seenb  the third point on which i would insist is that if such a mind were to arise it would necessarily divide the world of criticism into two factions the one necessarily the largest and loudest composed of men incapable of judging except by precedent ignorant of general truth and acquainted only with such particular truths as may have been illustrated or pointed out to them by former works which class would of course be violent in vituperation and increase in animosity as the master departed farther from their particular and preconceived canons of rightthus wounding their vanity by impugning their judgment the other necessarily narrow of number composed of men of general knowledge and unbiassed habits of thought who would recognize in the work of the daring innovator a record and illustration of facts before unseized who would justly and candidly estimate the value of the truths so rendered and would increase in fervor of admiration as the master strode farther and deeper and more daringly into dominions before unsearched or unknown yet diminishing in multitude as they increased in enthusiasm for by how much their leader became more impatient in his stepmore impetuous in his successmore exalted in his research by so much must the number capable of following him become narrower until at last supposing him never to pause in his advance he might be left in the very culminating moment of his consummate achievement with but a faithful few by his side his former disciples fallen away his former enemies doubled in numbers and virulence and the evidence of his supremacy only to be wrought out by the devotion of mens lives to the earnest study of the new truths he had discovered and recorded  such a mind has arisen in our days it has gone on from strength to strength laying open fields of conquest peculiar to itself it has occasioned such schism in the schools of criticism as was beforehand to be expected and it is now at the zenith of its power and consequently in the last phase of declining popularity  this i know and can prove no man says southey was ever yet convinced of any momentous truth without feeling in himself the power as well as the desire of communicating it in asserting and demonstrating the supremacy of this great master i shall both do immediate service to the cause of right art and shall be able to illustrate many principles of landscape painting which are of general application and have hitherto been unacknowledged  for anything like immediate effect on the public mind i do not hope we mistake mens diseases says richard baxter when we think there needeth nothing to cure them of their errors but the evidence of truth alas there are many distempers of mind to be removed before they receive that evidence nevertheless when it is fully laid before them my duty will be done conviction will follow in due time i do not consider myself as in any way addressing or having to do with the ordinary critics of the press their writings are not the guide but the expression of public opinion a writer for a newspaper naturally and necessarily endeavors to meet as nearly as he can the feelings of the majority of his readers his bread depends on his doing so precluded by the nature of his occupations from gaining any knowledge of art he is sure that he can gain credit for it by expressing the opinions of his readers he mocks the picture which the public pass and bespatters with praise the canvas which a crowd concealed from him  writers like the present critic of blackwoods magazinec deserve more respectthe respect due to honest hopeless helpless imbecility there is something exalted in the innocence of their feeblemindedness one cannot suspect them of partiality for it implies feeling nor of prejudice for it implies some previous acquaintance with their subject i do not know that even in this age of charlatanry i could point to a more barefaced instance of imposture on the simplicity of the public than the insertion of these pieces of criticism in a respectable periodical we are not insulted with opinions on music from persons ignorant of its notes nor with treatises on philology by persons unacquainted with the alphabet but here is page after page of criticism which one may read from end to end looking for something which the writer knows and finding nothing not his own language for he has to look in his dictionary by his own confession for a wordd occurring in one of the most important chapters of his bible not the commonest traditions of the schools for he does not know why poussin was called learnede not the most simple canons of art for he prefers lee to gainsboroughf not the most ordinary facts of nature for we find him puzzled by the epithet silver as applied to the orange blossomevidently never having seen anything silvery about an orange in his life except a spoon nay he leaves us not to conjecture his calibre from internal evidence he candidly tells us oct 1842 that he has been studying trees only for the last week and bases his critical remarks chiefly on his practical experience of birch more disinterested than our friend sancho he would disenchant the public from the magic of turner by virtue of his own flagellation xanthiaslike he would rob his master of immortality by his own powers of endurance what is christopher north about does he receive his critiques from eaton or harrowbased on the experience of a weeks birdsnesting and its consequences how low must art and its interests sink when the public mind is inadequate to the detection of this effrontery of incapacity in all kindness to maga we warn her that though the nature of this work precludes us from devoting space to the exposure there may come a time when the public shall be themselves able to distinguish ribaldry from reasoning and may require some better and higher qualifications in their critics of art than the experience of a schoolboy and the capacities of a buffoon  it is not however merely to vindicate the reputation of those whom writers like these defame which would but be to anticipate by a few years the natural and inevitable reaction of the public mind that i am devoting years of labor to the development of the principles on which the great productions of recent art are based i have a higher end in viewone which may i think justify me not only in the sacrifice of my own time but in calling on my readers to follow me through an investigation far more laborious than could be adequately rewarded by mere insight into the merits of a particular master or the spirit of a particular age  it is a question which in spite of the claims of painting to be called the sister of poetry appears to me to admit of considerable doubt whether art has ever except in its earliest and rudest stages possessed anything like efficient moral influence on mankind better the state of rome when magnorum artificum frangebat pocula miles ut phaleris gauderet equus than when her walls flashed with the marble and the gold nec cessabat luxuria id agere ut quam plurimum incendiis perdat better the state of religion in italy before giotto had broken on one barbarism of the byzantine schools than when the painter of the last judgment and the sculptor of the perseus sat revelling side by side it appears to me that a rude symbol is oftener more efficient than a refined one in touching the heart and that as pictures rise in rank as works of art they are regarded with less devotion and more curiosity  but however this may be and whatever influence we may be disposed to admit in the great works of sacred art no doubt can i think be reasonably entertained as to the utter inutility of all that has been hitherto accomplished by the painters of landscape no moral end has been answered no permanent good effected by any of their works they may have amused the intellect or exercised the ingenuity but they never have spoken to the heart landscape art has never taught us one deep or holy lesson it has not recorded that which is fleeting nor penetrated that which was hidden nor interpreted that which was obscure it has never made us feel the wonder nor the power nor the glory of the universe it has not prompted to devotion nor touched with awe its power to move and exalt the heart has been fatally abused and perished in the abusing that which ought to have been a witness to the omnipotence of god has become an exhibition of the dexterity of man and that which should have lifted our thoughts to the throne of the deity has encumbered them with the inventions of his creatures  if we stand for a little time before any of the more celebrated works of landscape listening to the comments of the passersby we shall hear numberless expressions relating to the skill of the artist but very few relating to the perfection of nature hundreds will be voluble in admiration for one who will be silent in delight multitudes will laud the composition and depart with the praise of claude on their lipsnot one will feel as if it were no composition and depart with the praise of god in his heart  these are the signs of a debased mistaken and false school of painting the skill of the artist and the perfection of his art are never proved until both are forgotten the artist has done nothing till he has concealed himselfthe art is imperfect which is visiblethe feelings are but feebly touched if they permit us to reason on the methods of their excitement in the reading of a great poem in the hearing of a noble oration it is the subject of the writer and not his skillhis passion not his power on which our minds are fixed we see as he sees but we see not him we become part of him feel with him judge behold with him but we think of him as little as of ourselves do we think of Æschylus while we wait on the silence of cassandrag or of shakspeare while we listen to the wailing of lear not so the power of the masters is shown by their selfannihilation it is commensurate with the degree in which they themselves appear not in their work the harp of the minstrel is untruly touched if his own glory is all that it records every great writer may be at once known by his guiding the mind far from himself to the beauty which is not of his creation and the knowledge which is past his finding out  and must it ever be otherwise with painting for otherwise it has ever been her subjects have been regarded as mere themes on which the artists power is to be displayed and that power be it of imitation composition idealization or of whatever other kind is the chief object of the spectators observation it is man and his fancies man and his trickeries man and his inventionspoor paltry weak selfsighted manwhich the connoisseur forever seeks and worships among potsherds and dunghills among drunken boors and withered beldames through every scene of debauchery and degradation we follow the erring artist not to receive one wholesome lesson not to be touched with pity nor moved with indignation but to watch the dexterity of the pencil and gloat over the glittering of the hue  i speak not only of the works of the flemish schooli wage no war with their admirers they may be left in peace to count the spiculæ of haystacks and the hairs of donkeysit is also of works of real mind that i speakworks in which there are evidences of genius and workings of powerworks which have been held up as containing all of the beautiful that art can reach or man conceive and i assert with sorrow that all hitherto done in landscape by those commonly conceived its masters has never prompted one holy thought in the minds of nations it has begun and ended in exhibiting the dexterities of individuals and conventionalities of systems filling the world with the honor of claude and salvator it has never once tended to the honor of god  does the reader start in reading these last words as if they were those of wild enthusiasmas if i were lowering the dignity of religion by supposing that its cause could be advanced by such means his surprise proves my position it does sound like wild like absurd enthusiasm to expect any definite moral agency in the painters of landscape but ought it so to sound are the gorgeousness of the visible hue the glory of the realized form instruments in the artists hand so ineffective that they can answer no nobler purpose than the amusement of curiosity or the engagement of idleness must it not be owing to gross neglect or misapplication of the means at his command that while words and tones means of representing nature surely less powerful than lines and colors can kindle and purify the very inmost souls of men the painter can only hope to entertain by his efforts at expression and must remain forever brooding over his incommunicable thoughts  the cause of the evil lies i believe deepseated in the system of ancient landscape art it consists in a word in the painters taking upon him to modify gods works at his pleasure casting the shadow of himself on all he sees constituting himself arbiter where it is honor to be a disciple and exhibiting his ingenuity by the attainment of combinations whose highest praise is that they are impossible we shall not pass through a single gallery of old art without hearing this topic of praise confidently advanced the sense of artificialness the absence of all appearance of reality the clumsiness of combination by which the meddling of man is made evident and the feebleness of his hand branded on the inorganization of his monstrous creature is advanced as a proof of inventive power as an evidence of abstracted conceptionnay the violation of specific form the utter abandonment of all organic and individual character of object numberless examples of which from the works of the old masters are given in the following pages is constantly held up by the unthinking critic as the foundation of the grand or historical style and the first step to the attainment of a pure ideal now there is but one grand style in the treatment of all subjects whatsoever and that style is based on the perfect knowledge and consists in the simple unencumbered rendering of the specific characters of the given object be it man beast or flower every change caricature or abandonment of such specific character is as destructive of grandeur as it is of truth of beauty as of propriety every alteration of the features of nature has its origin either in powerless indolence or blind audacity in the folly which forgets or the insolence which desecrates works which it is the pride of angels to know and their privilege to love  we sometimes hear such infringement of universal laws justified on the plea that the frequent introduction of mythological abstractions into ancient landscape requires an imaginary character of form in the material objects with which they are associated something of this kind is hinted in reynoldss 14th discourse but nothing can be more false than such reasoning if there be any truth or beauty in the original conception of the spiritual being so introduced there must be a true and real connection between that abstract ideah and the features of nature as she was and is the woods and waters which were peopled by the greek with typical life were not different from those which now wave and murmur by the ruins of his shrines with their visible and actual forms was his imagination filled and the beauty of its incarnate creatures can only be understood among the pure realities which originally modelled their conception if divinity be stamped upon the features or apparent in the form of the spiritual creature the mind will not be shocked by its appearing to ride upon the whirlwind and trample on the storm but if mortality no violation of the characters of the earth will forge one single link to bind it to the heaven  is there then no such thing as elevated ideal character of landscape undoubtedly and sir joshua with the great master of this character nicolo poussin present to his thoughts ought to have arrived at more true conclusions respecting its essence than as we shall presently see are deducible from his works the true ideal of landscape is precisely the same as that of the human form it is the expression of the specificnot the individual but the specificcharacters of every object in their perfection there is an ideal form of every herb flower and tree it is that form to which every individual of the species has a tendency to arrive freed from the influence of accident or disease every landscape painter should know the specific characters of every object he has to represent rock flower or cloud and in his highest ideal works all their distinctions will be perfectly expressed broadly or delicately slightly or completely according to the nature of the subject and the degree of attention which is to be drawn to the particular object by the part it plays in the composition where the sublime is aimed at such distinctions will be indicated with severe simplicity as the muscular markings in a colossal statue where beauty is the object they must be expressed with the utmost refinement of which the hand is capable  this may sound like a contradiction of principles advanced by the highest authorities but it is only a contradiction of a particular and most mistaken application of them much evil has been done to art by the remarks of historical painters on landscape accustomed themselves to treat their backgrounds slightly and boldly and feeling though as i shall presently show only in consequence of their own deficient powers that any approach to completeness of detail therein injures their picture by interfering with its principal subject they naturally lose sight of the peculiar and intrinsic beauties of things which to them are injurious unless subordinate hence the frequent advice given by reynolds and others to neglect specific form in landscape and treat its materials in large masses aiming only at general truthsthe flexibility of foliage but not its kind the rigidity of rock but not its mineral character in the passage more especially bearing on this subject in the eleventh lecture of sir j reynolds we are told that the landscape painter works not for the virtuoso or the naturalist but for the general observer of life and nature this is true in precisely the same sense that the sculptor does not work for the anatomist but for the common observer of life and nature yet the sculptor is not for this reason permitted to be wanting either in knowledge or expression of anatomical detail and the more refined that expression can be rendered the more perfect is his work that which to the anatomist is the endis to the sculptor the means the former desires details for their own sake the latter that by means of them he may kindle his work with life and stamp it with beauty and so in landscapebotanical or geological details are not to be given as matter of curiosity or subject of search but as the ultimate elements of every species of expression and order of loveliness  in his observations on the foreground of the st pietro martire sir joshua advances as matter of praise that the plants are discriminated just as much as was necessary for variety and no more had this foreground been occupied by a group of animals we should have been surprised to be told that the lion the serpent and the dove or whatever other creatures might have been introduced were distinguished from each other just as much as was necessary for variety and no more yet is it to be supposed that the distinctions of the vegetable world are less complete less essential or less divine in origin than those of the animal if the distinctive forms of animal life are meant for our reverent observance is it likely that those of vegetable life are made merely to be swept away the latter are indeed less obvious and less obtrusive for which very reason there is less excuse for omitting them because there is less danger of their disturbing the attention or engaging the fancy  but sir joshua is as inaccurate in fact as false in principle he himself furnishes a most singular instance of the very error of which he accuses vasenithe seeing what he expects or rather in the present case not seeing what he does not expect the great masters of italy almost without exception and titian perhaps more than any for he had the highest knowledge of landscape are in the constant habit of rendering every detail of their foregrounds with the most laborious botanical fidelity witness the bacchus and ariadne in which the foreground is occupied by the common blue iris the aquilegia and the wild rose every stamen of which latter is given while the blossoms and leaves of the columbine a difficult flower to draw have been studied with the most exquisite accuracy the foregrounds of raffaelles two cartoonsthe miraculous draught of fishes and the charge to peterare covered with plants of the common sea colewort crambe maritima of which the sinuated leaves and clustered blossoms would have exhausted the patience of any other artist but have appeared worthy of prolonged and thoughtful labor to the great mind of raffaelle  it appears then not only from natural principles but from the highest of all authority that thorough knowledge of the lowest details is necessary and full expression of them right even in the highest class of historical painting that it will not take away from nor interfere with the interest of the figures but rightly managed must add to and elucidate it and if further proof be wanting i would desire the reader to compare the background of sir joshuas holy family in the national gallery with that of nicolo poussins nursing of jupiter in the dulwich gallery the first owing to the utter neglect of all botanical detail has lost every atom of ideal character and reminds us of nothing but an english fashionable flower gardenthe formal pedestal adding considerably to the effect poussins in which every vine leaf is drawn with consummate skill and untiring diligence produces not only a tree group of the most perfect grace and beauty but one which in its pure and simple truth belongs to every age of nature and adapts itself to the history of all time if then such entire rendering of specific character be necessary to the historical painter in cases where these lower details are entirely subordinate to his human subject how much more must it be necessary in landscape where they themselves constitute the subject and where the undivided attention is to be drawn to them  there is a singular sense in which the child may peculiarly be said to be father of the man in many arts and attainments the first and last stages of progressthe infancy and the consummationhave many features in common while the intermediate stages are wholly unlike either and are farthest from the right thus it is in the progress of a painters handling we see the perfect childthe absolute beginner using of necessity a broken imperfect inadequate line which as he advances becomes gradually firm severe and decided yet before he becomes a perfect artist this severity and decision will again be exchanged for a light and careless stroke which in many points will far more resemble that of his childhood than of his middle agediffering from it only by the consummate effect wrought out by the apparently inadequate means so it is in many matters of opinion our first and last coincide though on different grounds it is the middle stage which is farthest from the truth childhood often holds a truth with its feeble fingers which the grasp of manhood cannot retainwhich it is the pride of utmost age to recover  perhaps this is in no instance more remarkable than in the opinion we form upon the subject of detail in works of art infants in judgment we look for specific character and complete finishwe delight in the faithful plumage of the wellknown birdin the finely drawn leafage of the discriminated flower as we advance in judgment we scorn such detail altogether we look for impetuosity of execution and breadth of effect but perfected in judgment we return in a great measure to our early feelings and thank raffaelle for the shells upon his sacred beach and for the delicate stamens of the herbage beside his inspired st catherinei  of those who take interest in art nay even of artists themselves there are an hundred in the middle stage of judgment for one who is in the last and this not because they are destitute of the power to discover or the sensibility to enjoy the truth but because the truth bears so much semblance of errorthe last stage of the journey to the firstthat every feeling which guides to it is checked in its origin the rapid and powerful artist necessarily looks with such contempt on those who seek minutiæ of detail rather than grandeur of impression that it is almost impossible for him to conceive of the great last step in art by which both become compatible he has so often to dash the delicacy out of the pupils work and to blot the details from his encumbered canvas so frequently to lament the loss of breadth and unity and so seldom to reprehend the imperfection of minutiæ that he necessarily looks upon complete parts as the very sign of error weakness and ignorance thus frequently to the latest period of his life he separates like sir joshua as chief enemies the details and the whole which an artist cannot be great unless he reconciles and because details alone and unreferred to a final purpose are the sign of a tyros work he loses sight of the remoter truth that details perfect in unity and contributing to a final purpose are the sign of the production of a consummate master  it is not therefore detail sought for its own sakenot the calculable bricks of the dutch housepainters nor the numbered hairs and mapped wrinkles of denner which constitute great artthey are the lowest and most contemptible art but it is detail referred to a great endsought for the sake of the inestimable beauty which exists in the slightest and least of gods works and treated in a manly broad and impressive manner there may be as much greatness of mind as much nobility of manner in a masters treatment of the smallest features as in his management of the most vast and this greatness of manner chiefly consists in seizing the specific character of the object together with all the great qualities of beauty which it has in common with higher orders of existencej while he utterly rejects the meaner beauties which are accidentally peculiar to the object and yet not specifically characteristic of it i cannot give a better instance than the painting of the flowers in titians picture above mentioned while every stamen of the rose is given because this was necessary to mark the flower and while the curves and large characters of the leaves are rendered with exquisite fidelity there is no vestige of particular texture of moss bloom moisture or any other accidentno dewdrops nor flies nor trickeries of any kind nothing beyond the simple forms and hues of the flowerseven those hues themselves being simplified and broadly rendered the varieties of aquilegia have in reality a grayish and uncertain tone of color and i believe never attain the intense purity of blue with which titian has gifted his flower but the master does not aim at the particular color of individual blossoms he seizes the type of all and gives it with the utmost purity and simplicity of which color is capable  these laws being observed it will not only be in the power it will be the dutythe imperative dutyof the landscape painter to descend to the lowest details with undiminished attention every herb and flower of the field has its specific distinct and perfect beauty it has its peculiar habitation expression and function the highest art is that which seizes this specific character which develops and illustrates it which assigns to it its proper position in the landscape and which by means of it enhances and enforces the great impression which the picture is intended to convey nor is it of herbs and flowers alone that such scientific representation is required every class of rock every kind of earth every form of cloud must be studied with equal industry and rendered with equal precision and thus we find ourselves unavoidably led to a conclusion directly opposed to that constantly enunciated dogma of the parrotcritic that the features of nature must be generalizeda dogma whose inherent and broad absurdity would long ago have been detected if it had not contained in its convenient falsehood an apology for indolence and a disguise for incapacity generalized as if it were possible to generalize things generically different of such common cant of criticism i extract a characteristic passage from one of the reviews of this work that in this years athenæum for february 10th he the author would have geological landscape painters dendrologic meteorologic and doubtless entomologic ichthyologic every kind of physiologic painter united in the same person yet alas for true poetic art among all these learned thebans no landscape painting must not be reduced to mere portraiture of inanimate substances dennerlike portraiture of the earths face           ancient landscapists took a broader deeper higher view of their art they neglected particular traits and gave only general features thus they attained mass and force harmonious union and simple effect the elements of grandeur and beauty  to all such criticism as this and i notice it only because it expresses the feelings into which many sensible and thoughtful minds have been fashioned by infection the answer is simple and straightforward it is just as impossible to generalize granite and slate as it is to generalize a man and a cow an animal must be either one animal or another animal it cannot be a general animal or it is no animal and so a rock must be either one rock or another rock it cannot be a general rock or it is no rock if there were a creature in the foreground of a picture of which he could not decide whether it were a pony or a pig the athenæum critic would perhaps affirm it to be a generalization of pony and pig and consequently a high example of harmonious union and simple effect but i should call it simple bad drawing and so when there are things in the foreground of salvator of which i cannot pronounce whether they be granite or slate or tufa i affirm that there is in them neither harmonious union nor simple effect but simple monstrosity there is no grandeur no beauty of any sort or kind nothing but destruction disorganization and ruin to be obtained by the violation of natural distinctions the elements of brutes can only mix in corruption the elements of inorganic nature only in annihilation we may if we choose put together centaur monsters but they must still be half man half horse they cannot be both man and horse nor either man or horse and so if landscape painters choose they may give us rocks which shall be half granite and half slate but they cannot give us rocks which shall be either granite or slate nor which shall be both granite and slate every attempt to produce that which shall be any rock ends in the production of that which is no rock  it is true that the distinctions of rocks and plants and clouds are less conspicuous and less constantly subjects of observation than those of the animal creation but the difficulty of observing them proves not the merit of overlooking them it only accounts for the singular fact that the world has never yet seen anything like a perfect school of landscape for just as the highest historical painting is based on perfect knowledge of the workings of the human form and human mind so must the highest landscape painting be based on perfect cognizance of the form functions and system of every organic or definitely structured existence which it has to represent this proposition is selfevident to every thinking mind and every principle which appears to contradict it is either misstated or misunderstood for instance the athenæum critic calls the right statement of generic difference dennerlike portraiture if he can find anything like denner in what i have advanced as the utmost perfection of landscape artthe recent works of turnerhe is welcome to his discovery and his theory no dennerlike portraiture would be the endeavor to paint the separate crystals of quartz and felspar in the granite and the separate flakes of mica in the mica slatean attempt just as far removed from what i assert to be great art the bold rendering of the generic characters of form in both rocks as modern sculpture of lace and buttonholes is from the elgin marbles martin has attempted this dennerlike portraiture of seafoam with the assistance of an acre of canvaswith what success i believe the critics of his last years canute had for once sense enough to decide  again it does not follow that because such accurate knowledge is necessary to the painter that it should constitute the painter nor that such knowledge is valuable in itself and without reference to high ends every kind of knowledge may be sought from ignoble motives and for ignoble ends and in those who so possess it it is ignoble knowledge while the very same knowledge is in another mind an attainment of the highest dignity and conveying the greatest blessing this is the difference between the mere botanists knowledge of plants and the great poets or painters knowledge of them the one notes their distinctions for the sake of swelling his herbarium the other that he may render them vehicles of expression and emotion the one counts the stamens and affixes a name and is content the other observes every character of the plants color and form considering each of its attributes as an element of expression he seizes on its lines of grace or energy rigidity or repose notes the feebleness or the vigor the serenity or tremulousness of its hues observes its local habits its love or fear of peculiar places its nourishment or destruction by particular influences he associates it in his mind with all the features of the situations it inhabits and the ministering agencies necessary to its support thenceforward the flower is to him a living creature with histories written on its leaves and passions breathing in its motion its occurrence in his picture is no mere point of color no meaningless spark of light it is a voice rising from the eartha new chord of the minds musica necessary note in the harmony of his picture contributing alike to its tenderness and its dignity nor less to its loveliness than its truth  the particularization of flowers by shakspeare and shelley affords us the most frequent examples of the exalted use of these inferior details it is true that the painter has not the same power of expressing the thoughts with which his symbols are connected he is dependent in some degree on the knowledge and feeling of the spectator but by the destruction of such details his foreground is not rendered more intelligible to the ignorant although it ceases to have interest for the informed it is no excuse for illegible writing that there are persons who could not have read it had it been plain  i repeat then generalization as the word is commonly understood is the act of a vulgar incapable and unthinking mind to see in all mountains nothing but similar heaps of earth in all rocks nothing but similar concretions of solid matter in all trees nothing but similar accumulations of leaves is no sign of high feeling or extended thought the more we know and the more we feel the more we separate we separate to obtain a more perfect unity stones in the thoughts of the peasant lie as they do on his field one is like another and there is no connection between any of them the geologist distinguishes and in distinguishing connects them each becomes different from its fellow but in differing from assumes a relation to its fellow they are no more each the repetition of the otherthey are parts of a system and each implies and is connected with the existence of the rest that generalization then is right true and noble which is based on the knowledge of the distinctions and observance of the relations of individual kinds that generalization is wrong false and contemptible which is based on ignorance of the one and disturbance of the other it is indeed no generalization but confusion and chaos it is the generalization of a defeated army into indistinguishable impotencethe generalization of the elements of a dead carcass into dust  let us then without farther notice of the dogmata of the schools of art follow forth those conclusions to which we are led by observance of the laws of nature  i have just said that every class of rock earth and cloud must be known by the painter with geologic and meteorologic accuracyk nor is this merely for the sake of obtaining the character of these minor features themselves but more especially for the sake of reaching that simple earnest and consistent character which is visible in the whole effect of every natural landscape every geological formation has features entirely peculiar to itself definite lines of fracture giving rise to fixed resultant forms of rock and earth peculiar vegetable products among which still farther distinctions are wrought out by variations of climate and elevation from such modifying circumstances arise the infinite varieties of the orders of landscape of which each one shows perfect harmony among its several features and possesses an ideal beauty of its own a beauty not distinguished merely by such peculiarities as are wrought on the human form by change of climate but by generic differences the most marked and essential so that its classes cannot be generalized or amalgamated by any expedients whatsoever the level marshes and rich meadows of the tertiary the rounded swells and short pastures of the chalk the squarebuilt cliffs and cloven dells of the lower limestone the soaring peaks and ridgy precipices of the primaries having nothing in common among themnothing which is not distinctive and incommunicable their very atmospheres are differenttheir clouds are differenttheir humors of storm and sunshine are differenttheir flowers animals and forests are different by each order of landscapeand its orders i repeat are infinite in number corresponding not only to the several species of rock but to the particular circumstances of the rocks deposition or after treatment and to the incalculable varieties of climate aspect and human interferenceby each order of landscape i say peculiar lessons are intended to be taught and distinct pleasures to be conveyed and it is as utterly futile to talk of generalizing their impressions into an ideal landscape as to talk of amalgamating all nourishment into one ideal food gathering all music into one ideal movement or confounding all thought into one ideal idea  there is however such a thing as composition of different orders of landscape though there can be no generalization of them nature herself perpetually brings together elements of various expression her barren rocks stoop through wooded promontories to the plain and the wreaths of the vine show through their green shadows the wan light of unperishing snow  the painter therefore has the choice of either working out the isolated character of some one distinct class of scene or of bringing together a multitude of different elements which may adorn each other by contrast  i believe that the simple and uncombined landscape if wrought out with due attention to the ideal beauty of the features it includes will always be the most powerful in its appeal to the heart contrast increases the splendor of beauty but it disturbs its influence it adds to its attractiveness but diminishes its power on this subject i shall have much to say hereafter at present i merely wish to suggest the possibility that the singleminded painter who is working out on broad and simple principles a piece of unbroken harmonious landscape character may be reaching an end in art quite as high as the more ambitious student who is always within five minutes walk of everywhere making the ends of the earth contribute to his pictorial guazzettol and the certainty that unless the composition of the latter be regulated by severe judgment and its members connected by natural links it must become more contemptible in its motley than an honest study of roadside weeds  let me at the risk of tediously repeating what is universally known refer to the common principles of historical composition in order that i may show their application to that of landscape the merest tyro in art knows that every figure which is unnecessary to his picture is an encumbrance to it and that every figure which does not sympathize with the action interrupts it he that gathereth not with me scatterethis or ought to be the ruling principle of his plan and the power and grandeur of his result will be exactly proportioned to the unity of feeling manifested in its several parts and to the propriety and simplicity of the relations in which they stand to each other  all this is equally applicable to the materials of inanimate nature impressiveness is destroyed by a multitude of contradictory facts and the accumulation which is not harmonious is discordant he who endeavors to unite simplicity with magnificence to guide from solitude to festivity and to contrast melancholy with mirth must end by the production of confused inanity there is a peculiar spirit possessed by every kind of scene and although a point of contrast may sometimes enhance and exhibit this particular feeling more intensely it must be only a point not an equalized opposition every introduction of new and different feeling weakens the force of what has already been impressed and the mingling of all emotions must conclude in apathy as the mingling of all colors in white  let us test by these simple rules one of the ideal landscape compositions of claude that known to the italians as il mulino  the foreground is a piece of very lovely and perfect forest scenery with a dance of peasants by a brookside quite enough subject to form in the hands of a master an impressive and complete picture on the other side of the brook however we have a piece of pastoral life a man with some bulls and goats tumbling headforemost into the water owing to some sudden paralytic affection of all their legs even this group is one too many the shepherd had no business to drive his flock so near the dancers and the dancers will certainly frighten the cattle but when we look farther into the picture our feelings receive a sudden and violent shock by the unexpected appearance amidst things pastoral and musical of the military a number of roman soldiers riding in on hobbyhorses with a leader on foot apparently encouraging them to make an immediate and decisive charge on the musicians beyond the soldiers is a circular temple in exceedingly bad repair and close beside it built against its very walls a neat watermill in full work by the mill flows a large river with a weir all across it the weir has not been made for the mill for that receives its water from the hills by a trough carried over the temple but it is particularly ugly and monotonous in its line of fall and the water below forms a deadlooking pond on which some people are fishing in punts the banks of this river resemble in contour the later geological formations around london constituted chiefly of broken pots and oystershells at an inconvenient distance from the waterside stands a city composed of twentyfive round towers and a pyramid beyond the city is a handsome bridge beyond the bridge part of the campagna with fragments of aqueducts beyond the campagna the chain of the alps on the left the cascades of tivoli  this is i believe a fair example of what is commonly called an ideal landscape ie a group of the artists studies from nature individually spoiled selected with such opposition of character as may insure their neutralizing each others effect and united with sufficient unnaturalness and violence of association to insure their producing a general sensation of the impossible let us analyze the separate subjects a little in this ideal work of claudes  perhaps there is no more impressive scene on earth than the solitary extent of the campagna of rome under evening light let the reader imagine himself for a moment withdrawn from the sounds and motion of the living world and sent forth alone into this wild and wasted plain the earth yields and crumbles beneath his foot tread he never so lightly for its substance is white hollow and carious like the dusty wreck of the bones of menm the long knotted grass waves and tosses feebly in the evening wind and the shadows of its motion shake feverishly along the banks of ruin that lift themselves to the sunlight hillocks of mouldering earth heave around him as if the dead beneath were struggling in their sleep scattered blocks of black stone foursquare remnants of mighty edifices not one left upon another lie upon them to keep them down a dull purple poisonous haze stretches level along the desert veiling its spectral wrecks of massy ruins on whose rents the red light rests like dying fire on defiled altars the blue ridge of the alban mount lifts itself against a solemn space of green clear quiet sky watchtowers of dark clouds stand steadfastly along the promontories of the apennines from the plain to the mountains the shattered aqueducts pier beyond pier melt into the darkness like shadowy and countless troops of funeral mourners passing from a nations grave  let us with claude make a few ideal alterations in this landscape first we will reduce the multitudinous precipices of the apennines to four sugarloaves secondly we will remove the alban mount and put a large dustheap in its stead next we will knock down the greater part of the aqueducts and leave only an arch or two that their infinity of length may no longer be painful from its monotony for the purple mist and declining sun we will substitute a bright blue sky with round white clouds finally we will get rid of the unpleasant ruins in the foreground we will plant some handsome trees therein we will send for some fiddlers and get up a dance and a picnic party  it will be found throughout the picture that the same species of improvement is made on the materials which claude had ready to his hand the descending slopes of the city of rome towards the pyramid of caius cestius supply not only lines of the most exquisite variety and beauty but matter for contemplation and reflection in every fragment of their buildings this passage has been idealized by claude into a set of similar round towers respecting which no idea can be formed but that they are uninhabitable and to which no interest can be attached beyond the difficulty of conjecturing what they could have been built for the ruins of the temple are rendered unimpressive by the juxtaposition of the watermill and inexplicable by the introduction of the roman soldiers the glide of the muddy streams of the melancholy tiber and anio through the campagna is impressive in itself but altogether ceases to be so when we disturb their stillness of motion by a weir adorn their neglected flow with a handsome bridge and cover their solitary surface with punts nets and fishermen  it cannot i think be expected that landscapes like this should have any effect on the human heart except to harden or to degrade it to lead it from the love of what is simple earnest and pure to what is as sophisticated and corrupt in arrangement as erring and imperfect in detail so long as such works are held up for imitation landscape painting must be a manufacture its productions must be toys and its patrons must be children  my purpose then in the present work is to demonstrate the utter falseness both of the facts and principles the imperfection of material and error of arrangement on which works such as these are based and to insist on the necessity as well as the dignity of an earnest faithful loving study of nature as she is rejecting with abhorrence all that man has done to alter and modify her and the praise which in this first portion of the work is given to many english artists would be justifiable on this ground only that although frequently with little power and desultory effort they have yet in an honest and good heart received the word of god from clouds and leaves and waves and kept itn and endeavored in humility to render to the world that purity of impression which can alone render the result of art an instrument of good or its labor deserving of gratitude  if however i shall have frequent occasion to insist on the necessity of this heartfelt love of and unqualified submission to the teaching of nature it will be no less incumbent upon me to reprobate the careless rendering of casual impression and the mechanical copyism of unimportant subject which are too frequently visible in our modern schoolo their lightness and desultoriness of intention their meaningless multiplication of unstudied composition and their want of definiteness and loftiness of aim bring discredit on their whole system of study and encourage in the critic the unhappy prejudice that the field and the hillside are less fit places of study than the gallery and the garret not every casual idea caught from the flight of a shower or the fall of a sunbeam not every glowing fragment of harvest light nor every flickering dream of copsewood coolness is to be given to the world as it came unconsidered incomplete and forgotten by the artist as soon as it has left his easel that only should be considered a picture in which the spirit not the materials observe but the animating emotion of many such studies is concentrated and exhibited by the aid of longstudied painfullychosen forms idealized in the right sense of the word not by audacious liberty of that faculty of degrading gods works which man calls his imagination but by perfect assertion of entire knowledge of every part and character and function of the object and in which the details are completed to the last line compatible with the dignity and simplicity of the whole wrought out with that noblest industry which concentrates profusion into point and transforms accumulation into structure neither must this labor be bestowed on every subject which appears to afford a capability of good but on chosen subjects in which nature has prepared to the artists hand the purest sources of the impression he would convey these may be humble in their order but they must be perfect of their kind there is a perfection of the hedgerow and cottage as well as of the forest and the palace and more ideality in a great artists selection and treatment of roadside weeds and brookworn pebbles than in all the struggling caricature of the meaner mind which heaps its foreground with colossal columns and heaves impossible mountains into the encumbered sky finally these chosen subjects must not be in any way repetitions of one another but each founded on a new idea and developing a totally distinct train of thought so that the work of the artists life should form a consistent series of essays rising through the scale of creation from the humblest scenery to the most exalted each picture being a necessary link in the chain based on what preceded introducing to what is to follow and all in their lovely system exhibiting and drawing closer the bonds of nature to the human heart since then i shall have to reprobate the absence of study in the moderns nearly as much as its false direction in the ancients my task will naturally divide itself into three portions in the first i shall endeavor to investigate and arrange the facts of nature with scientific accuracy showing as i proceed by what total neglect of the very first base and groundwork of their art the idealities of some among the old masters are produced this foundation once securely laid i shall proceed in the second portion of the work to analyze and demonstrate the nature of the emotions of the beautiful and sublime to examine the particular characters of every kind of scenery and to bring to light as far as may be in my power that faultless ceaseless inconceivable inexhaustible loveliness which god has stamped upon all things if man will only receive them as he gives them finally i shall endeavor to trace the operation of all this on the hearts and minds of men to exhibit the moral function and end of art to prove the share which it ought to have in the thoughts and influence on the lives of all of us to attach to the artist the responsibility of a preacher and to kindle in the general mind that regard which such an office must demand  it must be evident that the first portion of this task which is all that i have yet been enabled to offer to the reader cannot but be the least interesting and the most laborious especially because it is necessary that it should be executed without reference to any principles of beauty or influences of emotion it is the hard straightforward classification of material things not the study of thought or passion and therefore let me not be accused of the feelings which i choose to repress the consideration of the high qualities of art must not be interrupted by the work of the hammer and the eudiometer  again i would request that the frequent passages of reference to the great masters of the italian school may not be looked upon as mere modes of conventional expression i think there is enough in the following pages to prove that i am not likely to be carried away by the celebrity of a name and therefore that the devoted love which i profess for the works of the great historical and sacred painters is sincere and wellgrounded and indeed every principle of art which i may advocate i shall be able to illustrate by reference to the works of men universally allowed to be the masters of masters and the public so long as my teaching leads them to higher understanding and love of the works of buonaroti leonardo raffaelle titian and cagliari may surely concede to me without fear the right of striking such blows as i may deem necessary to the establishment of my principles at gasper poussin or vandevelde  indeed i believe there is nearly as much occasion at the present day for advocacy of michael angelo against the pettiness of the moderns as there is for support of turner against the conventionalities of the ancients for though the names of the fathers of sacred art are on all our lips our faith in them is much like that of the great world in its religionnominal but dead in vain our lecturers sound the name of raffaelle in the ears of their pupils while their own works are visibly at variance with every principle deducible from his in vain is the young student compelled to produce a certain number of school copies of michael angelo when his bread must depend on the number of gewgaws he can crowd into his canvas and i could with as much zeal exert myself against the modern system of english historical art as i have in favor of our school of landscape but that it is an ungrateful and painful task to attack the works of living painters struggling with adverse circumstances of every kind and especially with the false taste of a nation which regards matters of art either with the ticklishness of an infant or the stolidity of a megatherium  i have been accused in the execution of this first portion of my work of irreverent and scurrile expression towards the works which i have depreciated possibly i may have been in some degree infected by reading those criticisms of our periodicals which consist of nothing else but i believe in general that my words will be found to have sufficient truth in them to excuse their familiarity and that no other weapons could have been used to pierce the superstitious prejudice with which the works of certain painters are shielded from the attacks of reason my answer is that given long ago to a similar complaint uttered under the same circumstances by the foiled sophistgreek hos destin ho anthrôpos hôs apaideutos tis os ouiô phaula onomata onomazein tolma en semnô pragmati toioutos tis ô hippia ouden allo phrontizôn ê to alêthes  it is with more surprise that i have heard myself accused of thoughtless severity with respect to the works of contemporary painters for i fully believe that whenever i attack them i give myself far more pain than i can possibly inflict and in many instances i have withheld reprobation which i considered necessary to the full understanding of my work in the fear of grieving or injuring men of whose feelings and circumstances i was ignorant indeed the apparently false and exaggerated bias of the whole book in favor of modern art is in great degree dependent on my withholding the animadversions which would have given it balance and keeping silence where i cannot praise but i had rather be a year or two longer in effecting my purposes than reach them by trampling on mens hearts and hearths and i have permitted myself to express unfavorable opinions only where the popularity and favor of the artist are so great as to render the opinion of an individual a matter of indifference to him  and nowbut one word more for many a year we have heard nothing with respect to the works of turner but accusations of their want of truth to every observation on their power sublimity or beauty there has been but one reply they are not like nature i therefore took my opponents on their own ground and demonstrated by thorough investigation of actual facts that turner is like nature and paints more of nature than any man who ever lived i expected this proposition the foundation of all my future efforts would have been disputed with desperate struggles and that i should have had to fight my way to my position inch by inch not at all my opponents yield me the field at once one the writer for the athenæum has no other resource than the assertion that he disapproves the natural style in painting if people want to see nature let them go and look at herself why should they see her at secondhand on a piece of canvas the other blackwood still more utterly discomfited is reduced to a still more remarkable line of defence it is not he says what things in all respects really are but how they are convertible by the mind into what they are not that we have to consider october 1843 p 485 i leave therefore the reader to choose whether with blackwood and his fellows he will proceed to consider how things are convertible by the mind into what they are not or whether with me he will undergo the harder but perhaps on the whole more useful labor of ascertainingwhat they are   footnotes    a one or two fragments of greek sculpture the works of michael     angelo considered with reference to their general conception and     power and the madonna di st sisto are all that i should myself     put into such a category not that even these are without defect     but their defects are such as mortality could never hope to rectify    b this principle is dangerous but not the less true and     necessary to be kept in mind there is scarcely any truth which does     not admit of being wrested to purposes of evil and we must not deny     the desirableness of originality because men may err in seeking for     it or because a pretence to it may be made by presumption a cloak     for its incompetence nevertheless originality is never to be     sought for its own sakeotherwise it will be mere aberrationit     should arise naturally out of hard independent study of nature and     it should be remembered that in many things technical it is     impossible to alter without being inferior for therein as says     spencer truth is one and right is ever one but wrongs are     various and multitudinous vice says byron in marino faliero     must have variety but virtue stands like the sun and all which     rolls around drinks life from her aspect    c it is with regret that in a work of this nature i take notice     of criticisms which after all are merely intended to amuse the     careless reader and be forgotten as soon as read but i do so in     compliance with wishes expressed to me since the publication of this     work by persons who have the interests of art deeply at heart and     who i find attach more importance to the matter than i should have     been disposed to do i have therefore marked two or three passages     which may enable the public to judge for themselves of the quality     of these critiques and this i think a matter of justice to those     who might otherwise have been led astray by themmore than this i     cannot consent to do i should have but a hounds office if i had to     tear the tabard from every rouge sanglier of the artswith bell and     bauble to back him    d chrysoprase vide no for october

winds of the fools     paradise it is with great pain that i ever speak with severity of     the works of living masters especially when like mr lees they     are wellintentioned simple free from affectation or imitation     and evidently painted with constant reference to nature but i     believe that these qualities will always secure him that admiration     which he deservesthat there will be many unsophisticated and     honest minds always ready to follow his guidance and answer his     efforts with delight and therefore that i need not fear to point     out in him the want of those technical qualities which are more     especially the object of an artists admiration gainsboroughs     power of color it is mentioned by sir joshua as his peculiar gift     is capable of taking rank beside that of rubens he is the purest     coloristsir joshua himself not exceptedof the whole english     school with him in fact the art of painting did in great part     die and exists not now in europe evidence enough will be seen in     the following pages of my devoted admiration of turner but i     hesitate not to say that in management and quality of single and     particular tint in the purely technical part of painting turner is     a child of gainsborough now mr lee never aims at color he does     not make it his object in the slightest degreethe spring green of     vegetation is all that he desires and it would be about as rational     to compare his works with studied pieces of coloring as the     modulation of the calabrian pipe to the harmony of a full orchestra     gainsboroughs hand is as light as the sweep of a cloudas swift as     the flash of a sunbeam lees execution is feeble and spotty     gainsboroughs masses are as broad as the first division in heaven     of light from darkness lees perhaps necessarily considering the     effects of flickering sunlight at which he aims are as fragmentary     as his leaves and as numerous gainsboroughs forms are grand     simple and ideal lees are small confused and unselected     gainsborough never loses sight of his picture as a whole lee is but     too apt to be shackled by its parts in a word gainsborough is an     immortal painter and lee though on the right road is yet in the     early stages of his art and the man who could imagine any     resemblance or point of comparison between them is not only a     novice in art but has not capacity ever to be anything more he may     be pardoned for not comprehending turner for long preparation and     discipline are necessary before the abstract and profound philosophy     of that artist can be met but gainsboroughs excellence is based on     principles of art long acknowledged and facts of nature universally     apparent and i insist more particularly on the reviewers want of     feeling for his works because it proves a truth of which the public     ought especially to be assured that those who lavish abuse on the     great men of modern times are equally incapable of perceiving the     real excellence of established canons are ignorant of the commonest     and most acknowledged principia of the art blind to the most     palpable and comprehensible of its beauties incapable of     distinguishing if left to themselves a masters work from the     vilest school copy and founding their applause of those great works     which they praise either in pure hypocrisy or in admiration of     their defects    g there is a fine touch in the frogs in aristophanes alluding     probably to this part of the agamemnon greek ego d hechairon

perhaps in need of chastening and     guiding from the works of his fellowmen we should use pictures not     as authorities but as comments on nature just as we use divines     not as authorities but as comments on the bible constable in his     dread of saintworship excommunicates himself from all benefit of     the church and deprives himself of much instruction from the     scripture to which he holds because he will not accept aid in the     reading of it from the learning of other men sir george beaumont     on the contrary furnishes in the anecdotes given of him in     constables life a melancholy instance of the degradation into     which the human mind may fall when it suffers human works to     interfere between it and its master the recommending the color of     an old cremona fiddle for the prevailing tone of everything and the     vapid inquiry of the conventionalist where do you put your brown     tree show a prostration of intellect so laughable and lamentable     that they are at once on all and to all students of the gallery     a satire and a warning art so followed is the most servile     indolence in which life can be wasted there are then two dangerous     extremes to be shunnedforgetfulness of the scripture and scorn     of the divineslavery on the one hand freethinking on the other     the mean is nearly as difficult to determine or keep in art as in     religion but the great danger is on the side of superstition he     who walks humbly with nature will seldom be in danger of losing     sight of art he will commonly find in all that is truly great of     mans works something of their original for which he will regard     them with gratitude and sometimes follow them with respect while     he who takes art for his authority may entirely lose sight of all     that it interprets and sink at once into the sin of an idolater     and the degradation of a slave    o i should have insisted more on this fault for it is a fatal     one in the following essay but the cause of it rests rather with     the public than with the artist and in the necessities of the     public as much as in their will such pictures as artists themselves     would wish to paint could not be executed under very high prices     and it must always be easier in the present state of society to     find ten purchasers of tenguinea sketches than one purchaser for a     hundredguinea picture still i have been often both surprised and     grieved to see that any effort on the part of our artists to rise     above manufactureany struggle to something like completed     conceptionwas left by the public to be its own reward in the     watercolor exhibition of last year there was a noble work of david     coxs ideal in the right sensea forest hollow with a few sheep     crushing down through its deep fern and a solemn opening of evening     sky above its dark masses of distance it was worth all his little     bits on the walls put together yet the public picked up all the     little bitsblots and splashes ducks chickweed ears of cornall     that was clever and petite and the real picturethe full     development of the artists mindwas left on his hands how can i     or any one else with a conscience advise him after this to aim at     anything more than may be struck out by the cleverness of a quarter     of an hour cattermole i believe is earthed and shackled in the     same manner he began his career with finished and studied pictures     which i believe never paid himhe now prostitutes his fine talent     to the superficialness of public taste and blots his way to     emolument and oblivion there is commonly however fault on both     sides in the artist for exhibiting his dexterity by mountebank     tricks of the brush until chaste finish requiring ten times the     knowledge and labor appears insipid to the diseased taste which he     has himself formed in his patrons as the roaring and ranting of a     common actor will oftentimes render apparently vapid the finished     touches of perfect nature and in the public for taking less real     pains to become acquainted with and discriminate the various     powers of a great artist than they would to estimate the excellence     of a cook or develop the dexterity of a dancer                            preface to the third edition  it is with much regret and partly against my own judgment that i republish the following chapters in their present form the particular circumstances stated in the first preface under which they were originally written have rendered them so unfit for the position they now hold as introductory to a serious examination of the general functions of art that i should have wished first to complete the succeeding portions of the essay and then to write another introduction of more fitting character but as it may be long before i am able to do this and as i believe what i have already written may still be of some limited and partial service i have suffered it to reappear trusting to the kindness of the reader to look to its intention rather than its temper and forgive its inconsideration in its earnestness  thinking it of too little substance to bear mending wherever i have found a passage which i thought required modification or explanation i have cut it out what i have left however imperfect cannot i think be dangerously misunderstood something i have added not under the idea of rendering the work in any wise systematic or complete but to supply gross omissions answer inevitable objections and give some substance to passages of mere declamation  whatever inadequacy or error there may be throughout in materials or modes of demonstration i have no doubt of the truth and necessity of the main result and though the reader may perhaps find me frequently hereafter showing other and better grounds for what is here affirmed yet the point and bearing of the book its determined depreciation of claude salvator gaspar and canaletto and its equally determined support of turner as the greatest of all landscape painters and of turners recent works as his finest are good and right and if the prevalence throughout of attack and eulogium be found irksome or offensive let it be remembered that my object thus far has not been either the establishment or the teaching of any principles of art but the vindication most necessary to the prosperity of our present schools of the uncomprehended rank of their greatest artist and the diminution equally necessary as i think to the prosperity of our schools of the unadvised admiration of the landscape of the seventeenth century for i believe it to be almost impossible to state in terms sufficiently serious and severe the depth and extent of the evil which has resulted and that not in art alone but in all other matters with which the contemplative faculties are concerned from the works of those elder men on the continent all landscape art has been utterly annihilated by them and with it all sense of the power of nature we in england have only done better because our artists have had strength of mind enough to form a school withdrawn from their influence  these points are somewhat farther developed in the general sketch of ancient and modern landscape which i have added to the first section of the second part some important additions have also been made to the chapters on the painting of sea throughout the rest of the text though something is withdrawn little is changed and the reader may rest assured that if i were now to bestow on this feeble essay the careful revision which it much needs but little deserves it would not be to alter its tendencies or modify its conclusions but to prevent indignation from appearing virulence on the one side and enthusiasm partisanship on the other                      preface to new edition 1873  i have been lately so often asked by friends on whose judgment i can rely to permit the publication of another edition of modern painters in its original form that i have at last yielded though with some violence to my own feelings for many parts of the first and second volumes are written in a narrow enthusiasm and the substance of their metaphysical and religious speculation is only justifiable on the ground of its absolute honesty of the third fourth and fifth volumes i indeed mean eventually to rearrange what i think of permanent interest for the complete edition of my works but with fewer and less elaborate illustrations nor have i any serious grounds for refusing to allow the book once more to appear in the irregular form which it took as it was written since of the artteaching and landscape description it contains i have little to retrench and nothing to retract  this final edition must however be limited to a thousand copies for some of the more delicate plates are already worn that of the mill stream in the fifth volume and of the loire side very injuriously while that of the shores of wharfe had to be retouched by an engraver after the removal of the mezzotint for reprinting but mr armytages mr cousens and mr cuffs magnificent plates are

opinion no criterion of excellence except after long        periods of time  if it be true and it can scarcely be disputed that nothing has been for centuries consecrated by public admiration without possessing in a high degree some kind of sterling excellence it is not because the average intellect and feeling of the majority of the public are competent in any way to distinguish what is really excellent but because all erroneous opinion is inconsistent and all ungrounded opinion transitory so that while the fancies and feelings which deny deserved honor and award what is undue have neither root nor strength sufficient to maintain consistent testimony for a length of time the opinions formed on right grounds by those few who are in reality competent judges being necessarily stable communicate themselves gradually from mind to mind descending lower as they extend wider until they leaven the whole lump and rule by absolute authority even where the grounds and reasons for them cannot be understood on this gradual victory of what is consistent over what is vacillating depends the reputation of all that is highest in art and literature for it is an insult to what is really great in either to suppose that it in any way addresses itself to mean or uncultivated faculties it is a matter of the simplest demonstration that no man can be really appreciated but by his equal or superior his inferior may overestimate him in enthusiasm or as is more commonly the case degrade him in ignorance but he cannot form a grounded and just estimate without proving this howeverwhich it would take more space to do than i can spareit is sufficiently evident that there is no process of amalgamation by which opinions wrong individually can become right merely by their multitude1 if i stand by a picture in the academy and hear twenty persons in succession admiring some paltry piece of mechanism or imitation in the lining of a cloak or the satin of a slipper it is absurd to tell me that they reprobate collectively what they admire individually or if they pass with apathy by a piece of the most noble conception or most perfect truth because it has in it no tricks of the brush nor grimace of expression it is absurd to tell me that they collectively respect what they separately scorn or that the feelings and knowledge of such judges by any length of time or comparison of ideas could come to any right conclusion with respect to what is really high in art the question is not decided by them but for themdecided at first by few by fewer in proportion as the merits of the work are of a higher order from these few the decision is communicated to the number next below them in rank of mind and by these again to a wider and lower circle each rank being so far cognizant of the superiority of that above it as to receive its decision with respect until in process of time the right and consistent opinion is communicated to all and held by all as a matter of faith the more positively in proportion as the grounds of it are less perceived2   § 2 and therefore obstinate when once formed  § 3 the authors reasons for opposing it in particular instances  § 4 but only on points capable of demonstration  but when this process has taken place and the work has become sanctified by time in the minds of men it is impossible that any new work of equal merit can be impartially compared with it except by minds not only educated and generally capable of appreciating merit but strong enough to shake off the weight of prejudice and association which invariably incline them to the older favorite it is much easier says barry to repeat the character recorded of phidias than to investigate the merits of agasias and when as peculiarly in the case of painting much knowledge of what is technical and practical is necessary to a right judgment so that those alone are competent to pronounce a true verdict who are themselves the persons to be judged and who therefore can give no opinion centuries may elapse before fair comparison can be made between two artists of different ages while the patriarchal excellence exercises during the interval a tyrannicalperhaps even a blighting influence over the minds both of the public and of those to whom properly understood it should serve for a guide and example in no city of europe where art is a subject of attention are its prospects so hopeless or its pursuits so resultless as in rome because there among all students the authority of their predecessors in art is supreme and without appeal and the mindless copyist studies raffaelle but not what raffaelle studied it thus becomes the duty of every one capable of demonstrating any definite points of superiority in modern art and who is in a position in which his doing so will not be ungraceful to encounter without hesitation whatever opprobrium may fall upon him from the necessary prejudice even of the most candid minds and from the far more virulent opposition of those who have no hope of maintaining their own reputation for discernment but in the support of that kind of consecrated merit which may be applauded without an inconvenient necessity for reasons it is my purpose therefore believing that there are certain points of superiority in modern artists and especially in one or two of their number which have not yet been fully understood except by those who are scarcely in a position admitting the declaration of their conviction to institute a close comparison between the great works of ancient and modern landscape art to raise as far as possible the deceptive veil of imaginary light through which we are accustomed to gaze upon the patriarchal work and to show the real relations whether favorable or otherwise subsisting between it and our own i am fully aware that this is not to be done lightly or rashly that it is the part of every one proposing to undertake such a task strictly to examine with prolonged doubt and severe trial every opinion in any way contrary to the sacred verdict of time and to advance nothing which does not at least in his own conviction rest on surer ground than mere feeling or taste i have accordingly advanced nothing in the following pages but with accompanying demonstration which may indeed be true or falsecomplete or conditional but which can only be met on its own grounds and can in no way be borne down or affected by mere authority of great names yet even thus i should scarcely have ventured to speak so decidedly as i have but for my full conviction that we ought not to class the historical painters of the fifteenth and landscape painters of the seventeenth centuries together under the general title of old masters as if they possessed anything like corresponding rank in their respective walks of art i feel assured that the principles on which they worked are totally opposed and that the landscape painters have been honored only because they exhibited in mechanical and technical qualities some semblance of the manner of the nobler historical painters whose principles of conception and composition they entirely reversed the course of study which has led me reverently to the feet of michael angelo and da vinci has alienated me gradually from claude and gaspari cannot at the same time do homage to power and pettinessto the truth of consummate science and the mannerism of undisciplined imagination and let it be understood that whenever hereafter i speak depreciatingly of the old masters as a body i refer to none of the historical painters for whom i entertain a veneration which though i hope reasonable in its grounds is almost superstitious in degree neither unless he be particularly mentioned do i intend to include nicholas poussin whose landscapes have a separate and elevated character which renders it necessary to consider them apart from all others speaking generally of the older masters i refer only to claude gaspar poussin salvator rosa cuyp berghem both ruysdael hobbima teniers in his landscapes p potter canaletti and the various van somethings and back somethings more especially and malignantly those who have libelled the sea  it will of course be necessary for me in the commencement of the work to state briefly those principles on which i conceive all right judgment of art must be founded these introductory chapters i should wish to be read carefully because all criticism must be useless when the terms or grounds of it are in any degree ambiguous and the ordinary language of connoisseurs and critics granting that they understand it themselves is usually mere jargon to others from their custom of using technical terms by which everything is meant and nothing is expressed   § 5 the authors partiality to modern works excusable  and if in the application of these principles in spite of my endeavor to render it impartial the feeling and fondness which i have for some works of modern art escape me sometimes where it should not let it be pardoned as little more than a fair counterbalance to that peculiar veneration with which the work of the older master associated as it has ever been in our ears with the expression of whatever is great or perfect must be usually regarded by the reader i do not say that this veneration is wrong nor that we should be less attentive to the repeated words of time but let us not forget that if honor be for the dead gratitude can only be for the living he who has once stood beside the grave to look back upon the companionship which has been forever closed feeling how impotent there are the wild love or the keen sorrow to give one instants pleasure to the pulseless heart or atone in the lowest measure to the departed spirit for the hour of unkindness will scarcely for the future incur that debt to the heart which can only be discharged to the dust but the lesson which men receive as individuals they do not learn as nations again and again they have seen their noblest descend into the grave and have thought it enough to garland the tombstone when they had not crowned the brow and to pay the honor to the ashes which they had denied to the spirit let it not displease them that they are bidden amidst the tumult and the dazzle of their busy life to listen for the few voices and watch for the few lamps which god has toned and lighted to charm and to guide them that they may not learn their sweetness by their silence nor their light by their decay   footnotes    1 the opinion of a majority is right only when it is more probable     with each individual that he should be right than that he should be     wrong as in the case of a jury where it is more probable with     respect to each individual that he should be wrong than right the     opinion of the minority is the true one thus it is in art    2 there are however a thousand modifying circumstances which     render this process sometimes unnecessarysometimes rapid and     certainsometimes impossible it is unnecessary in rhetoric and the     drama because the multitude is the only proper judge of those arts     whose end is to move the multitude though more is necessary to a     fine play than is essentially dramatic and it is only of the     dramatic part that the multitude are cognizant it is unnecessary     when united with the higher qualities of a work there are appeals     to universal passion to all the faculties and feelings which are     general in man as an animal the popularity is then as sudden as it     is well groundedit is hearty and honest in every mind but it is     based in every mind on a different species of excellence such will     often be the case with the noblest works of literature take don     quixote for example the lowest mind would find in it perpetual and     brutal amusement in the misfortunes of the knight and perpetual     pleasure in sympathy with the squire a mind of average feeling     would perceive the satirical meaning and force of the book would     appreciate its wit its elegance and its truth but only elevated     and peculiar minds discover in addition to all this the full moral     beauty of the love and truth which are the constant associates of     all that is even most weak and erring in the character of its hero     and pass over the rude adventure and scurrile jest in hasteperhaps     in pain to penetrate beneath the rusty corselet and catch from the     wandering glance the evidence and expression of fortitude     selfdevotion and universal love so again with the works of     scott and byron popularity was as instant as it was deserved     because there is in them an appeal to those passions which are     universal in all men as well as an expression of such thoughts as     can be received only by the few but they are admired by the     majority of their advocates for the weakest parts of their works as     a popular preacher by the majority of his congregation for the worst     part of his sermon      the process is rapid and certain when though there may be little     to catch the multitude at once there is much which they can enjoy     when their attention is authoritatively directed to it so rests the     reputation of shakspeare no ordinary mind can comprehend wherein     his undisputed superiority consists but there is yet quite as much     to amuse thrill or excitequite as much of what is in the     strict sense of the word dramatic in his works as in any one     elses they were received therefore when first written with     average approval as works of common merit but when the high     decision was made and the circle spread the public took up the hue     and cry conscientiously enough let them have daggers ghosts     clowns and kings and with such real and definite sources of     enjoyment they will take the additional trouble to learn half a     dozen quotations without understanding them and admit the     superiority of shakspeare without further demur nothing perhaps     can more completely demonstrate the total ignorance of the public of     all that is great or valuable in shakspeare than their universal     admiration of maclises hamlet      the process is impossible when there is in the work nothing to     attract and something to disgust the vulgar mind neither their     intrinsic excellence nor the authority of those who can judge of     it will ever make the poems of wordsworth or george herbert     popular in the sense in which scott and byron are popular because     it is to the vulgar a labor instead of a pleasure to read them and     there are parts in them which to such judges cannot but be vapid or     ridiculous most works of the highest artthose of raffaelle m     angelo or da vincistand as shakspeare doesthat which is     commonplace and feeble in their excellence being taken for its     essence by the uneducated imagination assisting the impression     for we readily fancy that we feel when feeling is a matter of     pride or conscience and affectation and pretension increasing the     noise of the rapture if not its degree giotto orgagna angelico     perugino stand like george herbert only with the few wilkie     becomes popular like scott because he touches passions which all     feel and expresses truths which all can recognize                                      chapter ii                         definition of greatness in art   § 1 distinction between the painters intellectual power and technical        knowledge  in the 15th lecture of sir joshua reynolds incidental notice is taken of the distinction between those excellences in the painter which belong to him as such and those which belong to him in common with all men of intellect the general and exalted powers of which art is the evidence and expression not the subject but the distinction is not there dwelt upon as it should be for it is owing to the slight attention ordinarily paid to it that criticism is open to every form of coxcombry and liable to every phase of error it is a distinction on which depend all sound judgment of the rank of the artist and all just appreciation of the dignity of art   § 2 painting as such is nothing more than language  painting or art generally as such with all its technicalities difficulties and particular ends is nothing but a noble and expressive language invaluable as the vehicle of thought but by itself nothing he who has learned what is commonly considered the whole art of painting that is the art of representing any natural object faithfully has as yet only learned the language by which his thoughts are to be expressed he has done just as much towards being that which we ought to respect as a great painter as a man who has learned how to express himself grammatically and melodiously has towards being a great poet the language is indeed more difficult of acquirement in the one case than in the other and possesses more power of delighting the sense while it speaks to the intellect but it is nevertheless nothing more than language and all those excellences which are peculiar to the painter as such are merely what rhythm melody precision and force are in the words of the orator and the poet necessary to their greatness but not the tests of their greatness it is not by the mode of representing and saying but by what is represented and said that the respective greatness either of the painter or the writer is to be finally determined   § 3 painter a term corresponding to versifier  speaking with strict propriety therefore we should call a man a great painter only as he excelled in precision and force in the language of lines and a great versifier as he excelled in precision or force in the language of words a great poet would then be a term strictly and in precisely the same sense applicable to both if warranted by the character of the images or thoughts which each in their respective languages convey   § 4 example in a painting of e landseers  take for instance one of the most perfect poems or pictures i use the words as synonymous which modern times have seenthe old shepherds chiefmourner here the exquisite execution of the glossy and crisp hair of the dog the bright sharp touching of the green bough beside it the clear painting of the wood of the coffin and the folds of the blanket are languagelanguage clear and expressive in the highest degree but the close pressure of the dogs breast against the wood the convulsive clinging of the paws which has dragged the blanket off the trestle the total powerlessness of the head laid close and motionless upon its folds the fixed and tearful fall of the eye in its utter hopelessness the rigidity of repose which marks that there has been no motion nor change in the trance of agony since the last blow was struck on the coffinlid the quietness and gloom of the chamber the spectacles marking the place where the bible was last closed indicating how lonely has been the lifehow unwatched the departure of him who is now laid solitary in his sleepthese are all thoughtsthoughts by which the picture is separated at once from hundreds of equal merit as far as mere painting goes by which it ranks as a work of high art and stamps its author not as the neat imitator of the texture of a skin or the fold of a drapery but as the man of mind   § 5 difficulty of fixing an exact limit between language and thought  it is not however always easy either in painting or literature to determine where the influence of language stops and where that of thought begins many thoughts are so dependent upon the language in which they are clothed that they would lose half their beauty if otherwise expressed but the highest thoughts are those which are least dependent on language and the dignity of any composition and praise to which it is entitled are in exact proportion to its independency of language or expression a composition is indeed usually most perfect when to such intrinsic dignity is added all that expression can do to attract and adorn but in every case of supreme excellence this all becomes as nothing we are more gratified by the simplest lines or words which can suggest the idea in its own naked beauty than by the robe or the gem which conceal while they decorate we are better pleased to feel by their absence how little they would bestow than by their presence how much they can destroy   § 6 distinction between decorative and expressive language  there is therefore a distinction to be made between what is ornamental in language and what is expressive that part of it which is necessary to the embodying and conveying the thought is worthy of respect and attention as necessary to excellence though not the test of it but that part of it which is decorative has little more to do with the intrinsic excellence of the picture than the frame or the varnishing of it and this caution in distinguishing between the ornamental and the expressive is peculiarly necessary in painting for in the language of words it is nearly impossible for that which is not expressive to be beautiful except by mere rhythm or melody any sacrifice to which is immediately stigmatized as error but the beauty of mere language in painting is not only very attractive and entertaining to the spectator but requires for its attainment no small exertion of mind and devotion of time by the artist hence in art men have frequently fancied that they were becoming rhetoricians and poets when they were only learning to speak melodiously and the judge has over and over again advanced to the honor of authors those who were never more than ornamental writingmasters   § 7 instance in the dutch and early italian schools  most pictures of the dutch school for instance and excepting always those of rubens vandyke and rembrandt are ostentatious exhibitions of the artists power of speech the clear and vigorous elocution of useless and senseless words while the early efforts of cimabue and giotto are the burning messages of prophecy delivered by the stammering lips of infants it is not by ranking the former as more than mechanics or the latter as less than artists that the taste of the multitude always awake to the lowest pleasures which art can bestow and blunt to the highest is to be formed or elevated it must be the part of the judicious critic carefully to distinguish what is language and what is thought and to rank and praise pictures chiefly for the latter considering the former as a totally inferior excellence and one which cannot be compared with nor weighed against thought in any way nor in any degree whatsoever the picture which has the nobler and more numerous ideas however awkwardly expressed is a greater and a better picture than that which has the less noble and less numerous ideas however beautifully expressed no weight nor mass nor beauty of execution can outweigh one grain or fragment of thought three penstrokes of raffaelle are a greater and a better picture than the most finished work that ever carlo dolci polished into inanity a finished work of a great artist is only better than its sketch if the sources of pleasure belonging to color and realizationvaluable in themselvesare so employed as to increase the impressiveness of the thought but if one atom of thought has vanished all color all finish all execution all ornament are too dearly bought nothing but thought can pay for thought and the instant that the increasing refinement or finish of the picture begins to be paid for by the loss of the faintest shadow of an idea that instant all refinement or finish is an excrescence and a deformity   § 8 yet there are certain ideas belonging to language itself  § 9 the definition  yet although in all our speculations on art language is thus to be distinguished from and held subordinate to that which it conveys we must still remember that there are certain ideas inherent in language itself and that strictly speaking every pleasure connected with art has in it some reference to the intellect the mere sensual pleasure of the eye received from the most brilliant piece of coloring is as nothing to that which it receives from a crystal prism except as it depends on our perception of a certain meaning and intended arrangement of color which has been the subject of intellect nay the term idea according to lockes definition of it will extend even to the sensual impressions themselves as far as they are things which the mind occupies itself about in thinking that is not as they are felt by the eye only but as they are received by the mind through the eye so that if i say that the greatest picture is that which conveys to the mind of the spectator the greatest number of the greatest ideas i have a definition which will include as subjects of comparison every pleasure which art is capable of conveying if i were to say on the contrary that the best picture was that which most closely imitated nature i should assume that art could only please by imitating nature and i should cast out of the pale of criticism those parts of works of art which are not imitative that is to say intrinsic beauties of color and form and those works of art wholly which like the arabesques of raffaelle in the loggias are not imitative at all now i want a definition of art wide enough to include all its varieties of aim i do not say therefore that the art is greatest which gives most pleasure because perhaps there is some art whose end is to teach and not to please i do not say that the art is greatest which teaches us most because perhaps there is some art whose end is to please and not to teach i do not say that the art is greatest which imitates best because perhaps there is some art whose end is to create and not to imitate but i say that the art is greatest which conveys to the mind of the spectator by any means whatsoever the greatest number of the greatest ideas and i call an idea great in proportion as it is received by a higher faculty of the mind and as it more fully occupies and in occupying exercises and exalts the faculty by which it is received  if this then be the definition of great art that of a great artist naturally follows he is the greatest artist who has embodied in the sum of his works the greatest number of the greatest ideas                                 chapter iii                          of ideas of power   the definition of art which i have just given requires me to determine what kinds of ideas can be received from works of art and which of these are the greatest before proceeding to any practical application of the test   § 1 what classes of ideas are conveyable by art  i think that all the sources of pleasure or any other good to be derived from works of art may be referred to five distinct heads      i ideas of powerthe perception or conception of the mental or          bodily powers by which the work has been produced     ii ideas of imitationthe perception that the thing produced          resembles something else    iii ideas of truththe perception of faithfulness in a statement          of facts by the thing produced     iv ideas of beautythe perception of beauty either in the thing          produced or in what it suggests or resembles      v ideas of relationthe perception of intellectual relations in          the thing produced or in what it suggests or resembles  i shall briefly distinguish the nature and effects of each of these classes of ideas   § 2 ideas of power vary much in relative dignity  i ideas of powerthese are the simple perception of the mental or bodily powers exerted in the production of any work of art according to the dignity and degree of the power perceived is the dignity of the idea but the whole class of ideas is received by the intellect and they excite the best of the moral feelings veneration and the desire of exertion as a species therefore they are one of the noblest connected with art but the differences in degree of dignity among themselves are infinite being correspondent with every order of powerfrom that of the fingers to that of the most exalted intellect thus when we see an indians paddle carved from the handle to the blade we have a conception of prolonged manual labor and are gratified in proportion to the supposed expenditure of time and exertion these are indeed powers of a low order yet the pleasure arising from the conception of them enters very largely indeed into our admiration of all elaborate ornament architectural decoration etc the delight with which we look on the fretted front of rouen cathedral depends in no small degree on the simple perception of time employed and labor expended in its production but it is a right that is an ennobling pleasure even in this its lowest phase and even the pleasure felt by those persons who praise a drawing for its finish or its work which is one precisely of the same kind would be right if it did not imply a want of perception of the higher powers which render work unnecessary if to the evidence of labor be added that of strength or dexterity the sensation of power is yet increased if to strength and dexterity be added that of ingenuity and judgment it is multiplied tenfold and so on through all the subjects of action of body or mind we receive the more exalted pleasure from the more exalted power   § 3 but are received from whatever has been the subject of power the        meaning of the word excellence  so far the nature and effects of ideas of power cannot but be admitted by all but the circumstance which i wish especially to insist upon with respect to them is one which may not perhaps be so readily allowed namely that they are independent of the nature or worthiness of the object from which they are received and that whatever has been the subject of a great power whether there be intrinsic and apparent worthiness in itself or not bears with it the evidence of having been so and is capable of giving the ideas of power and the consequent pleasures in their full degree for observe that a thing is not properly said to have been the result of a great power on which only some part of that power has been expended a nut may be cracked by a steamengine but it has not in being so been the subject of the power of the engine and thus it is falsely said of great men that they waste their lofty powers on unworthy objects the object may be dangerous or useless but as far as the phrase has reference to difficulty of performance it cannot be unworthy of the power which it brings into exertion because nothing can become a subject of action to a greater power which can be accomplished by a less any more than bodily strength can be exerted where there is nothing to resist it  so then men may let their great powers lie dormant while they employ their mean and petty powers on mean and petty objects but it is physically impossible to employ a great power except on a great object consequently wherever power of any kind or degree has been exerted the marks and evidence of it are stamped upon its results it is impossible that it should be lost or wasted or without record even in the estimation of a hair and therefore whatever has been the subject of a great power bears about with it the image of that which created it and is what is commonly called excellent and this is the true meaning of the word excellent as distinguished from the terms beautiful useful good etc and we shall always in future use the word excellent as signifying that the thing to which it is applied required a great power for its production3   § 4 what is necessary to the distinguishing of excellence  the faculty of perceiving what powers are required for the production of a thing is the faculty of perceiving excellence it is this faculty in which men even of the most cultivated taste must always be wanting unless they have added practice to reflection because none can estimate the power manifested in victory unless they have personally measured the strength to be overcome though therefore it is possible by the cultivation of sensibility and judgment to become capable of distinguishing what is beautiful it is totally impossible without practice and knowledge to distinguish or feel what is excellent the beauty or the truth of titians fleshtint may be appreciated by all but it is only to the artist whose multiplied hours of toil have not reached the slightest resemblance of one of its tones that its excellence is manifest   § 5 the pleasure attendant on conquering difficulties is right  wherever then difficulty has been overcome there is excellence and therefore in order to prove excellent we have only to prove the difficulty of its production whether it be useful or beautiful is another question its excellence depends on its difficulty alone for is it a false or diseased taste which looks for the overcoming of difficulties and has pleasure in it even without any view to resultant good it has been made part of our moral nature that we should have a pleasure in encountering and conquering opposition for the sake of the struggle and the victory not for the sake of any after result and not only our own victory but the perception of that of another is in all cases the source of pure and ennobling pleasure and if we often hear it said and truly said that an artist has erred by seeking rather to show his skill in overcoming technical difficulties than to reach a great end be it observed that he is only blamed because he has sought to conquer an inferior difficulty rather than a great one for it is much easier to overcome technical difficulties than to reach a great end whenever the visible victory over difficulties is found painful or in false taste it is owing to the preference of an inferior to a great difficulty or to the false estimate of what is difficult and what is not it is far more difficult to be simple than to be complicated far more difficult to sacrifice skill and cease exertion in the proper place than to expend both indiscriminately we shall find in the course of our investigation that beauty and difficulty go together and that they are only mean and paltry difficulties which it is wrong or contemptible to wrestle with be it remembered thenpower is never wasted whatever power has been employed produces excellence in proportion to its own dignity and exertion and the faculty of perceiving this exertion and appreciating this dignity is the faculty of perceiving excellence   footnotes    3 of course the word excellent is primarily a mere synonym with     surpassing and when applied to persons has the general meaning     given by johnsonthe state of abounding in any good quality but     when applied to things it has always reference to the power by which     they are produced we talk of excellent music or poetry because it     is difficult to compose or write such but never of excellent     flowers because all flowers being the result of the same power     must be equally excellent we distinguish them only as beautiful or     useful and therefore as there is no other one word to signify that     quality of a thing produced by which it pleases us merely as the     result of power and as the term excellent is more frequently used     in this sense than in any other i choose to limit it at once to     this sense and i wish it when i use it in future to be so     understood                                      chapter iv                             of ideas of imitation   § 1 false use of the term imitation by many writers of art  fuseli in his lectures and many other persons of equally just and accurate habits of thought among others s t coleridge make a distinction between imitation and copying representing the first as the legitimate function of artthe latter as its corruption but as such a distinction is by no means warranted or explained by the common meaning of the words themselves it is not easy to comprehend exactly in what sense they are used by those writers and though reasoning from the context i can understand what ideas those words stand for in their minds i cannot allow the terms to be properly used as symbols of those ideas which especially in the case of the word imitation are exceedingly complex and totally different from what most people would understand by the term and by men of less accurate thought the word is used still more vaguely or falsely for instance burke treatise on the sublime part i sect 16 says when the object represented in poetry or painting is such as we could have no desire of seeing in the reality then we may be sure that its power in poetry or painting is owing to the power of imitation in which case the real pleasure may be in what we have been just speaking of the dexterity of the artists hand or it may be in a beautiful or singular arrangement of colors or a thoughtful chiaroscuro or in the pure beauty of certain forms which art forces on our notice though we should not have observed them in the reality and i conceive that none of these sources of pleasure are in any way expressed or intimated by the term imitation  but there is one source of pleasure in works of art totally different from all these which i conceive to be properly and accurately expressed by the word imitation one which though constantly confused in reasoning because it is always associated in fact with other means of pleasure is totally separated from them in its nature and is the real basis of whatever complicated or various meaning may be afterwards attached to the word in the minds of men   § 2 real meaning of the term  § 3 what is requisite to the sense of imitation  i wish to point out this distinct source of pleasure clearly at once and only to use the word imitation in reference to it whenever anything looks like what it is not the resemblance being so great as nearly to deceive we feel a kind of pleasurable surprise an agreeable excitement of mind exactly the same in its nature as that which we receive from juggling whenever we perceive this in something produced by art that is to say whenever the work is seen to resemble something which we know it is not we receive what i call an idea of imitation why such ideas are pleasing it would be out of our present purpose to inquire we only know that there is no man who does not feel pleasure in his animal nature from gentle surprise and that such surprise can be excited in no more distinct manner than by the evidence that a thing is not what it appears to be4 now two things are requisite to our complete and more pleasurable perception of this first that the resemblance be so perfect as to amount to a deception secondly that there be some means of proving at the same moment that it is a deception the most perfect ideas and pleasures of imitation are therefore when one sense is contradicted by another both bearing as positive evidence on the subject as each is capable of alone as when the eye says a thing is round and the finger says it is flat they are therefore never felt in so high a degree as in painting where appearance of projection roughness hair velvet etc are given with a smooth surface or in waxwork where the first evidence of the senses is perpetually contradicted by their experience but the moment we come to marble our definition checks us for a marble figure does not look like what it is not it looks like marble and like the form of a man but then it is marble and it is the form of a man it does not look like a man which it is not but like the form of a man which it is form is form bona fide and actual whether in marble or in fleshnot an imitation or resemblance of form but real form the chalk outline of the bough of a tree on paper is not an imitation it looks like chalk and papernot like wood and that which it suggests to the mind is not properly said to be like the form of a bough it is the form of a bough now then we see the limits of an idea of imitation it extends only to the sensation of trickery and deception occasioned by a things intentionally seeming different from what it is and the degree of the pleasure depends on the degree of difference and the perfection of the resemblance not on the nature of the thing resembled the simple pleasure in the imitation would be precisely of the same degree if the accuracy could be equal whether the subject of it were the hero or his horse there are other collateral sources of pleasure which are necessarily associated with this but that part of the pleasure which depends on the imitation is the same in both   § 4 the pleasure resulting from imitation the most contemptible that        can be derived from art  ideas of imitation then act by producing the simple pleasure of surprise and that not of surprise in its higher sense and function but of the mean and paltry surprise which is felt in jugglery these ideas and pleasures are the most contemptible which can be received from art first because it is necessary to their enjoyment that the mind should reject the impression and address of the thing represented and fix itself only upon the reflection that it is not what it seems to be all high or noble emotion or thought are thus rendered physically impossible while the mind exults in what is very like a strictly sensual pleasure we may consider tears as a result of agony or of art whichever we please but not of both at the same moment if we are surprised by them as an attainment of the one it is impossible we can be moved by them as a sign of the other   § 5 imitation is only of contemptible subjects  ideas of imitation are contemptible in the second place because not only do they preclude the spectator from enjoying inherent beauty in the subject but they can only be received from mean and paltry subjects because it is impossible to imitate anything really great we can paint a cat or a fiddle so that they look as if we could take them up but we cannot imitate the ocean or the alps we can imitate fruit but not a tree flowers but not a pasture cutglass but not the rainbow all pictures in which deceptive powers of imitation are displayed are therefore either of contemptible subjects or have the imitation shown in contemptible parts of them bits of dress jewels furniture etc   § 6 imitation is contemptible because it is easy  thirdly these ideas are contemptible because no ideas of power are associated with them to the ignorant imitation indeed seems difficult and its success praiseworthy but even they can by no possibility see more in the artist than they do in a juggler who arrives at a strange end by means with which they are unacquainted to the instructed the juggler is by far the more respectable artist of the two for they know sleight of hand to be an art of immensely more difficult acquirement and to imply more ingenuity in the artist than a power of deceptive imitation in painting which requires nothing more for its attainment than a true eye a steady hand and moderate industryqualities which in no degree separate the imitative artist from a watchmaker pinmaker or any other neathanded artificer these remarks do not apply to the art of the diorama or the stage where the pleasure is not dependent on the imitation but is the same which we should receive from nature herself only far inferior in degree it is a noble pleasure but we shall see in the course of our investigation both that it is inferior to that which we receive when there is no deception at all and why it is so   § 7 recapitulation  whenever then in future i speak of ideas of imitation i wish to be understood to mean the immediate and present perception that something produced by art is not what it seems to be i prefer saying that it is not what it seems to be to saying that it seems to be what it is not because we perceive at once what it seems to be and the idea of imitation and the consequent pleasure result from the subsequent perception of its being something elseflat for instance when we thought it was round   footnotes    4 greek syllogismos ettig hoti touto ekeinoarist rhet 1     11 23                                      chapter v                               of ideas of truth  the word truth as applied to art signifies the faithful statement either to the mind or senses of any fact of nature   § 1 meaning of the word truth as applied to art  we receive an idea of truth then when we perceive the faithfulness of such a statement  the difference between ideas of truth and of imitation lies chiefly in the following points   § 2 first difference between truth and imitation  firstimitation can only be of something material but truth has reference to statements both of the qualities of material things and of emotions impressions and thoughts there is a moral as well as material trutha truth of impression as well as of formof thought as well as of matter and the truth of impression and thought is a thousand times the more important of the two hence truth is a term of universal application but imitation is limited to that narrow field of art which takes cognizance only of material things   § 3 second difference  secondlytruth may be stated by any signs or symbols which have a definite signification in the minds of those to whom they are addressed although such signs be themselves no image nor likeness of anything whatever can excite in the mind the conception of certain facts can give ideas of truth though it be in no degree the imitation or resemblance of those facts if there bewe do not say there isbut if there be in painting anything which operates as words do not by resembling anything but by being taken as a symbol and substitute for it and thus inducing the effect of it then this channel of communication can convey uncorrupted truth though it do not in any degree resemble the facts whose conception it induces but ideas of imitation of course require the likeness of the object they speak to the perceptive faculties only truth to the conceptive   § 4 third difference  thirdlyand in consequence of what is above stated an idea of truth exists in the statement of one attribute of anything but an idea of imitation requires the resemblance of as many attributes as we are usually cognizant of in its real presence a pencil outline of the bough of a tree on white paper is a statement of a certain number of facts of form it does not yet amount to the imitation of anything the idea of that form is not given in nature by lines at all still less by black lines with a white space between them but those lines convey to the mind a distinct impression of a certain number of facts which it recognizes as agreeable with its previous impressions of the bough of a tree and it receives therefore an idea of truth if instead of two lines we give a dark form with the brush we convey information of a certain relation of shade between the bough and sky recognizable for another idea of truth but we have still no imitation for the white paper is not the least like air nor the black shadow like wood it is not until after a certain number of ideas of truth have been collected together that we arrive at an idea of imitation   § 5 no accurate truths necessary to imitation  hence it might at first sight appear that an idea of imitation inasmuch as several ideas of truth were united in it was nobler than a simple idea of truth and if it were necessary that the ideas of truth should be perfect or should be subjects of contemplation as such it would be so but observe we require to produce the effect of imitation only so many and such ideas of truth as the senses are usually cognizant of now the senses are not usually nor unless they be especially devoted to the service cognizant with accuracy of any truths but those of space and projection it requires long study and attention before they give certain evidence of even the simplest truths of form for instance the quay on which the figure is sitting with his hand at his eyes in claudes seaport no 14 in the national gallery is egregiously out of perspective the eye of this artist with all his study had thus not acquired the power of taking cognizance of the apparent form even of a simple parallelopiped how much less of the complicated forms of boughs leaves or limbs although therefore something resembling the real form is necessary to deception this something is not to be called a truth of form for strictly speaking there are no degrees of truth there are only degrees of approach to it and an approach to it whose feebleness and imperfection would instantly offend and give pain to a mind really capable of distinguishing truth is yet quite sufficient for all the purposes of deceptive imagination it is the same with regard to color if we were to paint a tree skyblue or a dog rosepink the discernment of the public would be keen enough to discover the falsehood but so that there be just so much approach to truth of color as may come up to the common idea of it in mens minds that is to say if the trees be all bright green and flesh unbroken buff and ground unbroken brown though all the real and refined truths of color be wholly omitted or rather defied and contradicted there is yet quite enough for all purposes of imitation the only facts then which we are usually and certainly cognizant of are those of distance and projection and if these be tolerably given with something like truth of form and color to assist them the idea of imitation is complete i would undertake to paint an arm with every muscle out of its place and every bone of false form and dislocated articulation and yet to observe certain coarse and broad resemblances of true outline which with careful shading would induce deception and draw down the praise and delight of the discerning public the other day at bruges while i was endeavoring to set down in my notebook something of the ineffable expression of the madonna in the cathedral a french amateur came up to me to inquire if i had seen the modern french pictures in a neighboring church i had not but felt little inclined to leave my marble for all the canvas that ever suffered from french brushes my apathy was attacked with gradually increasing energy of praise rubens never executedtitian never colored anything like them i thought this highly probable and still sat quiet the voice continued at my ear parbleu monsieur michel ange na rien produit de plus beau de plus beau repeated i wishing to know what particular excellences of michael angelo were to be intimated by this expression monsieur on ne pent pluscest un tableau admirableinconcevable monsieur said the frenchman lifting up his hands to heaven as he concentrated in one conclusive and overwhelming proposition the qualities which were to outshine rubens and overpower buonarotimonsieur il sort  this gentleman could only perceive two truthsflesh color and projection these constituted his notion of the perfection of painting because they unite all that is necessary for deception he was not therefore cognizant of many ideas of truth though perfectly cognizant of ideas of imitation   § 6 ideas of truth are inconsistent with ideas of imitation  we shall see in the course of our investigation of ideas of truth that ideas of imitation not only do not imply their presence but even are inconsistent with it and that pictures which imitate so as to deceive are never true but this is not the place for the proof of this at present we have only to insist on the last and greatest distinction between ideas of truth and of imitationthat the mind in receiving one of the former dwells upon its own conception of the fact or form or feeling stated and is occupied only with the qualities and character of that fact or form considering it as real and existing being all the while totally regardless of the signs or symbols by which the notion of it has been conveyed these signs have no pretence nor hypocrisy nor legerdemain about themthere is nothing to be found out or sifted or surprised in themthey bear their message simply and clearly and it is that message which the mind takes from them and dwells upon regardless of the language in which it is delivered but the mind in receiving an idea of imitation is wholly occupied in finding out that what has been suggested to it is not what it appears to be it does not dwell on the suggestion but on the perception that it is a false suggestion it derives its pleasure not from the contemplation of a truth but from the discovery of a falsehood so that the moment ideas of truth are grouped together so as to give rise to an idea of imitation they change their very naturelose their essence as ideas of truthand are corrupted and degraded so as to share in the treachery of what they have produced hence finally ideas of truth are the foundation and ideas of imitation the destruction of all art we shall be better able to appreciate their relative dignity after the investigation which we propose of the functions of the former but we may as well now express the conclusion to which we shall then be ledthat no picture can be good which deceives by its imitation for the very reason that nothing can be beautiful which is not true                                      chapter vi                               of ideas of beauty   § 1 definition of the term beautiful  any material object which can give us pleasure in the simple contemplation of its outward qualities without any direct and definite exertion of the intellect i call in some way or in some degree beautiful why we receive pleasure from some forms and colors and not from others is no more to be asked or answered than why we like sugar and dislike wormwood the utmost subtilty of investigation will only lead us to ultimate instincts and principles of human nature for which no farther reason can be given than the simple will of the deity that we should be so created we may indeed perceive as far as we are acquainted with his nature that we have been so constructed as when in a healthy and cultivated state of mind to derive pleasure from whatever things are illustrative of that nature but we do not receive pleasure from them because they are illustrative of it nor from any perception that they are illustrative of it but instinctively and necessarily as we derive sensual pleasure from the scent of a rose on these primary principles of our nature education and accident operate to an unlimited extent they may be cultivated or checked directed or diverted gifted by right guidance with the most acute and faultless sense or subjected by neglect to every phase of error and disease he who has followed up these natural laws of aversion and desire rendering them more and more authoritative by constant obedience so as to derive pleasure always from that which god originally intended should give him pleasure and who derives the greatest possible sum of pleasure from any given object is a man of taste   § 2 definition of the term taste  this then is the real meaning of this disputed word perfect taste is the faculty of receiving the greatest possible pleasure from those material sources which are attractive to our moral nature in its purity and perfection he who receives little pleasure from these sources wants taste he who receives pleasure from any other sources has false or bad taste   § 3 distinction between taste and judgment  and it is thus that the term taste is to be distinguished from that of judgment with which it is constantly confounded judgment is a general term expressing definite action of the intellect and applicable to every kind of subject which can be submitted to it there may be judgment of congruity judgment of truth judgment of justice and judgment of difficulty and excellence but all these exertions of the intellect are totally distinct from taste properly so called which is the instinctive and instant preferring of one material object to another without any obvious reason except that it is proper to human nature in its perfection so to do   § 4 how far beauty may become intellectual  observe however i do not mean by excluding direct exertion of the intellect from ideas of beauty to assert that beauty has no effect upon nor connection with the intellect all our moral feelings are so inwoven with our intellectual powers that we cannot affect the one without in some degree addressing the other and in all high ideas of beauty it is more than probable that much of the pleasure depends on delicate and untraceable perceptions of fitness propriety and relation which are purely intellectual and through which we arrive at our noblest ideas of what is commonly and rightly called intellectual beauty but there is yet no immediate exertion of the intellect that is to say if a person receiving even the noblest ideas of simple beauty be asked why he likes the object exciting them he will not be able to give any distinct reason nor to trace in his mind any formed thought to which he can appeal as a source of pleasure he will say that the thing gratifies fills hallows exalts his mind but he will not be able to say why or how if he can and if he can show that he perceives in the object any expression of distinct thought he has received more than an idea of beautyit is an idea of relation   § 5 the high rank and function of ideas of beauty  ideas of beauty are among the noblest which can be presented to the human mind invariably exalting and purifying it according to their degree and it would appear that we are intended by the deity to be constantly under their influence because there is not one single object in nature which is not capable of conveying them and which to the rightly perceiving mind does not present an incalculably greater number of beautiful than of deformed parts there being in fact scarcely anything in pure undiseased nature like positive deformity but only degrees of beauty or such slight and rare points of permitted contrast as may render all around them more valuable by their opposition spots of blackness in creation to make its colors felt   § 6 meaning of the term ideal beauty  but although everything in nature is more or less beautiful every species of object has its own kind and degree of beauty some being in their own nature more beautiful than others and few if any individuals possessing the utmost degree of beauty of which the species is capable this utmost degree of specific beauty necessarily coexistent with the utmost perfection of the object in other respects is the ideal of the object  ideas of beauty then be it remembered are the subjects of moral but not of intellectual perception by the investigation of them we shall be led to the knowledge of the ideal subjects of art                                      chapter vii                              of ideas of relation   § 1 general meaning of the term  i use this term rather as one of convenience than as adequately expressive of the vast class of ideas which i wish to be comprehended under it namely all those conveyable by art which are the subjects of distinct intellectual perception and action and which are therefore worthy of the name of thoughts but as every thought or definite exertion of intellect implies two subjects and some connection or relation inferred between them the term ideas of relation is not incorrect though it is inexpressive   § 2 what ideas are to be comprehended under it  under this head must be arranged everything productive of expression sentiment and character whether in figures or landscapes for there may be as much definite expression and marked carrying out of particular thoughts in the treatment of inanimate as of animate nature everything relating to the conception of the subject and to the congruity and relation of its parts not as they enhance each others beauty by known and constant laws of composition but as they give each other expression and meaning by particular application requiring distinct thought to discover or to enjoy the choice for instance of a particular lurid or appalling light to illustrate an incident in itself terrible or of a particular tone of pure color to prepare the mind for the expression of refined and delicate feeling and in a still higher sense the invention of such incidents and thoughts as can be expressed in words as well as on canvas and are totally independent of any means of art but such as may serve for the bare suggestion of them the principal object in the foreground of turners building of carthage is a group of children sailing toy boats the exquisite choice of this incident as expressive of the ruling passion which was to be the source of future greatness in preference to the tumult of busy stonemasons or arming soldiers is quite as appreciable when it is told as when it is seenit has nothing to do with the technicalities of painting a scratch of the pen would have conveyed the idea and spoken to the intellect as much as the elaborate realizations of color such a thought as this is something far above all art it is epic poetry of the highest order claude in subjects of the same kind commonly introduces people carrying red trunks with iron locks about and dwells with infantine delight on the lustre of the leather and the ornaments of the iron the intellect can have no occupation here we must look to the imitation or to nothing consequently turner rises above claude in the very first instant of the conception of his picture and acquires an intellectual superiority which no powers of the draughtsman or the artist supposing that such existed in his antagonist could ever wrest from him   § 3 the exceeding nobility of these ideas  such are the function and force of ideas of relation they are what i have asserted in the second chapter of this section to be the noblest subjects of art dependent upon it only for expression they cause all the rest of its complicated sources of pleasure to take in comparison with them the place of mere language or decoration nay even the noblest ideas of beauty sink at once beside these into subordination and subjection it would add little to the influence of landseers picture above instanced chap ii § 4 that the form of the dog should be conceived with every perfection of curve and color which its nature was capable of and that the ideal lines should be carried out with the science of a praxiteles nay the instant that the beauty so obtained interfered with the impression of agony and desolation and drew the mind away from the feeling of the animal to its outward form that instant would the picture become monstrous and degraded the utmost glory of the human body is a mean subject of contemplation compared to the emotion exertion and character of that which animates it the lustre of the limbs of the aphrodite is faint beside that of the brow of the madonna and the divine form of the greek god except as it is the incarnation and expression of divine mind is degraded beside the passion and the prophecy of the vaults of the sistine   § 4 why no subdivision of so extensive a class is necessary  ideas of relation are of course with respect to art generally the most extensive as the most important source of pleasure and if we proposed entering upon the criticism of historical works it would be absurd to attempt to do so without further subdivision and arrangement but the old landscape painters got over so much canvas without either exercise of or appeal to the intellect that we shall be little troubled with the subject as far as they are concerned and whatever subdivision we may adopt as it will therefore have particular reference to the works of modern artists will be better understood when we have obtained some knowledge of them in less important points  by the term ideas of relation then i mean in future to express all those sources of pleasure which involve and require at the instant of their perception active exertion of the intellectual powers                                      section ii                                    of power                                      chapter i                  general principles respecting ideas of power   § 1 no necessity for detailed study of ideas of imitation  we have seen in the last section what classes of ideas may be conveyed by art and we have been able so far to appreciate their relative worth as to see that from the list as it is to be applied to the purposes of legitimate criticism we may at once throw out the ideas of imitation first because as we have shown they are unworthy the pursuit of the artist and secondly because they are nothing more than the result of a particular association of ideas of truth in examining the truth of art therefore we shall be compelled to take notice of those particular truths whose association gives rise to the ideas of imitation we shall then see more clearly the meanness of those truths and we shall find ourselves able to use them as tests of vice in art saying of a pictureit deceives therefore it must be bad   § 2 nor for separate study of ideas of power  ideas of power in the same way cannot be completely viewed as a separate class not because they are mean or unimportant but because they are almost always associated with or dependent upon some of the higher ideas of truth beauty or relation rendered with decision or velocity that power which delights us in the chalk sketch of a great painter is not one of the fingers not like that of the writingmaster mere dexterity of hand it is the accuracy and certainty of the knowledge rendered evident by its rapid and fearless expression which is the real source of pleasure and so upon each difficulty of art whether it be to know or to relate or to invent the sensation of power is attendant when we see that difficulty totally and swiftly vanquished hence as we determine what is otherwise desirable in art we shall gradually develop the sources of the ideas of power and if there be anything difficult which is not otherwise desirable it must be afterwards considered separately   § 3 except under one particular form  but it will be necessary at present to notice a particular form of the ideas of power which is partially independent of knowledge of truth or difficulty and which is apt to corrupt the judgment of the critic and debase the work of the artist it is evident that the conception of power which we receive from a calculation of unseen difficulty and an estimate of unseen strength can never be so impressive as that which we receive from the present sensation or sight of the one resisting and the other overwhelming in the one case the power is imagined and in the other felt   § 4 there are two modes of receiving ideas of power commonly        inconsistent  there are thus two modes in which we receive the conception of power one the most just when by a perfect knowledge of the difficulty to be overcome and the means employed we form a right estimate of the faculties exerted the other when without possessing such intimate and accurate knowledge we are impressed by a sensation of power in visible action if these two modes of receiving the impression agree in the result and if the sensation be equal to the estimate we receive the utmost possible idea of power but this is the case perhaps with the works of only one man out of the whole circle of the fathers of art of him to whom we have just referred michael angelo in others the estimate and the sensation are constantly unequal and often contradictory   § 5 first reason of the inconsistency  the first reason of this inconsistency is that in order to receive a sensation of power we must see it in operation its victory therefore must not be achieved but achieving and therefore imperfect thus we receive a greater sensation of power from the halfhewn limbs of the twilight to the day of the cappella de medici than even from the divine inebriety of the bacchus in the gallerygreater from the life dashed out along the friezes of the parthenon than from the polished limbs of the apollogreater from the ink sketch of the head of raffaelles st catherine than from the perfection of its realization   § 6 second reason for the inconsistency  another reason of the inconsistency is that the sensation of power is in proportion to the apparent inadequacy of the means to the end so that the impression is much greater from a partial success attained with slight effort than from perfect success attained with greater proportional effort now in all art every touch or effort does individually less in proportion as the work approaches perfection the first five chalk touches bring a head into existence out of nothing no five touches in the whole course of the work will ever do so much as these and the difference made by each touch is more and more imperceptible as the work approaches completion consequently the ratio between the means employed and the effect produced is constantly decreasing and therefore the least sensation of power is received from the most perfect work   § 7 the sensation of power ought not to be sought in imperfect art  it is thus evident that there are sensations of power about imperfect art so that it be right art as far as it goes which must always be wanting in its perfection and that there are sources of pleasure in the hasty sketch and rough hewn block which are partially wanting in the tinted canvas and the polished marble but it is nevertheless wrong to prefer the sensation of power to the intellectual perception of it there is in reality greater power in the completion than in the commencement and though it be not so manifest to the senses it ought to have higher influence on the mind and therefore in praising pictures for the ideas of power they convey we must not look to the keenest sensation but to the highest estimate accompanied with as much of the sensation as is compatible with it and thus we shall consider those pictures as conveying the highest ideas of power which attain the most perfect end with the slightest possible means not observe those in which though much has been done with little all has not been done but from the picture in which all has been done and yet not a touch thrown away the quantity of work in the sketch is necessarily less in proportion to the effect obtained than in the picture but yet the picture involves the greater power if out of all the additional labor bestowed on it not a touch has been lost   § 8 instances in pictures of modern artists  for instance there are few drawings of the present day that involve greater sensations of power than those of frederick tayler every dash tells and the quantity of effect obtained is enormous in proportion to the apparent means but the effect obtained is not complete brilliant beautiful and right as a sketch the work is still far from perfection as a drawing on the contrary there are few drawings of the present day that bear evidence of more labor bestowed or more complicated means employed than those of john lewis the result does not at first so much convey an impression of inherent power as of prolonged exertion but the result is complete watercolor drawing can be carried no farther nothing has been left unfinished or untold and on examination of the means employed it is found and felt that not one touch out of the thousands employed has been thrown awaythat not one dot nor dash could be spared without loss of effectand that the exertion has been as swift as it has been prolongedas bold as it has been persevering the power involved in such a picture is of the highest order and the enduring pleasure following on the estimate of it pure   § 9 connection between ideas of power and modes of execution  but there is still farther ground for caution in pursuing the sensation of power connected with the particular characters and modes of execution this we shall be better able to understand by briefly reviewing the various excellences which may belong to execution and give pleasure in it though the full determination of what is desirable in it and the critical examination of the execution of different artists must be deferred as will be immediately seen until we are more fully acquainted with the principles of truth                                      chapter ii             of ideas of power as they are dependent upon execution   § 1 meaning of the term execution  by the term execution i understand the right mechanical use of the means of art to produce a given end   § 2 the first quality of execution is truth  all qualities of execution properly so called are influenced by and in a great degree dependent on a far higher power than that of mere executionknowledge of truth for exactly in proportion as an artist is certain of his end will he be swift and simple in his means and as he is accurate and deep in his knowledge will he be refined and precise in his touch the first merit of manipulation then is that delicate and ceaseless expression of refined truth which is carried out to the last touch and shadow of a touch and which makes every hairsbreadth of importance and every gradation full of meaning it is not properly speaking execution but it is the only source of difference between the execution of a commonplace and of a perfect artist the lowest draughtsman if he have spent the same time in handling the brush may be equal to the highest in the other qualities of execution in swiftness simplicity and decision but not in truth it is in the perfection and precision of the instantaneous line that the claim to immortality is laid and if this truth of truths be present all the other qualities of execution may well be spared and to those artists who wish to excuse their ignorance and inaccuracy by a species of execution which is a perpetual proclamation quils nont demeuré quun quart dheure a le faire we may reply with the truthful alceste monsieur le temps ne fait rien a laffaire   § 3 the second simplicity  the second quality of execution is simplicity the more unpretending quiet and retiring the means the more impressive their effect any ostentation brilliancy or pretension of touchany exhibition of power or quickness merely as such above all any attempt to render lines attractive at the expense of their meaning is vice   § 4 the third mystery  the third is mystery nature is always mysterious and secret in the use of her means and art is always likest her when it is most inexplicable that execution which is the most incomprehensible and which therefore defies imitation other qualities being supposed alike is the best   § 5 the fourth inadequacy and the fifth decision  the fourth is inadequacy the less sufficient the means appear to the end the greater as has been already noticed will be the sensation of power  the fifth is decision the appearance that is that whatever is done has been done fearlessly and at once because this gives us the impression that both the fact to be represented and the means necessary to its representation were perfectly known   § 6 the sixth velocity  the sixth is velocity not only is velocity or the appearance of it agreeable as decision is because it gives ideas of power and knowledge but of two touches as nearly as possible the same in other respects the quickest will invariably be the best truth being supposed equally present in the shape and direction of both there will be more evenness grace and variety in the quick one than in the slow one it will be more agreeable to the eye as a touch or line and will possess more of the qualities of the lines of naturegradation uncertainty and unity   § 7 strangeness an illegitimate source of pleasure in execution  these six qualities are the only perfectly legitimate sources of pleasure in execution but i might have added a seventhstrangeness which in many cases is productive of a pleasure not altogether mean or degrading though scarcely right supposing the other higher qualities first secured it adds in no small degree to our impression of the artists knowledge if the means used be such as we should never have thought of or should have thought adapted to a contrary effect let us for instance compare the execution of the bulls head in the left hand lowest corner of the adoration of the magi in the museum at antwerp with that in berghems landscape no 132 in the dulwich gallery rubens first scratches horizontally over his canvas a thin grayish brown transparent and even very much the color of light wainscot the horizontal strokes of the bristles being left so evident that the whole might be taken for an imitation of wood were it not for its transparency on this ground the eye nostril and outline of the cheek are given with two or three rude brown touches about three or four minutes work in all though the head is colossal the background is then laid in with thick solid warm white actually projecting all round the head leaving it in dark intaglio finally five thin and scratchy strokes of very cold bluish white are struck for the high light on the forehead and nose and the head is complete seen within a yard of the canvas it looks actually transparenta flimsy meaningless distant shadow while the background looks solid projecting and near from the right distance ten or twelve yards off whence alone the whole of the picture can be seen it is a complete rich substantial and living realization of the projecting head of the animal while the background falls far behind now there is no slight nor mean pleasure in perceiving such a result attained by means so strange by berghem on the other hand a dark background is first laid in with exquisite delicacy and transparency and on this the cows head is actually modelled in luminous white the separate locks of hair projecting from the canvas no surprise nor much pleasure of any kind would be attendant on this execution even were the result equally successful and what little pleasure we had in it vanishes when on retiring from the picture we find the head shining like a distant lantern instead of substantial or near yet strangeness is not to be considered as a legitimate source of pleasure that means which is most conducive to the end should always be the most pleasurable and that which is most conducive to the end can be strange only to the ignorance of the spectator this kind of pleasure is illegitimate therefore because it implies and requires in those who feel it ignorance of art   § 8 yet even the legitimate sources of pleasure in execution are        inconsistent with each other  § 9 and fondness for ideas of power leads to the adoption of the        lowest  § 10 therefore perilous  the legitimate sources of pleasure in execution are therefore truth simplicity mystery inadequacy decision and velocity but of these be it observed some are so far inconsistent with others that they cannot be united in high degrees mystery with inadequacy for instance since to see that the means are inadequate we must see what they are now the first three are the great qualities of execution and the last three are the attractive ones because on them are chiefly attendant the ideas of power by the first three the attention is withdrawn from the means and fixed on the result by the last three withdrawn from the result and fixed on the means to see that execution is swift or that it is decided we must look away from its creation to observe it in the act of creating we must think more of the pallet than of the picture but simplicity and mystery compel the mind to leave the means and fix itself on the conception hence the danger of too great fondness for those sensations of power which are associated with the three last qualities of execution for although it is most desirable that these should be present as far as they are consistent with the others and though their visible absence is always painful and wrong yet the moment the higher qualities are sacrificed to them in the least degree we have a brilliant vice berghem and salvator rosa are good instances of vicious execution dependent on too great fondness for sensations of power vicious because intrusive and attractive in itself instead of being subordinate to its results and forgotten in them there is perhaps no greater stumblingblock in the artists way than the tendency to sacrifice truth and simplicity to decision and velocity5 captivating qualities easy of attainment and sure to attract attention and praise while the delicate degree of truth which is at first sacrificed to them is so totally unappreciable by the majority of spectators so difficult of attainment to the artist that it is no wonder that efforts so arduous and unrewarded should be abandoned but if the temptation be once yielded to its consequences are fatal there is no pause in the fall i could name a celebrated modern artistonce a man of the highest power and promise who is a glaring instance of the peril of such a course misled by the undue popularity of his swift execution he has sacrificed to it first precision and then truth and her associate beauty what was first neglect of nature has become contradiction of her what was once imperfection is now falsehood and all that was meritorious in his manner is becoming the worst because the most attractive of vices decision without a foundation and swiftness without an end   § 11 recapitulation  such are the principal modes in which the ideas of power may become a dangerous attraction to the artista false test to the critic but in all cases where they lead us astray it will be found that the error is caused by our preferring victory over a small apparent difficulty to victory over a great but concealed one and so that we keep this distinction constantly in view whether with reference to execution or to any other quality of art between the sensation and the intellectual estimate of power we shall always find the ideas of power a just and high source of pleasure in every kind and grade of art   footnotes    5 i have here noticed only noble vices the sacrifices of one     excellence to another legitimate but inferior one there are on the     other hand qualities of execution which are often sought for and     praised though scarcely by the class of persons for whom i am     writing in which everything is sacrificed to illegitimate and     contemptible sources of pleasure and these are vice throughout and     have no redeeming quality nor excusing aim such is that which is     often thought so desirable in the drawingmaster under the title of     boldness meaning that no touch is ever to be made less than the     tenth of an inch broad such on the other hand the softness and     smoothness which are the great attraction of carlo dolci and such     the exhibition of particular powers and tricks of the hand and     fingers in total forgetfulness of any end whatsoever to be attained     thereby which is especially characteristic of modern engraving     compare sect ii chap ii § 21 note                                      chapter iii                                 of the sublime  it may perhaps be wondered that in the division we have made of our subject we have taken no notice of the sublime in art and that in our explanation of that division we have not once used the word   § 1 sublimity is the effect upon the mind of anything above it  the fact is that sublimity is not a specific termnot a term descriptive of the effect of a particular class of ideas anything which elevates the mind is sublime and elevation of mind is produced by the contemplation of greatness of any kind but chiefly of course by the greatness of the noblest things sublimity is therefore only another word for the effect of greatness upon the feelings greatness of matter space power virtue or beauty are thus all sublime and there is perhaps no desirable quality of a work of art which in its perfection is not in some way or degree sublime   § 2 burkes theory of the nature of the sublime incorrect and why  § 3 danger is sublime but not the fear of it  § 4 the highest beauty is sublime  § 5 and generally whatever elevates the mind  i am fully prepared to allow of much ingenuity in burkes theory of the sublime as connected with selfpreservation there are few things so great as death and there is perhaps nothing which banishes all littleness of thought and feeling in an equal degree with its contemplation everything therefore which in any way points to it and therefore most dangers and powers over which we have little control are in some degree sublime but it is not the fear observe but the contemplation of death not the instinctive shudder and struggle of selfpreservation but the deliberate measurement of the doom which are really great or sublime in feeling it is not while we shrink but while we defy that we receive or convey the highest conceptions of the fate there is no sublimity in the agony of terror whether do we trace it most in the cry to the mountains fall on us and to the hills cover us or in the calmness of the prophecyand though after my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh i shall see god a little reflection will easily convince any one that so far from the feelings of selfpreservation being necessary to the sublime their greatest action is totally destructive of it and that there are few feelings less capable of its perception than those of a coward but the simple conception or idea of greatness of suffering or extent of destruction is sublime whether there be any connection of that idea with ourselves or not if we were placed beyond the reach of all peril or pain the perception of these agencies in their influence on others would not be less sublime not because peril or pain are sublime in their own nature but because their contemplation exciting compassion or fortitude elevates the mind and renders meanness of thought impossible beauty is not so often felt to be sublime because in many kinds of purely material beauty there is some truth in burkes assertion that littleness is one of its elements but he who has not felt that there may be beauty without littleness and that such beauty is a source of the sublime is yet ignorant of the meaning of the ideal in art i do not mean in tracing the source of the sublime to greatness to hamper myself with any finespun theory i take the widest possible ground of investigation that sublimity is found wherever anything elevates the mind that is wherever it contemplates anything above itself and perceives it to be so this is the simple philological signification of the word derived from sublimis and will serve us much more easily and be a far clearer and more evident ground of argument than any mere metaphysical or more limited definition while the proof of its justness will be naturally developed by its application to the different branches of art   § 6 the former division of the subject is therefore sufficient  as therefore the sublime is not distinct from what is beautiful nor from other sources of pleasure in art but is only a particular mode and manifestation of them my subject will divide itself into the investigation of ideas of truth beauty and relation and to each of these classes of ideas i destine a separate part of the work the investigation of ideas of truth will enable us to determine the relative rank of artists as followers and historians of nature  that of ideas of beauty will lead us to compare them in their attainment first of what is agreeable in technical matters then in color and composition finally and chiefly in the purity of their conceptions of the ideal  and that of ideas of relation will lead us to compare them as originators of just thought                                       part ii                                   of truth                                   section i                  general principles respecting ideas of truth                                      chapter i    of ideas of truth in their connection with those of beauty and relation   § 1 the two great ends of landscape painting are the representation of        facts and thoughts  it cannot but be evident from the above division of the ideas conveyable by art that the landscape painter must always have two great and distinct ends the first to induce in the spectators mind the faithful conception of any natural objects whatsoever the second to guide the spectators mind to those objects most worthy of its contemplation and to inform him of the thoughts and feelings with which these were regarded by the artist himself  in attaining the first end the painter only places the spectator where he stands himself he sets him before the landscape and leaves him the spectator is alone he may follow out his own thoughts as he would in the natural solitude or he may remain untouched unreflecting and regardless as his disposition may incline him but he has nothing of thought given to him no new ideas no unknown feelings forced on his attention or his heart the artist is his conveyance not his companionhis horse not his friend but in attaining the second end the artist not only places the spectator but talks to him makes him a sharer in his own strong feelings and quick thoughts hurries him away in his own enthusiasm guides him to all that is beautiful snatches him from all that is base and leaves him more than delightedennobled and instructed under the sense of having not only beheld a new scene but of having held communion with a new mind and having been endowed for a time with the keen perception and the impetuous emotion of a nobler and more penetrating intelligence   § 2 they induce a different choice of material subjects  each of these different aims of art will necessitate a different system of choice of objects to be represented the first does not indeed imply choice at all but it is usually united with the selection of such objects as may be naturally and constantly pleasing to all men at all times and this selection when perfect and careful leads to the attainment of the pure ideal but the artist aiming at the second end selects his objects for their meaning and character rather than for their beauty and uses them rather to throw light upon the particular thought he wishes to convey than as in themselves objects of unconnected admiration   § 3 the first mode of selection apt to produce sameness and repetition  now although the first mode of selection when guided by deep reflection may rise to the production of works possessing a noble and ceaseless influence on the human mind it is likely to degenerate into or rather in nine cases out of ten it never goes beyond a mere appeal to such parts of our animal nature as are constant and commonshared by all and perpetual in all such for instance as the pleasure of the eye in the opposition of a cold and warm color or of a massy form with a delicate one it also tends to induce constant repetition of the same ideas and reference to the same principles it gives rise to those rules of art which properly excited reynoldss indignation when applied to its higher efforts it is the source of and the apology for that host of technicalities and absurdities which in all ages have been the curse of art and the crown of the connoisseur   § 4 the second necessitating variety  but art in its second and highest aim is not an appeal to constant animal feelings but an expression and awakening of individual thought it is therefore as various and as extended in its efforts as the compass and grasp of the directing mind and we feel in each of its results that we are looking not at a specimen of a tradesmans wares of which he is ready to make us a dozen to match but at one coruscation of a perpetually active mind like which there has not been and will not be another   § 5 yet the first is delightful to all  § 6 the second only to a few  hence although there can be no doubt which of these branches of art is the highest it is equally evident that the first will be the most generally felt and appreciated for the simple statement of the truths of nature must in itself be pleasing to every order of mind because every truth of nature is more or less beautiful and if there be just and right selection of the more important of these truthsbased as above explained on feelings and desires common to all mankindthe facts so selected must in some degree be delightful to all and their value appreciable by all more or less indeed as their senses and instinct have been rendered more or less acute and accurate by use and study but in some degree by all and in the same way by all but the highest art being based on sensations of peculiar minds sensations occurring to them only at particular times and to a plurality of mankind perhaps never and being expressive of thoughts which could only rise out of a mass of the most extended knowledge and of dispositions modified in a thousand ways by peculiarity of intellectcan only be met and understood by persons having some sort of sympathy with the high and solitary minds which produced itsympathy only to be felt by minds in some degree high and solitary themselves he alone can appreciate the art who could comprehend the conversation of the painter and share in his emotion in moments of his most fiery passion and most original thought and whereas the true meaning and end of his art must thus be sealed to thousands or misunderstood by them so also as he is sometimes obliged in working out his own peculiar end to set at defiance those constant laws which have arisen out of our lower and changeless desires that whose purpose is unseen is frequently in its means and parts displeasing   § 7 the first necessary to the second  § 8 the exceeding importance of truth  but this want of extended influence in high art be it especially observed proceeds from no want of truth in the art itself but from a want of sympathy in the spectator with those feelings in the artist which prompt him to the utterance of one truth rather than of another for and this is what i wish at present especially to insist upon although it is possible to reach what i have stated to be the first end of art the representation of facts without reaching the second the representation of thoughts yet it is altogether impossible to reach the second without having previously reached the first i do not say that a man cannot think having false basis and material for thought but that a false thought is worse than the want of thought and therefore is not art and this is the reason why though i consider the second as the real and only important end of all art i call the representation of facts the first end because it is necessary to the other and must be attained before it it is the foundation of all art like real foundations it may be little thought of when a brilliant fabric is raised on it but it must be there and as few buildings are beautiful unless every line and column of their mass have reference to their foundation and are suggestive of its existence and strength so nothing can be beautiful in art which does not in all its parts suggest and guide to the foundation even where no undecorated portion of it is visible while the noblest edifices of art are built of such pure and fine crystal that the foundation may all be seen through them and then many while they do not see what is built upon that first story yet much admire the solidity of its brickwork thinking they understand all that is to be understood of the matter while others stand beside them looking not at the low story but up into the heaven at that building of crystal in which the builders spirit is dwelling and thus though we want the thoughts and feelings of the artist as well as the truth yet they must be thoughts arising out of the knowledge of truth and feelings raising out of the contemplation of truth we do not want his mind to be as badly blown glass that distorts what we see through it but like a glass of sweet and strange color that gives new tones to what we see through it and a glass of rare strength and clearness too to let us see more than we could ourselves and bring nature up to us and near to us nothing can atone for the want of truth not the most brilliant imagination the most playful fancy the most pure feeling supposing that feeling could be pure and false at the same time not the most exalted conception nor the most comprehensive grasp of intellect can make amends for the want of truth and that for two reasons first because falsehood is in itself revolting and degrading and secondly because nature is so immeasurably superior to all that the human mind can conceive that every departure from her is a fall beneath her so that there can be no such thing as an ornamental falsehood all falsehood must be a blot as well as a sin an injury as well as a deception   § 9 coldness or want of beauty no sign of truth  we shall in consequence find that no artist can be graceful imaginative or original unless he be truthful and that the pursuit of beauty instead of leading us away from truth increases the desire for it and the necessity of it tenfold so that those artists who are really great in imaginative power will be found to have based their boldness of conception on a mass of knowledge far exceeding that possessed by those who pride themselves on its accumulation without regarding its use coldness and want of passion in a picture are not signs of the accuracy but of the paucity of its statements true vigor and brilliancy are not signs of audacity but of knowledge   § 10 how truth may be considered a just criterion of all art  hence it follows that it is in the power of all with care and time to form something like a just judgment of the relative merits of artists for although with respect to the feeling and passion of pictures it is often as impossible to criticise as to appreciate except to such as are in some degree equal in powers of mind and in some respects the same in modes of mind with those whose works they judge yet with respect to the representation of facts it is possible for all by attention to form a right judgment of the respective powers and attainments of every artist truth is a bar of comparison at which they may all be examined and according to the rank they take in this examination will almost invariably be that which if capable of appreciating them in every respect we should be just in assigning them so strict is the connection so constant the relation between the sum of knowledge and the extent of thought between accuracy of perception and vividness of idea  i shall endeavor therefore in the present portion of the work to enter with care and impartiality into the investigation of the claims of the schools of ancient and modern landscape to faithfulness in representing nature i shall pay no regard whatsoever to what may be thought beautiful or sublime or imaginative i shall look only for truth bare clear downright statement of facts showing in each particular as far as i am able what the truth of nature is and then seeking for the plain expression of it and for that alone and i shall thus endeavor totally regardless of fervor of imagination or brilliancy of effect or any other of their more captivating qualities to examine and to judge the works of the great living painter who is i believe imagined by the majority of the public to paint more falsehood and less fact than any other known master we shall see with what reason                                      chapter ii        that the truth of nature is not to be discerned by the uneducated                                   senses   § 1 the common selfdeception of men with respect to their power of        discerning truth  it may be here inquired by the reader with much appearance of reason why i think it necessary to devote a separate portion of the work to the showing of what is truthful in art cannot we say the public see what nature is with our own eyes and find out for ourselves what is like her it will be as well to determine this question before we go farther because if this were possible there would be little need of criticism or teaching with respect to art  now i have just said that it is possible for all men by care and attention to form a just judgment of the fidelity of artists to nature to do this no peculiar powers of mind are required no sympathy with particular feelings nothing which every man of ordinary intellect does not in some degree possesspowers namely of observation and intelligence which by cultivation may be brought to a high degree of perfection and acuteness but until this cultivation has been bestowed and until the instrument thereby perfected has been employed in a consistent series of careful observation it is as absurd as it is audacious to pretend to form any judgment whatsoever respecting the truth of art and my first business before going a step farther must be to combat the nearly universal error of belief among the thoughtless and unreflecting that they know either what nature is or what is like her that they can discover truth by instinct and that their minds are such pure venice glass as to be shocked by all treachery i have to prove to them that there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in their philosophy and that the truth of nature is a part of the truth of god to him who does not search it out darkness as it is to him who does infinity   § 2 men usually see little of what is before their eyes  the first great mistake that people make in the matter is the supposition that they must see a thing if it be before their eyes they forget the great truth told them by locke book ii chap 9 § 3this is certain that whatever alterations are made in the body if they reach not the mind whatever impressions are made on the outward parts if they are not taken notice of within there is no perception fire may burn our bodies with no other effect than it does a billet unless the motion be continued to the brain and there the sense of heat or idea of pain be produced in the mind wherein consists actual perception how often may a man observe in himself that while his mind is intently employed in the contemplation of some subjects and curiously surveying some ideas that are there it takes no notice of impressions of sounding bodies made upon the organ of hearing with the same attention that uses to be for the producing the ideas of sound a sufficient impulse there may be on the organ but it not reaching the observation of the mind there follows no perception and though the motion that uses to produce the idea of sound be made in the ear yet no sound is heard and what is here said which all must feel by their own experience to be true is more remarkably and necessarily the case with sight than with any other of the senses for this reason that the ear is not accustomed to exercise constantly its functions of hearing it is accustomed to stillness and the occurrence of a sound of any kind whatsoever is apt to awake attention and be followed with perception in proportion to the degree of sound but the eye during our waking hours exercises constantly its function of seeing it is its constant habit we always as far as the bodily organ is concerned see something and we always see in the same degree so that the occurrence of sight as such to the eye is only the continuance of its necessary state of action and awakes no attention whatsoever except by the particular nature and quality of the sight and thus unless the minds of men are particularly directed to the impressions of sight objects pass perpetually before the eyes without conveying any impression to the brain at all and so pass actually unseen not merely unnoticed but in the full clear sense of the word unseen and numbers of men being preoccupied with business or care of some description totally unconnected with the impressions of sight such is actually the case with them they receiving from nature only the inevitable sensations of blueness redness darkness light etc and except at particular and rare moments no more whatsoever   § 3 but more or less in proportion to their natural sensibility to what        is beautiful  § 4 connected with a perfect state of moral feeling  the degree of ignorance of external nature in which men may thus remain depends therefore partly on the number and character of the subjects with which their minds may be otherwise occupied and partly on a natural want of sensibility to the power of beauty of form and the other attributes of external objects i do not think that there is ever such absolute incapacity in the eye for distinguishing and receiving pleasure from certain forms and colors as there is in persons who are technically said to have no ear for distinguishing notes but there is naturally every degree of bluntness and acuteness both for perceiving the truth of form and for receiving pleasure from it when perceived and although i believe even the lowest degree of these faculties can be expanded almost unlimitedly by cultivation the pleasure received rewards not the labor necessary and the pursuit is abandoned so that while in those whose sensations are naturally acute and vivid the call of external nature is so strong that it must be obeyed and is ever heard louder as the approach to her is nearerin those whose sensations are naturally blunt the call is overpowered at once by other thoughts and their faculties of perception weak originally die of disuse with this kind of bodily sensibility to color and form is intimately connected that higher sensibility which we revere as one of the chief attributes of all noble minds and as the chief spring of real poetry i believe this kind of sensibility may be entirely resolved into the acuteness of bodily sense of which i have been speaking associated with love love i mean in its infinite and holy functions as it embraces divine and human and brutal intelligences and hallows the physical perception of external objects by association gratitude veneration and other pure feelings of our moral nature and although the discovery of truth is in itself altogether intellectual and dependent merely on our powers of physical perception and abstract intellect wholly independent of our moral nature yet these instruments perception and judgment are so sharpened and brightened and so far more swiftly and effectively used when they have the energy and passion of our moral nature to bring them into actionperception is so quickened by love and judgment so tempered by veneration that practically a man of deadened moral sensation is always dull in his perception of truth and thousands of the highest and most divine truths of nature are wholly concealed from him however constant and indefatigable may be his intellectual search thus then the farther we look the more we are limited in the number of those to whom we should choose to appeal as judges of truth and the more we perceive how great a number of mankind may be partially incapacitated from either discovering or feeling it   § 5 and of the intellectual powers  § 6 how sight depends upon previous knowledge  next to sensibility which is necessary for the perception of facts come reflection and memory which are necessary for the retention of them and recognition of their resemblances for a man may receive impression after impression and that vividly and with delight and yet if he take no care to reason upon those impressions and trace them to their sources he may remain totally ignorant of the facts that produced them nay may attribute them to facts with which they have no connection or may coin causes for them that have no existence at all and the more sensibility and imagination a man possesses the more likely will he be to fall into error for then he will see whatever he expects and admire and judge with his heart and not with his eyes how many people are misled by what has been said and sung of the serenity of italian skies to suppose they must be more blue than the skies of the north and think that they see them so whereas the sky of italy is far more dull and gray in color than the skies of the north and is distinguished only by its intense repose of light and this is confirmed by benvenuto cellini who i remember on his first entering france is especially struck with the clearness of the sky as contrasted with the mist of italy and what is more strange still when people see in a painting what they suppose to have been the source of their impressions they will affirm it to be truthful though they feel no such impression resulting from it thus though day after day they may have been impressed by the tone and warmth of an italian sky yet not having traced the feeling to its source and supposing themselves impressed by its blueness they will affirm a blue sky in a painting to be truthful and reject the most faithful rendering of all the real attributes of italy as cold or dull and this influence of the imagination over the senses is peculiarly observable in the perpetual disposition of mankind to suppose that they see what they know and vice versa in their not seeing what they do not know thus if a child be asked to draw the corner of a house he will lay down something in the form of the letter t he has no conception that the two lines of the roof which he knows to be level produce on his eye the impression of a slope it requires repeated and close attention before he detects this fact or can be made to feel that the lines on his paper are false and the chinese children in all things suppose a good perspective drawing to be as false as we feel their plate patterns to be or wonder at the strange buildings which come to a point at the end and all the early works whether of nations or of men show by their want of shade how little the eye without knowledge is to be depended upon to discover truth the eye of a red indian keen enough to find the trace of his enemy or his prey even in the unnatural turn of a trodden leaf is yet so blunt to the impressions of shade that mr catlin mentions his once having been in great danger from having painted a portrait with the face in halflight which the untutored observers imagined and affirmed to be the painting of half a face barry in his sixth lecture takes notice of the same want of actual sight in the early painters of italy the imitations he says of early art are like those of childrennothing is seen in the spectacle before us unless it be previously known and sought for and numberless observable differences between the age of ignorance and that of knowledge show how much the contraction or extension of our sphere of vision depends upon other considerations than the mere returns of our natural optics and the deception which takes place so broadly in cases like these has infinitely greater influence over our judgment of the more intricate and less tangible truths of nature we are constantly supposing that we see what experience only has shown us or can show us to have existence constantly missing the sight of what we do not know beforehand to be visible and painters to the last hour of their lives are apt to fall in some degree into the error of painting what exists rather than what they can see i shall prove the extent of this error more completely hereafter   § 7 the difficulty increased by the variety of truths in nature  be it also observed that all these difficulties would lie in the way even if the truths of nature were always the same constantly repeated and brought before us but the truths of nature are one eternal changeone infinite variety there is no bush on the face of the globe exactly like another bushthere are no two trees in the forest whose boughs bend into the same network nor two leaves on the same tree which could not be told one from the other nor two waves in the sea exactly alike and out of this mass of various yet agreeing beauty it is by long attention only that the conception of the constant characterthe ideal formhinted at by all yet assumed by none is fixed upon the imagination for its standard of truth  it is not singular therefore nor in any way disgraceful that the majority of spectators are totally incapable of appreciating the truth of nature when fully set before them but it is both singular and disgraceful that it is so difficult to convince them of their own incapability ask the connoisseur who has scampered over all europe the shape of the leaf of an elm and the chances are ninety to one that he cannot tell you and yet he will be voluble of criticism on every painted landscape from dresden to madrid and pretend to tell you whether they are like nature or not ask an enthusiastic chatterer in the sistine chapel how many ribs he has and you get no answer but it is odds that you do not get out of the door without his informing you that he considers such and such a figure badly drawn   § 8 we recognize objects by their least important attributes compare        part i sect i chap 4  a few such interrogations as these might indeed convict if not convince the mass of spectators of incapability were it not for the universal reply that they can recognize what they cannot describe and feel what is truthful though they do not know what is truth and this is to a certain degree true a man may recognize the portrait of his friend though he cannot if you ask him apart tell you the shape of his nose or the height of his forehead and every one could tell nature herself from an imitation why not then it will be asked what is like her from what is not for this simple reason that we constantly recognize things by their least important attributes and by help of very few of those and if these attributes exist not in the imitation though there may be thousands of others far higher and more valuable yet if those be wanting or imperfectly rendered by which we are accustomed to recognize the object we deny the likeness while if these be given though all the great and valuable and important attributes may be wanting we affirm the likeness recognition is no proof of real and intrinsic resemblance we recognize our books by their bindings though the true and essential characteristics lie inside a man is known to his dog by the smellto his tailor by the coatto his friend by the smile each of these know him but how little or how much depends on the dignity of the intelligence that which is truly and indeed characteristic of the man is known only to god one portrait of a man may possess exact accuracy of feature and no atom of expression it may be to use the ordinary terms of admiration bestowed on such portraits by those whom they please as like as it can stare everybody down to his cat would know this another portrait may have neglected or misrepresented the features but may have given the flash of the eye and the peculiar radiance of the lip seen on him only in his hours of highest mental excitement none but his friends would know this another may have given none of his ordinary expressions but one which he wore in the most excited instant of his life when all his secret passions and all his highest powers were brought into play at once none but those who had then seen him might recognize this as like but which would be the most truthful portrait of the man the first gives the accidents of bodythe sport of climate and food and timewhich corruption inhabits and the worm waits for the second gives the stamp of the soul upon the flesh but it is the soul seen in the emotions which it shares with manywhich may not be characteristic of its essencethe results of habit and education and accidenta gloze whether purposely worn or unconsciously assumed perhaps totally contrary to all that is rooted and real in the mind that it conceals the third has caught the trace of all that was most hidden and most mighty when all hypocrisy and all habit and all petty and passing emotionthe ice and the bank and the foam of the immortal riverwere shivered and broken and swallowed up in the awakening of its inward strength when the call and claim of some divine motive had brought into visible being those latent forces and feelings which the spirits own volition could not summon nor its consciousness comprehend which god only knew and god only could awaken the depth and the mystery of its peculiar and separating attributes and so it is with external nature she has a body and a soul like man but her soul is the deity it is possible to represent the body without the spirit and this shall be like to those whose senses are only cognizant of body it is possible to represent the spirit in its ordinary and inferior manifestations and this shall be like to those who have not watched for its moments of power it is possible to represent the spirit in its secret and high operations and this shall be like only to those to whose watching they have been revealed all these are truth but according to the dignity of the truths he can represent or feel is the power of the painterthe justice of the judge                                      chapter iii      of the relative importance of truthsfirst that particular truths                      are more important than general ones   § 1 necessity of determining the relative importance of truths  i have in the last chapter affirmed that we usually recognize objects by their least essential characteristics this very naturally excites the inquiry what i consider their important characteristics and why i call one truth more important than another and this question must be immediately determined because it is evident that in judging of the truth of painters we shall have to consider not only the accuracy with which individual truths are given but the relative importance of the truths themselves for as it constantly happens that the powers of art are unable to render all truths that artist must be considered the most truthful who has preserved the most important at the expense of the most trifling   § 2 misapplication of the aphorism general truths are more important        than particular ones  § 3 falseness of this maxim taken without explanation  § 4 generality important in the subject particularity in the        predicate  now if we are to begin our investigation in aristotles way and look at the greek phainomena of the subject we shall immediately stumble over a maxim which is in everybodys mouth and which as it is understood in practice is true and useful as it is usually applied in argument false and misleading general truths are more important than particular ones often when in conversation i have been praising turner for his perpetual variety and for giving so particular and separate a character to each of his compositions that the mind of the painter can only be estimated by seeing all that he has ever done and that nothing can be prophesied of a picture coming into existence on his easel but that it will be totally different in idea from all that he has ever done before and when i have opposed this inexhaustible knowledge or imagination whichever it may be to the perpetual repetition of some halfdozen conceptions by claude and poussin i have been met by the formidable objection enunciated with much dignity and selfsatisfaction on the part of my antagonistthat is not painting general truths that is painting particular truths now there must be something wrong in that application of a principle which would make the variety and abundance which we look for as the greatest sign of intellect in the writer the greatest sign of error in the painter and we shall accordingly see by an application of it to other matters that taken without limitation the whole proposition is utterly false for instance mrs jameson somewhere mentions the exclamation of a lady of her acquaintance more desirous to fill a pause in conversation than abundant in sources of observation what an excellent book the bible is this was a very general truth indeed a truth predicable of the bible in common with many other books but it certainly is neither striking nor important had the lady exclaimedhow evidently is the bible a divine revelation she would have expressed a particular truth one predicable of the bible only but certainly far more interesting and important had she on the contrary informed us that the bible was a book she would have been still more general and still less entertaining if i ask any one who somebody else is and receive for answer that he is a man i get little satisfaction for my pains but if i am told that he is sir isaac newton i immediately thank my neighbor for his information the fact is and the above instances may serve at once to prove it if it be not selfevident that generality gives importance to the subject and limitation or particularity to the predicate if i say that such and such a man in china is an opiumeater i say nothing very interesting because my subject such a man is particular if i say that all men in china are opiumeaters i say something interesting because my subject all men is general if i say that all men in china eat i say nothing interesting because my predicate eat is general if i say that all men in china eat opium i say something interesting because my predicate eat opium is particular  now almost everything which with reference to a given subject a painter has to ask himself whether he shall represent or not is a predicate hence in art particular truths are usually more important than general ones  how is it then that anything so plain as this should be contradicted by one of the most universally received aphorisms respecting art a little reflection will show us under what limitations this maxim may be true in practice   § 5 the importance of truths of species is not owing to their        generality  § 6 all truths valuable as they are characteristic  it is selfevident that when we are painting or describing anything those truths must be the most important which are most characteristic of what is to be told or represented now that which is first and most broadly characteristic of a thing is that which distinguishes its genus or which makes it what it is for instance that which makes drapery be drapery is not its being made of silk or worsted or flax for things are made of all these which are not drapery but the ideas peculiar to drapery the properties which when inherent in a thing make it drapery are extension nonelastic flexibility unity and comparative thinness everything which has these properties a waterfall for instance if united and extended or a net of weeds over a wall is drapery as much as silk or woollen stuff is so that these ideas separate drapery in our minds from everything else they are peculiarly characteristic of it and therefore are the most important group of ideas connected with it and so with everything else that which makes the thing what it is is the most important idea or group of ideas connected with the thing but as this idea must necessarily be common to all individuals of the species it belongs to it is a general idea with respect to that species while other ideas which are not characteristic of the species and are therefore in reality general as black or white are terms applicable to more things than drapery are yet particular with respect to that species being predicable only of certain individuals of it hence it is carelessly and falsely said that general ideas are more important than particular ones carelessly and falsely i say because the socalled general idea is important not because it is common to all the individuals of that species but because it separates that species from everything else it is the distinctiveness not the universality of the truth which renders it important and the socalled particular idea is unimportant not because it is not predicable of the whole species but because it is predicable of things out of that species it is not its individuality but its generality which renders it unimportant so then truths are important just in proportion as they are characteristic and are valuable primarily as they separate the species from all other created things secondarily as they separate the individuals of that species from one another thus silken or woollen are unimportant ideas with respect to drapery because they neither separate the species from other things nor even the individuals of that species from one another since though not common to the whole of it they are common to indefinite numbers of it but the particular folds into which any piece of drapery may happen to fall being different in many particulars from those into which any other piece of drapery will fall are expressive not only of the characters of the species flexibility nonelasticity etc but of individuality and definite character in the case immediately observed and are consequently most important and necessary ideas so in a man to be shortlegged or longnosed or anything else of accidental quality does not distinguish him from other shortlegged or longnosed animals but the important truths respecting a man are first the marked development of that distinctive organization which separates him as man from other animals and secondly that group of qualities which distinguish the individual from all other men which make him paul or judas newton or shakspeare   § 7 otherwise truths of species are valuable because beautiful  such are the real sources of importance in truths as far as they are considered with reference merely to their being general or particular but there are other sources of importance which give farther weight to the ordinary opinion of the greater value of those which are general and which render this opinion right in practice i mean the intrinsic beauty of the truths themselves a quality which it is not here the place to investigate but which must just be noticed as invariably adding value to truths of species rather than to those of individuality the qualities and properties which characterize man or any other animal as a species are the perfection of his or its form of mind almost all individual differences arising from imperfections hence a truth of species is the more valuable to art because it must always be a beauty while a truth of individuals is commonly in some sort or way a defect   § 8 and many truths valuable if separate may be objectionable in        connection with others  again a truth which may be of great interest when an object is viewed by itself may be objectionable when it is viewed in relation to other objects thus if we were painting a piece of drapery as our whole subject it would be proper to give in it every source of entertainment which particular truths could supply to give it varied color and delicate texture but if we paint this same piece of drapery as part of the dress of a madonna all these ideas of richness or texture become thoroughly contemptible and unfit to occupy the mind at the same moment with the idea of the virgin the conception of drapery is then to be suggested by the simplest and slightest means possible and all notions of texture and detail are to be rejected with utter reprobation but this observe is not because they are particular or general or anything else with respect to the drapery itself but because they draw the attention to the dress instead of the saint and disturb and degrade the imagination and the feelings hence we ought to give the conception of the drapery in the most unobtrusive way possible by rendering those essential qualities distinctly which are necessary to the very existence of drapery and not one more  with these last two sources of the importance of truths we have nothing to do at present as they are dependent upon ideas of beauty and relation i merely allude to them now to show that all that is alleged by sir j reynolds and other scientific writers respecting the kind of truths proper to be represented by the painter or sculptor is perfectly just and right while yet the principle on which they base their selection that general truths are more important than particular ones is altogether false canovas perseus in the vatican is entirely spoiled by an unlucky tassel in the folds of the mantle which the next admirer of canova who passes would do well to knock off but it is spoiled not because this is a particular truth but because it is a contemptible unnecessary and ugly truth the button which fastens the vest of the sistine daniel is as much a particular truth as this but it is a necessary one and the idea of it is given by the simplest possible means hence it is right and beautiful   § 9 recapitulation  finally then it is to be remembered that all truths as far as their being particular or general affects their value at all are valuable in proportion as they are particular and valueless in proportion as they are general or to express the proposition in simpler terms every truth is valuable in proportion as it is characteristic of the thing of which it is affirmed                                      chapter iv          of the relative importance of truthssecondly that rare truths                      are more important than frequent ones   § 1 no accidental violation of natures principles should be        represented  it will be necessary next for us to determine how far frequency or rarity can affect the importance of truths and whether the artist is to be considered the most truthful who paints what is common or what is unusual in nature  now the whole determination of this question depends upon whether the unusual fact be a violation of natures general principles or the application of some of those principles in a peculiar and striking way nature sometimes though very rarely violates her own principles it is her principle to make everything beautiful but now and then for an instant she permits what compared with the rest of her works might be called ugly it is true that even these rare blemishes are permitted as i have above said for a good purpose part i sec i chap 5 they are valuable in nature and used as she uses them are equally valuable as instantaneous discords in art but the artist who should seek after these exclusively and paint nothing else though he might be able to point to something in nature as the original of every one of his uglinesses would yet be in the strict sense of the word falsefalse to nature and disobedient to her laws for instance it is the practice of nature to give character to the outlines of her clouds by perpetual angles and right lines perhaps once in a month by diligent watching we might be able to see a cloud altogether rounded and made up of curves but the artist who paints nothing but curved clouds must yet be considered thoroughly and inexcusably false   § 2 but the cases in which those principles have been strikingly        exemplified  § 3 which are comparatively rare  § 4 all repetition is blamable  § 5 the duty of the painter is the same as that of a preacher  but the case is widely different when instead of a principle violated we have one extraordinarily carried out or manifested under unusual circumstances though nature is constantly beautiful she does not exhibit her highest powers of beauty constantly for then they would satiate us and pall upon our senses it is necessary to their appreciation that they should be rarely shown her finest touches are things which must be watched for her most perfect passages of beauty are the most evanescent she is constantly doing something beautiful for us but it is something which she has not done before and will not do again some exhibition of her general powers in particular circumstances which if we do not catch at the instant it is passing will not be repeated for us now they are these evanescent passages of perfected beauty these perpetually varied examples of utmost power which the artist ought to seek for and arrest no supposition can be more absurd than that effects or truths frequently exhibited are more characteristic of nature than those which are equally necessary by her laws though rarer in occurrence both the frequent and the rare are parts of the same great system to give either exclusively is imperfect truth and to repeat the same effect or thought in two pictures is wasted life what should we think of a poet who should keep all his life repeating the same thought in different words and why should we be more lenient to the parrotpainter who has learned one lesson from the page of nature and keeps stammering it out with eternal repetition without turning the leaf is it less tautology to describe a thing over and over again with lines than it is with words the teaching of nature is as varied and infinite as it is constant and the duty of the painter is to watch for every one of her lessons and to give for human life will admit of nothing more those in which she has manifested each of her principles in the most peculiar and striking way the deeper his research and the rarer the phenomena he has noted the more valuable will his works be to repeat himself even in a single instance is treachery to nature for a thousand human lives would not be enough to give one instance of the perfect manifestation of each of her powers and as for combining or classifying them as well might a preacher expect in one sermon to express and explain every divine truth which can be gathered out of gods revelation as a painter expect in one composition to express and illustrate every lesson which can be received from gods creation both are commentators on infinity and the duty of both is to take for each discourse one essential truth seeking particularly and insisting especially on those which are less palpable to ordinary observation and more likely to escape an indolent research and to impress that and that alone upon those whom they address with every illustration that can be furnished by their knowledge and every adornment attainable by their power and the real truthfulness of the painter is in proportion to the number and variety of the facts he has so illustrated those facts being always as above observed the realization not the violation of a general principle the quantity of truth is in proportion to the number of such facts and its value and instructiveness in proportion to their rarity all really great pictures therefore exhibit the general habits of nature manifested in some peculiar rare and beautiful way                                      chapter v           of the relative importance of truthsthirdly that truths of                  color are the least important of all truths   § 1 difference between primary and secondary qualities in bodies  in the two last chapters we have pointed out general tests of the importance of all truths which will be sufficient at once to distinguish certain classes of properties in bodies as more necessary to be told than others because more characteristic either of the particular thing to be represented or of the principles of nature  according to locke book ii chap 8 there are three sorts of qualities in bodies first the bulk figure number situation and motion or rest of their solid parts those that are in them whether we perceive them or not these he calls primary qualities secondly the power that is in any body to operate after a peculiar manner on any of our senses sensible qualities and thirdly the power that is in any body to make such a change in another body as that it shall operate on our senses differently from what it did before these last being usually called powers   § 2 the first are fully characteristic the second imperfectly so  hence he proceeds to prove that those which he calls primary qualities are indeed part of the essence of the body and characteristic of it but that the two other kinds of qualities which together he calls secondary are neither of them more than powers of producing on other objects or in us certain effects and sensations now a power of influence is always equally characteristic of two objectsthe active and passive for it is as much necessary that there should be a power in the object suffering to receive the impression as in the object acting to give the impression compare locke book ii chap 21 sect 2 for supposing two people as is frequently the case perceive different scents in the same flower it is evident that the power in the flower to give this or that depends on the nature of their nerves as well as on that of its own particles and that we are as correct in saying it is a power in us to perceive as in the object to impress every power therefore being characteristic of the nature of two bodies is imperfectly and incompletely characteristic of either separately but the primary qualities being characteristic only of the body in which they are inherent are the most important truths connected with it for the question what the thing is must precede and be of more importance than the question what can it do   § 3 color is a secondary quality therefore less important than form  now by lockes definition above given only bulk figure situation and motion or rest of solid parts are primary qualities hence all truths of color sink at once into the second rank he therefore who has neglected a truth of form for a truth of color has neglected a greater truth for a less one   § 4 color no distinction between objects of the same species  and that color is indeed a most unimportant characteristic of objects will be farther evident on the slightest consideration the color of plants is constantly changing with the season and of everything with the quality of light falling on it but the nature and essence of the thing are independent of these changes an oak is an oak whether green with spring or red with winter a dahlia is a dahlia whether it be yellow or crimson and if some monsterhunting botanist should ever frighten the flower blue still it will be a dahlia but let one curve of the petalsone groove of the stamens be wanting and the flower ceases to be the same let the roughness of the bark and the angles of the boughs be smoothed or diminished and the oak ceases to be an oak but let it retain its inward structure and outward form and though its leaves grew white or pink or blue or tricolor it would be a white oak or a pink oak or a republican oak but an oak still again color is hardly ever even a possible distinction between two objects of the same species two trees of the same kind at the same season and of the same age are of absolutely the same color but they are not of the same form nor anything like it there can be no difference in the color of two pieces of rock broken from the same place but it is impossible they should be of the same form so that form is not only the chief characteristic of species but the only characteristic of individuals of a species   § 5 and different in association from what it is alone  again a color in association with other colors is different from the same color seen by itself it has a distinct and peculiar power upon the retina dependent on its association consequently the color of any object is not more dependent upon the nature of the object itself and the eye beholding it than on the color of the objects near it in this respect also therefore it is no characteristic   § 6 it is not certain whether any two people see the same color in        things  and so great is the uncertainty with respect to those qualities or powers which depend as much on the nature of the object suffering as of the object acting that it is totally impossible to prove that one man sees in the same thing the same color that another does though he may use the same name for it one man may see yellow where another sees blue but as the effect is constant they agree in the term to be used for it and both call it blue or both yellow having yet totally different ideas attached to the term and yet neither can be said to see falsely because the color is not in the thing but in the thing and them together but if they see forms differently one must see falsely because the form is positive in the object my friend may see boars blue for anything i know but it is impossible he should see them with paws instead of hoofs unless his eyes or brain are diseased compare locke book ii chap xxxii § 15 but i do not speak of this uncertainty as capable of having any effect on art because though perhaps landseer sees dogs of the color which i should call blue yet the color he puts on the canvas being in the same way blue to him will still be brown or dogcolor to me and so we may argue on points of color just as if all men saw alike as indeed in all probability they do but i merely mention this uncertainty to show farther the vagueness and unimportance of color as a characteristic of bodies   § 7 form considered as an element of landscape includes light and        shade  § 8 importance of light and shade in expressing the character of bodies        and unimportance of color  before going farther however i must explain the sense in which i have used the word form because painters have a most inaccurate and careless habit of confining the term to the outline of bodies whereas it necessarily implies light and shade it is true that the outline and the chiaroscuro must be separate subjects of investigation with the student but no form whatsoever can be known to the eye in the slightest degree without its chiaroscuro and therefore in speaking of form generally as an element of landscape i mean that perfect and harmonious unity of outline with light and shade by which all the parts and projections and proportions of a body are fully explained to the eye being nevertheless perfectly independent of sight or power in other objects the presence of light upon a body being a positive existence whether we are aware of it or not and in no degree dependent upon our senses this being understood the most convincing proof of the unimportance of color lies in the accurate observation of the way in which any material object impresses itself on the mind if we look at nature carefully we shall find that her colors are in a state of perpetual confusion and indistinctness while her forms as told by light and shade are invariably clear distinct and speaking the stones and gravel of the bank catch green reflections from the boughs above the bushes receive grays and yellows from the ground every hairbreadth of polished surface gives a little bit of the blue of the sky or the gold of the sun like a star upon the local color this local color changeful and uncertain in itself is again disguised and modified by the hue of the light or quenched in the gray of the shadow and the confusion and blending of tint is altogether so great that were we left to find out what objects were by their colors only we would scarcely in places distinguish the boughs of a tree from the air beyond them or the ground beneath them i know that people unpractised in art will not believe this at first but if they have accurate powers of observation they may soon ascertain it for themselves they will find that while they can scarcely ever determine the exact hue of anything except when it occurs in large masses as in a green field or the blue sky the form as told by light and shade is always decided and evident and the source of the chief character of every object light and shade indeed so completely conquer the distinctions of local color that the difference in hue between the illumined parts of a white and black object is not so great as the difference in sunshine between the illumined and dark side of either separately   § 9 recapitulation  we shall see hereafter in considering ideas of beauty that color even as a source of pleasure is feeble compared to form but this we cannot insist upon at present we have only to do with simple truth and the observations we have made are sufficient to prove that the artist who sacrifices or forgets a truth of form in the pursuit of a truth of color sacrifices what is definite to what is uncertain and what is essential to what is accidental                                      chapter vi                                 recapitulation   § 1 the importance of historical truths  it ought farther to be observed respecting truths in general that those are always most valuable which are most historical that is which tell us most about the past and future states of the object to which they belong in a tree for instance it is more important to give the appearance of energy and elasticity in the limbs which is indicative of growth and life than any particular character of leaf or texture of bough it is more important that we should feel that the uppermost sprays are creeping higher and higher into the sky and be impressed with the current of life and motion which is animating every fibre than that we should know the exact pitch of relief with which those fibres are thrown out against the sky for the first truths tell us tales about the tree about what it has been and will be while the last are characteristic of it only in its present state and are in no way talkative about themselves talkative facts are always more interesting and more important than silent ones so again the lines in a crag which mark its stratification and how it has been washed and rounded by water or twisted and drawn out in fire are more important because they tell more than the stains of the lichens which change year by year and the accidental fissures of frost or decomposition not but that both of these are historical but historical in a less distinct manner and for shorter periods   § 2 form as explained by light and shade the first of all truths        tone light and color are secondary  hence in general the truths of specific form are the first and most important of all and next to them those truths of chiaroscuro which are necessary to make us understand every quality and part of forms and the relative distances of objects among each other and in consequence their relative bulks altogether lower than these as truths though often most important as beauties stand all effects of chiaroscuro which are productive merely of imitations of light and tone and all effects of color to make us understand the space of the sky is an end worthy of the artists highest powers to hit its particular blue or gold is an end to be thought of when we have accomplished the first and not till then   § 3 and deceptive chiaroscuro the lowest of all  finally far below all these come those particular accuraciesor tricks of chiaroscuro which cause objects to look projecting from the canvas not worthy of the name of truths because they require for their attainment the sacrifice of all others for not having at our disposal the same intensity of light by which nature illustrates her objects we are obliged if we would have perfect deception in one to destroy its relation to the rest compare sect ii chap v and thus he who throws one object out of his picture never lets the spectator into it michael angelo bids you follow his phantoms into the abyss of heaven but a modern french painter drops his hero out of the picture frame  this solidity or projection then is the very lowest truth that art can give it is the painting of mere matter giving that as food for the eye which is properly only the subject of touch it can neither instruct nor exalt nor please except as jugglery it addresses no sense of beauty nor of power and wherever it characterizes the general aim of a picture it is the sign and the evidence of the vilest and lowest mechanism which art can be insulted by giving name to                                      chapter vii                general application of the foregoing principles   § 1 the different selection of facts consequent on the several aims at        imitation or at truth  we have seen in the preceding chapters some proof of what was before asserted that the truths necessary for deceptive imitation are not only few but of the very lowest order we thus find painters ranging themselves into two great classes one aiming at the development of the exquisite truths of specific form refined color and ethereal space and content with the clear and impressive suggestion of any of these by whatsoever means obtained and the other casting all these aside to attain those particular truths of tone and chiaroscuro which may trick the spectator into a belief of reality the first class if they have to paint a tree are intent upon giving the exquisite designs of intersecting undulation in its boughs the grace of its leafage the intricacy of its organization and all those qualities which make it lovely or affecting of its kind the second endeavor only to make you believe that you are looking at wood they are totally regardless of truths or beauties of form a stump is as good as a trunk for all their purposes so that they can only deceive the eye into the supposition that it is a stump and not canvas   § 2 the old masters as a body aim only at imitation  § 3 what truths they gave  to which of these classes the great body of the old landscape painters belonged may be partly gathered from the kind of praise which is bestowed upon them by those who admire them most which either refers to technical matters dexterity of touch clever oppositions of color etc or is bestowed on the power of the painter to deceive m de marmontel going into a connoisseurs gallery pretends to mistake a fine berghem for a window this he says was affirmed by its possessor to be the greatest praise the picture had ever received such is indeed the notion of art which is at the bottom of the veneration usually felt for the old landscape painters it is of course the palpable first idea of ignorance it is the only notion which people unacquainted with art can by any possibility have of its ends the only test by which people unacquainted with nature can pretend to form anything like judgment of art it is strange that with the great historical painters of italy before them who had broken so boldly and indignantly from the trammels of this notion and shaken the very dust of it from their feet the succeeding landscape painters should have wasted their lives in jugglery but so it is and so it will be felt the more we look into their works that the deception of the senses was the great and first end of all their art to attain this they paid deep and serious attention to effects of light and tone and to the exact degree of relief which material objects take against light and atmosphere and sacrificing every other truth to these not necessarily but because they required no others for deception they succeeded in rendering these particular facts with a fidelity and force which in the pictures that have come down to us uninjured are as yet unequalled and never can be surpassed they painted their foregrounds with laborious industry covering them with details so as to render them deceptive to the ordinary eye regardless of beauty or truth in the details themselves they painted their trees with careful attention to their pitch of shade against the sky utterly regardless of all that is beautiful or essential in the anatomy of their foliage and boughs they painted their distances with exquisite use of transparent color and aerial tone totally neglectful of all facts and forms which nature uses such color and tone to relieve and adorn they had neither love of nature nor feeling of her beauty they looked for her coldest and most commonplace effects because they were easiest to imitate and for her most vulgar forms because they were most easily to be recognized by the untaught eyes of those whom alone they could hope to please they did it like the pharisee of old to be seen of men and they had their reward they do deceive and delight the unpractised eye they will to all ages as long as their colors endure be the standards of excellence with all who ignorant of nature claim to be thought learned in art and they will to all ages be to those who have thorough love and knowledge of the creation which they libel instructive proofs of the limited number and low character of the truths which are necessary and the accumulated multitude of pure broad bold falsehoods which are admissible in pictures meant only to deceive  there is of course more or less accuracy of knowledge and execution combined with this aim at effect according to the industry and precision of eye possessed by the master and more or less of beauty in the forms selected according to his natural taste but both the beauty and truth are sacrificed unhesitatingly where they interfere with the great effort at deception claude had if it had been cultivated a fine feeling for beauty of form and is seldom ungraceful in his foliage but his picture when examined with reference to essential truth is one mass of error from beginning to end cuyp on the other hand could paint close truth of everything except ground and water with decision and success but he has no sense of beauty gaspar poussin more ignorant of truth than claude and almost as dead to beauty as cuyp has yet a perception of the feeling and moral truth of nature which often redeems the picture but yet in all of them everything that they can do is done for deception and nothing for the sake or love of what they are painting   § 4 the principles of selection adopted by modern artists  modern landscape painters have looked at nature with totally different eyes seeking not for what is easiest to imitate but for what is most important to tell rejecting at once all idea of bona fide imitation they think only of conveying the impression of nature into the mind of the spectator and there is in consequence a greater sum of valuable essential and impressive truth in the works of two or three of our leading modern landscape painters than in those of all the old masters put together and of truth too nearly unmixed with definite or avoidable falsehood while the unimportant and feeble truths of the old masters are choked with a mass of perpetual defiance of the most authoritative laws of nature   § 5 general feeling of claude salvator and g poussin contrasted        with the freedom and vastness of nature  i do not expect this assertion to be believed at present it must rest for demonstration on the examination we are about to enter upon yet even without reference to any intricate or deeplaid truths it appears strange to me that any one familiar with nature and fond of her should not grow weary and sick at heart among the melancholy and monotonous transcripts of her which alone can be received from the old school of art a man accustomed to the broad wild seashore with its bright breakers and free winds and sounding rocks and eternal sensation of tameless power can scarcely but be angered when claude bids him stand still on some paltry chipped and chiselled quay with porters and wheelbarrows running against him to watch a weak rippling bound and barriered water that has not strength enough in one of its waves to upset the flowerpots on the wall or even to fling one jet of spray over the confining stone a man accustomed to the strength and glory of gods mountains with their soaring and radiant pinnacles and surging sweeps of measureless distance kingdoms in their valleys and climates upon their crests can scarcely but be angered when salvator bids him stand still under some contemptible fragment of splintery crag which an alpine snowwreath would smother in its first swell with a stunted bush or two growing out of it and a volume of manufactory smoke for a sky a man accustomed to the grace and infinity of natures foliage with every vista a cathedral and every bough a revelation can scarcely but be angered when poussin mocks him with a black round mass of impenetrable paint diverging into feathers instead of leaves and supported on a stick instead of a trunk the fact is there is one thing wanting in all the doing of these men and that is the very virtue by which the work of human mind chiefly rises above that of the daguerreotype or calotype or any other mechanical means that ever have been or may be invented love there is no evidence of their ever having gone to nature with any thirst or received from her such emotion as could make them even for an instant lose sight of themselves there is in them neither earnestness nor humility there is no simple or honest record of any single truth none of the plain words nor straight efforts that men speak and make when they once feel   § 6 inadequacy of the landscape of titian and tintoret  nor is it only by the professed landscape painters that the great verities of the material world are betrayed grand as are the motives of landscape in the works of the earlier and mightier men there is yet in them nothing approaching to a general view nor complete rendering of natural phenomena not that they are to be blamed for this for they took out of nature that which was fit for their purpose and their mission was to do no more but we must be cautious to distinguish that imaginative abstraction of landscape which alone we find in them from the entire statement of truth which has been attempted by the moderns i have said in the chapter on symmetry in the second volume that all landscape grandeur vanishes before that of titian and tintoret and this is true of whatever these two giants touchedbut they touched little a few level flakes of chestnut foliage a blue abstraction of hill forms from cadore or the euganeans a grand mass or two of glowing ground and mighty herbage and a few burning fields of quiet cloud were all they needed there is evidence of tintorets having felt more than this but it occurs only in secondary fragments of rock cloud or pine hardly noticed among the accumulated interest of his human subject from the window of titians house at venice the chain of the tyrolese alps is seen lifted in spectral power above the tufted plain of treviso every dawn that reddens the towers of murano lights also a line of pyramidal fires along that colossal ridge but there is so far as i know no evidence in any of the masters works of his ever having beheld much less felt the majesty of their burning the dark firmament and saddened twilight of tintoret are sufficient for their end but the sun never plunges behind san giorgio in aliga without such retinue of radiant cloud such rest of zoned light on the green lagoon as never received image from his hand more than this of that which they loved and rendered much is rendered conventionally by noble conventionalities indeed but such nevertheless as would be inexcusable if the landscape became the principal subject instead of an accompaniment i will instance only the san pietro martire which if not the most perfect is at least the most popular of titians landscapes in which to obtain light on the flesh of the near figures the sky is made as dark as deep sea the mountains are laid in with violent and impossible blue except one of them on the left which to connect the distant light with the foreground is thrown into light relief unexplained by its materials unlikely in its position and in its degree impossible under any circumstances   § 7 causes of its want of influence on subsequent schools  i do not instance these as faults in the picture there are no works of very powerful color which are free from conventionality concentrated or diffused daring or disguised but as the conventionality of this whole picture is mainly thrown into the landscape it is necessary while we acknowledge the virtue of this distance as a part of the great composition to be on our guard against the license it assumes and the attractiveness of its overcharged color fragments of far purer truth occur in the works of tintoret and in the drawing of foliage whether rapid or elaborate of masses or details the venetian painters taken as a body may be considered almost faultless models but the whole field of what they have done is so narrow and therein is so much of what is only relatively right and in itself false or imperfect that the young and inexperienced painter could run no greater risk than the too early taking them for teachers and to the general spectator their landscape is valuable rather as a means of peculiar and solemn emotion than as ministering to or inspiring the universal love of nature hence while men of serious mind especially those whose pursuits have brought them into continued relations with the peopled rather than the lonely world will always look to the venetian painters as having touched those simple chords of landscape harmony which are most in unison with earnest and melancholy feeling those whose philosophy is more cheerful and more extended as having been trained and colored among simple and solitary nature will seek for a wider and more systematic circle of teaching they may grant that the barred horizontal gloom of the titian sky and the massy leaves of the titian forest are among the most sublime of the conceivable forms of material things but they know that the virtue of these very forms is to be learned only by right comparison of them with the cheerfulness fulness and comparative inquietness of other hours and scenes that they are not intended for the continual food but the occasional soothing of the human heart that there is a lesson of not less value in its place though of less concluding and sealing authority in every one of the more humble phases of material things and that there are some lessons of equal or greater authority which these masters neither taught nor received and until the school of modern landscape arose art had never noted the links of this mighty chain it mattered not that a fragment lay here and there no heavenly lightning could descend by it the landscape of the venetians was without effect on any contemporary in subsequent schools it still remains on the continent as useless as if it had never existed and at this moment german and italian landscapes of which no words are scornful enough to befit the utter degradation hang in the venetian academy in the next room to the desert of titian and the paradise of tintoret6   § 8 the value of inferior works of art how to be estimated  that then which i would have the reader inquire respecting every work of art of undetermined merit submitted to his judgment is not whether it be a work of especial grandeur importance or power but whether it have any virtue or substance as a link in this chain of truth whether it have recorded or interpreted anything before unknown whether it have added one single stone to our heavenpointing pyramid cut away one dark bough or levelled one rugged hillock in our path this if it be an honest work of art it must have done for no man ever yet worked honestly without giving some such help to his race god appoints to every one of his creatures a separate mission and if they discharge it honorably if they quit themselves like men and faithfully follow that light which is in them withdrawing from it all cold and quenching influence there will assuredly come of it such burning as in its appointed mode and measure shall shine before men and be of service constant and holy degrees infinite of lustre there must always be but the weakest among us has a gift however seemingly trivial which is peculiar to him and which worthily used will be a gift also to his race forever  fool not says george herbert                                     for all may have        if they dare choose a glorious life or grave  if on the contrary there be nothing of this freshness achieved if there be neither purpose nor fidelity in what is done if it be an envious or powerless imitation of other mens labors if it be a display of mere manual dexterity or curious manufacture or if in any other mode it show itself as having its origin in vanitycast it out it matters not what powers of mind may have been concerned or corrupted in it all have lost their savor it is worse than worthlessperilouscast it out  works of art are indeed always of mixed kind their honesty being more or less corrupted by the various weaknesses of the painter by his vanity his idleness or his cowardice the fear of doing right has far more influence on art than is commonly thought that only is altogether to be rejected which is altogether vain idle and cowardly of the rest the rank is to be estimated rather by the purity of their metal than the coined value of it   § 9 religious landscape of italy the admirableness of its completion  keeping these principles in view let us endeavor to obtain something like a general view of the assistance which has been rendered to our study of nature by the various occurrences of landscape in elder art and by the more exclusively directed labors of modern schools  to the ideal landscape of the early religious painters of italy i have alluded in the concluding chapter of the second volume it is absolutely right and beautiful in its peculiar application but its grasp of nature is narrow and its treatment in most respects too severe and conventional to form a profitable example when the landscape is to be alone the subject of thought the great virtue of it is its entire exquisite and humble realization of those objects it selects in this respect differing from such german imitations of it as i have met with that there is no effort of any fanciful or ornamental modifications but loving fidelity to the thing studied the foreground plants are usually neither exaggerated nor stiffened they do not form arches or frames or borders their grace is unconfined their simplicity undestroyed cima da conegliano in his picture in the church of the madonna dell orto at venice has given us the oak the fig the beautiful erba della madonna on the wall precisely such a bunch of it as may be seen growing at this day on the marble steps of that very church ivy and other creepers and a strawberry plant in the foreground with a blossom and a berry just set and one half ripe and one ripe all patiently and innocently painted from the real thing and therefore most divine fra angelicos use of the oxalis acetosella is as faithful in representation as touching in feeling7 the ferns that grow on the walls of fiesole may be seen in their simple verity on the architecture of ghirlandajo the rose the myrtle and the lily the olive and orange pomegranate and vine have received their fairest portraiture where they bear a sacred character even the common plantains and mallows of the waysides are touched with deep reverence by raffaelle and indeed for the perfect treatment of details of this kind treatment as delicate and affectionate as it is elevated and manly it is to the works of these schools alone that we can refer and on this their peculiar excellence i should the more earnestly insist because it is of a kind altogether neglected by the english school and with most unfortunate result many of our best painters missing their deserved rank solely from the want of it as gainsborough and all being more or less checked in their progress or vulgarized in their aim   § 10 finish and the want of it how right and how wrong  it is a misfortune for all honest critics that hardly any quality of art is independently to be praised and without reference to the motive from which it resulted and the place in which it appears so that no principle can be simply enforced but it shall seem to countenance a vice while the work of qualification and explanation both weakens the force of what is said and is not perhaps always likely to be with patience received so also those who desire to misunderstand or to oppose have it always in their power to become obtuse listeners or specious opponents thus i hardly dare insist upon the virtue of completion lest i should be supposed a defender of wouvermans or gerard dow neither can i adequately praise the power of tintoret without fearing to be thought adverse to holbein or perugino the fact is that both finish and impetuosity specific minuteness or large abstraction may be the signs of passion or of its reverse may result from affection or indifference intellect or dulness some men finish from intense love of the beautiful in the smallest parts of what they do others in pure incapability of comprehending anything but parts others to show their dexterity with the brush and prove expenditure of time some are impetuous and bold in their handling from having great thoughts to express which are independent of detail others because they have bad taste or have been badly taught others from vanity and others from indolence compare vol ii chap ix § 8 now both the finish and incompletion are right where they are the signs of passion or of thought and both are wrong and i think the finish the more contemptible of the two when they cease to be so the modern italians will paint every leaf of a laurel or rosebush without the slightest feeling of their beauty or character and without showing one spark of intellect or affection from beginning to end anything is better than this and yet the very highest schools do the same thing or nearly so but with totally different motives and perceptions and the result is divine on the whole i conceive that the extremes of good and evil lie with the finishers and that whatever glorious power we may admit in men like tintoret whatever attractiveness of method to rubens rembrandt or though in far less degree our own reynolds still the thoroughly great men are those who have done everything thoroughly and who in a word have never despised anything however small of gods making and this is the chief fault of our english landscapists that they have not the intense allobserving penetration of wellbalanced mind they have not except in one or two instances anything of that feeling which wordsworth shows in the following lines             so fair so sweet withal so sensitive             would that the little flowers were born to live             conscious of half the pleasure which they give             that to this mountain daisys self were known             the beauty of its starshaped shadow thrown             on the smooth surface of this naked stone  that is a little bit of good downright foreground paintingno mistake about it daisy and shadow and stone texture and all our painters must come to this before they have done their duty and yet on the other hand let them beware of finishing for the sake of finish all over their picture the ground is not to be all over daisies nor is every daisy to have its starshaped shadow there is as much finish in the right concealment of things as in the right exhibition of them and while i demand this amount of specific character where nature shows it i demand equal fidelity to her where she conceals it to paint mist rightly space rightly and light rightly it may be often necessary to paint nothing else rightly but the rule is simple for all that if the artist is painting something that he knows and loves as he knows it because he loves it whether it be the fair strawberry of cima or the clear sky of francia or the blazing incomprehensible mist of turner he is all right but the moment he does anything as he thinks it ought to be because he does not care about it he is all wrong he has only to ask himself whether he cares for anything except himself so far as he does he will make a good picture so far as he thinks of himself a vile one this is the root of the viciousness of the whole french school industry they have learning they have power they have feeling they have yet not so much feeling as ever to force them to forget themselves even for a moment the ruling motive is invariably vanity and the picture therefore an abortion   § 11 the open skies of the religious schools how valuable mountain         drawing of masaccio landscape of the bellinis and giorgione  returning to the pictures of the religious schools we find that their open skies are also of the highest value their preciousness is such that no subsequent schools can by comparison be said to have painted sky at all but only clouds or mist or blue canopies the golden sky of marco basaiti in the academy of venice altogether overpowers and renders valueless that of titian beside it those of francia in the gallery of bologna are even more wonderful because cooler in tone and behind figures in full light the touches of white light in the horizon of angelicos last judgment are felt and wrought with equal truth the dignified and simple forms of cloud in repose are often by these painters sublimely expressed but of changeful cloud form they show no examples the architecture mountains and water of these distances are commonly conventional motives are to be found in them of the highest beauty and especially remarkable for quantity and meaning of incident but they can only be studied or accepted in the particular feeling that produced them it may generally be observed that whatever has been the result of strong emotion is ill seen unless through the medium of such emotion and will lead to conclusions utterly false and perilous if it be made a subject of coldhearted observance or an object of systematic imitation one piece of genuine mountain drawing however occurs in the landscape of masaccios tribute money it is impossible to say what strange results might have taken place in this particular field of art or how suddenly a great school of landscape might have arisen had the life of this great painter been prolonged of this particular fresco i shall have much to say hereafter the two brothers bellini gave a marked and vigorous impulse to the landscape of venice of gentiles architecture i shall speak presently giovannis though in style less interesting and in place less prominent occurring chiefly as a kind of frame to his pictures connecting them with the architecture of the churches for which they were intended is in refinement of realization i suppose quite unrivalled especially in passages requiring pure gradation as the hollows of vaultings that of veronese would look ghostly beside it that of titian lightless his landscape is occasionally quaint and strange like giorgiones and as fine in color as that behind the madonna in the brera gallery at milan but a more truthful fragment occurs in the picture in san francesco della vigna at venice and in the picture of st jerome in the church of san grisostomo the landscape is as perfect and beautiful as any background may legitimately be and finer as far as it goes than anything of titians it is remarkable for the absolute truth of its sky whose blue clear as crystal and though deep in tone bright as the open air is gradated to the horizon with a cautiousness and finish almost inconceivable and to obtain light at the horizon without contradicting the system of chiaroscuro adopted in the figures which are lighted from the right hand it is barred across with some glowing white cirri which in their turn are opposed by a single dark horizontal line of lower cloud and to throw the whole farther back there is a wreath of rain cloud of warmer color floating above the mountains lighted on its under edge whose faithfulness to nature both in hue and in its light and shattering form is altogether exemplary the wandering of the light among the hills is equally studied and the whole is crowned by the grand realization of the leaves of the figtree alluded to vol ii part iii chap 5 as well as of the herbage upon the rocks considering that with all this care and completeness in the background there is nothing that is not of meaning and necessity in reference to the figures and that in the figures themselves the dignity and heavenliness of the highest religious painters are combined with a force and purity of color greater i think than titians it is a work which may be set before the young artist as in every respect a nearly faultless guide giorgiones landscape is inventive and solemn but owing to the rarity even of his nominal works i dare not speak of it in general terms it is certainly conventional and is rather i imagine to be studied for its color and its motives than its details   § 12 landscape of titian and tintoret  of titian and tintoret i have spoken already the latter is every way the greater master never indulging in the exaggerated color of titian and attaining far more perfect light his grasp of nature is more extensive and his view of her more imaginative incidental notices of his landscape will be found in the chapter on imagination penetrative of the second volume but he is usually too impatient to carry his thoughts as far out or to realize with as much substantiality as titian in the st jerome of the latter in the gallery of the brera there is a superb example of the modes in which the objects of landscape may be either suggested or elaborated according to their place and claim the larger features of the ground foliage and drapery as well as the lion in the lower angle are executed with a slightness which admits not of close examination and which if not in shade would be offensive to the generality of observers but on the rock above the lion where it turns towards the light and where the eye is intended to dwell there is a wreath of ivy of which every leaf is separately drawn with the greatest accuracy and care and beside it a lizard studied with equal earnestness yet always with that right grandeur of manner to which i have alluded in the preface tintoret seldom reaches or attempts the elaboration in substance and color of these objects but he is even more truthtelling and certain in his rendering of all the great characters of specific form and as the painter of space he stands altogether alone among dead masters being the first who introduced the slightness and confusion of touch which are expressive of the effects of luminous objects seen through large spaces of air and the principles of aerial color which have been since carried out in other fields by turner i conceive him to be the most powerful painter whom the world has seen and that he was prevented from being also the most perfect partly by untoward circumstances in his position and education partly by the very fulness and impetuosity of his own mind partly by the want of religious feeling and its accompanying perception of beauty for his noble treatment of religious subject of which i have given several examples in the third part appears to be the result only of that grasp which a great and welltoned intellect necessarily takes of any subject submitted to it and is wanting in the signs of the more withdrawn and sacred sympathies  but whatever advances were made by tintoret in modes of artistical treatment he cannot be considered as having enlarged the sphere of landscape conception he took no cognizance even of the materials and motives so singularly rich in color which were forever around him in his own venice all portions of venetian scenery introduced by him are treated conventionally and carelessly the architectural characters lost altogether the sea distinguished from the sky only by a darker green while of the sky itself only those forms were employed by him which had been repeated again and again for centuries though in less tangibility and completion of mountain scenery he has left i believe no example so far carried as that of john bellini above instanced   § 13 schools of florence milan and bologna  the florentine and ambrian schools supply us with no examples of landscape except that introduced by their earliest masters gradually overwhelmed under renaissance architecture  leonardos landscape has been of unfortunate effect on art so far as it has had effect at all in realization of detail he verges on the ornamental in his rock outlines he has all the deficiencies and little of the feeling of the earlier men behind the sacrifice for the friends of giotto at pisa there is a sweet piece of rock incident a little fountain breaking out at the mountain foot and trickling away its course marked by branches of reeds the latter formal enough certainly and always in triplets but still with a sense of nature pervading the whole which is utterly wanting to the rocks of leonardo in the holy family in the louvre the latter are grotesque without being ideal and extraordinary without being impressive the sketch in the uffizii of florence has some fine foliage and there is of course a certain virtue in all the work of a man like leonardo which i would not depreciate but our admiration of it in this particular field must be qualified and our following cautious  no advances were made in landscape so far as i know after the time of tintoret the power of art ebbed gradually away from the derivative schools various degrees of cleverness or feeling being manifested in more or less brilliant conventionalism i once supposed there was some life in the landscape of domenichino but in this i must have been wrong the man who painted the madonna del rosario and martyrdom of st agnes in the gallery of bologna is palpably incapable of doing anything good great or right in any field way or kind whatsoever8   § 14 claude salvator and the poussins  though however at this period the general grasp of the schools was perpetually contracting a gift was given to the world by claude for which we are perhaps hardly enough grateful owing to the very frequency of our after enjoyment of it he set the sun in heaven and was i suppose the first who attempted anything like the realization of actual sunshine in misty air he gives the first example of the study of nature for her own sake and allowing for the unfortunate circumstances of his education and for his evident inferiority of intellect more could hardly have been expected from him his false taste forced composition and ignorant rendering of detail have perhaps been of more detriment to art than the gift he gave was of advantage the character of his own mind is singular i know of no other instance of a mans working from nature continually with the desire of being true and never attaining the power of drawing so much as a bough of a tree rightly salvator a man originally endowed with far higher power of mind than claude was altogether unfaithful to his mission and has left us i believe no gift everything that he did is evidently for the sake of exhibiting his own dexterity there is no love of any kind for anything his choice of landscape features is dictated by no delight in the sublime but by mere animal restlessness or ferocity guided by an imaginative power of which he could not altogether deprive himself he has done nothing which others have not done better or which it would not have been better not to have done in nature he mistakes distortion for energy and savageness for sublimity in man mendicity for sanctity and conspiracy for heroism  the landscape of nicolo poussin shows much power and is usually composed and elaborated on right principles compare preface to second edition but i am aware of nothing that it has attained of new or peculiar excellence it is a graceful mixture of qualities to be found in other masters in higher degrees in finish it is inferior to leonardos in invention to giorgiones in truth to titians in grace to raffaelles the landscapes of gaspar have serious feeling and often valuable and solemn color virtueless otherwise they are full of the most degraded mannerism and i believe the admiration of them to have been productive of extensive evil among recent schools   § 15 german and flemish landscape  the development of landscape north of the alps presents us with the same general phases under modifications dependent partly on less intensity of feeling partly on diminished availableness of landscape material that of the religious painters is treated with the same affectionate completion but exuberance of fancy sometimes diminishes the influence of the imagination and the absence of the italian force of passion admits of more patient and somewhat less intellectual elaboration a morbid habit of mind is evident in many seeming to lose sight of the balance and relations of things so as to become intense in trifles gloomily minute as in albert durer and this mingled with a feverish operation of the fancy which appears to result from certain habitual conditions of bodily health rather than of mental culture and of which the sickness without the power is eminently characteristic of the modern germans but with all this there are virtues of the very highest order in those schools and i regret that my knowledge is insufficient to admit of my giving any detailed account of them  in the landscape of rembrandt and rubens we have the northern parallel to the power of the venetians among the etchings and drawings of rembrandt landscape thoughts may be found not unworthy of titian and studies from nature of sublime fidelity but his system of chiaroscuro was inconsistent with the gladness and his peculiar modes of feeling with the grace of nature nor from my present knowledge can i name any work on canvas in which he has carried out the dignity of his etched conceptions or exhibited any perceptiveness of new truths  not so rubens who perhaps furnishes us with the first instances of complete unconventional unaffected landscape his treatment is healthy manly and rational not very affectionate yet often condescending to minute and multitudinous detail always as far as it goes pure forcible and refreshing consummate in composition and marvellous in color in the pitti palace the best of its two rubens landscapes has been placed near a characteristic and highlyfinished titian the marriage of st catherine but for the grandeur of line and solemn feeling in the flock of sheep and the figures of the latter work i doubt if all its glow and depth of tone could support its overcharged green and blue against the open breezy sunshine of the fleming i do not mean to rank the art of rubens with that of titian but it is always to be remembered that titian hardly ever paints sunshine but a certain opalescent twilight which has as much of human emotion as of imitative truth in it           the clouds that gather round the setting sun           do take a sober coloring from an eye           that hath kept watch oer mans mortality  and that art of this kind must always be liable to some appearance of failure when compared with a less pathetic statement of facts  it is to be noted however that the licenses taken by rubens in particular instances are as bold as his general statements are sincere in the landscape just instanced the horizon is an oblique line in the sunset of our own gallery many of the shadows fall at right angles to the light and in a picture in the dulwich gallery a rainbow is seen by the spectator at the side of the sun  these bold and frank licenses are not to be considered as detracting from the rank of the painter they are usually characteristic of those minds whose grasp of nature is so certain and extensive as to enable them fearlessly to sacrifice a truth of actuality to a truth of feeling yet the young artist must keep in mind that the painters greatness consists not in his taking but in his atoning for them   § 16 the lower dutch schools  among the professed landscapists of the dutch school we find much dexterous imitation of certain kinds of nature remarkable usually for its persevering rejection of whatever is great valuable or affecting in the object studied where however they show real desire to paint what they saw as far as they saw it there is of course much in them that is instructive as in cuyp and in the etchings of waterloo which have even very sweet and genuine feeling and so in some of their architectural painters but the object of the great body of them is merely to display manual dexterities of one kind or another and their effect on the public mind is so totally for evil that though i do not deny the advantage an artist of real judgment may derive from the study of some of them i conceive the best patronage that any monarch could possibly bestow upon the arts would be to collect the whole body of them into a grand gallery and burn it to the ground   § 17 english school wilson and gainsborough  passing to the english school we find a connecting link between them and the italians formed by richard wilson had this artist studied under favorable circumstances there is evidence of his having possessed power enough to produce an original picture but corrupted by study of the poussins and gathering his materials chiefly in their field the district about romea district especially unfavorable as exhibiting no pure or healthy nature but a diseased and overgrown flora among halfdeveloped volcanic rocks loose calcareous concretions and mouldering wrecks of buildingsand whose spirit i conceive to be especially opposed to the natural tone of the english mind his originality was altogether overpowered and though he paints in a manly way and occasionally reaches exquisite tones of color as in the small and very precious picture belonging to mr rogers and sometimes manifests some freshness of feeling as in the villa of mæcenas of our national gallery yet his pictures are in general mere diluted adaptations from poussin and salvator without the dignity of the one or the fire of the other  not so gainsborough a great name his whether of the english or any other school the greatest colorist since rubens and the last i think of legitimate colorists that is to say of those who were fully acquainted with the power of their material pure in his english feeling profound in his seriousness graceful in his gayety there are nevertheless certain deductions to be made from his worthiness which yet i dread to make because my knowledge of his landscape works is not extensive enough to justify me in speaking of them decisively but this is to be noted of all that i know that they are rather motives of feeling and color than earnest studies that their execution is in some degree mannered and always hasty that they are altogether wanting in the affectionate detail of which i have already spoken and that their color is in some measure dependent on a bituminous brown and conventional green which have more of science than of truth in them these faults may be sufficiently noted in the magnificent picture presented by him to the royal academy and tested by a comparison of it with the turner llanberis in the same room nothing can be more attractively luminous or aerial than the distance of the gainsborough nothing more bold or inventive than the forms of its crags and the diffusion of the broad distant light upon them where a vulgar artist would have thrown them into dark contrast but it will be found that the light of the distance is brought out by a violent exaggeration of the gloom in the valley that the forms of the green trees which bear the chief light are careless and ineffective that the markings of the crags are equally hasty and that no object in the foreground has realization enough to enable the eye to rest upon it the turner a much feebler picture in its first impression and altogether inferior in the quality and value of its individual hues will yet be found to the end more forcible because unexaggerated its gloom is moderate and aerial its light deep in tone its color entirely unconventional and the forms of its rocks studied with the most devoted care with gainsborough terminates the series of painters connected with the elder schools by whom among those yet living or lately lost the impulse was first given to modern landscape i attempt not to decide such questions are rather invidious than interesting the particular tone or direction of any school seems to me always to have resulted rather from certain phases of national character limited to particular periods than from individual teaching and especially among moderns what has been good in each master has been commonly original   § 18 constable calcott  i have already alluded to the simplicity and earnestness of the mind of constable to its vigorous rupture with school laws and to its unfortunate error on the opposite side unteachableness seems to have been a main feature of his character and there is corresponding want of veneration in the way he approaches nature herself his early education and associations were also against him they induced in him a morbid preference of subjects of a low order i have never seen any work of his in which there were any signs of his being able to draw and hence even the most necessary details are painted by him inefficiently his works are also eminently wanting both in rest and refinement and fuselis jesting compliment is too true for the showery weather in which the artist delights misses alike the majesty of storm and the loveliness of calm weather it is greatcoat weather and nothing more there is strange want of depth in the mind which has no pleasure in sunbeams but when piercing painfully through clouds nor in foliage but when shaken by the wind nor in light itself but when flickering glistening restless and feeble yet with all these deductions his works are to be deeply respected as thoroughly original thoroughly honest free from affectation manly in manner frequently successful in cool color and especially realizing certain motives of english scenery with perhaps as much affection as such scenery unless when regarded through media of feeling derived from higher sources is calculated to inspire  on the works of calcott high as his reputation stands i should look with far less respect i see not any preference or affection in the artist there is no tendency in him with which we can sympathize nor does there appear any sign of aspiration effort or enjoyment in any one of his works he appears to have completed them methodically to have been content with them when completed to have thought them good legitimate regular pictures perhaps in some respects better than nature he painted everything tolerably and nothing excellently he has given us no gift struck for us no light and though he has produced one or two valuable works of which the finest i know is the marine in the possession of sir j swinburne they will i believe in future have no place among those considered representative of the english school   § 19 peculiar tendency of recent landscape  throughout the range of elder art it will be remembered we have found no instance of the faithful painting of mountain scenery except in a faded background of masaccios nothing more than rocky eminences undulating hills or fantastic crags and even these treated altogether under typical forms the more specific study of mountains seems to have coincided with the most dexterous practice of watercolor but it admits of doubt whether the choice of subject has been directed by the vehicle or whether as i rather think the tendency of national feeling has been followed in the use of the most appropriate means something is to be attributed to the increased demand for slighter works of art and much to the sense of the quality of objects now called picturesque which appears to be exclusively of modern origin from what feeling the character of middleage architecture and costume arose or with what kind of affection their forms were regarded by the inventors i am utterly unable to guess but of this i think we may be assured that the natural instinct and childlike wisdom of those days were altogether different from the modern feeling which appears to have taken its origin in the absence of such objects and to be based rather on the strangeness of their occurrence than on any real affection for them and which is certainly so shallow and ineffective as to be instantly and always sacrificed by the majority to fashion comfort or economy yet i trust that there is a healthy though feeble love of nature mingled with it nature pure separate felicitous which is also peculiar to the moderns and as signs of this feeling or ministers to it i look with veneration upon many works which in a technical point of view are of minor importance   § 20 g robson d cox false use of the term style  i have been myself indebted for much teaching and more delight to those of the late g robson weaknesses there are in them manifold much bad drawing much forced color much over finish little of what artists call composition but there is thorough affection for the thing drawn they are serious and quiet in the highest degree certain qualities of atmosphere and texture in them have never been excelled and certain facts of mountain scenery never but by them expressed as for instance the stillness and depth of the mountain tarns with the reversed imagery of their darkness signed across by the soft lines of faintly touching winds the solemn flush of the brown fern and glowing heath under evening light the purple mass of mountains far removed seen against clear still twilight with equal gratitude i look to the drawings of david cox which in spite of their loose and seemingly careless execution are not less serious in their meaning nor less important in their truth i must however in reviewing those modern works in which certain modes of execution are particularly manifested insist especially on this general principle applicable to all times of art that what is usually called the style or manner of an artist is in all good art nothing but the best means of getting at the particular truth which the artist wanted it is not a mode peculiar to himself of getting at the same truths as other men but the only mode of getting the particular facts he desires and which mode if others had desired to express those facts they also must have adopted all habits of execution persisted in under no such necessity but because the artist has invented them or desires to show his dexterity in them are utterly base for every good painter finds so much difficulty in reaching the end he sees and desires that he has no time nor power left for playing tricks on the road to it he catches at the easiest and best means he can get it is possible that such means may be singular and then it will be said that his style is strange but it is not a style at all it is the saying of a particular thing in the only way in which it possibly can be said thus the reed pen outline and peculiar touch of prout which are frequently considered as mere manner are in fact the only means of expressing the crumbling character of stone which the artist loves and desires that character never has been expressed except by him nor will it ever be expressed except by his means and it is of the greatest importance to distinguish this kind of necessary and virtuous manner from the conventional manners very frequent in derivative schools and always utterly to be contemned wherein an artist desiring nothing and feeling nothing executes everything in his own particular mode and teaches emulous scholars how to do with difficulty what might have been done with ease it is true that there are sometimes instances in which great masters have employed different means of getting at the same end but in these cases their choice has been always of those which to them appeared the shortest and most complete their practice has never been prescribed by affectation or continued from habit except so far as must be expected from such weakness as is common to all men from hands that necessarily do most readily what they are most accustomed to do and minds always liable to prescribe to the hands that which they can do most readily  the recollection of this will keep us from being offended with the loose and blotted handling of david cox there is no other means by which his object could be attained the looseness coolness and moisture of his herbage the rustling crumpled freshness of his broadleaved weeds the play of pleasant light across his deep heathered moor or plashing sand the melting of fragments of white mist into the dropping blue above all this has not been fully recorded except by him and what there is of accidental in his mode of reaching it answers gracefully to the accidental part of nature herself yet he is capable of more than this and if he suffers himself uniformly to paint beneath his capability that which began in feeling must necessarily end in manner he paints too many small pictures and perhaps has of late permitted his peculiar execution to be more manifest than is necessary of this he is himself the best judge for almost all faults of this kind the public are answerable not the painter i have alluded to one of his grander workssuch as i should wish always to see him paintin the preface another i think still finer a red sunset on distant hills almost unequalled for truth and power of color was painted by him several years ago and remains i believe in his own possession   § 21 copley fielding phenomena of distant color  the deserved popularity of copley fielding has rendered it less necessary for me to allude frequently to his works in the following pages than it would otherwise have been more especially as my own sympathies and enjoyments are so entirely directed in the channel which his art has taken that i am afraid of trusting them too far yet i may perhaps be permitted to speak of myself so far as i suppose my own feelings to be representative of those of a class and i suppose that there are many who like myself at some period of their life have derived more intense and healthy pleasure from the works of this painter than of any other whatsoever healthy because always based on his faithful and simple rendering of nature and that of very lovely and impressive nature altogether freed from coarseness violence or vulgarity various references to that which he has attained will be found subsequently what i am now about to say respecting what he has not attained is not in depreciation of what he has accomplished but in regret at his suffering powers of a high order to remain in any measure dormant  he indulges himself too much in the use of crude color pure cobalt violent rose and purple are of frequent occurrence in his distances pure siennas and other browns in his foregrounds and that not as expressive of lighted but of local color the reader will find in the following chapters that i am no advocate for subdued coloring but crude color is not bright color and there was never a noble or brilliant work of color yet produced whose real form did not depend on the subduing of its tints rather than the elevation of them  it is perhaps one of the most difficult lessons to learn in art that the warm colors of distance even the most glowing are subdued by the air so as in no wise to resemble the same color seen on a foreground object so that the rose of sunset on clouds or mountains has a gray in it which distinguishes it from the rose color of the leaf of a flower and the mingling of this gray of distance without in the slightest degree taking away the expression of the intense and perfect purity of the color in and by itself is perhaps the last attainment of the great landscape colorist in the same way the blue of distance however intense is not the blue of a bright blue flower and it is not distinguished from it by different texture merely but by a certain intermixture and under current of warm color which is altogether wanting in many of the blues of fieldings distances and so of every bright distant color while in foreground where colors may be and ought to be pure yet that any of them are expressive of light is only to be felt where there is the accurate fitting of them to their relative shadows which we find in the works of giorgione titian tintoret veronese turner and all other great colorists in proportion as they are so of this fitting of light to shadow fielding is altogether regardless so that his foregrounds are constantly assuming the aspect of overcharged local color instead of sunshine and his figures and cattle look transparent   § 22 beauty of mountain foreground  again the finishing of fieldings foregrounds as regards their drawing is minute without accuracy multitudinous without thought and confused without mystery where execution is seen to be in measure accidental as in cox it may be received as representative of what is accidental in nature but there is no part of fieldings foreground that is accidental it is evidently worked and reworked dotted rubbed and finished with great labor and where the virtue playfulness and freedom of accident are thus removed one of two virtues must be substituted for them either we must have the deeply studied and imaginative foreground of which every part is necessary to every other and whose every spark of light is essential to the wellbeing of the whole of which the foregrounds of turner in the liber studiorum are the most eminent examples i know or else we must have in some measure the botanical faithfulness and realization of the early masters neither of these virtues is to be found in fieldings its features though grouped with feeling are yet scattered and inessential any one of them might be altered in many ways without doing harm there is no proportioned necessary unalterable relation among them no evidence of invention or of careful thought while on the other hand there is no botanical or geological accuracy nor any point on which the eye may rest with thorough contentment in its realization  it seems strange that to an artist of so quick feeling the details of a mountain foreground should not prove irresistibly attractive and entice him to greater accuracy of study there is not a fragment of its living rock nor a tuft of its heathery herbage that has not adorable manifestations of gods working thereupon the harmonies of color among the native lichens are better than titians the interwoven bells of campanula and heather are better than all the arabesques of the vatican they need no improvement arrangement nor alteration nothing but love and every combination of them is different from every other so that a painter need never repeat himself if he will only be true yet all these sources of power have been of late entirely neglected by fielding there is evidence through all his foregrounds of their being mere home inventions and like all home inventions they exhibit perpetual resemblances and repetitions the painter is evidently embarrassed without his rutted road in the middle and his boggy pool at the side which pool he has of late painted in hard lines of violent blue there is not a stone even of the nearest and most important which has its real lichens upon it or a studied form or anything more to occupy the mind than certain variations of dark and light browns the same faults must be found with his present painting of foliage neither the stems nor leafage being ever studied from nature and this is the more to be regretted because in the earlier works of the artist there was much admirable drawing and even yet his power is occasionally developed in his larger works as in a bolton abbey on canvas which wasi cannot say exhibitedbut was in the rooms of the royal academy in 18439 i should have made the preceding remarks with more hesitation and diffidence but that from a comparison of works of this kind with the slighter ornaments of the watercolor rooms it seems evident that the painter is not unaware of the deficiencies of these latter and concedes something of what he would himself desire to what he has found to be the feeling of a majority of his admirers this is a dangerous modesty and especially so in these days when the judgment of the many is palpably as artificial as their feeling is cold   § 23 de wint  there is much that is instructive and deserving of high praise in the sketches of de wint yet it is to be remembered that even the pursuit of truth however determined will have results limited and imperfect when its chief motive is the pride of being true and i fear that these works sublime as many of them have unquestionably been testify more accuracy of eye and experience of color than exercise of thought their truth of effect is often purchased at too great an expense by the loss of all beauty of form and of the higher refinements of color deficiencies however on which i shall not insist since the value of the sketches as far as they go is great they have done good service and set good example and whatever their failings may be there is evidence in them that the painter has always done what he believed to be right   § 24 influence of engraving j d harding  the influence of the masters of whom we have hitherto spoken is confined to those who have access to their actual works since the particular qualities in which they excel are in no wise to be rendered by the engraver those of whom we have next to speak are known to the public in a great measure by the help of the engraver and while their influence is thus very far extended their modes of working are perhaps in some degree modified by the habitual reference to the future translation into light and shade reference which is indeed beneficial in the care it induces respecting the arrangement of the chiaroscuro and the explanation of the forms but which is harmful so far as it involves a dependence rather on quantity of picturesque material than on substantial color or simple treatment and as it admits of indolent diminution of size and slightness of execution  we should not be just to the present works of j d harding unless we took this influence into account some years back none of our artists realized more laboriously nor obtained more substantial color and texture a large drawing in the possession of b g windus esq of tottenham is of great value as an example of his manner at the period a manner not only careful but earnest and free from any kind of affectation partly from the habit of making slight and small drawings for engravers and partly also i imagine from an overstrained seeking after appearances of dexterity in execution his drawings have of late years become both less solid and less complete not however without attaining certain brilliant qualities in exchange which are very valuable in the treatment of some of the looser portions of subject of the extended knowledge and various powers of this painter frequent instances are noted in the following pages neither perhaps are rightly estimated among artists owing to a certain coldness of sentiment in his choice of subject and a continual preference of the picturesque to the impressive proved perhaps in nothing so distinctly as in the little interest usually attached to his skies which if aerial and expressive of space and movement content him though destitute of story power or character an exception must be made in favor of the very grand sunrise on the swiss alps exhibited in 1844 wherein the artists real power was in some measure displayed though i am convinced he is still capable of doing far greater things so in his foliage he is apt to sacrifice the dignity of his trees to their wildness and lose the forest in the copse neither is he at all accurate enough in his expression of species or realization of near portions these are deficiencies be it observed of sentiment not of perception as there are few who equal him in rapidity of seizure of material truth   § 25 samuel prout early painting of architecture how deficient  very extensive influence in modern art must be attributed to the works of samuel prout and as there are some circumstances belonging to his treatment of architectural subject which it does not come within the sphere of the following chapters to examine i shall endeavor to note the more important of them here  let us glance back for a moment to the architectural drawing of earlier times before the time of the bellinis at venice and of ghirlandajo at florence i believe there are no examples of anything beyond conventional representation of architecture often rich quaint and full of interest as memmis abstract of the duomo at florence at sta maria novella but not to be classed with any genuine efforts at representation it is much to be regretted that the power and custom of introducing welldrawn architecture should have taken place only when architectural taste had been itself corrupted and that the architecture introduced by bellini ghirlandajo francia and the other patient and powerful workmen of the fifteenth century is exclusively of the renaissance styles while their drawing of it furnishes little that is of much interest to the architectural draughtsman as such being always governed by a reference to its subordinate position so that all forceful shadow and play of color are most justly surrendered for quiet and uniform hues of gray and chiaroscuro of extreme simplicity whatever they chose to do they did with consummate grandeur note especially the chiaroscuro of the square window of ghirlandajos which so much delighted vasari in sta maria novella and the daring management of a piece of the perspective in the salutation opposite where he has painted a flight of stairs descending in front though the picture is twelve feet above the eye and yet this grandeur in all these men results rather from the general power obtained in their drawing of the figure than from any definite knowledge respecting the things introduced in these accessory parts so that while in some points it is impossible for any painter to equal these accessories unless he were in all respects as great as ghirlandajo or bellini in others it is possible for him with far inferior powers to attain a representation both more accurate and more interesting  in order to arrive at the knowledge of these we must briefly take note of a few of the modes in which architecture itself is agreeable to the mind especially of the influence upon the character of the building which is to be attributed to the signs of age   § 26 effects of age upon buildings how far desirable  it is evident first that if the design of the building be originally bad the only virtue it can ever possess will be in signs of antiquity all that in this world enlarges the sphere of affection or imagination is to be reverenced and all those circumstances enlarge it which strengthen our memory or quicken our conception of the dead hence it is no light sin to destroy anything that is old more especially because even with the aid of all obtainable records of the past we the living occupy a space of too large importance and interest in our own eyes we look upon the world too much as our own too much as if we had possessed it and should possess it forever and forget that it is a mere hostelry of which we occupy the apartments for a time which others better than we have sojourned in before who are now where we should desire to be with them fortunately for mankind as some counterbalance to that wretched love of novelty which originates in selfishness shallowness and conceit and which especially characterizes all vulgar minds there is set in the deeper places of the heart such affection for the signs of age that the eye is delighted even by injuries which are the work of time not but that there is also real and absolute beauty in the forms and colors so obtained for which the original lines of the architecture unless they have been very grand indeed are well exchanged so that there is hardly any building so ugly but that it may be made an agreeable object by such appearances it would not be easy for instance to find a less pleasing piece of architecture than the portion of the front of queens college oxford which has just been restored yet i believe that few persons could have looked with total indifference on the mouldering and peeled surface of the oolite limestone previous to its restoration if however the character of the building consist in minute detail or multitudinous lines the evil or good effect of age upon it must depend in great measure on the kind of art the material and the climate the parthenon for instance would be injured by any markings which interfered with the contours of its sculptures and any lines of extreme purity or colors of original harmony and perfection are liable to injury and are ill exchanged for mouldering edges or brown weatherstains  but as all architecture is or ought to be meant to be durable and to derive part of its glory from its antiquity all art that is liable to mortal injury from effects of time is therein out of place and this is another reason for the principle i have asserted in the second part page 204 i do not at this instant recollect a single instance of any very fine building which is not improved up to a certain period by all its signs of age after which period like all other human works it necessarily declines its decline being in almost all ages and countries accelerated by neglect and abuse in its time of beauty and alteration or restoration in its time of age  thus i conceive that all buildings dependent on color whether of mosaic or painting have their effect improved by the richness of the subsequent tones of age for there are few arrangements of color so perfect but that they are capable of improvement by some softening and blending of this kind with mosaic the improvement may be considered as proceeding almost so long as the design can be distinctly seen with painting so long as the colors do not change or chip off  again upon all forms of sculptural ornament the effect of time is such that if the design be poor it will enrich it if overcharged simplify it if harsh and violent soften it if smooth and obscure exhibit it whatever faults it may have are rapidly disguised whatever virtue it has still shines and steals out in the mellow light and this to such an extent that the artist is always liable to be tempted to the drawing of details in old buildings as of extreme beauty which look cold and hard in their architectural lines and i have never yet seen any restoration or cleaned portion of a building whose effect was not inferior to the weathered parts even to those of which the design had in some parts almost disappeared on the front of the church of san michele at lucca the mosaics have fallen out of half the columns and lie in weedy ruin beneath in many the frost has torn large masses of the entire coating away leaving a scarred unsightly surface two of the shafts of the upper star window are eaten entirely away by the sea wind the rest have lost their proportions the edges of the arches are hacked into deep hollows and cast indented shadows on the weedgrown wall the process has gone too far and yet i doubt not but that this building is seen to greater advantage now than when first built always with exception of one circumstance that the french shattered the lower wheel window and set up in front of it an escutcheon with libertas upon it which abomination of desolation the lucchese have not yet had humanheartedness enough to pull down  putting therefore the application of architecture as an accessory out of the question and supposing our object to be the exhibition of the most impressive qualities of the building itself it is evidently the duty of the draughtsman to represent it under those conditions and with that amount of agemark upon it which may best exalt and harmonize the sources of its beauty this is no pursuit of mere picturesqueness it is true following out of the ideal character of the building nay far greater dilapidation than this may in portions be exhibited for there are beauties of other kinds not otherwise attainable brought out by advanced dilapidation but when the artist suffers the mere love of ruinousness to interfere with his perception of the art of the building and substitutes rude fractures and blotting stains for all its fine chiselling and determined color he has lost the end of his own art   § 27 effects of light how necessary to the understanding of detail  so far of aging next of effects of light and color it is i believe hardly enough observed among architects that the same decorations are of totally different effect according to their position and the time of day a moulding which is of value on a building facing south where it takes deep shadows from steep sun may be utterly ineffective if placed west or east and a moulding which is chaste and intelligible in shade on a north side may be grotesque vulgar or confused when it takes black shadows on the south farther there is a time of day in which every architectural decoration is seen to best advantage and certain times in which its peculiar force and character are best explained of these niceties the architect takes little cognizance as he must in some sort calculate on the effect of ornament at all times but to the artist they are of infinite importance and especially for this reason that there is always much detail on buildings which cannot be drawn as such which is too far off or too minute and which must consequently be set down in shorthand of some kind or another and as it were an abstract more or less philosophical made of its general heads of the style of this abstract of the lightness confusion and mystery necessary in it i have spoken elsewhere at present i insist only on the arrangement and matter of it all good ornament and all good architecture are capable of being put into shorthand that is each has a perfect system of parts principal and subordinate of which even when the complemental details vanish in distance the system and anatomy yet remain visible so long as anything is visible so that the divisions of a beautiful spire shall be known as beautiful even till their last line vanishes in blue mist and the effect of a welldesigned moulding shall be visibly disciplined harmonious and inventive as long as it is seen to be a moulding at all now the power of the artist of marking this character depends not on his complete knowledge of the design but on his experimental knowledge of its salient and bearing parts and of the effects of light and shadow by which their saliency is best told he must therefore be prepared according to his subject to use light steep or level intense or feeble and out of the resulting chiaroscuro select those peculiar and hinging points on which the rest are based and by which all else that is essential may be explained  the thoughtful command of all these circumstances constitutes the real architectural draughtsman the habits of executing everything either under one kind of effect or in one manner or of using unintelligible and meaningless abstracts of beautiful designs are those which must commonly take the place of it and are the most extensively esteemed10   § 28 architectural painting of gentile bellini and vittor carpaccio  let us now proceed with our review of those artists who have devoted themselves more peculiarly to architectural subject  foremost among them stand gentile bellini and vittor carpaccio to whom we are indebted for the only existing faithful statements of the architecture of old venice and who are the only authorities to whom we can trust in conjecturing the former beauty of those few desecrated fragments the last of which are now being rapidly swept away by the idiocy of modern venetians  nothing can be more careful nothing more delicately finished or more dignified in feeling than the works of both these men and as architectural evidence they are the best we could have had all the gilded parts being gilt in the picture so that there can be no mistake or confusion of them with yellow color or light and all the frescoes or mosaics given with the most absolute precision and fidelity at the same time they are by no means examples of perfect architectural drawing there is little light and shade in them of any kind and none whatever of the thoughtful observance of temporary effect of which we have just been speaking so that in rendering the character of the relieved parts their solidity depth or gloom the representation fails altogether and it is moreover lifeless from its very completion both the signs of age and the effects of use and habitation being utterly rejected rightly so indeed in these instances all the architecture of these painters being in background to religious subject but wrongly so if we look to the architecture alone neither is there anything like aerial perspective attempted the employment of actual gold in the decoration of all the distances and the entire realization of their details as far as is possible on the scale compelled by perspective being alone sufficient to prevent this except in the hands of painters far more practised in effect than either gentile or carpaccio but with all these discrepancies gentile bellinis church of st marks is the best church of st marks that has ever been painted so far as i know and i believe the reconciliation of true aerial perspective and chiaroscuro with the splendor and dignity obtained by the real gilding and elaborate detail is a problem yet to be accomplished with the help of the daguerreotype and the lessons of color given by the later venetians we ought now to be able to accomplish it more especially as the right use of gold has been shown us by the greatest master of effect whom venice herself produced tintoret who has employed it with infinite grace on the steps ascended by the young madonna in his large picture in the church of the madonna dell orto perugino uses it also with singular grace often employing it for golden light on distant trees and continually on the high light of hair and that without losing relative distances   § 29 and of the venetians generally  the great group of venetian painters who brought landscape art for that time to its culminating point have left as we have already seen little that is instructive in architectural painting the causes of this i cannot comprehend for neither titian nor tintoret appears to despise anything that affords them either variety of form or of color the latter especially condescending to very trivial detailsas in the magnificent carpet painting of the doge mocenigo so that it might have been expected that in the rich colors of st marks and the magnificent and fantastic masses of the byzantine palaces they would have found whereupon to dwell with delighted elaboration this is however never the case and although frequently compelled to introduce portions of venetian locality in their backgrounds such portions are always treated in a most hasty and faithless manner missing frequently all character of the building and never advanced to realization in titians picture of faith the view of venice below is laid in so rapidly and slightly the houses all leaning this way and that and of no color the sea a dead gray green and the shipsails mere dashes of the brush that the most obscure of turners venices would look substantial beside it while in the very picture of tintoret in which he has dwelt so elaborately on the carpet he has substituted a piece of ordinary renaissance composition for st marks and in the background has chosen the sansovino side of the piazzetta treating even that so carelessly as to lose all the proportion and beauty of its design and so flimsily that the line of the distant sea which has been first laid in is seen through all the columns evidences of magnificent power of course exist in whatever he touches but his full power is never turned in this direction more space is allowed to his architecture by paul veronese but it is still entirely suggestive and would be utterly false except as a frame or background for figures the same may be said with respect to raffaelle and the roman school   § 30 fresco painting of the venetian exteriors canaletto  if however these men laid architecture little under contribution to their own art they made their own art a glorious gift to architecture and the walls of venice which before i believe had received color only in arabesque patterns were lighted with human life by giorgione titian tintoret and veronese of the works of tintoret and titian nothing now i believe remains two figures of giorgiones are still traceable on the fondaco de tedeschi one of which singularly uninjured is seen from far above and below the rialto flaming like the reflection of a sunset two figures of veronese were also traceable till lately the head and arms of one still remain and some glorious olivebranches which were beside the other the figure having been entirely effaced by an inscription in large black letters on a whitewash tablet which we owe to the somewhat inopportunely expressed enthusiasm of the inhabitants of the district in favor of their new pastor11 judging however from the rate at which destruction is at present advancing and seeing that in about seven or eight years more venice will have utterly lost every external claim to interest except that which attaches to the group of buildings immediately around st marks place and to the larger churches it may be conjectured that the greater part of her present degradation has taken place at any rate within the last forty years let the reader with such scraps of evidence as may still be gleaned from under the stucco and paint of the italian committees of taste and from among the drawingroom innovations of english and german residents restore venice in his imagination to some resemblance of what she must have been before her fall let him looking from lido or fusina replace in the forest of towers those of the hundred and sixtysix churches which the french threw down let him sheet her walls with purple and scarlet overlay her minarets with gold12 cleanse from their pollution those choked canals which are now the drains of hovels where they were once vestibules of palaces and fill them with gilded barges and bannered ships finally let him withdraw from this scene already so brilliant such sadness and stain as had been set upon it by the declining energies of more than half a century and he will see venice as it was seen by canaletto whose miserable virtueless heartless mechanism accepted as the representation of such various glory is both in its existence and acceptance among the most striking signs of the lost sensation and deadened intellect of the nation at that time a numbness and darkness more without hope than that of the grave itself holding and wearing yet the sceptre and the crown like the corpses of the etruscan kings ready to sink into ashes at the first unbarring of the door of the sepulchre  illustration casa contarini fasan venice                  from a drawing by ruskin  the mannerism of canaletto is the most degraded that i know in the whole range of art professing the most servile and mindless imitation it imitates nothing but the blackness of the shadows it gives no one single architectural ornament however near so much form as might enable us even to guess at its actual one and this i say not rashly for i shall prove it by placing portions of detail accurately copied from canaletto side by side with engravings from the daguerreotype it gives the buildings neither their architectural beauty nor their ancestral dignity for there is no texture of stone nor character of age in canalettos touch which is invariably a violent black sharp ruled penmanlike line as far removed from the grace of nature as from her faintness and transparency and for his truth of color let the single fact of his having omitted all record whatsoever of the frescoes whose wrecks are still to be found at least on one half of the unrestored palaces and with still less excusableness all record of the magnificent colored marbles of many whose greens and purples are still undimmed upon the casa dario casa bianca capello and multitudes besides speak for him in this respect  let it be observed that i find no fault with canaletto for his want of poetry of feeling of artistical thoughtfulness in treatment or of the various other virtues which he does not so much as profess he professes nothing but colored daguerreotypeism let us have it most precious and to be revered it would be let us have fresco where fresco was and that copied faithfully let us have carving where carving is and that architecturally true i have seen daguerreotypes in which every figure and rosette and crack and stain and fissure are given on a scale of an inch to canalettos three feet what excuse is there to be offered for his omitting on that scale as i shall hereafter show all statement of such ornament whatever among the flemish schools exquisite imitations of architecture are found constantly and that not with canalettos vulgar black exaggeration of shadow but in the most pure and silvery and luminous grays i have little pleasure in such pictures but i blame not those who have more they are what they profess to be and they are wonderful and instructive and often graceful and even affecting but canaletto possesses no virtue except that of dexterous imitation of commonplace light and shade and perhaps with the exception of salvator no artist has ever fettered his unfortunate admirers more securely from all healthy or vigorous perception of truth or been of more general detriment to all subsequent schools   § 31 expression of the effects of age on architecture by s prout  neither however by the flemings nor by any other of the elder schools was the effect of age or of human life upon architecture ever adequately expressed what ruins they drew looked as if broken down on purpose what weeds they put on seemed put on for ornament their domestic buildings had never any domesticity the people looked out of their windows evidently to be drawn or came into the street only to stand there forever a peculiar studiousness infected all accident bricks fell out methodically windows opened and shut by rule stones were chipped at regular intervals everything that happened seemed to have been expected before and above all the street had been washed and the houses dusted expressly to be painted in their best we owe to prout i believe the first perception and certainly the only existing expression of precisely the characters which were wanting to old art of that feeling which results from the influence among the noble lines of architecture of the rent and the rust the fissure the lichen and the weed and from the writing upon the pages of ancient walls of the confused hieroglyphics of human history i suppose from the deserved popularity of the artist that the strange pleasure which i find myself in the deciphering of these is common to many the feeling has been rashly and thoughtlessly contemned as mere love of the picturesque there is as i have above shown a deeper moral in it and we owe much i am not prepared to say how much to the artist by whom preeminently it has been excited for numerous as have been his imitators extended as his influence and simple as his means and manner there has yet appeared nothing at all to equal him there is no stone drawing no vitality of architecture like prouts i say not this rashly i have mackenzie in my eye and many other capital imitators and i have carefully reviewed the architectural work of the academicians often most accurate and elaborate i repeat there is nothing but the work of prout which is true living or right in its general impression and nothing therefore so inexhaustibly agreeable faults he has manifold easily detected and much declaimed against by secondrate artists but his excellence no one has ever touched and his lithographic work sketches in flanders and germany which was i believe the first of the kind still remains the most valuable of all numerous and elaborate as its various successors have been the second series in italy and switzerland was of less value the drawings seemed more laborious and had less of the life of the original sketches being also for the most part of subjects less adapted for the development of the artists peculiar powers but both are fine and the brussels louvain cologne and nuremberg subjects of the one together with the tours amboise geneva and sion of the other exhibit substantial qualities of stone and wood drawing together with an ideal appreciation of the present active vital being of the cities such as nothing else has ever approached their value is much increased by the circumstance of their being drawn by the artists own hand upon the stone and by the consequent manly recklessness of subordinate parts in works of this kind be it remembered much is subordinate which is of all characters of execution the most refreshing note the scrawled middle tint of the wall behind the gothic well at ratisbonne and compare this manly piece of work with the wretched smoothness of recent lithography let it not be thought that there is any inconsistency between what i say here and what i have said respecting finish this piece of dead wall is as much finished in relation to its function as a wall of ghirlandajos or leonardos in relation to theirs and the refreshing quality is the same in both and manifest in all great masters without exception that of the utter regardlessness of the means so that their end be reached the same kind of scrawling occurs often in the shade of raffaelle   § 32 his excellent composition and color  it is not only however by his peculiar stone touch nor perception of human character that he is distinguished he is the most dexterous of all our artists in a certain kind of composition no one can place figures like him except turner it is one thing to know where a piece of blue or white is wanted and another to make the wearer of the blue apron or white cap come there and not look as if it were against her will prouts streets are the only streets that are accidentally crowded his markets are the only markets where one feels inclined to get out of the way with others we feel the figures so right where they are that we have no expectation of their going anywhere else and approve of the position of the man with the wheelbarrow without the slightest fear of his running against our legs one other merit he has far less generally acknowledged than it should be he is among our most sunny and substantial colorists much conventional color occurs in his inferior pictures for he is very unequal and some in all but portions are always to be found of quality so luminous and pure that i have found these works the only ones capable of bearing juxtaposition with turner and hunt who invariably destroy everything else that comes within range of them his most beautiful tones occur in those drawings in which there is prevalent and powerful warm gray his most failing ones in those of sandy red on his deficiencies i shall not insist because i am not prepared to say how far it is possible for him to avoid them we have never seen the reconciliation of the peculiar characters he has obtained with the accurate following out of architectural detail with his present modes of execution farther fidelity is impossible nor has any other mode of execution yet obtained the same results and though much is unaccomplished by him in certain subjects and something of overmannerism may be traced in his treatment of others as especially in his mode of expressing the decorative parts of greek or roman architecture yet in his own peculiar gothic territory where the spirit of the subject itself is somewhat rude and grotesque his abstract of decoration has more of the spirit of the reality than far more laborious imitation the spirit of the flemish hotel de ville and decorated street architecture has never been even in the slightest degree felt or conveyed except by him and by him to my mind faultlessly and absolutely and though his interpretation of architecture that contains more refined art in its details is far less satisfactory still it is impossible while walking on his favorite angle of the piazzetta at venice either to think of any other artist than prout or not to think of him   § 33 modern architectural painting generally g cattermole  many other dexterous and agreeable architectural artists we have of various degrees of merit but of all of whom it may be generally said that they draw hats faces cloaks and caps much better than prout but figures not so well that they draw walls and windows but not cities mouldings and buttresses but not cathedrals joseph nashs work on the architecture of the middle ages is however valuable and i suppose that haghes works may be depended on for fidelity but it appears very strange that a workman capable of producing the clever drawings he has from time to time sent to the new society of painters in water colors should publish lithographs so conventional forced and lifeless  it is not without hesitation that i mention a name respecting which the reader may already have been surprised at my silence that of g cattermole there are signs in his works of very peculiar gifts and perhaps also of powerful genius their deficiencies i should willingly attribute to the advice of illjudging friends and to the applause of a public satisfied with shallow efforts if brilliant yet i cannot but think it one necessary characteristic of all true genius to be misled by no such false fires the antiquarian feeling of cattermole is pure earnest and natural and i think his imagination originally vigorous certainly his fancy his grasp of momentary passion considerable his sense of action in the human body vivid and ready but no original talent however brilliant can sustain its energy when the demands upon it are constant and all legitimate support and food withdrawn i do not recollect in any even of the most important of cattermoles works so much as a fold of drapery studied out from nature violent conventionalism of light and shade sketchy forms continually less and less developed the walls and the faces drawn with the same stucco color alike opaque and all the shades on flesh dress or stone laid in with the same arbitrary brown forever tell the same tale of a mind wasting its strength and substance in the production of emptiness and seeking by more and more blindly hazarded handling to conceal the weakness which the attempt at finish would betray  this tendency of late has been painfully visible in his architecture some drawings made several years ago for an annual illustrative of scotts works were for the most part pure and finely feltthough irrelevant to our present subject a fall of the clyde should be noticed admirable for breadth and grace of foliage and for the bold sweeping of the water and another subject of which i regret that i can only judge by the engraving glendearg at twilightthe monk eustace chased by christie of the clint hillwhich i think must have been one of the sweetest pieces of simple border hill feeling ever paintedand about that time his architecture though always conventionally brown in the shadows was generally well drawn and always powerfully conceived  since then he has been tending gradually through exaggeration to caricature and vainly endeavoring to attain by inordinate bulk of decorated parts that dignity which is only to be reached by purity of proportion and majesty of line   § 34 the evil in an archæological point of view of misapplied invention         in architectural subject  it has pained me deeply to see an artist of so great original power indulging in childish fantasticism and exaggeration and substituting for the serious and subdued work of legitimate imagination monstre machicolations and colossal cusps and crockets while there is so much beautiful architecture daily in process of destruction around us i cannot but think it treason to imagine anything at least if we must have composition let the design of the artist be such as the architect would applaud but it is surely very grievous that while our idle artists are helping their vain inventions by the fall of sponges on soiled paper glorious buildings with the whole intellect and history of centuries concentrated in them are suffered to fall into unrecorded ruin a day does not now pass in italy without the destruction of some mighty monument the streets of all her cities echo to the hammer half of her fair buildings lie in separate stones about the places of their foundation would not time be better spent in telling us the truth about these perishing remnants of majestic thought than in perpetuating the illdigested fancies of idle hours it is i repeat treason to the cause of art for any man to invent unless he invents something better than has been invented before or something differing in kind there is room enough for invention in the pictorial treatment of what exists there is no more honorable exhibition of imaginative power than in the selection of such place choice of such treatment introduction of such incident as may produce a noble picture without deviation from one line of the actual truth and such i believe to be indeed in the end the most advantageous as well as the most modest direction of the invention for i recollect no single instance of architectural composition by any men except such as leonardo or veronese who could design their architecture thoroughly before they painted it which has not a look of inanity and absurdity the best landscapes and the best architectural studies have been views and i would have the artist take shame to himself in the exact degree in which he finds himself obliged in the production of his picture to lose any even of the smallest parts or most trivial hues which bear a part in the great impression made by the reality the difference between the drawing of the architect and artist13 ought never to be as it now commonly is the difference between lifeless formality and witless license it ought to be between giving the mere lines and measures of a building and giving those lines and measures with the impression and soul of it besides all artists should be ashamed of themselves when they find they have not the power of being true the right wit of drawing is like the right wit of conversation not hyperbole not violence not frivolity only well expressed laconic truth   § 35 works of david roberts their fidelity and grace  among the members of the academy we have at present only one professedly architectural draughtsman of note david roberts whose reputation is probably farther extended on the continent than that of any other of our artists except landseer i am not certain however that i have any reason to congratulate either of my countrymen upon this their european estimation for i think it exceedingly probable that in both instances it is exclusively based on their defects and in the case of mr roberts in particular there has of late appeared more ground for it than is altogether desirable in a smoothness and overfinish of texture which bears dangerous fellowship with the work of our gallic neighbors  the fidelity of intention and honesty of system of roberts have however always been meritorious his drawing of architecture is dependent on no unintelligible lines or blots or substituted types the main lines of the real design are always there and its hollowness and undercuttings given with exquisite feeling his sense of solidity of form is very peculiar leading him to dwell with great delight on the roundings of edges and angles his execution is dexterous and delicate singularly so in oil and his sense of chiaroscuro refined but he has never done himself justice and suffers his pictures to fall below the rank they should assume by the presence of several marring characters which i shall name because it is perfectly in his power to avoid them in looking over the valuable series of drawing of the holy land which we owe to mr roberts we cannot but be amazed to find how frequently it has happened that there was something very white immediately in the foreground and something very black exactly behind it the same thing happens perpetually with mr robertss pictures a white column is always coming out of a blue mist or a white stone out of a green pool or a white monument out of a brown recess and the artifice is not always concealed with dexterity this is unworthy of so skilful a composer and it has destroyed the impressiveness as well as the color of some of his finest works it shows a poverty of conception which appears to me to arise from a deficient habit of study it will be remembered that of the sketches for this work several times exhibited in london every one was executed in the same manner and with about the same degree of completion being all of them accurate records of the main architectural lines the shapes of the shadows and the remnants of artificial color obtained by means of the same grays throughout and of the same yellow a singularly false and cold though convenient color touched upon the lights as far as they went nothing could be more valuable than these sketches and the public glancing rapidly at their general and graceful effects could hardly form anything like an estimate of the endurance and determination which must have been necessary in such a climate to obtain records so patient entire and clear of details so multitudinous as especially the hieroglyphics of the egyptian temples an endurance which perhaps only artists can estimate and for which we owe a debt of gratitude to mr roberts most difficult to discharge but if these sketches were all that the artist brought home whatever value is to be attached to them as statements of fact they are altogether insufficient for the producing of pictures i saw among them no single instance of a downright study of a study in which the real hues and shades of sky and earth had been honestly realized or attempted nor were there on the other hand any of those invaluableblottedfiveminutes works which record the unity of some single and magnificent impressions hence the pictures which have been painted from these sketches have been as much alike in their want of impressiveness as the sketches themselves and have never borne the living aspect of the egyptian light it has always been impossible to say whether the red in them not a pleasant one was meant for hot sunshine or for red sandstonetheir power has been farther destroyed by the necessity the artist seems to feel himself under of eking out their effect by points of bright foreground color and thus we have been encumbered with caftans pipes scymetars and black hair when all that we wanted was a lizard or an ibis it is perhaps owing to this want of earnestness in study rather than to deficiency of perception that the coloring of this artist is commonly untrue some time ago when he was painting spanish subjects his habit was to bring out his whites in relief from transparent bituminous browns which though not exactly right in color were at any rate warm and agreeable but of late his color has become cold waxy and opaque and in his deep shades he sometimes permits himself the use of a violent black which is altogether unjustifiable a picture of roslin chapel exhibited in 1844 showed this defect in the recess to which the stairs descend in an extravagant degree and another exhibited in the british institution instead of showing the exquisite crumbling and lichenous texture of the roslin stone was polished to as vapid smoothness as every french historical picture the general feebleness of the effect is increased by the insertion of the figures as violent pieces of local color unaffected by the light and unblended with the hues around them and bearing evidence of having been painted from models or draperies in the dead light of a room instead of sunshine on these deficiencies i should not have remarked but that by honest and determined painting from and of nature it is perfectly in the power of the artist to supply them and it is bitterly to be regretted that the accuracy and elegance of his work should not be aided by that genuineness of hue and effect which can only be given by the uncompromising effort to paint not a fine picture but an impressive and known verity  the two artists whose works it remains for us to review are men who have presented us with examples of the treatment of every kind of subject and among the rest with portions of architecture which the best of our exclusively architectural draughtsmen could not excel   § 36 clarkson stanfield  the frequent references made to the works of clarkson stanfield throughout the subsequent pages render it less necessary for me to speak of him here at any length he is the leader of the english realists and perhaps among the more remarkable of his characteristics is the look of commonsense and rationality which his compositions will always bear when opposed to any kind of affectation he appears to think of no other artist what he has learned has been from his own acquaintance with and affection for the steep hills and the deep sea and his modes of treatment are alike removed from sketchiness or incompletion and from exaggeration or effort the somewhat overprosaic tone of his subjects is rather a condescension to what he supposes to be public feeling than a sign of want of feeling in himself for in some of his sketches from nature or from fancy i have seen powers and perceptions manifested of a far higher order than any that are traceable in his academy works powers which i think him much to be blamed for checking the portion of his pictures usually most defective in this respect is the sky which is apt to be cold and uninventive always well drawn but with a kind of hesitation in the clouds whether it is to be fair or foul weather they having neither the joyfulness of rest nor the majesty of storm their color is apt also to verge on a morbid purple as was eminently the case in the large picture of the wreck on the coast of holland exhibited in 1844 a work in which both his powers and faults were prominently manifested the picture being full of good painting but wanting in its entire appeal there was no feeling of wreck about it and but for the damage about her bowsprit it would have been impossible for a landsman to say whether the hull was meant for a wreck or a guardship nevertheless it is always to be recollected that in subjects of this kind it is probable that much escapes us in consequence of our want of knowledge and that to the eye of the seaman much may be of interest and value which to us appears cold at all events this healthy and rational regard of things is incomparably preferable to the dramatic absurdities which weaker artists commit in matters marine and from coppercolored sunsets on green waves sixty feet high with cauliflower breakers and ninepin rocks from drowning on planks and starving on rafts and lying naked on beaches it is really refreshing to turn to a surge of stanfields true salt serviceable unsentimental sea it would be well however if he would sometimes take a higher flight the castle of ischia gave him a grand subject and a little more invention in the sky a little less muddiness in the rocks and a little more savageness in the sea would have made it an impressive picture it just misses the sublime yet is a fine work and better engraved than usual by the art union  one fault we cannot but venture to find even in our own extreme ignorance with mr stanfields boats they never look weatherbeaten there is something peculiarly precious in the rusty dusty tartrickled fishy phosphorescent brown of an old boat and when this has just dipped under a wave and rises to the sunshine it is enough to drive giorgione to despair i have never seen any effort at this by stanfield his boats always look new painted and clean witness especially the one before the ship in the wreck picture above noticed and there is some such absence of a right sense of color in other portions of his subject even his fishermen have always clean jackets and unsoiled caps and his very rocks are lichenless and by the way this ought to be noted respecting modern painters in general that they have not a proper sense of the value of dirt cottage children never appear but in fresh gotup caps and aprons and whitehanded beggars excite compassion in unexceptionable rags in reality almost all the colors of things associated with human life derive something of their expression and value from the tones of impurity and so enhance the value of the entirely pure tints of nature herself of stanfields rock and mountain drawing enough will be said hereafter his foliage is inferior his architecture admirably drawn but commonly wanting in color his picture of the doges palace at venice was quite claycold and untrue of late he has shown a marvellous predilection for the realization even to actually relieved texture of old wormeaten wood we trust he will not allow such fancies to carry him too far   § 37 j m w turner force of national feeling in all great painters  the name i have last to mention is that of j m w turner i do not intend to speak of this artist at present in general terms because my constant practice throughout this work is to say when i speak of an artist at all the very truth of what i believe and feel respecting him and the truth of what i believe and feel respecting turner would appear in this place unsupported by any proof mere rhapsody i shall therefore here confine myself to a rapid glance at the relations of his past and present works and to some notice of what he has failed of accomplishing the greater part of the subsequent chapters will be exclusively devoted to the examination of the new fields over which he has extended the range of landscape art  it is a fact more universally acknowledged than enforced or acted upon that all great painters of whatever school have been great only in their rendering of what they had seen and felt from early childhood and that the greatest among them have been the most frank in acknowledging this their inability to treat anything successfully but that with which they had been familiar the madonna of raffaelle was born on the urbino mountains ghirlandajos is a florentine bellinis a venetian there is not the slightest effort on the part of any one of these great men to paint her as a jewess it is not the place here to insist farther on a point so simple and so universally demonstrable expression character types of countenance costume color and accessories are with all great painters whatsoever those of their native land and that frankly and entirely without the slightest attempt at modification and i assert fearlessly that it is impossible that it should ever be otherwise and that no man ever painted or ever will paint well anything but what he has early and long seen early and long felt and early and long loved how far it is possible for the mind of one nation or generation to be healthily modified and taught by the work of another i presume not to determine but it depends upon whether the energy of the mind which receives the instruction be sufficient while it takes out of what it feeds upon that which is universal and common to all nature to resist all warping from national or temporary peculiarities nino pisano got nothing but good the modern french nothing but evil from the study of the antique but nino pisano had a god and a character all artists who have attempted to assume or in their weakness have been affected by the national peculiarities of other times and countries have instantly whatever their original power fallen to thirdrate rank or fallen altogether and have invariably lost their birthright and blessing lost their power over the human heart lost all capability of teaching or benefiting others compare the hybrid classification of wilson with the rich english purity of gainsborough compare the recent exhibition of middleage cartoons for the houses of parliament with the works of hogarth compare the sickly modern german imitations of the great italians with albert durer and holbein compare the vile classicality of canova and the modern italians with mino da fiesole luca della robbia and andrea del verrocchio the manner of nicolo poussin is said to be greekit may be so this only i know that it is heartless and profitless the severity of the rule however extends not in full force to the nationality but only to the visibility of things for it is very possible for an artist of powerful mind to throw himself well into the feeling of foreign nations of his own time thus john lewis has been eminently successful in his seizing of spanish character yet it may be doubted if the seizure be such as spaniards themselves would acknowledge it is probably of the habits of the people more than their hearts continued efforts of this kind especially if their subjects be varied assuredly end in failure lewis who seemed so eminently penetrative in spain sent nothing from italy but complexions and costumes and i expect no good from his stay in egypt english artists are usually entirely ruined by residence in italy but for this there are collateral causes which it is not here the place to examine be this as it may and whatever success may be attained in pictures of slight and unpretending aim of genre as they are called in the rendering of foreign character of this i am certain that whatever is to be truly great and affecting must have on it the strong stamp of the native land not a law this but a necessity from the intense hold on their country of the affections of all truly great men all classicality all middleage patent reviving is utterly vain and absurd if we are now to do anything great good awful religious it must be got out of our own little island and out of this year 1846 railroads and all if a british painter i say this in earnest seriousness cannot make historical characters out of the british house of peers he cannot paint history and if he cannot make a madonna of a british girl of the nineteenth century he cannot paint one at all   § 38 influence of this feeling on the choice of landscape subject  the rule of course holds in landscape yet so far less authoritatively that the material nature of all countries and times is in many points actually and in all in principle the same so that feelings educated in cumberland may find their food in switzerland and impressions first received among the rocks of cornwall be recalled upon the precipices of genoa add to this actual sameness the power of every great mind to possess itself of the spirit of things once presented to it and it is evident that little limitation can be set to the landscape painter as to the choice of his field and that the law of nationality will hold with him only so far as a certain joyfulness and completion will be by preference found in those parts of his subject which remind him of his own land but if he attempt to impress on his landscapes any other spirit than that he has felt and to make them landscapes of other times it is all over with him at least in the degree in which such reflected moonshine takes place of the genuine light of the present day  the reader will at once perceive how much trouble this simple principle will save both the painter and the critic it at once sets aside the whole school of common composition and exonerates us from the labor of minutely examining any landscape which has nymphs or philosophers in it  it is hardly necessary for us to illustrate this principle by any reference to the works of early landscape painters as i suppose it is universally acknowledged with respect to them titian being the most remarkable instance of the influence of the native air on a strong mind and claude of that of the classical poison on a weak one but it is very necessary to keep it in mind in reviewing the works of our great modern landscape painter   § 39 its peculiar manifestation in turner  i do not know in what district of england turner first or longest studied but the scenery whose influence i can trace most definitely throughout his works varied as they are is that of yorkshire of all his drawings i think those of the yorkshire series have the most heart in them the most affectionate simple unwearied serious finishing of truth there is in them little seeking after effect but a strong love of place little exhibition of the artists own powers or peculiarities but intense appreciation of the smallest local minutiæ these drawings have unfortunately changed hands frequently and have been abused and ill treated by picture dealers and cleaners the greater number of them are now mere wrecks i name them not as instances but as proofs of the artists study in this district for the affection to which they owe their excellence must have been grounded long years before it is to be traced not only in these drawings of the places themselves but in the peculiar love of the painter for rounded forms of hills not but that he is right in this on general principles for i doubt not that with his peculiar feeling for beauty of line his hills would have been rounded still even if he had studied first among the peaks of cadore but rounded to the same extent and with the same delight in their roundness they would not have been it is i believe to those broad wooded steeps and swells of the yorkshire downs that we in part owe the singular massiveness that prevails in turners mountain drawing and gives it one of its chief elements of grandeur let the reader open the liber studiorum and compare the painters enjoyment of the lines in the ben arthur with his comparative uncomfortableness among those of the aiguilles about the mer de glace great as he is those peaks would have been touched very differently by a savoyard as great as he  i am in the habit of looking to the yorkshire drawings as indicating one of the culminating points in turners career in these he attained the highest degree of what he had up to that time attempted namely finish and quantity of form united with expression of atmosphere and light without color his early drawings are singularly instructive in this definiteness and simplicity of aim no complicated or brilliant color is ever thought of in them they are little more than exquisite studies in light and shade very green blues being used for the shadows and golden browns for the lights the difficulty and treachery of color being thus avoided the artist was able to bend his whole mind upon the drawing and thus to attain such decision delicacy and completeness as have never in any wise been equalled and as might serve him for a secure foundation in all after experiments of the quantity and precision of his details the drawings made for hakewills italy are singular examples the most perfect gem in execution is a little bit on the rhine with reeds in the foreground in the possession of b g windus esq of tottenham but the yorkshire drawings seem to be on the whole the most noble representatives of his art at this period  about the time of their production the artist seems to have felt that he had done either all that could be done or all that was necessary in that manner and began to reach after something beyond it the element of color begins to mingle with his work and in the first efforts to reconcile his intense feeling for it with his careful form several anomalies begin to be visible and some unfortunate or uninteresting works necessarily belong to the period the england drawings which are very characteristic of it are exceedingly unequalsome as the oakhampton kilgarren alnwick and llanthony being among his finest works others as the windsor from eton the eton college and the bedford showing coarseness and conventionality   § 40 the domestic subjects of the liber studiorum  i do not know at what time the painter first went abroad but among the earliest of the series of the liber studiorum dates 1808 1809 occur the magnificent mont st gothard and little devils bridge now it is remarkable that after his acquaintance with this scenery so congenial in almost all respects with the energy of his mind and supplying him with materials of which in these two subjects and in the chartreuse and several others afterwards he showed both his entire appreciation and command the proportion of english to foreign subjects should in the rest of the work be more than two to one and that those english subjects should bemany of themof a kind peculiarly simple and of everyday occurrence such as the pembury mill the farm yard composition with the white horse that with the cocks and pigs hedging and ditching watercress gatherers scene at twickenham and the beautiful and solemn rustic subject called a watermill and that the architectural subjects instead of being taken as might have been expected of an artist so fond of treating effects of extended space from some of the enormous continental masses are almost exclusively british rivaulx holy island dumblain dunstanborough chepstow st catherines greenwich hospital an english parish church a saxon ruin and an exquisite reminiscence of the english lowland castle in the pastoral with the brook wooden bridge and wild duck to all of which we have nothing foreign to oppose but three slight illconsidered and unsatisfactory subjects from basle lauffenbourg and another swiss village and further not only is the preponderance of subject british but of affection also for it is strange with what fulness and completion the home subjects are treated in comparison with the greater part of the foreign ones compare the figures and sheep in the hedging and ditching and the east gate winchelsea together with the near leafage with the puzzled foreground and inappropriate figures of the lake of thun or the cattle and road of the st catherines hill with the foreground of the bonneville or the exquisite figure with the sheaf of corn in the watermill with the vintages of the grenoble subject  in his foliage the same predilections are remarkable reminiscences of english willows by the brooks and english forest glades mingle even with the heroic foliage of the Æsacus and hesperie and the cephalus into the pine whether of switzerland or the glorious stone he cannot enter or enters at his peril like ariel those of the valley of chamounix are fine masses better pines than other peoples but not a bit like pines for all that he feels his weakness and tears them off the distant mountains with the mercilessness of an avalanche the stone pines of the two italian compositions are fine in their arrangement but they are very pitiful pines the glory of the alpine rose he never touches he munches chestnuts with no relish never has learned to like olives and by the vine we find him in the foreground of the grenoble alps laid utterly and incontrovertibly on his back  i adduce these evidences of turners nationality and innumerable others might be given if need were not as proofs of weakness but of power not so much as testifying want of perception in foreign lands as strong hold on his own will for i am sure that no artist who has not this hold upon his own will ever get good out of any other keeping this principle in mind it is instructive to observe the depth and solemnity which turners feeling received from the scenery of the continent the keen appreciation up to a certain point of all that is locally characteristic and the ready seizure for future use of all valuable material   § 41 turners painting of french and swiss landscape the latter         deficient  of all foreign countries he has most entirely entered into the spirit of france partly because here he found more fellowship of scene with his own england partly because an amount of thought which will miss of italy or switzerland will fathom france partly because there is in the french foliage and forms of ground much that is especially congenial with his own peculiar choice of form to what cause it is owing i cannot tell nor is it generally allowed or felt but of the fact i am certain that for grace of stem and perfection of form in their transparent foliage the french trees are altogether unmatched and their modes of grouping and massing are so perfectly and constantly beautiful that i think of all countries for educating an artist to the perception of grace france bears the bell and that not romantic nor mountainous france not the vosges nor auvergne nor provence but lowland france picardy and normandy the valleys of the loire and seine and even the district so thoughtlessly and mindlessly abused by english travellers as uninteresting traversed between calais and dijon of which there is not a single valley but is full of the most lovely pictures nor a mile from which the artist may not receive instruction the district immediately about sens being perhaps the most valuable from the grandeur of its lines of poplars and the unimaginable finish and beauty of the tree forms in the two great avenues without the walls of this kind of beauty turner was the first to take cognizance and he still remains the only but in himself the sufficient painter of french landscape one of the most beautiful examples is the drawing of trees engraved for the keepsake now in the possession of b g windus esq the drawings made to illustrate the scenery of the rivers of france supply instances of the most varied character  the artist appears until very lately rather to have taken from switzerland thoughts and general conceptions of size and of grand form and effect to be used in his after compositions than to have attempted the seizing of its actual character this was beforehand to be expected from the utter physical impossibility of rendering certain effects of swiss scenery and the monotony and unmanageableness of others the valley of chamounix in the collection of walter fawkes esq i have never seen it has a high reputation the hannibal passing the alps in its present state exhibits nothing but a heavy shower and a crowd of people getting wet another picture in the artists gallery of a landfall is most masterly and interesting but more daring than agreeable the snowstorm avalanche and inundation is one of his mightiest works but the amount of mountain drawing in it is less than of cloud and effect the subjects in the liber studiorum are on the whole the most intensely felt and next to them the vignettes to rogerss poems and italy of some recent drawings of swiss subject i shall speak presently   § 42 his rendering of italian character still less successful his         large compositions how failing  the effect of italy upon his mind is very puzzling on the one hand it gave him the solemnity and power which are manifested in the historical compositions of the liber studiorum more especially the rizpah the cephalus the scene from the fairy queen and the Æsacus and hesperie on the other he seems never to have entered thoroughly into the spirit of italy and the materials he obtained there were afterwards but awkwardly introduced in his large compositions  of these there are very few at all worthy of him none but the liber studiorum subjects are thoroughly great and these are great because there is in them the seriousness without the materials of other countries and times there is nothing particularly indicative of palestine in the barley harvest of the rizpah nor in those round and awful trees only the solemnity of the south in the lifting of the near burning moon the rocks of the jason may be seen in any quarry of warwickshire sandstone jason himself has not a bit of greek about himhe is a simple warrior of no period in particular nay i think there is something of the nineteenth century about his legs when local character of this classical kind is attempted the painter is visibly cramped awkward resemblances to claude testify the want of his usual forceful originality in the tenth plague of egypt he makes us think of belzoni rather than of moses the fifth is a total failure the pyramids look like brickkilns and the fire running along the ground bears brotherly resemblance to the burning of manure the realization of the tenth plague now in his gallery is finer than the study but still uninteresting and of the large compositions which have much of italy in them the greater part are overwhelmed with quantity and deficient in emotion the crossing the brook is one of the best of these hybrid pictures incomparable in its tree drawing it yet leaves us doubtful where we are to look and what we are to feel it is northern in its color southern in its foliage italy in its details and england in its sensations without the grandeur of the one or the healthiness of the other  the two carthages are mere rationalizations of claude one of them excessively bad in color the other a grand thought and yet one of the kind which does no one any good because everything in it is reciprocally sacrificed the foliage is sacrificed to the architecture the architecture to the water the water is neither sea nor river nor lake nor brook nor canal and savors of regents park the foreground is uncomfortable groundlet on building leases so the caligulas bridge temple of jupiter departure of regulus ancient italy ciceros villa and such others come they from whose hand they may i class under the general head of nonsense pictures there never can be any wholesome feeling developed in these preposterous accumulations and where the artists feeling fails his art follows so that the worst possible examples of turners color are found in pictures of this class in one or two instances he has broken through the conventional rules and then is always fine as in the hero and leander but in general the picture rises in value as it approaches to a view as the fountain of fallacy a piece of rich northern italy with some fairy waterworks this picture was unrivalled in color once but is now a mere wreck so the rape of proserpine though it is singular that in his academy pictures even his simplicity fails of reaching ideality in this picture of proserpine the nature is not the grand nature of all time it is indubitably modern14 and we are perfectly electrified at anybodys being carried away in the corner except by people with spiky hats and carabines this is traceable to several causes partly to the want of any grand specific form partly to the too evident middleage character of the ruins crowning the hills and to a multiplicity of minor causes which we cannot at present enter into   § 43 his views of italy destroyed by brilliancy and redundant quantity  neither in his actual views of italy has turner ever caught her true spirit except in the little vignettes to rogerss poems the villa of galileo the nameless composition with stone pines the several villa moonlights and the convent compositions in the voyage of columbus are altogether exquisite but this is owing chiefly to their simplicity and perhaps in some measure to their smallness of size none of his large pictures at all equal them the bay of baiæ is encumbered with material it contains ten times as much as is necessary to a good picture and yet is so crude in color as to look unfinished the palestrina is fall of raw white and has a look of hampton court about its long avenue the modern italy is purely english in its near foliage it is composed from tivoli material enriched and arranged most dexterously but it has the look of a rich arrangement and not the virtue of the real thing the early tivoli a large drawing taken from below the falls was as little true and still less fortunate the trees there being altogether affected and artificial the florence engraved in the keepsake is a glorious drawing as far as regards the passage with the bridge and sunlight on the arno the cascine foliage and distant plain and the towers of the fortress on the left but the details of the duomo and the city are entirely missed and with them the majesty of the whole scene the vines and melons of the foreground are disorderly and its cypresses conventional in fact i recollect no instance of turners drawing a cypress except in general terms  the chief reason of these failures i imagine to be the effort of the artist to put joyousness and brilliancy of effect upon scenes eminently pensive to substitute radiance for serenity of light and to force the freedom and breadth of line which he learned to love on english downs and highland moors out of a country dotted by campaniles and square convents bristled with cypresses partitioned by walls and gone up and down by steps  in one of the cities of italy he had no such difficulties to encounter at venice he found freedom of space brilliancy of light variety of color massy simplicity of general form and to venice we owe many of the motives in which his highest powers of color have been displayed after that change in his system of which we must now take note   § 44 changes introduced by him in the received system of art  among the earlier paintings of turner the culminating period marked by the yorkshire series in his drawings is distinguished by great solemnity and simplicity of subject prevalent gloom in light and shade and brown in the hue the drawing manly but careful the minutiæ sometimes exquisitely delicate all the finest works of this period are i believe without exception views or quiet single thoughts the calder bridge belonging to e bicknell esq is a most pure and beautiful example the ivy bridge i imagine to be later but its rock foreground is altogether unrivalled and remarkable for its delicacy of detail a butterfly is seen settled on one of the large brown stones in the midst of the torrent two paintings of bonneville in savoy one in the possession of abel allnutt esq the other and i think the finest in a collection at birmingham show more variety of color than is usual with him at the period and are in every respect magnificent examples pictures of this class are of peculiar value for the larger compositions of the same period are all poor in color and most of them much damaged but the smaller works have been far finer originally and their color seems secure there is nothing in the range of landscape art equal to them in their way but the full character and capacity of the painter is not in them grand as they are in their sobriety they still leave much to be desired there is great heaviness in their shadows the material is never thoroughly vanquished though this partly for a very noble reason that the painter is always thinking of and referring to nature and indulges in no artistical conventionalities and sometimes the handling appears feeble in warmth lightness and transparency they have no chance against gainsborough in clear skies and air tone they are alike unfortunate when they provoke comparison with claude and in force and solemnity they can in no wise stand with the landscape of the venetians  the painter evidently felt that he had farther powers and pressed forward into the field where alone they could be brought into play it was impossible for him with all his keen and longdisciplined perceptions not to feel that the real color of nature had never been attempted by any school and that though conventional representations had been given by the venetians of sunlight and twilight by invariably rendering the whites golden and the blues green yet of the actual joyous pure roseate hues of the external world no record had ever been given he saw also that the finish and specific grandeur of nature had been given but her fulness space and mystery never and he saw that the great landscape painters had always sunk the lower middle tints of nature in extreme shade bringing the entire melody of color as many degrees down as their possible light was inferior to natures and that in so doing a gloomy principle had influenced them even in their choice of subject  for the conventional color he substituted a pure straightforward rendering of fact as far as was in his power and that not of such fact as had been before even suggested but of all that is most brilliant beautiful and inimitable he went to the cataract for its iris to the conflagration for its flames asked of the sea its intensest azure of the sky its clearest gold for the limited space and defined forms of elder landscape he substituted the quantity and the mystery of the vastest scenes of earth and for the subdued chiaroscuro he substituted first a balanced diminution of oppositions throughout the scale and afterwards in one or two instances attempted the reverse of the old principle taking the lowest portion of the scale truly and merging the upper part in high light   § 45 difficulties of his later manner resultant deficiencies  innovations so daring and so various could not be introduced without corresponding peril the difficulties that lay in his way were more than any human intellect could altogether surmount in his time there has been no one system of color generally approved every artist has his own method and his own vehicle how to do what gainsborough did we know not much less what titian to invent a new system of color can hardly be expected of those who cannot recover the old to obtain perfectly satisfactory results in color under the new conditions introduced by turner would at least have required the exertion of all his energies in that sole direction but color has always been only his second object the effects of space and form in which he delights often require the employment of means and method totally at variance with those necessary for the obtaining of pure color it is physically impossible for instance rightly to draw certain forms of the upper clouds with the brush nothing will do it but the pallet knife with loaded white after the blue ground is prepared now it is impossible that a cloud so drawn however glazed afterwards should have the virtue of a thin warm tint of titians showing the canvas throughout so it happens continually add to these difficulties those of the peculiar subjects attempted and to these again all that belong to the altered system of chiaroscuro and it is evident that we must not be surprised at finding many deficiencies or faults in such works especially in the earlier of them nor even suffer ourselves to be withdrawn by the pursuit of what seems censurable from our devotion to what is mighty  notwithstanding in some chosen examples of pictures of this kind i will name three juliet and her nurse the old temeraire and the slave ship i do not admit that there are at the time of their first appearing on the walls of the royal academy any demonstrably avoidable faults i do not deny that there may be nay that it is likely there are but there is no living artist in europe whose judgment might safely be taken on the subject or who could without arrogance affirm of any part of such a picture that it was wrong i am perfectly willing to allow that the lemon yellow is not properly representative of the yellow of the sky that the loading of the color is in many places disagreeable that many of the details are drawn with a kind of imperfection different from what they would have in nature and that many of the parts fail of imitation especially to an uneducated eye but no living authority is of weight enough to prove that the virtues of the picture could have been obtained at a less sacrifice or that they are not worth the sacrifice and though it is perfectly possible that such may be the case and that what turner has done may hereafter in some respects be done better i believe myself that these works are at the time of their first appearing as perfect as those of phidias or leonardo that is to say incapable in their way of any improvement conceivable by human mind  also it is only by comparison with such that we are authorized to affirm definite faults in any of his others for we should have been bound to speak at least for the present with the same modesty respecting even his worst pictures of this class had not his more noble efforts given us canons of criticism  but as was beforehand to be expected from the difficulties he grappled with turner is exceedingly unequal he appears always as a champion in the thick of fight sometimes with his foot on his enemies necks sometimes staggered or struck to his knee once or twice altogether down he has failed most frequently as before noticed in elaborate compositions from redundant quantity sometimes like most other men from overcare as very signally in a large and most labored drawing of bamborough sometimes unaccountably his eye for color seeming to fail him for a time as in a large painting of rome from the forum and in the ciceros villa building of carthage and the picture of this year in the british institution and sometimes i am sorry to say criminally from taking licenses which he must know to be illegitimate or indulging in conventionalities which he does not require  illustration the dogana and santa maria della salute venice                  from a painting by turner   § 46 reflection of his very recent works  on such instances i shall not insist for the finding fault with turner is not i think either decorous in myself or like to be beneficial to the reader15 the greater number of failures took place in the transition period when the artist was feeling for the new qualities and endeavoring to reconcile them with more careful elaboration of form than was properly consistent with them gradually his hand became more free his perception and grasp of the new truths more certain and his choice of subject more adapted to the exhibition of them but his powers did not attain their highest results till towards the year 1840 about which period they did so suddenly and with a vigor and concentration which rendered his pictures at that time almost incomparable with those which had preceded them the drawings of nemi and oberwesel in the possession of b g windus esq were among the first evidences of this sudden advance only the foliage in both of these is inferior and it is remarkable that in this phase of his art turner has drawn little foliage and that little badlythe great characteristic of it being its power beauty and majesty of color and its abandonment of all littleness and division of thought to a single impression in the year 1842 he made some drawings from recent sketches in switzerland these with some produced in the following years all of swiss subject i consider to be on the whole the most characteristic and perfect works he has ever produced the academy pictures were far inferior to them but among these examples of the same power were not wanting more especially in the smaller pictures of venice the sun of venice going to sea the san benedetto looking towards fusina and a view of murano with the cemetery were all faultless another of venice seen from near fusina with sunlight and moonlight mixed 1844 was i think when i first saw it and it still remains little injured the most perfectly beautiful piece of color of all that i have seen produced by human hands by any means or at any period of the exhibition of 1845 i have only seen a small venice still i believe in the artists possession and the two whaling subjects the venice is a secondrate work and the two others altogether unworthy of him  in conclusion of our present sketch of the course of landscape art it may be generally stated that turner is the only painter so far as i know who has ever drawn the sky not the clear sky which we before saw belonged exclusively to the religious schools but the various forms and phenomena of the cloudy heavens all previous artists having only represented it typically or partially but he absolutely and universally he is the only painter who has ever drawn a mountain or a stone no other man ever having learned their organization or possessed himself of their spirit except in part and obscurely the one or two stones noted of tintorets vol ii part iii ch 3 are perhaps hardly enough on which to found an exception in his favor he is the only painter who ever drew the stem of a tree titian having come the nearest before him and excelling him in the muscular development of the larger trunks though sometimes losing the woody strength in a serpentlike flaccidity but missing the grace and character of the ramifications he is the only painter who has ever represented the surface of calm or the force of agitated water who has represented the effects of space on distant objects or who has rendered the abstract beauty of natural color these assertions i make deliberately after careful weighing and consideration in no spirit of dispute or momentary zeal but from strong and convinced feeling and with the consciousness of being able to prove them   § 47 difficulty of demonstration in such subjects  this proof is only partially and incidentally attempted in the present portion of this work which was originally written as before explained for a temporary purpose and which therefore i should have gladly cancelled but that relating as it does only to simple matters of fact and not to those of feeling it may still perhaps be of service to some readers who would be unwilling to enter into the more speculative fields with which the succeeding sections are concerned i leave therefore nearly as it was originally written the following examination of the relative truthfulness of elder and of recent art always requesting the reader to remember as some excuse for the inadequate execution even of what i have here attempted how difficult it is to express or explain by language only those delicate qualities of the object of sense on the seizing of which all refined truth of representation depends try for instance to explain in language the exact qualities of the lines on which depend the whole truth and beauty of expression about the halfopened lips of raffaelles st catherine there is indeed nothing in landscape so ineffable as this but there is no part nor portion of gods works in which the delicacy appreciable by a cultivated eye and necessary to be rendered in art is not beyond all expression and explanation i cannot tell it you if you do not see it and thus i have been entirely unable in the following pages to demonstrate clearly anything of really deep and perfect truth nothing but what is coarse and commonplace in matters to be judged of by the senses is within the reach of argument how much or how little i have done must be judged of by the reader how much it is impossible to do i have more fully shown in the concluding section  i shall first take into consideration those general truths common to all the objects of nature which are productive of what is usually called effect that is to say truths of tone general color space and light i shall then investigate the truths of specific form and color in the four great component parts of landscapesky earth water and vegetation   footnotes    6 not the large paradise but the fall of adam a small picture     chiefly in brown and gray near titians assumption its companion     the death of abel is remarkable as containing a group of trees     which turner i believe accidentally has repeated nearly mass for     mass in the marly both are among the most noble works of this or     any other master whether for preciousness of color or energy of     thought    7 the triple leaf of this plant and white flower stained purple     probably gave it strange typical interest among the christian     painters angelico in using its leaves mixed with daisies in the     foreground of his crucifixion had i imagine a view also to its     chemical property    8 this is no rash method of judgment sweeping and hasty as it may     appear from the weaknesses of an artist or failures however     numerous we have no right to conjecture his total inability a time     may come when he may rise into sudden strength or an instance occur     when his efforts shall be successful but there are some pictures     which rank not under the head of failures but of perpetrations or     commissions some things which a man cannot do nor say without     sealing forever his character and capacity the angel holding the     cross with his finger in his eye the roaring redfaced children     about the crown of thorns the blasphemous i speak deliberately and     determinedly head of christ upon the handkerchief and the mode in     which the martyrdom of the saint is exhibited i do not choose to     use the expressions which alone could characterize it are perfect     sufficient incontrovertible proofs that whatever appears good in     any of the doings of such a painter must be deceptive and that we     may be assured that our taste is corrupted and false whenever we     feel disposed to admire him i am prepared to support this position     however uncharitable it may seem a man may be tempted into a gross     sin by passion and forgiven and yet there are some kinds of sins     into which only men of a certain kind can be tempted and which     cannot be forgiven it should be added however that the artistical     qualities of these pictures are in every way worthy of the     conceptions they realize i do not recollect any instances of color     or execution so coarse and feelingless    9 it appears not to be sufficiently understood by those artists     who complain acrimoniously of their positions on the academy walls     that the academicians have in their own rooms a right to the line     and the best places near it in their taking this position there is     no abuse nor injustice but the academicians should remember that     with their rights they have their duties and their duty is to     determine among the works of artists not belonging to their body     those which are most likely to advance public knowledge and     judgment and to give these the best places next their own neither     would it detract from their dignity if they occasionally ceded a     square even of their own territory as they did gracefully and     rightly and i am sorry to add disinterestedly to the picture of     paul de la roche in 1844 now the academicians know perfectly well     that the mass of portrait which encumbers their walls at half height     is worse than useless seriously harmful to the public taste and it     was highly criminal i use the word advisedly that the valuable and     interesting work of fielding of which i have above spoken should     have been placed where it was above three rows of eyeglasses and     waistcoats a very beautiful work of hardings was treated either in     the same or the following exhibition with still greater injustice     fieldings was merely put out of sight hardings where its faults     were conspicuous and its virtues lost it was an alpine scene of     which the foreground rocks and torrents were painted with     unrivalled fidelity and precision the foliage was dexterous the     aerial gradations of the mountains tender and multitudinous their     forms carefully studied and very grand the blemish of the picture     was a buffcolored tower with a red roof singularly meagre in     detail and conventionally relieved

variance with what has been said of the     necessity of painting present times and objects it is not so a     great painter makes out of that which he finds before him something     which is independent of all time he can only do this out of the     materials ready to his hand but that which he builds has the     dignity of dateless age a little painter is annihilated by an     anachronism and is conventionally antique and involuntarily     modern    15 one point however it is incumbent upon me to notice being no     question of art but of material the reader will have observed that     i strictly limited the perfection of turners works to the time of     their first appearing on the walls of the royal academy it bitterly     grieves me to have to do this but the fact is indeed so no     picture of turners is seen in perfection a month after it is     painted the walhalla cracked before it had been eight days in the     academy rooms the vermilions frequently lose lustre long before the     exhibition is over and when all the colors begin to get hard a year     or two after the picture is painted a painful deadness and opacity     comes over them the whites especially becoming lifeless and many     of the warmer passages settling into a hard valueless brown even if     the paint remains perfectly firm which is far from being always the     case i believe that in some measure these results are unavoidable     the colors being so peculiarly blended and mingled in turners     present manner as almost to necessitate their irregular drying but     that they are not necessary to the extent in which they sometimes     take place is proved by the comparative safety of some even of the     more brilliant works thus the old temeraire is nearly safe in     color and quite firm while the juliet and her nurse is now the     ghost of what it was the slaver shows no cracks though it is     chilled in some of the darker passages while the walhalla and     several of the recent venices cracked in the royal academy it is     true that the damage makes no further progress after the first year     or two and that even in its altered state the picture is always     valuable and records its intention but it is bitterly to be     regretted that so great a painter should not leave a single work by     which in succeeding ages he might be estimated the fact of his     using means so imperfect together with that of his utter neglect of     the pictures in his own gallery are a phenomenon in human mind     which appears to me utterly inexplicable and both are without     excuse if the effects he desires cannot be to their full extent     produced except by these treacherous means one picture only should     be painted each year as an exhibition of immediate power and the     rest should be carried out whatever the expense of labor and time     in safe materials even at the risk of some deterioration of     immediate effect that which is greatest in him is entirely     independent of means much of what he now accomplishes     illegitimately might without doubt be attained in securer     modeswhat cannot should without hesitation be abandoned     fortunately the drawings appear subject to no such deterioration     many of them are now almost destroyed but this has been i think     always through ill treatment or has been the case only with very     early works i have myself known no instance of a drawing properly     protected and not rashly exposed to light suffering the slightest     change the great foes of turner as of all other great colorists     especially are the picture cleaner and the mounter                                      section ii                               of general truths                                      chapter i                               of truth of tone   § 1 meaning of the word tone first the right relation of objects in        shadow to the principal light  as i have already allowed that in effects of tone the old masters have never yet been equalled and as this is the first and nearly the last concession i shall have to make to them i wish it at once to be thoroughly understood how far it extends   § 2 secondly the quality of color by which it is felt to owe part of        its brightness to the hue of light upon it  i understand two things by the word tonefirst the exact relief and relation of objects against and to each other in substance and darkness as they are nearer or more distant and the perfect relation of the shades of all of them to the chief light of the picture whether that be sky water or anything else secondly the exact relation of the colors to the shadows to the colors of the lights so that they may be at once felt to be merely different degrees of the same light and the accurate relation among the illuminated parts themselves with respect to the degree in which they are influenced by the color of the light itself whether warm or cold so that the whole of the picture or where several tones are united those parts of it which are under each may be felt to be in one climate under one kind of light and in one kind of atmosphere this being chiefly dependent on that peculiar and inexplicable quality of each color laid on which makes the eye feel both what is the actual color of the object represented and that it is raised to its apparent pitch by illumination a very bright brown for instance out of sunshine may be precisely of the same shade of color as a very dead or cold brown in sunshine but it will be totally different in quality and that quality by which the illuminated dead color would be felt in nature different from the unilluminated bright one is what artists are perpetually aiming at and connoisseurs talking nonsense about under the name of tone the want of tone in pictures is caused by objects looking bright in their own positive hue and not by illumination and by the consequent want of sensation of the raising of their hues by light   § 3 difference between tone in its first sense and aerial perspective  the first of these meanings of the word tone is liable to be confounded with what is commonly called aerial perspective but aerial perspective is the expression of space by any means whatsoever sharpness of edge vividness of color etc assisted by greater pitch of shadow and requires only that objects should be detached from each other by degrees of intensity in proportion to their distance without requiring that the difference between the farthest and nearest should be in positive quantity the same that nature has put but what i have called tone requires that there should be the same sum of difference as well as the same division of differences   § 4 the pictures of the old masters perfect in relation of middle tints        to light  now the finely toned pictures of the old masters are in this respect some of the notes of nature played two or three octaves below her key the dark objects in the middle distance having precisely the same relation to the light of the sky which they have in nature but the light being necessarily infinitely lowered and the mass of the shadow deepened in the same degree i have often been struck when looking at a cameraobscuro on a dark day with the exact resemblance the image bore to one of the finest pictures of the old masters all the foliage coming dark against the sky and nothing being seen in its mass but here and there the isolated light of a silvery stem or an unusually illumined cluster of leafage   § 5 and consequently totally false in relation of middle tints to        darkness  now if this could be done consistently and all the notes of nature given in this way an octave or two down it would be right and necessary so to do but be it observed not only does nature surpass us in power of obtaining light as much as the sun surpasses white paper but she also infinitely surpasses us in her power of shade her deepest shades are void spaces from which no light whatever is reflected to the eye ours are black surfaces from which paint as black as we may a great deal of light is still reflected and which placed against one of natures deep bits of gloom would tell as distinct light here we are then with white paper for our highest light and visible illumined surface for our deepest shadow set to run the gauntlet against nature with the sun for her light and vacuity for her gloom it is evident that she can well afford to throw her material objects dark against the brilliant aerial tone of her sky and yet give in those objects themselves a thousand intermediate distances and tones before she comes to black or to anything like itall the illumined surfaces of her objects being as distinctly and vividly brighter than her nearest and darkest shadows as the sky is brighter than those illumined surfaces but if we against our poor dull obscurity of yellow paint instead of sky insist on having the same relation of shade in material objects we go down to the bottom of our scale at once and what in the world are we to do then where are all our intermediate distances to come fromhow are we to express the aerial relations among the parts themselves for instance of foliage whose most distant boughs are already almost blackhow are we to come up from this to the foreground and when we have done so how are we to express the distinction between its solid parts already as dark as we can make them and its vacant hollows which nature has marked sharp and clear and black among its lighted surfaces it cannot but be evident at a glance that if to any one of the steps from one distance to another we give the same quantity of difference in pitch of shade which nature does we must pay for this expenditure of our means by totally missing half a dozen distances not a whit less important or marked and so sacrifice a multitude of truths to obtain one and this accordingly was the means by which the old masters obtained their truth of tone they chose those steps of distance which are the most conspicuous and noticeablethat for instance from sky to foliage or from clouds to hillsand they gave these their precise pitch of difference in shade with exquisite accuracy of imitation their means were then exhausted and they were obliged to leave their trees flat masses of mere filledup outline and to omit the truths of space in every individual part of their picture by the thousand but this they did not care for it saved them trouble they reached their grand end imitative effect they thrust home just at the places where the common and careless eye looks for imitation and they attained the broadest and most faithful appearance of truth of tone which art can exhibit   § 6 general falsehood of such a system  but they are prodigals and foolish prodigals in art they lavish their whole means to get one truth and leave themselves powerless when they should seize a thousand and is it indeed worthy of being called a truth when we have a vast history given us to relate to the fulness of which neither our limits nor our language are adequate instead of giving all its parts abridged in the order of their importance to omit or deny the greater part of them that we may dwell with verbal fidelity on two or three nay the very truth to which the rest are sacrificed is rendered falsehood by their absence the relation of the tree to the sky is marked as an impossibility by the want of relation of its parts to each other   § 7 the principle of turner in this respect  turner starts from the beginning with a totally different principle he boldly takes pure white and justly for it is the sign of the most intense sunbeams for his highest light and lampblack for his deepest shade and between these he makes every degree of shade indicative of separate degree of distance16 giving each step of approach not the exact difference in pitch which it would have in nature but a difference bearing the same proportion to that which his sum of possible shade bears to the sum of natures shade so that an object half way between his horizon and his foreground will be exactly in half tint of force and every minute division of intermediate space will have just its proportionate share of the lesser sum and no more hence where the old masters expressed one distance he expresses a hundred and where they said furlongs he says leagues which of these modes of procedure be most agreeable with truth i think i may safely leave the reader to decide for himself he will see in this very first instance one proof of what we above asserted that the deceptive imitation of nature is inconsistent with real truth for the very means by which the old masters attained the apparent accuracy of tone which is so satisfying to the eye compelled them to give up all idea of real relations of retirement and to represent a few successive and marked stages of distance like the scenes of a theatre instead of the imperceptible multitudinous symmetrical retirement of nature who is not more careful to separate her nearest bush from her farthest one than to separate the nearest bough of that bush from the one next to it   § 8 comparison of n poussins phocion  take for instance one of the finest landscapes that ancient art has producedthe work of a really great and intellectual mind the quiet nicholas poussin in our own national gallery with the traveller washing his feet the first idea we receive from this picture is that it is evening and all the light coming from the horizon not so it is full moon the light coming steep from the left as is shown by the shadow of the stick on the righthand pedestalfor if the sun were not very high that shadow could not lose itself half way down and if it were not lateral the shadow would slope instead of being vertical now ask yourself and answer candidly if those black masses of foliage in which scarcely any form is seen but the outline be a true representation of trees under noonday sunlight sloping from the left bringing out as it necessarily would do their masses into golden green and marking every leaf and bough with sharp shadow and sparkling light the only truth in the picture is the exact pitch of relief against the sky of both trees and hills and to this the organization of the hills the intricacy of the foliage and everything indicative either of the nature of the light or the character of the objects are unhesitatingly sacrificed so much falsehood does it cost to obtain two apparent truths of tone or take as a still more glaring instance no 260 in the dulwich gallery where the trunks of the trees even of those farthest off on the left are as black as paint can make them and there is not and cannot be the slightest increase of force or any marking whatsoever of distance by color or any other means between them and the foreground   § 9 with turners mercury and argus  compare with these turners treatment of his materials in the mercury and argus he has here his light actually coming from the distance the sun being nearly in the centre of the picture and a violent relief of objects against it would be far more justifiable than in poussins case but this dark relief is used in its full force only with the nearest leaves of the nearest group of foliage overhanging the foreground from the left and between these and the more distant members of the same group though only three or four yards separate distinct aerial perspective and intervening mist and light are shown while the large tree in the centre though very dark as being very near compared with all the distance is much diminished in intensity of shade from this nearest group of leaves and is faint compared with all the foreground it is true that this tree has not in consequence the actual pitch of shade against the sky which it would have in nature but it has precisely as much as it possibly can have to leave it the same proportionate relation to the objects near at hand and it cannot but be evident to the thoughtful reader that whatever trickery or deception may be the result of a contrary mode of treatment this is the only scientific or essentially truthful system and that what it loses in tone it gains in aerial perspective   § 10 and with the datur hora quieti  compare again the last vignette in rogerss poems the datur hora quieti where everything even the darkest parts of the trees is kept pale and full of graduation even the bridge where it crosses the descending stream of sunshine rather lost in the light than relieved against it until we come up to the foreground and then the vigorous local black of the plough throws the whole picture into distance and sunshine i do not know anything in art which can for a moment be set beside this drawing for united intensity of light and repose  observe i am not at present speaking of the beauty or desirableness of the system of the old masters it may be sublime and affecting and ideal and intellectual and a great deal more but all i am concerned with at present is that it is not true while turners is the closest and most studied approach to truth of which the materials of art admit   § 11 the second sense of the word tone  § 12 remarkable difference in this respect between the paintings and         drawings of turner  § 13 not owing to want of power over the material  it was not therefore with reference to this division of the subject that i admitted inferiority in our great modern master to claude or poussin but with reference to the second and more usual meaning of the word tonethe exact relation and fitness of shadow and light and of the hues of all objects under them and more especially that precious quality of each color laid on which makes it appear a quiet color illuminated not a bright color in shade but i allow this inferiority only with respect to the paintings of turner not to his drawings i could select from among the works named in chap vi of this section pieces of tone absolutely faultless and perfect from the coolest grays of wintry dawn to the intense fire of summer noon and the difference between the prevailing character of these and that of nearly all the paintings for the early oil pictures of turner are far less perfect in tone than the most recent it is difficult to account for but on the supposition that there is something in the material which modern artists in general are incapable of mastering and which compels turner himself to think less of tone in oil color than of other and more important qualities the total failures of callcott whose struggles after tone ended so invariably in shivering winter or brown paint the misfortune of landseer with his evening sky in 1842 the frigidity of stanfield and the earthiness and opacity which all the magnificent power and admirable science of etty are unable entirely to conquer are too fatal and convincing proofs of the want of knowledge of means rather than of the absence of aim in modern artists as a body yet with respect to turner however much the want of tone in his early paintings the fall of carthage for instance and others painted at a time when he was producing the most exquisite hues of light in watercolor might seem to favor such a supposition there are passages in his recent works such for instance as the sunlight along the sea in the slaver which directly contradict it and which prove to us that where he now errs in tone as in the ciceros villa it is less owing to want of power to reach it than to the pursuit of some different and nobler end i shall therefore glance at the particular modes in which turner manages his tone in his present academy pictures the early ones must be given up at once place a genuine untouched claude beside the crossing the brook and the difference in value and tenderness of tone will be felt in an instant and felt the more painfully because all the cool and transparent qualities of claude would have been here desirable and in their place and appear to have been aimed at the foreground of the building of carthage and the greater part of the architecture of the fall are equally heavy and evidently paint if we compare them with genuine passages of claudes sunshine there is a very grand and simple piece of tone in the possession of j allnutt esq a sunset behind willows but even this is wanting in refinement of shadow and is crude in its extreme distance not so with the recent academy pictures many of their passages are absolutely faultless all are refined and marvellous and with the exception of the ciceros villa we shall find few pictures painted within the last ten years which do not either present us with perfect tone or with some higher beauty to which it is necessarily sacrificed if we glance at the requirements of nature and her superiority of means to ours we shall see why and how it is sacrificed   § 14 the two distinct qualities of light to be considered  light with reference to the tone it induces on objects is either to be considered as neutral and white bringing out local colors with fidelity or colored and consequently modifying these local tints with its own but the power of pure white light to exhibit local color is strangely variable the morning light of about nine or ten is usually very pure but the difference of its effect on different days independently of mere brilliancy is as inconceivable as inexplicable every one knows how capriciously the colors of a fine opal vary from day to day and how rare the lights are which bring them fully out now the expression of the strange penetrating deep neutral light which while it alters no color brings every color up to the highest possible pitch and key of pure harmonious intensity is the chief attribute of finelytoned pictures by the great colorists as opposed to pictures of equally high tone by masters who careless of color are content like cuyp to lose local tints in the golden blaze of absorbing light   § 15 falsehoods by which titian attains the appearance of quality in         light  falsehood in this neutral tone if it may be so called is a matter far more of feeling than of proof for any color is possible under such lights it is meagreness and feebleness only which are to be avoided and these are rather matters of sensation than of reasoning but it is yet easy enough to prove by what exaggerated and false means the pictures most celebrated for this quality are endowed with their richness and solemnity of color in the bacchus and ariadne of titian it is difficult to imagine anything more magnificently impossible than the blue of the distant landscapeimpossible not from its vividness but because it is not faint and aerial enough to account for its purity of color it is too dark and blue at the same time and there is indeed so total a want of atmosphere in it that but for the difference of form it would be impossible to tell the mountains intended to be ten miles off from the robe of ariadne close to the spectator yet make this blue faint aerial and distantmake it in the slightest degree to resemble the truth of natures colorand all the tone of the picture all its intensity and splendor will vanish on the instant so again in the exquisite and inimitable little bit of color the europa in the dulwich gallery the blue of the dark promontory on the left is thoroughly absurd and impossible and the warm tones of the clouds equally so unless it were sunset but the blue especially because it is nearer than several points of land which are equally in shadow and yet are rendered in warm gray but the whole value and tone of the picture would be destroyed if this blue were altered   § 16 turner will not use such means  § 17 but gains in essential truth by the sacrifice  § 18 the second quality of light  now as much of this kind of richness of tone is always given by turner as is compatible with truth of aerial effect but he will not sacrifice the higher truths of his landscape to mere pitch of color as titian does he infinitely prefers having the power of giving extension of space and fulness of form to that of giving deep melodies of tone he feels too much the incapacity of art with its feeble means of light to give the abundance of natures gradations and therefore it is that taking pure white for his highest expression of light that even pure yellow may give him one more step in the scale of shade he becomes necessarily inferior in richness of effect to the old masters of tone who always used a golden highest light but gains by the sacrifice a thousand more essential truths for though we all know how much more like light in the abstract a finelytoned warm hue will be to the feelings than white yet it is utterly impossible to mark the same number of gradations between such a sobered high light and the deepest shadow which we can between this and white and as these gradations are absolutely necessary to give the facts of form and distance which as we have above shown are more important than any truths of tone17 turner sacrifices the richness of his picture to its completenessthe manner of the statement to its matter and not only is he right in doing this for the sake of space but he is right also in the abstract question of color for as we observed above sect 14 it is only the white lightthe perfect unmodified group of rayswhich will bring out local color perfectly and if the picture therefore is to be complete in its system of color that is if it is to have each of the three primitives in their purity it must have white for its highest light otherwise the purity of one of them at least will be impossible and this leads us to notice the second and more frequent quality of light which is assumed if we make our highest representation of it yellow the positive hue namely which it may itself possess of course modifying whatever local tints it exhibits and thereby rendering certain colors necessary and certain colors impossible under the direct yellow light of a descending sun for instance pure white and pure blue are both impossible because the purest whites and blues that nature could produce would be turned in some degree into gold or green by it and when the sun is within half a degree of the horizon if the sky be clear a rose light supersedes the golden one still more overwhelming in its effect on local color i have seen the pale fresh green of spring vegetation in the gardens of venice on the lido side turned pure russet or between that and crimson by a vivid sunset of this kind every particle of green color being absolutely annihilated and so under all colored lights and there are few from dawn to twilight which are not slightly tinted by some accident of atmosphere there is a change of local color which when in a picture it is so exactly proportioned that we feel at once both what the local colors are in themselves and what is the color and strength of the light upon them gives us truth of tone   § 19 the perfection of cuyp in this respect interfered with by numerous         solecisms  for expression of effects of yellow sunlight parts might be chosen out of the good pictures of cuyp which have never been equalled in art but i much doubt if there be a single bright cuyp in the world which taken as a whole does not present many glaring solecisms in tone i have not seen many fine pictures of his which were not utterly spoiled by the vermilion dress of some principal figure a vermilion totally unaffected and unwarmed by the golden hue of the rest of the picture and what is worse with little distinction between its own illumined and shaded parts so that it appears altogether out of sunshine the color of a bright vermilion in dead cold daylight it is possible that the original color may have gone down in all cases or that these parts may have been villanously repainted but i am the rather disposed to believe them genuine because even throughout the best of his pictures there are evident recurrences of the same kind of solecism in other colorsgreens for instanceas in the steep bank on the right of the largest picture in the dulwich gallery and browns as in the lying cow in the same picture which is in most visible and painful contrast with the one standing beside it the flank of the standing one being bathed in breathing sunshine and the reposing one laid in with as dead opaque and lifeless brown as ever came raw from a novices pallet and again in that marked 83 while the figures on the right are walking in the most precious light and those just beyond them in the distance leave a furlong or two of pure visible sunbeams between us and them the cows in the centre are entirely deprived poor things of both light and air and these failing parts though they often escape the eye when we are near the picture and able to dwell upon what is beautiful in it yet so injure its whole effect that i question if there be many cuyps in which vivid colors occur which will not lose their effect and become cold and flat at a distance of ten or twelve paces retaining their influence only when the eye is close enough to rest on the right parts without including the whole take for instance the large one in our national gallery seen from the opposite door where the black cow appears a great deal nearer than the dogs and the golden tones of the distance look like a sepia drawing rather than like sunshine owing chiefly to the utter want of aerial grays indicated through them   § 20 turner is not so perfect in partsfar more so in the whole  now there is no instance in the works of turner of anything so faithful and imitative of sunshine as the best parts of cuyp but at the same time there is not a single vestige of the same kind of solecism it is true that in his fondness for color turner is in the habit of allowing excessively cold fragments in big warmest pictures but these are never observe warm colors with no light upon them useless as contrasts while they are discords in the tone but they are bits of the very coolest tints partially removed from the general influence and exquisitely valuable as color though with all deference be it spoken i think them sometimes slightly destructive of what would otherwise be perfect tone for instance the two blue and white stripes on the drifting flag of the slave ship are i think the least degree too purely cool i think both the blue and white would be impossible under such a light and in the same way the white parts of the dress of the napoleon interfered by their coolness with the perfectly managed warmth of all the rest of the picture but both these lights are reflexes and it is nearly impossible to say what tones may be assumed even by the warmest light reflected from a cool surface so that we cannot actually convict these parts of falsehood and though we should have liked the tone of the picture better had they been slightly warmer we cannot but like the color of the picture better with them as they are while cuyps failing portions are not only evidently and demonstrably false being in direct light but are as disagreeable in color as false in tone and injurious to everything near them and the best proof of the grammatical accuracy of the tones of turner is in the perfect and unchanging influence of all his pictures at any distance we approach only to follow the sunshine into every cranny of the leafage and retire only to feel it diffused over the scene the whole picture glowing like a sun or star at whatever distance we stand and lighting the air between us and it while many even of the best pictures of claude must be looked close into to be felt and lose light every foot that we retire the smallest of the three seaports in the national gallery is valuable and right in tone when we are close to it but ten yards off it is all brickdust offensively and evidently false in its whole hue   § 21 the power in turner of uniting a number of tones  the comparison of turner with cuyp and claude may sound strange in most ears but this is chiefly because we are not in the habit of analyzing and dwelling upon those difficult and daring passages of the modern master which do not at first appeal to our ordinary notions of truth owing to his habit of uniting two three or even more separate tones in the same composition in this also he strictly follows nature for wherever climate changes tone changes and the climate changes with every 200 feet of elevation so that the upper clouds are always different in tone from the lower ones these from the rest of the landscape and in all probability some part of the horizon from the rest and when nature allows this in a high degree as in her most gorgeous effects she always will she does not herself impress at once with intensity of tone as in the deep and quiet yellows of a july evening but rather with the magnificence and variety of associated color in which if we give time and attention to it we shall gradually find the solemnity and the depth of twenty tones instead of one now in turners power of associating cold with warm light no one has ever approached or even ventured into the same field with him the old masters content with one simple tone sacrificed to its unity all the exquisite gradations and varied touches of relief and change by which nature unites her hours with each other they gave the warmth of the sinking sun overwhelming all things in its gold but they did not give those gray passages about the horizon where seen through its dying light the cool and the gloom of night gather themselves for their victory whether it was in them impotence or judgment it is not for me to decide i have only to point to the daring of turner in this respect as something to which art affords no matter of comparison as that in which the mere attempt is in itself superiority take the evening effect with the temeraire that picture will not at the first glance deceive as a piece of actual sunlight but this is because there is in it more than sunlight because under the blazing veil of vaulted fire which lights the vessel on her last path there is a blue deep desolate hollow of darkness out of which you can hear the voice of the night wind and the dull boom of the disturbed sea because the cold deadly shadows of the twilight are gathering through every sunbeam and moment by moment as you look you will fancy some new film and faintness of the night has risen over the vastness of the departing form   § 22 recapitulation  and if in effects of this kind time be taken to dwell upon the individual tones and to study the laws of their reconcilement there will be found in the recent academy pictures of this great artist a mass of various truth to which nothing can be brought for comparison which stands not only unrivalled but uncontended with and which when in carrying out it may be inferior to some of the picked passages of the old masters is so through deliberate choice rather to suggest a multitude of truths than to imitate one and through a strife with difficulties of effect of which art can afford no parallel example nay in the next chapter respecting color we shall see farther reason for doubting the truth of claude cuyp and poussin in tonereason so palpable that if these were all that were to be contended with i should scarcely have allowed any inferiority in turner whatsoever18 but i allow it not so much with reference to the deceptive imitations of sunlight wrought out with desperate exaggerations of shade of the professed landscape painters as with reference to the glory of rubens the glow of titian the silver tenderness of cagliari and perhaps more than all to the precious and pure passages of intense feeling and heavenly light holy and undefiled and glorious with the changeless passion of eternity which sanctify with their shadeless peace the deep and noble conceptions of the early school of italyof fra bartolomeo perugino and the early mind of raffaelle   footnotes    16 of course i am not speaking here of treatment of chiaroscuro     but of that quantity of depth of shade by which coeteris     paribus a near object will exceed a distant one for the truth of     the systems of turner and the old masters as regards chiaroscuro     vide chapter iii of this section § 8    17 more important observe as matters of truth or fact it may     often chance that as a matter of feeling the tone is the more     important of the two but with this we have here no concern    18 we must not leave the subject of tone without alluding to the     works of the late george barrett which afford glorious and exalted     passages of light and john varley who though less truthful in his     aim was frequently deep in his feeling some of the sketches of de     wint are also admirable in this respect as for our oil pictures     the less that is said about them the better callcott has the truest     aim but not having any eye for color it is impossible for him to     succeed in tone                                      chapter ii                               of truth of color   § 1 observations on the color of g poussins la riccia  there is in the first room of the national gallery a landscape attributed to gaspar poussin called sometimes aricia sometimes le or la riccia according to the fancy of catalogue printers whether it can be supposed to resemble the ancient aricia now la riccia close to albano i will not take upon me to determine seeing that most of the towns of these old masters are quite as like one place as another but at any rate it is a town on a hill wooded with twoandthirty bushes of very uniform size and possessing about the same number of leaves each these bushes are all painted in with one dull opaque brown becoming very slightly greenish towards the lights and discover in one place a bit of rock which of course would in nature have been cool and gray beside the lustrous hues of foliage and which therefore being moreover completely in shade is consistently and scientifically painted of a very clear pretty and positive brickred the only thing like color in the picture the foreground is a piece of road which in order to make allowance for its greater nearness for its being completely in light and it may be presumed for the quantity of vegetation usually present on carriageroads is given in a very cool green gray and the truth of the picture is completed by a number of dots in the sky on the right with a stalk to them of a sober and similar brown   § 2 as compared with the actual scene  not long ago i was slowly descending this very bit of carriageroad the first turn after you leave albano not a little impeded by the worthy successors of the ancient prototypes of veiento19 it had been wild weather when i left rome and all across the campagna the clouds were sweeping in sulphurous blue with a clap of thunder or two and breaking gleams of sun along the claudian aqueduct lighting up the infinity of its arches like the bridge of chaos but as i climbed the long slope of the alban mount the storm swept finally to the north and the noble outline of the domes of albano and graceful darkness of its ilex grove rose against pure streaks of alternate blue and amber the upper sky gradually flushing through the last fragments of raincloud in deep palpitating azure half ether and half dew the noonday sun came slanting down the rocky slopes of la riccia and its masses of entangled and tall foliage whose autumnal tints were mixed with the wet verdure of a thousand evergreens were penetrated with it as with rain i cannot call it color it was conflagration purple and crimson and scarlet like the curtains of gods tabernacle the rejoicing trees sank into the valley in showers of light every separate leaf quivering with buoyant and burning life each as it turned to reflect or to transmit the sunbeam first a torch and then an emerald far up into the recesses of the valley the green vistas arched like the hollows of mighty waves of some crystalline sea with the arbutus flowers dashed along their flanks for foam and silver flakes of orange spray tossed into the air around them breaking over the gray walls of rock into a thousand separate stars fading and kindling alternately as the weak wind lifted and let them fall every glade of grass burned like the golden floor of heaven opening in sudden gleams as the foliage broke and closed above it as sheetlightning opens in a cloud at sunset the motionless masses of dark rockdark though flushed with scarlet lichencasting their quiet shadows across its restless radiance the fountain underneath them filling its marble hollow with blue mist and fitful sound and over allthe multitudinous bars of amber and rose the sacred clouds that have no darkness and only exist to illumine were seen in fathomless intervals between the solemn and orbed repose of the stone pines passing to lose themselves in the last white blinding lustre of the measureless line where the campagna melted into the blaze of the sea   § 3 turner himself is inferior in brilliancy to nature  tell me who is likest this poussin or turner not in his most daring and dazzling efforts could turner himself come near it but you could not at the time have thought or remembered the work of any other man as having the remotest hue or resemblance of what you saw nor am i speaking of what is uncommon or unnatural there is no climate no place and scarcely an hour in which nature does not exhibit color which no mortal effort can imitate or approach for all our artificial pigments are even when seen under the same circumstances dead and lightless beside her living color the green of a growing leaf the scarlet of a fresh flower no art nor expedient can reach but in addition to this nature exhibits her hues under an intensity of sunlight which trebles their brilliancy while the painter deprived of this splendid aid works still with what is actually a gray shadow compared to the force of natures color take a blade of grass and a scarlet flower and place them so as to receive sunlight beside the brightest canvas that ever left turners easel and the picture will be extinguished so far from outfacing nature he does not as far as mere vividness of color goes onehalf reach herbut does he use this brilliancy of color on objects to which it does not properly belong let us compare his works in this respect with a few instances from the old masters   § 4 impossible colors of salvator titian  there is on the left hand side of salvators mercury and the woodman in our national gallery something without doubt intended for a rocky mountain in the middle distance near enough for all its fissures and crags to be distinctly visible or rather for a great many awkward scratches of the brush over it to be visible which though not particularly representative either of one thing or another are without doubt intended to be symbolical of rocks now no mountain in full light and near enough for its details of crag to be seen is without great variety of delicate color salvator has painted it throughout without one instant of variation but this i suppose is simplicity and generalizationlet it pass but what is the color pure sky blue without one grain of gray or any modifying hue whatsoeverthe same brush which had just given the bluest parts of the sky has been more loaded at the same part of the pallet and the whole mountain thrown in with unmitigated ultramarine now mountains only can become pure blue when there is so much air between us and them that they become mere flat dark shades every detail being totally lost they become blue when they become air and not till then consequently this part of salvators painting being of hills perfectly clear and near with all their details visible is as far as color is concerned broad bold falsehoodthe direct assertion of direct impossibility  in the whole range of turners works recent or of old date you will not find an instance of anything near enough to have details visible painted in sky blue wherever turner gives blue there he gives atmosphere it is air not object blue he gives to his sea so does natureblue he gives sapphiredeep to his extreme distance so does natureblue he gives to the misty shadows and hollows of his hills so does nature but blue he gives not where detail and illumined surface are visible as he comes into light and character so he breaks into warmth and varied hue nor is there in one of his works and i speak of the academy pictures especially one touch of cold color which is not to be accounted for and proved right and full of meaning  i do not say that salvators distance is not artistlike both in that and in the yet more glaringly false distances of titian above alluded to and in hundreds of others of equal boldness of exaggeration i can take delight and perhaps should be sorry to see them other than they are but it is somewhat singular to hear people talking of turners exquisite care and watchfulness in color as false while they receive such cases of preposterous and audacious fiction with the most generous and simple credulity   § 5 poussin and claude  again in the upper sky of the picture of nicolas poussin before noticed the clouds are of a very fine clear olivegreen about the same tint as the brightest parts of the trees beneath them they cannot have altered or else the trees must have been painted in gray for the hue is harmonious and well united with the rest of the picture and the blue and white in the centre of the sky are still fresh and pure now a green sky in open and illumined distance is very frequent and very beautiful but rich olivegreen clouds as far as i am acquainted with nature are a piece of color in which she is not apt to indulge you will be puzzled to show me such a thing in the recent works of turner20 again take any important group of trees i do not care whoseclaudes salvators or poussinswith lateral light that in the marriage of isaac and rebecca or gaspars sacrifice of isaac for instance can it be seriously supposed that those murky browns and melancholy greens are representative of the tints of leaves under full noonday sun i know that you cannot help looking upon all these pictures as pieces of dark relief against a light wholly proceeding from the distances but they are nothing of the kindthey are noon and morning effects with full lateral light be so kind as to match the color of a leaf in the sun the darkest you like as nearly as you can and bring your matched color and set it beside one of these groups of trees and take a blade of common grass and set it beside any part of the fullest light of their foregrounds and then talk about the truth of color of the old masters  and let not arguments respecting the sublimity or fidelity of impression be brought forward here i have nothing whatever to do with this at present i am not talking about what is sublime but about what is true people attack turner on this groundthey never speak of beauty or sublimity with respect to him but of nature and truth and let them support their own favorite masters on the same grounds perhaps i may have the very deepest veneration for the feeling of the old masters but i must not let it influence me nowmy business is to match colors not to talk sentiment neither let it be said that i am going too much into details and that general truths may be obtained by local falsehood truth is only to be measured by close comparison of actual facts we may talk forever about it in generals and prove nothing we cannot tell what effect falsehood may produce on this or that person but we can very well tell what is false and what is not and if it produce on our senses the effect of truth that only demonstrates their imperfection and inaccuracy and need of cultivation turners color is glaring to one persons sensations and beautiful to anothers this proves nothing poussins color is right to one soot to another this proves nothing there is no means of arriving at any conclusion but close comparison of both with the known and demonstrable hues of nature and this comparison will invariably turn claude or poussin into blackness and even turner into gray  whatever depth of gloom may seem to invest the objects of a real landscape yet a window with that landscape seen through it will invariably appear a broad space of light as compared with the shade of the room walls and this single circumstance may prove to us both the intensity and the diffusion of daylight in open air and the necessity if a picture is to be truthful in effect of color that it should tell as a broad space of graduated illuminationnot as do those of the old masters as a patchwork of black shades their works are nature in mourning weedsgreek oud hen hêliô katharô tethrammenoi all hypo symmigei skia   § 6 turners translation of colors  it is true that there are here and there in the academy pictures passages in which turner has translated the unattainable intensity of one tone of color into the attainable pitch of a higher one the golden green for instance of intense sunshine on verdure into pure yellow because he knows it to be impossible with any mixture of blue whatsoever to give faithfully its relative intensity of light and turner always will have his light and shade right whatever it costs him in color but he does this in rare cases and even then over very small spaces and i should be obliged to his critics if they would go out to some warm mossy green bank in full summer sunshine and try to reach its tone and when they find as find they will indian yellow and chrome look dark beside it let them tell me candidly which is nearest truth the gold of turner or the mourning and murky olive browns and verdigris greens in which claude with the industry and intelligence of a sevres china painter drags the laborious bramble leaves over his childish foreground   § 7 notice of effects in which no brilliancy of art can even approach        that of reality  § 8 reasons for the usual incredulity of the observer with respect to        their representation  § 9 color of the napoleon  but it is singular enough that the chief attacks on turner for overcharged brilliancy are made not when there could by any possibility be any chance of his outstepping nature but when he has taken subjects which no colors of earth could ever vie with or reach such for instance as his sunsets among the high clouds when i come to speak of skies i shall point out what divisions proportioned to their elevation exist in the character of clouds it is the highest regionthat exclusively characterized by white filmy multitudinous and quiet clouds arranged in bars or streaks or flakes of which i speak at present a region which no landscape painters have ever made one effort to represent except rubens and turnerthe latter taking it for his most favorite and frequent study now we have been speaking hitherto of what is constant and necessary in nature of the ordinary effects of daylight on ordinary colors and we repeat again that no gorgeousness of the pallet can reach even these but it is a widely different thing when nature herself takes a coloring fit and does something extraordinary something really to exhibit her power she has a thousand ways and means of rising above herself but incomparably the noblest manifestations of her capability of color are in these sunsets among the high clouds i speak especially of the moment before the sun sinks when his light turns pure rosecolor and when this light falls upon a zenith covered with countless cloudforms of inconceivable delicacy threads and flakes of vapor which would in common daylight be pure snow white and which give therefore fair field to the tone of light there is then no limit to the multitude and no check to the intensity of the hues assumed the whole sky from the zenith to the horizon becomes one molten mantling sea of color and fire every black bar turns into massy gold every ripple and wave into unsullied shadowless crimson and purple and scarlet and colors for which there are no words in language and no ideas in the mindthings which can only be conceived while they are visiblethe intense hollow blue of the upper sky melting through it allshowing here deep and pure and lightless there modulated by the filmy formless body of the transparent vapor till it is lost imperceptibly in its crimson and gold now there is no connection no one link of association or resemblance between those skies and the work of any mortal hand but turners he alone has followed nature in these her highest efforts he follows her faithfully but far behind follows at such a distance below her intensity that the napoleon of last years exhibition and the temeraire of the year before would look colorless and cold if the eye came upon them after one of natures sunsets among the high clouds but there are a thousand reasons why this should not be believed the concurrence of circumstances necessary to produce the sunsets of which i speak does not take place above five or six times in the summer and then only for a space of from five to ten minutes just as the sun reaches the horizon considering how seldom people think of looking for sunset at all and how seldom if they do they are in a position from which it can be fully seen the chances that their attention should be awake and their position favorable during these few flying instants of the year is almost as nothing what can the citizen who can see only the red light on the canvas of the wagon at the end of the street and the crimson color of the bricks of his neighbors chimney know of the flood of fire which deluges the sky from the horizon to the zenith what can even the quiet inhabitant of the english lowlands whose scene for the manifestation of the fire of heaven is limited to the tops of hayricks and the rooks nests in the old elmtrees know of the mighty passages of splendor which are tossed from alp to alp over the azure of a thousand miles of champaign even granting the constant vigor of observation and supposing the possession of such impossible knowledge it needs but a moments reflection to prove how incapable the memory is of retaining for any time the distinct image of the sources even of its most vivid impressions what recollection have we of the sunsets which delighted us last year we may know that they were magnificent or glowing but no distinct image of color or form is retainednothing of whose degree for the great difficulty with the memory is to retain not facts but degrees of fact we could be so certain as to say of anything now presented to us that it is like it if we did say so we should be wrong for we may be quite certain that the energy of an impression fades from the memory and becomes more and more indistinct every day and thus we compare a faded and indistinct image with the decision and certainty of one present to the senses how constantly do we affirm that the thunderstorm of last week was the most terrible one we ever saw in our lives because we compare it not with the thunderstorm of last year but with the faded and feeble recollection of it and so when we enter an exhibition as we have no definite standard of truth before us our feelings are toned down and subdued to the quietness of color which is all that human power can ordinarily attain to and when we turn to a piece of higher and closer truth approaching the pitch of the color of nature but to which we are not guided as we should be in nature by corresponding gradations of light everywhere around us but which is isolated and cut off suddenly by a frame and a wall and surrounded by darkness and coldness what can we expect but that it should surprise and shock the feelings suppose where the napoleon hung in the academy last year there could have been left instead an opening in the wall and through that opening in the midst of the obscurity of the dim room and the smokeladen atmosphere there could suddenly have been poured the full glory of a tropical sunset reverberated from the sea how would you have shrunk blinded from its scarlet and intolerable lightnings what picture in the room would not have been blackness after it and why then do you blame turner because he dazzles you does not the falsehood rest with those who do not there was not one hue in this whole picture which was not far below what nature would have used in the same circumstances nor was there one inharmonious or at variance with the restthe stormy bloodred of the horizon the scarlet of the breaking sunlight the rich crimson browns of the wet and illumined seaweed the pure gold and purple of the upper sky and shed through it all the deep passage of solemn blue where the cold moonlight fell on one pensive spot of the limitless shoreall were given with harmony as perfect as their color was intense and if instead of passing as i doubt not you did in the hurry of your unreflecting prejudice you had paused but so much as one quarter of an hour before the picture you would have found the sense of air and space blended with every line and breathing in every cloud and every color instinct and radiant with visible glowing absorbing light   § 10 necessary discrepancy between the attainable brilliancy of color         and light  it is to be observed however in general that wherever in brilliant effects of this kind we approach to anything like a true statement of natures color there must yet be a distinct difference in the impression we convey because we cannot approach her light all such hues are usually given by her with an accompanying intensity of sunbeams which dazzles and overpowers the eye so that it cannot rest on the actual colors nor understand what they are and hence in art in rendering all effects of this kind there must be a want of the ideas of imitation which are the great source of enjoyment to the ordinary observer because we can only give one series of truths those of color and are unable to give the accompanying truths of light so that the more true we are in color the greater ordinarily will be the discrepancy felt between the intensity of hue and the feebleness of light but the painter who really loves nature will not on this account give you a faded and feeble image which indeed may appear to you to be right because your feelings can detect no discrepancy in its parts but which he knows to derive its apparent truth from a systematized falsehood no he will make you understand and feel that art cannot imitate naturethat where it appears to do so it must malign her and mock her he will give you or state to you such truths as are in his power completely and perfectly and those which he cannot give he will leave to your imagination if you are acquainted with nature you will know all he has given to be true and you will supply from your memory and from your heart that light which he cannot give if you are unacquainted with nature seek elsewhere for whatever may happen to satisfy your feelings but do not ask for the truth which you would not acknowledge and could not enjoy   § 11 this discrepancy less in turner than in other colorists  § 12 its great extent in a landscape attributed to rubens  nevertheless the aim and struggle of the artist must always be to do away with this discrepancy as far as the powers of art admit not by lowering his color but by increasing his light and it is indeed by this that the works of turner are peculiarly distinguished from those of all other colorists by the dazzling intensity namely of the light which he sheds through every hue and which far more than their brilliant color is the real source of their overpowering effect upon the eye an effect so reasonably made the subject of perpetual animadversion as if the sun which they represent were quite a quiet and subdued and gentle and manageable luminary and never dazzled anybody under any circumstances whatsoever i am fond of standing by a bright turner in the academy to listen to the unintentional compliments of the crowdwhat a glaring thing i declare i cant look at it dont it hurt your eyesexpressed as if they were in the constant habit of looking the sun full in the face with the most perfect comfort and entire facility of vision it is curious after hearing people malign some of turners noble passages of light to pass to some really ungrammatical and false picture of the old masters in which we have color given without light take for instance the landscape attributed to rubens no 175 in the dulwich gallery i never have spoken and i never will speak of rubens but with the most reverential feeling and whatever imperfections in his art may have resulted from his unfortunate want of seriousness and incapability of true passion his calibre of mind was originally such that i believe the world may see another titian and another raffaelle before it sees another rubens but i have before alluded to the violent license he occasionally assumes and there is an instance of it in this picture apposite to the immediate question the sudden streak and circle of yellow and crimson in the middle of the sky of that picture being the occurrence of a fragment of a sunset color in pure daylight and in perfect isolation while at the same time it is rather darker when translated into light and shade than brighter than the rest of the sky is a case of such bold absurdity come from whose pencil it may that if every error which turner has fallen into in the whole course of his life were concentrated into one that one would not equal it and as our connoisseurs gaze upon this with neverending approbation we must not be surprised that the accurate perceptions which thus take delight in pure fiction should consistently be disgusted by turners fidelity and truth   § 13 turner scarcely ever uses pure or vivid color  hitherto however we have been speaking of vividness of pure color and showing that it is used by turner only where nature uses it and in no less degree but we have hitherto therefore been speaking of a most limited and uncharacteristic portion of his works for turner like all great colorists is distinguished not more for his power of dazzling and overwhelming the eye with intensity of effect than for his power of doing so by the use of subdued and gentle means there is no man living more cautious and sparing in the use of pure color than turner to say that he never perpetrates anything like the blue excrescences of foreground or hills shot like a housekeepers best silk gown with blue and red which certain of our celebrated artists consider the essence of the sublime would be but a poor compliment i might as well praise the portraits of titian because they have not the grimace and paint of a clown in a pantomime but i do say and say with confidence that there is scarcely a landscape artist of the present day however sober and lightless their effects may look who does not employ more pure and raw color than turner and that the ordinary tinsel and trash or rather vicious and perilous stuff according to the power of the mind producing it with which the walls of our academy are half covered disgracing in weak hands or in more powerful degrading and corrupting our whole school of art is based on a system of color beside which turners is as vesta to cotyttothe chastity of fire to the foulness of earth every picture of this great colorist has in one or two parts of it keynotes of the whole points where the system of each individual color is concentrated by a single stroke as pure as it can come from the pallet but throughout the great space and extent of even the most brilliant of his works there will not be found a raw color that is to say there is no warmth which has not gray in it and no blue which has not warmth in it and the tints in which he most excels and distances all other men the most cherished and inimitable portions of his color are as with all perfect colorists they must be his grays  it is instructive in this respect to compare the sky of the mercury and argus with the various illustrations of the serenity space and sublimity naturally inherent in blue and pink of which every years exhibition brings forward enough and to spare in the mercury and argus the pale and vaporous blue of the heated sky is broken with gray and pearly white the gold color of the light warming it more or less as it approaches or retires from the sun but throughout there is not a grain of pure blue all is subdued and warmed at the same time by the mingling gray and gold up to the very zenith where breaking through the flaky mist the transparent and deep azure of the sky is expressed with a single crumbling touch the keynote of the whole is given and every part of it passes at once far into glowing and aerial space the reader can scarcely fail to remember at once sundry works in contradistinction to this with great names attached to them in which the sky is a sheer piece of plumbers and glaziers work and should be valued per yard with heavy extra charge for ultramarine   § 14 the basis of gray under all his vivid hues  throughout the works of turner the same truthful principle of delicate and subdued color is carried out with a care and labor of which it is difficult to form a conception he gives a dash of pure white for his highest light but all the other whites of his picture are pearled down with gray or gold he gives a fold of pure crimson to the drapery of his nearest figure but all his other crimsons will be deepened with black or warmed with yellow in one deep reflection of his distant sea we catch a trace of the purest blue but all the rest is palpitating with a varied and delicate gradation of harmonized tint which indeed looks vivid blue as a mass but is only so by opposition it is the most difficult the most rare thing to find in his works a definite space however small of unconnected color that is either of a blue which has nothing to connect it with the warmth or of a warm color which has nothing to connect it with the grays of the whole and the result is that there is a general system and undercurrent of gray pervading the whole of his color out of which his highest lights and those local touches of pure color which are as i said before the keynotes of the picture flash with the peculiar brilliancy and intensity in which he stands alone   § 15 the variety and fulness even of his most simple tones  § 16 following the infinite and unapproachable variety of nature  intimately associated with this toning down and connection of the colors actually used is his inimitable power of varying and blending them so as never to give a quarter of an inch of canvas without a change in it a melody as well as a harmony of one kind or another observe i am not at present speaking of this as artistical or desirable in itself not as a characteristic of the great colorist but as the aim of the simple follower of nature for it is strange to see how marvellously nature varies the most general and simple of her tones a mass of mountain seen against the light may at first appear all of one blue and so it is blue as a whole by comparison with other parts of the landscape but look how that blue is made up there are black shadows in it under the crags there are green shadows along the turf there are gray halflights upon the rocks there are faint touches of stealthy warmth and cautious light along their edges every bush every stone every tuft of moss has its voice in the matter and joins with individual character in the universal will who is there who can do this as turner will the old masters would have settled the matter at once with a transparent agreeable but monotonous gray many among the moderns would probably be equally monotonous with absurd and false colors turner only would give the uncertaintythe palpitating perpetual changethe subjection of all to a great influence without one part or portion being lost or merged in itthe unity of action with infinity of agent and i wish to insist on this the more particularly because it is one of the eternal principles of nature that she will not have one line nor color nor one portion nor atom of space without a change in it there is not one of her shadows tints or lines that is not in a state of perpetual variation i do not mean in time but in space there is not a leaf in the world which has the same color visible over its whole surface it has a white high light somewhere and in proportion as it curves to or from that focus the color is brighter or grayer pick up a common flint from the roadside and count if you can its changes and hues of color every bit of bare ground under your feet has in it a thousand suchthe gray pebbles the warm ochre the green of incipient vegetation the grays and blacks of its reflexes and shadows might keep a painter at work for a month if he were obliged to follow them touch for touch how much more when the same infinity of change is carried out with vastness of object and space the extreme of distance may appear at first monotonous but the least examination will show it to be full of every kind of changethat its outlines are perpetually melting and appearing againsharp here vague therenow lost altogether now just hinted and still confused among each otherand so forever in a state and necessity of change hence wherever in a painting we have unvaried color extended even over a small space there is falsehood nothing can be natural which is monotonous nothing true which only tells one story the brown foreground and rocks of claudes sinon before priam are as false as color can be first because there never was such a brown under sunlight for even the sand and cinders volcanic tufa about naples granting that he had studied from these ugliest of all formations are where they are fresh fractured golden and lustrous in full light compared to these ideals of crag and become like all other rocks quiet and gray when weathered and secondly because no rock that ever nature stained is without its countless breaking tints of varied vegetation and even stanfield master as he is of rock form is apt in the same way to give us here and there a little bit of mud instead of stone   § 17 his dislike of purple and fondness for the opposition of yellow and         black the principles of nature in this respect  what i am next about to say with respect to turners color i should wish to be received with caution as it admits of dispute i think that the first approach to viciousness of color in any master is commonly indicated chiefly by a prevalence of purple and an absence of yellow i think nature mixes yellow with almost every one of her hues never or very rarely using red without it but frequently using yellow with scarcely any red and i believe it will be in consequence found that her favorite opposition that which generally characterizes and gives tone to her color is yellow and black passing as it retires into white and blue it is beyond dispute that the great fundamental opposition of rubens is yellow and black and that on this concentrated in one part of the picture and modified in various grays throughout chiefly depend the tones of all his finest works and in titian though there is a far greater tendency to the purple than in rubens i believe no red is ever mixed with the pure blue or glazed over it which has not in it a modifying quantity of yellow at all events i am nearly certain that whatever rich and pure purples are introduced locally by the great colorists nothing is so destructive of all fine color as the slightest tendency to purple in general tone and i am equally certain that turner is distinguished from all the vicious colorists of the present day by the foundation of all his tones being black yellow and the intermediate grays while the tendency of our common glareseekers is invariably to pure cold impossible purples so fond indeed is turner of black and yellow that he has given us more than one composition both drawings and paintings based on these two colors alone of which the magnificent quilleboeuf which i consider one of the most perfect pieces of simple color existing is a most striking example and i think that where as in some of the late venices there has been something like a marked appearance of purple tones even though exquisitely corrected by vivid orange and warm green in the foreground the general color has not been so perfect or truthful my own feelings would always guide me rather to the warm grays of such pictures as the snow storm or the glowing scarlet and gold of the napoleon and slave ship but i do not insist at present on this part of the subject as being perhaps more proper for future examination when we are considering the ideal of color   § 18 his early works are false in color  the above remarks have been made entirely with reference to the recent academy pictures which have been chiefly attacked for their color i by no means intend them to apply to the early works of turner those which the enlightened newspaper critics are perpetually talking about as characteristic of a time when turner was really great he is and was really great from the time when he first could hold a brush but he never was so great as he is now the crossing the brook glorious as it is as a composition and perfect in all that is most desirable and most ennobling in art is scarcely to be looked upon as a piece of color it is an agreeable cool gray rendering of space and form but it is not color if it be regarded as such it is thoroughly false and vapid and very far inferior to the tones of the same kind given by claude the reddish brown in the foreground of the fall of carthage with all diffidence be it spoken is as far as my feelings are competent to judge crude sunless and in every way wrong and both this picture and the building of carthage though this latter is far the finer of the two are quite unworthy of turner as a colorist   § 19 his drawings invariably perfect  not so with the drawings these countless as they are from the earliest to the latest though presenting an unbroken chain of increasing difficulty overcome and truth illustrated are all according to their aim equally faultless as to color whatever we have hitherto said applies to them in its fullest extent though each being generally the realization of some effect actually seen and realized but once requires almost a separate essay as a class they are far quieter and chaster than the academy pictures and were they better known might enable our connoisseurs to form a somewhat more accurate judgment of the intense study of nature on which all turners color is based   § 20 the subjection of his system of color to that of chiaroscuro  one point only remains to be noted respecting his system of color generallyits entire subordination to light and shade a subordination which there is no need to prove here as every engraving from his worksand few are unengravedis sufficient demonstration of it i have before shown the inferiority and unimportance in nature of color as a truth compared with light and shade that inferiority is maintained and asserted by all really great works of color but most by turners as their color is most intense whatever brilliancy he may choose to assume is subjected to an inviolable law of chiaroscuro from which there is no appeal no richness nor depth of tint is considered of value enough to atone for the loss of one particle of arranged light no brilliancy of hue is permitted to interfere with the depth of a determined shadow and hence it is that while engravings from works far less splendid in color are often vapid and cold because the little color employed has not been rightly based on light and shade an engraving from turner is always beautiful and forcible in proportion as the color of the original has been intense and never in a single instance has failed to express the picture as a perfect composition21 powerful and captivating and faithful as his color is it is the least important of all his excellences because it is the least important feature of nature he paints in color but he thinks in light and shade and were it necessary rather than lose one line of his forms or one ray of his sunshine would i apprehend be content to paint in black and white to the end of his life it is by mistaking the shadow for the substance and aiming at the brilliancy and the fire without perceiving of what deepstudied shade and inimitable form it is at once the result and the illustration that the host of his imitators sink into deserved disgrace with him as with all the greatest painters and in turners more than all the hue is a beautiful auxiliary in working out the great impression to be conveyed but is not the source nor the essence of that impression it is little more than a visible melody given to raise and assist the mind in the reception of nobler ideasas sacred passages of sweet sound to prepare the feelings for the reading of the mysteries of god   footnotes    19             cæcus adulator                     dignus aricinos qui mendicaret ad axes                     blandaque devexæ iactaret basia rhedæ    20 there is perhaps nothing more characteristic of a great     colorist than his power of using greens in strange places without     their being felt as such or at least than a constant preference of     green gray to purple gray and this hue of poussins clouds would     have been perfectly agreeable and allowable had there been gold or     crimson enough in the rest of the picture to have thrown it into     gray it is only because the lower clouds are pure white and blue     and because the trees are of the same color as the clouds that the     cloud color becomes false there is a fine instance of a sky green     in itself but turned gray by the opposition of warm color in     turners devonport with the dockyards    21 this is saying too much for it not unfrequently happens that     the light and shade of the original is lost in the engraving the     effect of which is afterwards partially recovered with the aid of     the artist himself by introductions of new features sometimes     when a drawing depends chiefly on color the engraver gets     unavoidably embarrassed and must be assisted by some change or     exaggeration of the effect but the more frequent case is that the     engravers difficulties result merely from his inattention to or     wilful deviations from his original and that the artist is obliged     to assist him by such expedients as the error itself suggests      not unfrequently in reviewing a plate as very constantly in     reviewing a picture after some time has elapsed since its     completion even the painter is liable to make unnecessary or     hurtful changes in the plate of the old temeraire lately published     in findens gallery i do not know whether it was turner or the     engraver who broke up the water into sparkling ripple but it was a     grievous mistake and has destroyed the whole dignity and value of     the conception the flash of lightning in the winchelsea of the     england series does not exist in the original it is put in to     withdraw the attention of the spectator from the sky which the     engraver destroyed      there is an unfortunate persuasion among modern engravers that color     can be expressed by particular characters of line and in the     endeavor to distinguish by different lines different colors of     equal depth they frequently lose the whole system of light and     shade it will hardly be credited that the piece of foreground on     the left of turners modern italy represented in the artunion     engraving as nearly coal black is in the original of a pale warm     gray hardly darker than the sky all attempt to record color in     engraving is heraldry out of its place the engraver has no power     beyond that of expressing transparency or opacity by greater or less     openness of line for the same depth of tint is producible by lines     with very different intervals      texture of surface is only in a measure in the power of the steel     and ought not to be laboriously sought after natures surfaces are     distinguished more by form than texture a stone is often smoother     than a leaf but if texture is to be given let the engraver at     least be sure that he knows what the texture of the object actually     is and how to represent it the leaves in the foreground of the     engraved mercury and argus have all of them three or four black     lines across them what sort of leaf texture is supposed to be     represented by these the stones in the foreground of turners     llanthony received from the artist the powdery texture of sandstone     the engraver covered them with contorted lines and turned them into     old timber      a still more fatal cause of failure is the practice of making out or     finishing what the artist left incomplete in the england plate of     dudley there are two offensive blank windows in the large building     with the chimney on the left these are engravers improvements     in the original they are barely traceable their lines being     excessively faint and tremulous as with the movement of heated air     between them and the spectator their vulgarity is thus taken away     and the whole building left in one grand unbroken mass it is almost     impossible to break engravers of this unfortunate habit i have even     heard of their taking journeys of some distance in order to obtain     knowledge of the details which the artist intentionally omitted and     the evil will necessarily continue until they receive something like     legitimate artistical education in one or two instances however     especially in small plates they have shown great feeling the     plates of miller especially those of the turner illustrations to     scott are in most instances perfect and beautiful interpretations     of the originals so those of goodall in rogerss works and     cousenss in the rivers of france those of the yorkshire series are     also very valuable though singularly inferior to the drawings but     none even of these men appear capable of producing a large plate     they have no knowledge of the means of rendering their lines vital     or valuable crosshatching stands for everything and inexcusably     for though we cannot expect every engraver to etch like rembrandt or     albert durer or every woodcutter to draw like titian at least     something of the system and power of the grand works of those men     might be preserved and some mind and meaning stolen into the     reticulation of the restless modern lines                                      chapter iii                            of truth of chiaroscuro   § 1 we are not at present to examine particular effects of light  it is not my intention to enter in the present portion of the work upon any examination of turners particular effects of light we must know something about what is beautiful before we speak of these  at present i wish only to insist upon two great principles of chiaroscuro which are observed throughout the works of the great modern master and set at defiance by the ancientsgreat general laws which may or may not be sources of beauty but whose observance is indisputably necessary to truth  go out some bright sunny day in winter and look for a tree with a broad trunk having rather delicate boughs hanging down on the sunny side near the trunk stand four or five yards from it with your back to the sun you will find that the boughs between you and the trunk of the tree are very indistinct that you confound them in places with the trunk itself and cannot possibly trace one of them from its insertion to its extremity but the shadows which they cast upon the trunk you will find clear dark and distinct perfectly traceable through their whole course except when they are interrupted by the crossing boughs and if you retire backwards you will come to a point where you cannot see the intervening boughs at all or only a fragment of them here and there but can still see their shadows perfectly plain now this may serve to show you the immense prominence and importance of shadows where there is anything like bright light they are in fact commonly far more conspicuous than the thing which casts them for being as large as the casting object and altogether made up of a blackness deeper than the darkest part of the casting object while that object is also broken up with positive and reflected lights their large broad unbroken spaces tell strongly on the eye especially as all form is rendered partially often totally invisible within them and as they are suddenly terminated by the sharpest lines which nature ever shows for no outline of objects whatsoever is so sharp as the edge of a close shadow put your finger over a piece of white paper in the sun and observe the difference between the softness of the outline of the finger itself and the decision of the edge of the shadow and note also the excessive gloom of the latter a piece of black cloth laid in the light will not attain onefourth of the blackness of the paper under the shadow   § 2 and therefore the distinctness of shadows is the chief means of        expressing vividness of light  § 3 total absence of such distinctness in the works of the italian        school  § 4 and partial absence in the dutch  hence shadows are in reality when the sun is shining the most conspicuous thing in a landscape next to the highest lights all forms are understood and explained chiefly by their agency the roughness of the bark of a tree for instance is not seen in the light nor in the shade it is only seen between the two where the shadows of the ridges explain it and hence if we have to express vivid light our very first aim must be to get the shadows sharp and visible and this is not to be done by blackness though indeed chalk on white paper is the only thing which comes up to the intensity of real shadows but by keeping them perfectly flat keen and even a very pale shadow if it be quite flatif it conceal the details of the objects it crossesif it be gray and cold compared to their color and very sharp edged will be far more conspicuous and make everything out of it look a great deal more like sunlight than a shadow ten times its depth shaded off at the edge and confounded with the color of the objects on which it falls now the old masters of the italian school in almost all of their works directly reverse this principle they blacken their shadows till the picture becomes quite appalling and everything in it invisible but they make a point of losing their edges and carrying them off by gradation in consequence utterly destroying every appearance of sunlight all their shadows are the faint secondary darknesses of mere daylight the sun has nothing whatever to do with them the shadow between the pages of the book which you hold in your hand is distinct and visible enough though you are i suppose reading it by the ordinary daylight of your room out of the sun and this weak and secondary shadow is all that we ever find in the italian masters as indicative of sunshine even cuyp and berghem though they know thoroughly well what they are about in their foregrounds forget the principle in their distances and though in claudes seaports where he has plain architecture to deal with he gives us something like real shadows along the stones the moment we come to ground and foliage with lateral light away go the shadows and the sun together in the marriage of isaac and rebecca in our own gallery the trunks of the trees between the waterwheel and the white figure in the middle distance are dark and visible but their shadows are scarcely discernible on the ground and are quite vague and lost in the building in nature every bit of the shadow would have been darker than the darkest part of the trunks and both on the ground and building would have been defined and conspicuous while the trunks themselves would have been faint confused and indistinguishable in their illumined parts from the grass or distance so in poussins phocion the shadow of the stick on the stone in the righthand corner is shaded off and lost while you see the stick plain all the way in natures sunlight it would have been the direct reverseyou would have seen the shadow black and sharp all the way down but you would have had to look for the stick which in all probability would in several places have been confused with the stone behind it  and so throughout the works of claude poussin and salvator we shall find especially in their conventional foliage and unarticulated barbarisms of rock that their whole sum and substance of chiaroscuro is merely the gradation and variation which nature gives in the body of her shadows and that all which they do to express sunshine she does to vary shade they take only one step while she always takes two marking in the first place with violent decision the great transition from sun to shade and then varying the shade itself with a thousand gentle gradations and double shadows in themselves equivalent and more than equivalent to all that the old masters did for their entire chiaroscuro   § 5 the perfection of turners works in this respect  now if there be one principle or secret more than another on which turner depends for attaining brilliancy of light it is his clear and exquisite drawing of the shadows whatever is obscure misty or undefined in his objects or his atmosphere he takes care that the shadows be sharp and clearand then he knows that the light will take care of itself and he makes them clear not by blackness but by excessive evenness unity and sharpness of edge he will keep them clear and distinct and make them felt as shadows though they are so faint that but for their decisive forms we should not have observed them for darkness at all he will throw them one after another like transparent veils along the earth and upon the air till the whole picture palpitates with them and yet the darkest of them will be a faint gray imbued and penetrated with light the pavement on the left of the hero and leander is about the most thorough piece of this kind of sorcery that i remember in art but of the general principle not one of his works is without constant evidence take the vignette of the garden opposite the titlepage of rogerss poems and note the drawing of the nearest balustrade on the right the balusters themselves are faint and misty and the light through them feeble but the shadows of them are sharp and dark and the intervening light as intense as it can be left and see how much more distinct the shadow of the running figure is on the pavement than the checkers of the pavement itself observe the shadows on the trunk of the tree at page 91 how they conquer all the details of the trunk itself and become darker and more conspicuous than any part of the boughs or limbs and so in the vignette to campbells beechtrees petition take the beautiful concentration of all that is most characteristic of italy as she is at page 168 of rogerss italy where we have the long shadows of the trunks made by far the most conspicuous thing in the whole foreground and hear how wordsworth the keenesteyed of all modern poets for what is deep and essential in nature illustrates turner here as we shall find him doing in all other points                                            at the root            of that tall pine the shadow of whose bare            and slender stem while here i sit at eve            oft stretches towrds me like a long straight path            traced faintly in the greensward                                                excursion book vi   § 6 the effect of his shadows upon the light  so again in the rhymers glen illustrations to scott note the intertwining of the shadows across the path and the checkering of the trunks by them and again on the bridge in the armstrongs tower and yet more in the long avenue of brienne where we have a length of two or three miles expressed by the playing shadows alone and the whole picture filled with sunshine by the long lines of darkness cast by the figures on the snow the hampton court in the england series is another very striking instance in fact the general system of execution observable in all turners drawings is to work his grounds richly and fully sometimes stippling and giving infinity of delicate mysterious and ceaseless detail and on the ground so prepared to cast his shadows with one dash of the brush leaving an excessively sharp edge of watery color such at least is commonly the case in such coarse and broad instances as those i have above given words are not accurate enough nor delicate enough to express or trace the constant allpervading influence of the finer and vaguer shadows throughout his works that thrilling influence which gives to the light they leave its passion and its power there is not a stone not a leaf not a cloud over which light is not felt to be actually passing and palpitating before our eyes there is the motion the actual wave and radiation of the darted beamnot the dull universal daylight which falls on the landscape without life or direction or speculation equal on all things and dead on all things but the breathing animated exulting light which feels and receives and rejoices and actswhich chooses one thing and rejects anotherwhich seeks and finds and loses againleaping from rock to rock from leaf to leaf from wave to waveglowing or flashing or scintillating according to what it strikes or in its holier moods absorbing and enfolding all things in the deep fulness of its repose and then again losing itself in bewilderment and doubt and dimness or perishing and passing away entangled in drifting mist or melted into melancholy air but stillkindling or declining sparkling or still it is the living light which breathes in its deepest most entranced rest which sleeps but never dies   § 7 the distinction holds good between almost all the works of the        ancient and modern schools  i need scarcely insist farther on the marked distinction between the works of the old masters and those of the great modern landscapepainters in this respect it is one which the reader can perfectly well work out for himself by the slightest systematic attentionone which he will find existing not merely between this work and that but throughout the whole body of their productions and down to every leaf and line and a little careful watching of nature especially in her foliage and foregrounds and comparison of her with claude gaspar poussin and salvator will soon show him that those artists worked entirely on conventional principles not representing what they saw but what they thought would make a handsome picture and even when they went to nature which i believe to have been a very much rarer practice with them than their biographers would have us suppose they copied her like children drawing what they knew to be there but not what they saw there22 i believe you may search the foregrounds of claude from one end of europe to another and you will not find the shadow of one leaf cast upon another you will find leaf after leaf painted more or less boldly or brightly out of the black ground and you will find dark leaves defined in perfect form upon the light but you will not find the form of a single leaf disguised or interrupted by the shadow of another and poussin and salvator are still farther from anything like genuine truth there is nothing in their pictures which might not be manufactured in their paintingroom with a branch or two of brambles and a bunch or two of weeds before them to give them the form of the leaves and it is refreshing to turn from their ignorant and impotent repetitions of childish conception to the clear close genuine studies of modern artists for it is not turner only though here as in all other points the first who is remarkable for fine and expressive decision of chiaroscuro some passages by j d harding are thoroughly admirable in this respect though this master is getting a little too much into a habit of general keen execution which prevents the parts which ought to be especially decisive from being felt as such and which makes his pictures especially the large ones look a little thin but some of his later passages of rock foreground have taken in the abstract been beyond all praise owing to the exquisite forms and firm expressiveness of their shadows and the chiaroscuro of stanfield is equally deserving of the most attentive study   § 8 second great principle of chiaroscuro both high light and deep        shadow are used in equal quantity and only in points  the second point to which i wish at present to direct attention has reference to the arrangement of light and shade it is the constant habit of nature to use both her highest lights and deepest shadows in exceedingly small quantity always in points never in masses she will give a large mass of tender light in sky or water impressive by its quantity and a large mass of tender shadow relieved against it in foliage or hill or building but the light is always subdued if it be extensivethe shadow always feeble if it be broad she will then fill up all the rest of her picture with middle tints and pale grays of some sort or another and on this quiet and harmonious whole she will touch her high lights in spotsthe foam of an isolated wavethe sail of a solitary vesselthe flash of the sun from a wet roofthe gleam of a single whitewashed cottageor some such sources of local brilliancy she will use so vividly and delicately as to throw everything else into definite shade by comparison and then taking up the gloom she will use the black hollows of some overhanging bank or the black dress of some shaded figure or the depth of some sunless chink of wall or window so sharply as to throw everything else into definite light by comparison thus reducing the whole mass of her picture to a delicate middle tint approaching of course here to light and there to gloom but yet sharply separated from the utmost degrees either of the one or the other   § 9 neglect or contradiction of this principle by writers on art  § 10 and consequent misguiding of the student  now it is a curious thing that none of our writers on art seem to have noticed the great principle of nature in this respect they all talk of deep shadow as a thing that may be given in quantityone fourth of the picture or in certain effects much more barry for instance says that the practice of the great painters who best understood the effects of chiaroscuro was for the most part to make the mass of middle tint larger than the light and the mass of dark larger than the masses of light and middle tint together ie occupying more than onehalf of the picture now i do not know what we are to suppose is meant by understanding chiaroscuro if it means being able to manufacture agreeable patterns in the shape of pyramids and crosses and zigzags into which arms and legs are to be persuaded and passion and motion arranged for the promotion and encouragement of the cant of criticism such a principle may be productive of the most advantageous results but if it means being acquainted with the deep perpetual systematic unintrusive simplicity and unwearied variety of natures chiaroscuroif it means the perception that blackness and sublimity are not synonymous and that space and light may possibly be coadjutorsthen no man who ever advocated or dreamed of such a principle is anything more than a novice blunderer and trickster in chiaroscuro and my firm belief is that though color is inveighed against by all artists as the great circe of artthe great transformer of mind into sensualityno fondness for it no study of it is half so great a peril and stumblingblock to the young student as the admiration he hears bestowed on such artificial false and juggling chiaroscuro and the instruction he receives based on such principles as that given us by fuselithat mere natural light and shade however separately or individually true is not always legitimate chiaroscuro in art it may not always be agreeable to a sophisticated unfeeling and perverted mind but the student had better throw up his art at once than proceed on the conviction that any other can ever be legitimate i believe i shall be perfectly well able to prove in following parts of the work that mere natural light and shade is the only fit and faithful attendant of the highest art and that all tricksall visible intended arrangementall extended shadows and narrow lightseverything in fact in the least degree artificial or tending to make the mind dwell upon light and shade as such is an injury instead of an aid to conceptions of high ideal dignity i believe i shall be able also to show that nature manages her chiaroscuro a great deal more neatly and cleverly than people fancythat mere natural light and shade is a very much finer thing than most artists can put together and that none think they can improve upon it but those who never understood it   § 11 the great value of a simple chiaroscuro  but however this may be it is beyond dispute that every permission given to the student to amuse himself with painting one figure all black and the next all white and throwing them out with a background of nothingevery permission given to him to spoil his pocketbook with sixths of sunshine and sevenths of shade and other such fractional sublimities is so much more difficulty laid in the way of his ever becoming a master and that none are in the right road to real excellence but those who are struggling to render the simplicity purity and inexhaustible variety of natures own chiaroscuro in open cloudless daylight giving the expanse of harmonious lightthe speaking decisive shadowand the exquisite grace tenderness and grandeur of aerial opposition of local color and equally illuminated lines no chiaroscuro is so difficult as this and none so noble chaste or impressive on this part of the subject however i must not enlarge at present i wish now only to speak of those great principles of chiaroscuro which nature observes even when she is most working for effectwhen she is playing with thunderclouds and sunbeams and throwing one thing out and obscuring another with the most marked artistical feeling and intentioneven then she never forgets her great rule to give precisely the same quantity of deepest shade which she does of highest light and no more points of the one answering to points of the other and both vividly conspicuous and separated from all the rest of the landscape   § 12 the sharp separation of natures lights from her middle tint  and it is most singular that this separation which is the great source of brilliancy in nature should not only be unobserved but absolutely forbidden by our great writers on art who are always talking about connecting the light with the shade by imperceptible gradations now so surely as this is done all sunshine is lost for imperceptible gradation from light to dark is the characteristic of objects seen out of sunshine in what is in landscape shadow natures principle of getting light is the direct reverse she will cover her whole landscape with middle tint in which she will have as many gradations as you please and a great many more than you can paint but on this middle tint she touches her extreme lights and extreme darks isolated and sharp so that the eye goes to them directly and feels them to be keynotes of the whole composition and although the dark touches are less attractive than the light ones it is not because they are less distinct but because they exhibit nothing while the bright touches are in parts where everything is seen and where in consequence the eye goes to rest but yet the high lights do not exhibit anything in themselves they are too bright and dazzle the eye and having no shadows in them cannot exhibit form for form can only be seen by shadow of some kind or another hence the highest lights and deepest darks agree in this that nothing is seen in either of them that both are in exceedingly small quantity and both are marked and distinct from the middle tones of the landscapethe one by their brilliancy the other by their sharp edges even though many of the more energetic middle tints may approach their intensity very closely   § 13 the truth of turner  i need scarcely do more than tell you to glance at any one of the works of turner and you will perceive in a moment the exquisite observation of all these principles the sharpness decision conspicuousness and excessively small quantity both of extreme light and extreme shade all the mass of the picture being graduated and delicate middle tint take up the rivers of france for instance and turn over a few of the plates in succession    1 chateau gaillard vignetteblack figures and boats points of shade suntouches on castle and wake of boat of light see how the eye rests on both and observe how sharp and separate all the lights are falling in spots edged by shadow but not melting off into it    2 orleansthe crowded figures supply both points of shade and light observe the delicate middle tint of both in the whole mass of buildings and compare this with the blackness of canalettos shadows against which neither figures nor anything else can ever tell as points of shade    3 bloiswhite figures in boats buttresses of bridge dome of church on

cypresses under castle    7 chateau of amboisethe boat in the centre with its reflections needs no comment note the glancing lights under the bridge this is a very glorious and perfect instance    8 st julien toursespecially remarkable for its preservation of deep points of gloom because the whole picture is one of extended shade  i need scarcely go on the above instances are taken as they happen to come without selection the reader can proceed for himself i may however name a few cases of chiaroscuro more especially deserving of his study scene between quilleboeuf and villequierhonfleurlight towers of the héveon the seine between mantes and vernonthe lantern at st cloudconfluence of seine and marnetroyesthe first and last vignette and those at pages 36 63 95 184 192 203 of rogerss poems the first and second in campbell st maurice in the italy where note the black stork brienne skiddaw mayburgh melrose jedburgh in the illustrations to scott and the vignettes to milton not because these are one whit superior to others of his works but because the laws of which we have been speaking are more strikingly developed in them and because they have been well engraved it is impossible to reason from the larger plates in which half the chiaroscuro is totally destroyed by the haggling blackening and making out of the engravers   footnotes    22 compare sect ii chap ii § 6                                      chapter iv     of truth of spacefirst as dependent on the focus of the eye23   § 1 space is more clearly indicated by the drawing of objects than by        their hue  in the first chapter of this section i noticed the distinction between real aerial perspective and that overcharged contrast of light and shade by which the old masters obtained their deceptive effect and i showed that though inferior to them in the precise quality or tone of aerial color our great modern master is altogether more truthful in the expression of the proportionate relation of all his distances to one another i am now about to examine those modes of expressing space both in nature and art by far the most important which are dependent not on the relative hues of objects but on the drawing of them by far the most important i say because the most constant and certain for nature herself is not always aerial local effects are frequent which interrupt and violate the laws of aerial tone and induce strange deception in our ideas of distance i have often seen the summit of a snowy mountain look nearer than its base owing to the perfect clearness of the upper air but the drawing of objects that is to say the degree in which their details and parts are distinct or confused is an unfailing and certain criterion of their distance and if this be rightly rendered in a painting we shall have genuine truth of space in spite of many errors in aerial tone while if this be neglected all space will be destroyed whatever dexterity of tint may be employed to conceal the defective drawing   § 2 it is impossible to see objects at unequal distances distinctly at        one moment  first then it is to be noticed that the eye like any other lens must have its focus altered in order to convey a distinct image of objects at different distances so that it is totally impossible to see distinctly at the same moment two objects one of which is much farther off than another of this any one may convince himself in an instant look at the bars of your windowframe so as to get a clear image of their lines and form and you cannot while your eye is fixed on them perceive anything but the most indistinct and shadowy images of whatever objects may be visible beyond but fix your eyes on those objects so as to see them clearly and though they are just beyond and apparently beside the windowframe that frame will only be felt or seen as a vague flitting obscure interruption to whatever is perceived beyond it a little attention directed to this fact will convince every one of its universality and prove beyond dispute that objects at unequal distances cannot be seen together not from the intervention of air or mist but from the impossibility of the rays proceeding from both converging to the same focus so that the whole impression either of one or the other must necessarily be confused indistinct and inadequate   § 3 especially such as are both comparatively near  but be it observed and i have only to request that whatever i say may be tested by immediate experiment the difference of focus necessary is greatest within the first five hundred yards and therefore though it is totally impossible to see an object ten yards from the eye and one a quarter of a mile beyond it at the same moment it is perfectly possible to see one a quarter of a mile off and one five miles beyond it at the same moment the consequence of this is practically that in a real landscape we can see the whole of what would be called the middle distance and distance together with facility and clearness but while we do so we can see nothing in the foreground beyond a vague and indistinct arrangement of lines and colors and that if on the contrary we look at any foreground object so as to receive a distinct impression of it the distance and middle distance become all disorder and mystery   § 4 in painting therefore either the foreground or distance must be        partially sacrificed  and therefore if in a painting our foreground is anything our distance must be nothing and vice versa for if we represent our near and distant objects as giving both at once that distinct image to the eye which we receive in nature from each when we look at them separately24 and if we distinguish them from each other only by the airtone and indistinctness dependent on positive distance we violate one of the most essential principles of nature we represent that as seen at once which can only be seen by two separate acts of seeing and tell a falsehood as gross as if we had represented four sides of a cubic object visible together   § 5 which not being done by the old masters they could not express        space  § 6 but modern artists have succeeded in fully carrying out this        principle  § 7 especially of turner  now to this fact and principle no landscape painter of the old school as far as i remember ever paid the slightest attention finishing their foregrounds clearly and sharply and with vigorous impression on the eye giving even the leaves of their bushes and grass with perfect edge and shape they proceeded into the distance with equal attention to what they could see of its detailsthey gave all that the eye can perceive in a distance when it is fully and entirely devoted to it and therefore though masters of aerial tone though employing every expedient that art could supply to conceal the intersection of lines though caricaturing the force and shadow of near objects to throw them close upon the eye they never succeeded in truly representing space turner introduced a new era in landscape art by showing that the foreground might be sunk for the distance and that it was possible to express immediate proximity to the spectator without giving anything like completeness to the forms of the near objects this is not done by slurred or soft lines observe always the sign of vice in art but by a decisive imperfection a firm but partial assertion of form which the eye feels indeed to be close home to it and yet cannot rest upon or cling to nor entirely understand and from which it is driven away of necessity to those parts of distance on which it is intended to repose and this principle originated by turner though fully carried out by him only has yet been acted on with judgment and success by several less powerful artists of the english school some six years ago the brown moorland foregrounds of copley fielding were very instructive in this respect not a line in them was made out not a single object clearly distinguishable wet broad sweeps of the brush sparkling careless and accidental as nature herself always truthful as far as they went implying knowledge though not expressing it suggested everything while they represented nothing but far off into the mountain distance came the sharp edge and the delicate form the whole intention and execution of the picture being guided and exerted where the great impression of space and size was to be given the spectator was compelled to go forward into the waste of hillsthere where the sun broke wide upon the moor he must walk and wanderhe could not stumble and hesitate over the near rocks nor stop to botanize on the first inches of his path25 and the impression of these pictures was always great and enduring as it was simple and truthful i do not know anything in art which has expressed more completely the force and feeling of nature in these particular scenes and it is a farther illustration26 of the principle we are insisting upon that where as in some of his later works he has bestowed more labor on the foreground the picture has lost both in space and sublimity and among artists in general who are either not aware of the principle or fear to act upon it for it requires no small courage as well as skill to treat a foreground with that indistinctness and mystery which they have been accustomed to consider as characteristic of distance the foreground is not only felt as every landscape painter will confess to be the most embarrassing and unmanageable part of the picture but in ninetynine cases out of a hundred will go near to destroy the effect of the rest of the composition thus callcotts trent is severely injured by the harsh group of foreground figures and stanfield very rarely gets through an academy picture without destroying much of its space by too much determination of near form while harding constantly sacrifices his distance and compels the spectator to dwell on the foreground altogether though indeed with such foregrounds as he gives us we are most happy so to do but it is in turner only that we see a bold and decisive choice of the distance and middle distance as his great object of attention and by him only that the foreground is united and adapted to it not by any want of drawing or coarseness or carelessness of execution but by the most precise and beautiful indication or suggestion of just so much of even the minutest forms as the eye can see when its focus is not adapted to them and herein is another reason for the vigor and wholeness of the effect of turners works at any distance while those of almost all other artists are sure to lose space as soon as we lose sight of the details   § 8 justification of the want of drawing in turners figures  and now we see the reason for the singular and to the ignorant in art the offensive execution of turners figures i do not mean to assert that there is any reason whatsoever for bad drawing though in landscape it matters exceedingly little but that there is both reason and necessity for that want of drawing which gives even the nearest figures round balls with four pink spots in them instead of faces and four dashes of the brush instead of hands and feet for it is totally impossible that if the eye be adapted to receive the rays proceeding from the utmost distance and some partial impression from all the distances it should be capable of perceiving more of the forms and features of near figures than turner gives and how absolutely necessary to the faithful representation of space this indecision really is might be proved with the utmost ease by any one who had veneration enough for the artist to sacrifice one of his pictures to his fame who would take some one of his works in which the figures were most incomplete and have them painted in by any of our delicate and firstrate figurepainters absolutely preserving every color and shade of turners group so as not to lose one atom of the composition but giving eyes for the pink spots and feet for the white ones let the picture be so exhibited in the academy and even novices in art would feel at a glance that its truth of space was gone that every one of its beauties and harmonies had undergone decomposition that it was now a grammatical solecism a painting of impossibilities a thing to torture the eye and offend the mind   footnotes    23 i have left this chapter in its original place because i am     more than ever convinced of the truth of the position advanced in     the 8th paragraph nor can i at present assign any other cause than     that here given for what is there asserted and yet i cannot but     think that i have allowed far too much influence to a change so     slight as that which we insensibly make in the focus of the eye and     that the real justification of turners practice with respect to     some of his foregrounds is to be elsewhere sought i leave the     subject therefore to the readers consideration    24 this incapacity of the eye must not be confounded with its     incapability to comprehend a large portion of lateral space at     once we indeed can see at any one moment little more than one     point the objects beside it being confused and indistinct but we     need pay no attention to this in art because we can see just as     little of the picture as we can of the landscape without turning the     eye and hence any slurring or confusing of one part of it     laterally more than another is not founded on any truth of nature     but is an expedient of the artistand often an excellent and     desirable oneto make the eye rest where he wishes it but as the     touch expressive of a distant object is as near upon the canvas as     that expressive of a near one both are seen distinctly and with the     same focus of the eye and hence an immediate contradiction of     nature results unless one or other be given with an artificial and     increased indistinctness expressive of the appearance peculiar to     the unadapted focus on the other hand it must be noted that the     greater part of the effect above described is consequent not on     variation of focus but on the different angle at which near objects     are seen by each of the two eyes when both are directed towards the     distance    25 there is no inconsistency observe between this passage and     what was before asserted respecting the necessity of botanical     fidelitywhere the foreground is the object of attention compare     part ii sect i chap vii § 10to paint mist rightly space     rightly and light rightly it may be often necessary to paint     nothing else rightly    26 hardly it would have been so only had the recently finished     foregrounds been as accurate in detail as they are abundant they     are painful i believe not from their finish but their falseness                                      chapter v        of truth of spacesecondly as its appearance is dependent on                             the power of the eye   § 1 the peculiar indistinctness dependent on the retirement of objects        from the eye  in the last chapter we have seen how indistinctness of individual distances becomes necessary in order to express the adaptation of the eye to one or other of them we have now to examine that kind of indistinctness which is dependent on real retirement of the object even when the focus of the eye is fully concentrated upon it the first kind of indecision is that which belongs to all objects which the eye is not adapted to whether near or far off the second is that consequent upon the want of power in the eye to receive a clear image of objects at a great distance from it however attentively it may regard them  draw on a piece of white paper a square and a circle each about a twelfth or eighth of an inch in diameter and blacken them so that their forms may be very distinct place your paper against the wall at the end of the room and retire from it a greater or less distance according as you have drawn the figures larger or smaller you will come to a point where though you can see both the spots with perfect plainness you cannot tell which is the square and which the circle   § 2 causes confusion but not annihilation of details  now this takes place of course with every object in a landscape in proportion to its distance and size the definite forms of the leaves of a tree however sharply and separately they may appear to come against the sky are quite indistinguishable at fifty yards off and the form of everything becomes confused before we finally lose sight of it now if the character of an object say the front of a house be explained by a variety of forms in it as the shadows in the tops of the windows the lines of the architraves the seams of the masonry etc these lesser details as the object falls into distance become confused and undecided each of them losing their definite forms but all being perfectly visible as something a white or a dark spot or stroke not lost sight of observe but yet so seen that we cannot tell what they are as the distance increases the confusion becomes greater until at last the whole front of the house becomes merely a flat pale space in which however there is still observable a kind of richness and checkering caused by the details in it which though totally merged and lost in the mass have still an influence on the texture of that mass until at last the whole house itself becomes a mere light or dark spot which we can plainly see but cannot tell what it is nor distinguish it from a stone or any other object   § 3 instances in various objects  now what i particularly wish to insist upon is the state of vision in which all the details of an object are seen and yet seen in such confusion and disorder that we cannot in the least tell what they are or what they mean it is not mist between us and the object still less is it shade still less is it want of character it is a confusion a mystery an interfering of undecided lines with each other not a diminution of their number window and door architrave and frieze all are there it is no cold and vacant mass it is full and rich and abundant and yet you cannot see a single form so as to know what it is observe your friends face as he is coming up to you first it is nothing more than a white spot now it is a face but you cannot see the two eyes nor the mouth even as spots you see a confusion of lines a something which you know from experience to be indicative of a face and yet you cannot tell how it is so now he is nearer and you can see the spots for the eyes and mouth but they are not blank spots neither there is detail in them you cannot see the lips nor the teeth nor the brows and yet you see more than mere spots it is a mouth and an eye and there is light and sparkle and expression in them but nothing distinct now he is nearer still and you can see that he is like your friend but you cannot tell whether he is or not there is a vagueness and indecision of line still now you are sure but even yet there are a thousand things in his face which have their effect in inducing the recognition but which you cannot see so as to know what they are   § 4 two great resultant truths that nature is never distinct and        never vacant  changes like these and states of vision corresponding to them take place with each and all of the objects of nature and two great principles of truth are deducible from their observation first place an object as close to the eye as you like there is always something in it which you cannot see except in the hinted and mysterious manner above described you can see the texture of a piece of dress but you cannot see the individual threads which compose it though they are all felt and have each of them influence on the eye secondly place an object as far from the eye as you like and until it becomes itself a mere spot there is always something in it which you can see though only in the hinted manner above described its shadows and lines and local colors are not lost sight of as it retires they get mixed and indistinguishable but they are still there and there is a difference always perceivable between an object possessing such details and a flat or vacant space the grass blades of a meadow a mile off are so far discernible that there will be a marked difference between its appearance and that of a piece of wood painted green and thus nature is never distinct and never vacant she is always mysterious but always abundant you always see something but you never see all  and thus arise that exquisite finish and fulness which god has appointed to be the perpetual source of fresh pleasure to the cultivated and observant eyea finish which no distance can render invisible and no nearness comprehensible which in every stone every bough every cloud and every wave is multiplied around us forever presented and forever exhaustless and hence in art every space or touch in which we can see everything or in which we can see nothing is false nothing can be true which is either complete or vacant every touch is false which does not suggest more than it represents and every space is false which represents nothing   § 5 complete violation of both these principles by the old masters        they are either distinct or vacant  now i would not wish for any more illustrative or marked examples of the total contradiction of these two great principles than the landscape works of the old masters taken as a bodythe dutch masters furnishing the cases of seeing everything and the italians of seeing nothing the rule with both is indeed the same differently applied you shall see the bricks in the wall and be able to count them or you shall see nothing but a dead flat but the dutch give you the bricks and the italians the flat natures rule being the precise reverseyou shall never be able to count the bricks but you shall never see a dead space   § 6 instances from nicholas poussin  take for instance the street in the centre of the really great landscape of poussin great in feeling at least marked 260 in the dulwich gallery the houses are dead square masses with a light side and a dark side and black touches for windows there is no suggestion of anything in any of the spaces the light wall is dead gray the dark wall dead gray and the windows dead black how differently would nature have treated us she would have let us see the indian corn hanging on the walls and the image of the virgin at the angles and the sharp broken broad shadows of the tiled eaves and the deep ribbed tiles with the doves upon them and the carved roman capital built into the wall and the white and blue stripes of the mattresses stuffed out of the windows and the flapping corners of the mat blinds all would have been there not as such not like the corn nor blinds nor tiles not to be comprehended nor understood but a confusion of yellow and black spots and strokes carried far too fine for the eye to follow microscopic in its minuteness and filling every atom and part of space with mystery out of which would have arranged itself the general impression of truth and life   § 7 from claude  again take the distant city on the right bank of the river in claudes marriage of isaac and rebecca in the national gallery i have seen many cities in my life and drawn not a few and i have seen many fortifications fancy ones included which frequently supply us with very new ideas indeed especially in matters of proportion but i do not remember ever having met with either a city or a fortress entirely composed of round towers of various heights and sizes all facsimiles of each other and absolutely agreeing in the number of battlements i have indeed some faint recollection of having delineated such an one in the first page of a spellingbook when i was four years old but somehow or other the dignity and perfection of the ideal were not appreciated and the volume was not considered to be increased in value by the frontispiece without however venturing to doubt the entire sublimity of the same ideal as it occurs in claude let us consider how nature if she had been fortunate enough to originate so perfect a conception would have managed it in its details claude has permitted us to see every battlement and the first impulse we feel upon looking at the picture is to count how many there are nature would have given us a peculiar confused roughness of the upper lines a multitude of intersections and spots which we should have known from experience was indicative of battlements but which we might as well have thought of creating as of counting claude has given you the walls below in one dead void of uniform gray there is nothing to be seen nor felt nor guessed at in it it is gray paint or gray shade whichever you may choose to call it but it is nothing more nature would have let you see nay would have compelled you to see thousands of spots and lines not one to be absolutely understood or accounted for but yet all characteristic and different from each other breaking lights on shattered stones vague shadows from waving vegetation irregular stains of time and weather mouldering hollows sparkling casementsall would have been therenone indeed seen as such none comprehensible or like themselves but all visible little shadows and sparkles and scratches making that whole space of color a transparent palpitating various infinity   § 8 and g poussin  or take one of poussins extreme distances such as that in the sacrifice of isaac it is luminous retiring delicate and perfect in tone and is quite complete enough to deceive and delight the careless eye to which all distances are alike nay it is perfect and masterly and absolutely right if we consider it as a sketchas a first plan of a distance afterwards to be carried out in detail but we must remember that all these alternate spaces of gray and gold are not the landscape itself but the treatment of itnot its substance but its light and shade they are just what nature would cast over it and write upon it with every cloud but which she would cast in play and without carefulness as matters of the very smallest possible importance all her work and her attention would be given to bring out from underneath this and through this the forms and the material character which this can only be valuable to illustrate not to conceal every one of those broad spaces she would linger over in protracted delight teaching you fresh lessons in every hairsbreadth of it and pouring her fulness of invention into it until the mind lost itself in following hernow fringing the dark edge of the shadow with a tufted line of level forestnow losing it for an instant in a breath of mistthen breaking it with the white gleaming angle of a narrow brookthen dwelling upon it again in a gentle mounded melting undulation over the other side of which she would carry you down into a dusty space of soft crowded light with the hedges and the paths and the sprinkled cottages and scattered trees mixed up and mingled together in one beautiful delicate impenetrable mysterysparkling and melting and passing away into the sky without one line of distinctness or one instant of vacancy   § 9 the imperative necessity in landscape painting of fulness and        finish  now it is indeed impossible for the painter to follow all thishe cannot come up to the same degree and order of infinitybut he can give us a lesser kind of infinity he has not onethousandth part of the space to occupy which nature has but he can at least leave no part of that space vacant and unprofitable if nature carries out her minutiæ over miles he has no excuse for generalizing in inches and if he will only give us all he can if he will give us a fulness as complete and as mysterious as natures we will pardon him for its being the fulness of a cup instead of an ocean but we will not pardon him if because he has not the mile to occupy he will not occupy the inch and because he has fewer means at his command will leave half of those in his power unexerted still less will we pardon him for mistaking the sport of nature for her labor and for following her only in her hour of rest without observing how she has worked for it after spending centuries in raising the forest and guiding the river and modelling the mountain she exults over her work in buoyancy of spirit with playful sunbeam and flying cloud but the painter must go through the same labor or he must not have the same recreation let him chisel his rock faithfully and tuft his forest delicately and then we will allow him his freaks of light and shade and thank him for them but we will not be put off with the play before the lessonwith the adjunct instead of the essencewith the illustration instead of the fact   § 10 breadth is not vacancy  i am somewhat anticipating my subject here because i can scarcely help answering the objections which i know must arise in the minds of most readers especially of those who are partially artistical respecting generalization breadth effect etc it were to be wished that our writers on art would not dwell so frequently on the necessity of breadth without explaining what it means and that we had more constant reference made to the principle which i can only remember having seen once clearly explained and insisted onthat breadth is not vacancy generalization is unity not destruction of parts and composition is not annihilation but arrangement of materials the breadth which unites the truths of nature with her harmonies is meritorious and beautiful but the breadth which annihilates those truths by the million is not painting nature but painting over her and so the masses which result from right concords and relations of details are sublime and impressive but the masses which result from the eclipse of details are contemptible and painful27 and we shall show in following parts of the work that distances like those of poussin are mere meaningless tricks of clever execution which when once discovered the artist may repeat over and over again with mechanical contentment and perfect satisfaction both to himself and to his superficial admirers with no more exertion of intellect nor awakening of feeling than any tradesman has in multiplying some ornamental pattern of furniture be this as it may however for we cannot enter upon the discussion of the question here the falsity and imperfection of such distances admit of no dispute beautiful and ideal they may be true they are not and in the same way we might go through every part and portion of the works of the old masters showing throughout either that you have every leaf and blade of grass staring defiance to the mystery of nature or that you have dead spaces of absolute vacuity equally determined in their denial of her fulness and even if we ever find as here and there in their better pictures we do changeful passages of agreeable playing color or mellow and transparent modulations of mysterious atmosphere even here the touches though satisfactory to the eye are suggestive of nothingthey are characterlessthey have none of the peculiar expressiveness and meaning by which nature maintains the variety and interest even of what she most conceals she always tells a story however hintedly and vaguely each of her touches is different from all the others and we feel with every one that though we cannot tell what it is it cannot be anything while even the most dexterous distances of the old masters pretend to secrecy without having anything to conceal and are ambiguous not from the concentration of meaning but from the want of it   § 11 the fulness and mystery of turners distances  and now take up one of turners distances it matters not which or of what kinddrawing or painting small or great done thirty years ago or for last years academy as you like say that of the mercury and argus and look if every fact which i have just been pointing out in nature be not carried out in it abundant beyond the power of the eye to embrace or follow vast and various beyond the power of the mind to comprehend there is yet not one atom in its whole extent and mass which does not suggest more than it represents nor does it suggest vaguely but in such a manner as to prove that the conception of each individual inch of that distance is absolutely clear and complete in the masters mind a separate picture fully worked out but yet clearly and fully as the idea is formed just so much of it is given and no more as nature would have allowed us to feel or see just so much as would enable a spectator of experience and knowledge to understand almost every minute fragment of separate detail but appears to the unpractised and careless eye just what a distance of natures own would appear an unintelligible mass not one line out of the millions there is without meaning yet there is not one which is not affected and disguised by the dazzle and indecision of distance no form is made out and yet no form is unknown   § 12 farther illustrations in architectural drawing  perhaps the truth of this system of drawing is better to be understood by observing the distant character of rich architecture than of any other object go to the top of highgate hill on a clear summer morning at five oclock and look at westminster abbey you will receive an impression of a building enriched with multitudinous vertical lines try to distinguish one of those lines all the way down from the one next to it you cannot try to count them you cannot try to make out the beginning or end of any one of them you cannot look at it generally and it is all symmetry and arrangement look at in its parts and it is all inextricable confusion am not i at this moment describing a piece of turners drawing with the same words by which i describe nature and what would one of the old masters have done with such a building as this in his distance either he would only have given the shadows of the buttresses and the light and dark sides of the two towers and two dots for the windows or if more ignorant and more ambitious he had attempted to render some of the detail it would have been done by distinct lineswould have been broad caricature of the delicate building felt at once to be false ridiculous and offensive his most successful effort would only have given us through his carefully toned atmosphere the effect of a colossal parish church without one line of carving on its economic sides turner and turner only would follow and render on the canvas that mystery of decided linethat distinct sharp visible but unintelligible and inextricable richness which examined part by part is to the eye nothing but confusion and defeat which taken as a whole is all unity symmetry and truth28   § 13 in near objects as well as distances  § 14 vacancy and falsehood of canaletto  nor is this mode of representation true only with respect to distances every object however near the eye has something about it which you cannot see and which brings the mystery of distance even into every part and portion of what we suppose ourselves to see most distinctly stand in the piazza di st marco at venice as close to the church as you can without losing sight of the top of it look at the capitals of the columns on the second story you see that they are exquisitely rich carved all over tell me their patterns you cannot tell me the direction of a single line in them you cannot yet you see a multitude of lines and you have so much feeling of a certain tendency and arrangement in those lines that you are quite sure the capitals are beautiful and that they are all different from each other but i defy you to make out one single line in any one of them now go to canalettos painting of this church in the palazzo manfrini taken from the very spot on which you stood how much has he represented of all this a black dot under each capital for the shadow and a yellow one above it for the light there is not a vestige nor indication of carving or decoration of any sort or kind  very different from this but erring on the other side is the ordinary drawing of the architect who gives the principal lines of the design with delicate clearness and precision but with no uncertainty or mystery about them which mystery being removed all space and size are destroyed with it and we have a drawing of a model not of a building but in the capital lying on the foreground in turners daphne hunting with leucippus we have the perfect truth not one jag of the acanthus leaves is absolutely visible the lines are all disorder but you feel in an instant that all are there and so it will invariably be found through every portion of detail in his late and most perfect works   § 15 still greater fulness and finish in landscape foregrounds  but if there be this mystery and inexhaustible finish merely in the more delicate instances of architectural decoration how much more in the ceaseless and incomparable decoration of nature the detail of a single weedy bank laughs the carving of ages to scorn every leaf and stalk has a design and tracery upon itevery knot of grass an intricacy of shade which the labor of years could never imitate and which if such labor could follow it out even to the last fibres of the leaflets would yet be falsely represented for as in all other cases brought forward it is not clearly seen but confusedly and mysteriously that which is nearness for the bank is distance for its details and however near it may be the greater part of those details are still a beautiful incomprehensibility29   § 16 space and size are destroyed alike by distinctness and by         vacancy  hence throughout the picture the expression of space and size is dependent upon obscurity united with or rather resultant from exceeding fulness we destroy both space and size either by the vacancy which affords us no measure of space or by the distinctness which gives us a false one the distance of poussin having no indication of trees nor of meadows nor of character of any kind may be fifty miles off or may be five we cannot tellwe have no measure and in consequence no vivid impression but a middle distance of hobbimas involves a contradiction in terms it states a distance by perspective which it contradicts by distinctness of detail   § 17 swift execution best secures perfection of details  § 18 finish is far more necessary in landscape than in historical         subjects  a single dusty roll of turners brush is more truly expressive of the infinity of foliage than the niggling of hobbima could have rendered his canvas if he had worked on it till doomsday what sir j reynolds says of the misplaced labor of his roman acquaintance on separate leaves of foliage and the certainty he expresses that a man who attended to general character would in five minutes produce a more faithful representation of a tree than the unfortunate mechanist in as many years is thus perfectly true and well founded but this is not because details are undesirable but because they are best given by swift execution and because individually they cannot be given at all but it should be observed though we shall be better able to insist upon this point in future that much of harm and error has arisen from the supposition and assertions of swift and brilliant historical painters that the same principles of execution are entirely applicable to landscape which are right for the figure the artist who falls into extreme detail in drawing the human form is apt to become disgusting rather than pleasing it is more agreeable that the general outline and soft hues of flesh should alone be given than its hairs and veins and lines of intersection and even the most rapid and generalizing expression of the human body if directed by perfect knowledge and rigidly faithful in drawing will commonly omit very little of what is agreeable or impressive but the exclusively generalizing landscape painter omits the whole of what is valuable in his subjectomits thoughts designs and beauties by the million everything indeed which can furnish him with variety or expression a distance in lincolnshire or in lombardy might both be generalized into such blue and yellow stripes as we see in poussin but whatever there is of beauty or character in either depends altogether on our understanding the details and feeling the difference between the morasses and ditches of the one and the rolling sea of mulberry trees of the other and so in every part of the subject i have no hesitation in asserting that it is impossible to go too fine or think too much about details in landscape so that they be rightly arranged and rightly massed but that it is equally impossible to render anything like the fulness or the space of nature except by that mystery and obscurity of execution which she herself uses and in which turner only has followed her   § 19 recapitulation of the section  we have now rapidly glanced at such general truths of nature as can be investigated without much knowledge of what is beautiful questions of arrangement massing and generalization i prefer leaving untouched until we know something about details and something about what is beautiful all that is desirable even in these mere technical and artificial points is based upon truths and habits of nature but we cannot understand those truths until we are acquainted with the specific forms and minor details which they affect or out of which they arise i shall therefore proceed to examine the invaluable and essential truths of specific character and formbriefly and imperfectly indeed as needs must be but yet at length sufficient to enable the reader to pursue if he will the subject for himself   footnotes    27 of course much depends upon the kind of detail so lost an     artist may generalize the trunk of a tree where he only loses lines     of bark and do us a kindness but he must not generalize the     details of a champaign in which there is a history of creation the     full discussion of the subject belongs to a future part of our     investigation    28 vide for illustration fontainebleau in the illustrations to     scott vignette at opening of human life in rogerss poems venice     in the italy chateau de blois the rouen and pont neuf paris in     the rivers of france the distances of all the academy pictures of     venice especially the shylock are most instructive    29 it is to be remembered however that these truths present     themselves in all probability under very different phases to     individuals of different powers of vision many artists who appear     to generalize rudely or rashly are perhaps faithfully endeavoring to     render the appearance which nature bears to sight of limited range     others may be led by their singular keenness of sight into     inexpedient detail works which are painted for effect at a certain     distance must be always seen at disadvantage by those whose sight is     of different range from the painters another circumstance to which     i ought above to have alluded is the scale of the picture for there     are different degrees of generalization and different necessities     of symbolism belonging to every scale the stipple of the miniature     painter would be offensive on features of the life size and the     leaves with tintoret may articulate on a canvas of sixty feet by     twentyfive must be generalized by turner on one of four by three     another circumstance of some importance is the assumed distance of     the foreground many landscape painters seem to think their nearest     foreground is always equally near whereas its distance from the     spectator varies not a little being always at least its own     calculable breadth from side to side as estimated by figures or any     other object of known size at the nearest part of it with claude     almost always with turner often as in the daphne and leucippus     this breadth is forty or fifty yards and as the nearest foreground     object must then be at least that distance removed and may be     much more it is evident that no completion of close detail is in     such cases allowable see here another proof of claudes erroneous     practice with titian and tintoret on the contrary the foreground     is rarely more than five or six yards broad and its objects     therefore being only five or six yards distant are entirely     detailed      none of these circumstances however in any wise affect the great     principle the confusion of detail taking place sooner or later in     all cases i ought to have noted however that many of the pictures     of turner in which the confused drawing has been least understood     have been luminous twilights and that the uncertainty of twilight     is therefore added to that of general distance in the evenings of     the south it not unfrequently happens that objects touched with the     reflected light of the western sky continue even for the space of     half an hour after sunset glowing ruddy and intense in color and     almost as bright as if they were still beneath actual sunshine even     till the moon begins to cast a shadow but in spite of this     brilliancy of color all the details become ghostly and illdefined     this is a favorite moment of turners and he invariably     characterizes it not by gloom but by uncertainty of detail i have     never seen the effect of clear twilight thoroughly rendered by art     that effect in which all details are lost while intense clearness     and light are still felt in the atmosphere in which nothing is     distinctly seen and yet it is not darkness far less mist that is     the cause of concealment turners efforts at rendering this effect     as the wilderness of engedi assos chateau de blois     caerlaverock and others innumerable have always some slight     appearance of mistiness owing to the indistinctness of details but     it remains to be shown that any closer approximation to the effect     is possible                                     section iii                                of truth of skies                                      chapter i                                of the open sky   § 1 the peculiar adaptation of the sky to the pleasing and teaching of        man  § 2 the carelessness with which its lessons are received  § 3 the most essential of these lessons are the gentlest  § 4 many of our ideas of sky altogether conventional  it is a strange thing how little in general people know about the sky it is the part of creation in which nature has done more for the sake of pleasing man more for the sole and evident purpose of talking to him and teaching him than in any other of her works and it is just the part in which we least attend to her there are not many of her other works in which some more material or essential purpose than the mere pleasing of man is not answered by every part of their organization but every essential purpose of the sky might so far as we know be answered if once in three days or thereabouts a great ugly black rain cloud were brought up over the blue and everything well watered and so all left blue again till next time with perhaps a film of morning and evening mist for dew and instead of this there is not a moment of any day of our lives when nature is not producing scene after scene picture after picture glory after glory and working still upon such exquisite and constant principles of the most perfect beauty that it is quite certain it is all done for us and intended for our perpetual pleasure and every man wherever placed however far from other sources of interest or of beauty has this doing for him constantly the noblest scenes of the earth can be seen and known but by few it is not intended that man should live always in the midst of them he injures them by his presence he ceases to feel them if he be always with them but the sky is for all bright as it is it is not too bright nor good for human natures daily food it is fitted in all its functions for the perpetual comfort and exalting of the heart for the soothing it and purifying it from its dross and dust sometimes gentle sometimes capricious sometimes awful never the same for two moments together almost human in its passions almost spiritual in its tenderness almost divine in its infinity its appeal to what is immortal in us is as distinct as its ministry of chastisement or of blessing to what is mortal is essential and yet we never attend to it we never make it a subject of thought but as it has to do with our animal sensations we look upon all by which it speaks to us more clearly than to brutes upon all which bears witness to the intention of the supreme that we are to receive more from the covering vault than the light and the dew which we share with the weed and the worm only as a succession of meaningless and monotonous accident too common and too vain to be worthy of a moment of watchfulness or a glance of admiration if in our moments of utter idleness and insipidity we turn to the sky as a last resource which of its phenomena do we speak of one says it has been wet and another it has been windy and another it has been warm who among the whole chattering crowd can tell me of the forms and the precipices of the chain of tall white mountains that girded the horizon at noon yesterday who saw the narrow sunbeam that came out of the south and smote upon their summits until they melted and mouldered away in a dust of blue rain who saw the dance of the dead clouds when the sunlight left them last night and the west wind blew them before it like withered leaves all has passed unregretted as unseen or if the apathy be ever shaken off even for an instant it is only by what is gross or what is extraordinary and yet it is not in the broad and fierce manifestations of the elemental energies not in the clash of the hail nor the drift of the whirlwind that the highest characters of the sublime are developed god is not in the earthquake nor in the fire but in the still small voice they are but the blunt and the low faculties of our nature which can only be addressed through lampblack and lightning it is in quiet and subdued passages of unobtrusive majesty the deep and the calm and the perpetualthat which must be sought ere it is seen and loved ere it is understoodthings which the angels work out for us daily and yet vary eternally which are never wanting and never repeated which are to be found always yet each found but once it is through these that the lesson of devotion is chiefly taught and the blessing of beauty given these are what the artist of highest aim must study it is these by the combination of which his ideal is to be created these of which so little notice is ordinarily taken by common observers that i fully believe little as people in general are concerned with art more of their ideas of sky are derived from pictures than from reality and that if we could examine the conception formed in the minds of most educated persons when we talk of clouds it would frequently be found composed of fragments of blue and white reminiscences of the old masters  i shall enter upon the examination of what is true in sky at greater length because it is the only part of a picture of which all if they will may be competent judges what i may have to assert respecting the rocks of salvator or the boughs of claude i can scarcely prove except to those whom i can immure for a month or two in the fastnesses of the apennines or guide in their summer walks again and again through the ravines of sorrento but what i say of the sky can be brought to an immediate test by all and i write the more decisively in the hope that it may be so   § 5 nature and essential qualities of the open blue  § 6 its connection with clouds  § 7 its exceeding depth  § 8 these qualities are especially given by modern masters  § 9 and by claude  § 10 total absence of them in poussin physical errors in his general         treatment of open sky  § 11 errors of cuyp in graduation of color  let us begin then with the simple open blue of the sky this is of course the color of the pure atmospheric air not the aqueous vapor but the pure azote and oxygen and it is the total color of the whole mass of that air between us and the void of space it is modified by the varying quantity of aqueous vapor suspended in it whose color in its most imperfect and therefore most visible state of solution is pure white as in steam which receives like any other white the warm hues of the rays of the sun and according to its quantity and imperfect solution makes the sky paler and at the same time more or less gray by mixing warm tones with its blue this gray aqueous vapor when very decided becomes mist and when local cloud hence the sky is to be considered as a transparent blue liquid in which at various elevations clouds are suspended those clouds being themselves only particular visible spaces of a substance with which the whole mass of this liquid is more or less impregnated now we all know this perfectly well and yet we so far forget it in practice that we little notice the constant connection kept up by nature between her blue and her clouds and we are not offended by the constant habit of the old masters of considering the blue sky as totally distinct in its nature and far separated from the vapors which float in it with them cloud is cloud and blue is blue and no kind of connection between them is ever hinted at the sky is thought of as a clear high material dome the clouds as separate bodies suspended beneath it and in consequence however delicate and exquisitely removed in tone their skies may be you always look at them not through them now if there be one characteristic of the sky more valuable or necessary to be rendered than another it is that which wordsworth has given in the second book of the excursion                       the chasm of sky above my head            is heavens profoundest azure no domain            for fickle shortlived clouds to occupy            or to pass throughbut rather an abyss            in which the everlasting stars abide            and whose soft gloom and boundless depth might tempt            the curious eye to look for them by day  and in his american notes i remember dickens notices the same truth describing himself as lying drowsily on the barge deck looking not at but through the sky and if you look intensely at the pure blue of a serene sky you will see that there is a variety and fulness in its very repose it is not flat dead color but a deep quivering transparent body of penetrable air in which you trace or imagine short falling spots of deceiving light and dim shades faint veiled vestiges of dark vapor and it is this trembling transparency which our great modern master has especially aimed at and given his blue is never laid on in smooth coats but in breaking mingling melting hues a quarter of an inch of which cut off from all the rest of the picture is still spacious still infinite and immeasurable in depth it is a painting of the air something into which you can see through the parts which are near you into those which are far off something which has no surface and through which we can plunge far and farther and without stay or end into the profundity of spacewhereas with all the old landscape painters except claude you may indeed go a long way before you come to the sky but you will strike hard against it at last a perfectly genuine and untouched sky of claude is indeed most perfect and beyond praise in all qualities of air though even with him i often feel rather that there is a great deal of pleasant air between me and the firmament than that the firmament itself is only air i do not mean however to say a word against such skies as that of the enchanted castle or that marked 30 in the national gallery or one or two which i remember at rome but how little and by how few these fine passages of claude are appreciated is sufficiently proved by the sufferance of such villainous and unpalliated copies as we meet with all over europe like the marriage of isaac in our own gallery to remain under his name in fact i do not remember above ten pictures of claudes in which the skies whether repainted or altogether copies or perhaps from claudes hand but carelessly laid in like that marked 241 dulwich gallery were not fully as feelingless and false as those of other masters while with the poussins there are no favorable exceptions their skies are systematically wrong take for instance the sky of the sacrifice of isaac it is here high noon as is shown by the shadow of the figures and what sort of color is the sky at the top of the picture is it pale and gray with heat full of sunshine and unfathomable in depth on the contrary it is of a pitch of darkness which except on the mont blanc or chimborazo is as purely impossible as color can be he might as well have painted it coal black and it is laid on with a dead coat of flat paint having no one quality or resemblance of sky about it it cannot have altered because the land horizon is as delicate and tender in tone as possible and is evidently unchanged and to complete the absurdity of the whole thing this color holds its own without graduation or alteration to within three or four degrees of the horizon where it suddenly becomes bold and unmixed yellow now the horizon at noon may be yellow when the whole sky is covered with dark clouds and only one open streak of light left in the distance from which the whole light proceeds but with a clear open sky and opposite the sun at noon such a yellow horizon as this is physically impossible even supposing that the upper part of the sky were pale and warm and that the transition from the one hue to the other were effected imperceptibly and gradually as is invariably the case in reality instead of taking place within a space of two or three degreeseven then this gold yellow would be altogether absurd but as it is we have in this sky and it is a fine pictureone of the best of gaspars that i know a notable example of the truth of the old masterstwo impossible colors impossibly united find such a color in turners noonday zenith as the blue at the top or such a color at a noonday horizon as the yellow at the bottom or such a connection of any colors whatsoever as that in the centre and then you may talk about his being false to nature if you will nor is this a solitary instance it is gaspar poussins favorite and characteristic effect i remember twenty such most of them worse than this in the downright surface and opacity of blue again look at the large cuyp in the dulwich gallery which mr hazlitt considers the finest in the world and of which he very complimentarily says the tender green of the valleys the gleaming lake the purple light of the hills have an effect like the down on an unripe nectarine i ought to have apologized before now for not having studied sufficiently in covent garden to be provided with terms of correct and classical criticism one of my friends begged me to observe the other day that claude was pulpy another added the yet more gratifying information that he was juicy and it is now happily discovered that cuyp is downy now i dare say that the sky of this firstrate cuyp is very like an unripe nectarine all that i have to say about it is that it is exceedingly unlike a sky the blue remains unchanged and ungraduated over threefourths of it down to the horizon while the sun in the lefthand corner is surrounded with a halo first of yellow and then of crude pink both being separated from each other and the last from the blue as sharply as the belts of a rainbow and both together not ascending ten degrees in the sky now it is difficult to conceive how any man calling himself a painter could impose such a thing on the public and still more how the public can receive it as a representation of that sunset purple which invariably extends its influence to the zenith so that there is no pure blue anywhere but a purple increasing in purity gradually down to its point of greatest intensity about fortyfive degrees from the horizon and then melting imperceptibly into the gold the three colors extending their influence over the whole sky so that throughout the whole sweep of the heaven there is no one spot where the color is not in an equal state of transitionpassing from gold into orange from that into rose from that into purple from that into blue with absolute equality of change so that in no place can it be said here it changes and in no place here it is unchanging this is invariably the case there is no such thingthere never was and never will be such a thing while gods heaven remains as it is madeas a serene sunset sky with its purple and rose in belts about the sun   § 12 the exceeding value of the skies of the early italian and dutch         schools their qualities are unattainable in modern times  such bold broad examples of ignorance as these would soon set aside all the claims of the professed landscape painters to truth with whatever delicacy of color or manipulation they may be disguised but there are some skies of the dutch school in which clearness and coolness have been aimed at instead of depth and some introduced merely as backgrounds to the historical subjects of the older italians which there is no matching in modern times one would think angels had painted them for all is now clay and oil in comparison it seems as if we had totally lost the art for surely otherwise however little our painters might aim at it or feel it they would touch the chord sometimes by accident but they never do and the mechanical incapacity is still more strongly evidenced by the muddy struggles of the unhappy germans who have the feeling partially strained artificial and diseased indeed but still genuine enough to bring out the tone if they had the mechanical means and technical knowledge but however they were obtained the clear tones of this kind of the older italians are glorious and enviable in the highest degree and we shall show when we come to speak of the beautiful that they are one of the most just grounds of the fame of the old masters   § 13 phenomena of visible sunbeams their nature and cause  but there is a series of phenomena connected with the open blue of the sky which we must take especial notice of as it is of constant occurrence in the works of turner and claude the effects namely of visible sunbeams it will be necessary for us thoroughly to understand the circumstances under which such effects take place  aqueous vapor or mist suspended in the atmosphere becomes visible exactly as dust does in the air of a room in the shadows you not only cannot see the dust itself because unillumined but you can see other objects through the dust without obscurity the air being thus actually rendered more transparent by a deprivation of light where a sunbeam enters every particle of dust becomes visible and a palpable interruption to the sight so that a transverse sunbeam is a real obstacle to the vision you cannot see things clearly through it  in the same way wherever vapor is illuminated by transverse rays there it becomes visible as a whiteness more or less affecting the purity of the blue and destroying it exactly in proportion to the degree of illumination but where vapor is in shade it has very little effect on the sky perhaps making it a little deeper and grayer than it otherwise would be but not itself unless very dense distinguishable or felt as mist   § 14 they are only illuminated mist and cannot appear when the sky is         free from vapor nor when it is without clouds  the appearance of mist or whiteness in the blue of the sky is thus a circumstance which more or less accompanies sunshine and which supposing the quantity of vapor constant is greatest in the brightest sunlight when there are no clouds in the sky the whiteness as it affects the whole sky equally is not particularly noticeable but when there are clouds between us and the sun the sun being low those clouds cast shadows along and through the mass of suspended vapor within the space of these shadows the vapor as above stated becomes transparent and invisible and the sky appears of a pure blue but where the sunbeams strike the vapor becomes visible in the form of the beams occasioning those radiating shafts of light which are one of the most valuable and constant accompaniments of a low sun the denser the mist the more distinct and sharpedged will these rays be when the air is very clear they are mere vague flushing gradated passages of light when it is very thick they are keenedged and decisive in a high degree  we see then first that a quantity of mist dispersed through the whole space of the sky is necessary to this phenomenon and secondly that what we usually think of as beams of greater brightness than the rest of the sky are in reality only a part of that sky in its natural state of illumination cut off and rendered brilliant by the shadows from the cloudsthat these shadows are in reality the source of the appearance of beamsthat therefore no part of the sky can present such an appearance except when there are broken clouds between it and the sun and lastly that the shadows cast from such clouds are not necessarily gray or dark but very nearly of the natural pure blue of a sky destitute of vapor   § 15 erroneous tendency in the representation of such phenomena by the         old masters  § 16 the ray which appears in the dazzled eye should not be         represented  § 17 the practice of turner his keen perception of the more delicate         phenomena of rays  § 18 the total absence of any evidence of such perception in the works         of the old masters  now as it has been proved that the appearance of beams can only take place in a part of the sky which has clouds between it and the sun it is evident that no appearance of beams can ever begin from the orb itself except when there is a cloud or solid body of some kind between us and it but that such appearances will almost invariably begin on the dark side of some of the clouds around it the orb itself remaining the centre of a broad blaze of united light wordsworth has given us in two lines the only circumstances under which rays can ever appear to have origin in the orb itself                                       but rays of light              now suddenly diverging from the orb              retired behind the mountain tops or veiled              by the dense air shot upwards                                             excursion book ix  and turner has given us the effect magnificently in the dartmouth of the river scenery it is frequent among the old masters and constant in claude though the latter from drawing his beams too fine represents the effect upon the dazzled eye rather than the light which actually exists and approximates very closely to the ideal which we see in the sign of the rising sun nay i am nearly sure that i remember cases in which he has given us the diverging beam without any cloud or hill interfering with the orb it may perhaps be somewhat difficult to say how far it is allowable to represent that kind of ray which is seen by the dazzled eye it is very certain that we never look towards a bright sun without seeing glancing rays issue from it but it is equally certain that those rays are no more real existences than the red and blue circles which we see after having been so dazzled and that if we are to represent the rays we ought also to cover our sky with pink and blue circles i should on the whole consider it utterly false in principle to represent the visionary beam and that we ought only to show that which has actual existence such we find to be the constant practice of turner even where owing to interposed clouds he has beams appearing to issue from the orb itself they are broad bursts of light not spiky rays and his more usual practice is to keep all near the sun in one simple blaze of intense light and from the first clouds to throw beams to the zenith though he often does not permit any appearance of rays until close to the zenith itself open at the 80th page of the illustrated edition of rogerss poems you have there a sky blazing with sunbeams but they all begin a long way from the sun and they are accounted for by a mass of dense clouds surrounding the orb itself turn to the 7th page behind the old oak where the sun is supposed to be you have only a blaze of undistinguished light but up on the left over the edge of the cloud on its dark side the sunbeam turn to page 192blazing rays again but all beginning where the clouds do not one can you trace to the sun and observe how carefully the long shadow on the mountain is accounted for by the dim dark promontory projecting out near the sun i need not multiply examples you will find various modifications and uses of these effects throughout his works but you will not find a single trace of them in the old masters they give you the rays issuing from behind black clouds and because they are a coarse and common effect which could not possibly escape their observation and because they are easily imitated they give you the spiky shafts issuing from the orb itself because these are partially symbolical of light and assist a tardy imagination as two or three rays scratched round the sun with a pen would though they would be rays of darkness instead of light30 but of the most beautiful phenomenon of all the appearance of the delicate ray far in the sky threading its way among the thin transparent clouds while all around the sun is unshadowed fire there is no record nor example whatsoever in their works it was too delicate and spiritual for them probably their blunt and feelingless eyes never perceived it in nature and their untaught imaginations were not likely to originate it in the study   § 19 truth of the skies of modern drawings  little is to be said of the skies of our other landscape artists in paintings they are commonly toneless crude and wanting in depth and transparency but in drawings some very perfect and delicate examples have been produced by various members of the old water color society and one or two others but with respect to the qualities of which we are at present speaking it is not right to compare drawings with paintings as the wash or spunging or other artifices peculiar to water color are capable of producing an appearance of quality which it needs much higher art to produce in oils   § 20 recapitulation the best skies of the ancients are in quality         inimitable but in rendering of various truth childish  taken generally the open skies of the moderns are inferior in quality to picked and untouched skies of the greatest of the ancients but far superior to the average class of pictures which we have every day fathered upon their reputation nine or ten skies of claude might be named which are not to be contended with in their way and as many of cuyp teniers has given some very wonderful passages and the clearness of the early italian and dutch schools is beyond all imitation but the common blue daubing which we hear every day in our best galleries attributed to claude and cuyp and the genuine skies of salvator and of both the poussins are not to be compared for an instant with the best works of modern times even in quality and transparency while in all matters requiring delicate observation or accurate sciencein all which was not attainable by technicalities of art and which depended upon the artists knowledge and understanding of nature all the works of the ancients are alike the productions of mere children sometimes manifesting great sensibility but proving at the same time feebly developed intelligence and illregulated observation   footnotes    30 i have left this passage as it stood originally because it is     right as far as it goes yet it speaks with too little respect of     symbolism which is often of the highest use in religious art and     in some measure is allowable in all art in the works of almost all     the greatest masters there are portions which are explanatory rather     than representative and typical rather than imitative nor could     these be parted with but at infinite loss note with respect to the     present question the daring black sunbeams of titian in his     woodcut of st francis receiving the stigmata and compare here part     iii sect ii chap iv § 18 chap v § 13 and though i believe     that i am right in considering all such symbolism as out of place in     pure landscape and in attributing that of claude to ignorance or     inability and not to feeling yet i praise turner not so much for     his absolute refusal to represent the spiky ray about the sun as     for his perceiving and rendering that which claude never perceived     the multitudinous presence of radiating light in the upper sky and     on all its countless ranks of subtile cloud                                      chapter ii            of truth of cloudsfirst of the region of the cirrus   § 1 difficulty of ascertaining wherein the truth of clouds consists  our next subject of investigation must be the specific character of clouds a species of truth which is especially neglected by artists first because as it is within the limits of possibility that a cloud may assume almost any form it is difficult to point out and not always easy to feel where in error consists and secondly because it is totally impossible to study the forms of clouds from nature with care and accuracy as a change in the subject takes place between every touch of the following pencil and parts of an outline sketched at different instants cannot harmonize nature never having intended them to come together still if artists were more in the habit of sketching clouds rapidly and as accurately as possible in the outline from nature instead of daubing down what they call effects with the brush they would soon find there is more beauty about their forms than can be arrived at by any random felicity of invention however brilliant and more essential character than can be violated without incurring the charge of falsehoodfalsehood as direct and definite though not as traceable as error in the less varied features of organic form   § 2 variation of their character at different elevations the three        regions to which they may conveniently be considered as        belonging  the first and most important character of clouds is dependent on the different altitudes at which they are formed the atmosphere may be conveniently considered as divided into three spaces each inhabited by clouds of specific character altogether different though in reality there is no distinct limit fixed between them by nature clouds being formed at every altitude and partaking according to their altitude more or less of the characters of the upper or lower regions the scenery of the sky is thus formed of an infinitely graduated series of systematic forms of cloud each of which has its own region in which alone it is formed and each of which has specific characters which can only be properly determined by comparing them as they are found clearly distinguished by intervals of considerable space i shall therefore consider the sky as divided into three regionsthe upper region or region of the cirrus the central region or region of the stratus the lower region or the region of the raincloud   § 3 extent of the upper region  § 4 the symmetrical arrangement of its clouds  the clouds which i wish to consider as included in the upper region never touch even the highest mountains of europe and may therefore be looked upon as never formed below an of at least 15000 feet they are the motionless multitudinous lines of delicate vapor with which the blue of the open sky is commonly streaked or speckled after several days of fine weather i must be pardoned for giving a detailed description of their specific characters as they are of constant occurrence in the works of modern artists and i shall have occasion to speak frequently of them in future parts of the work their chief characters arefirst symmetry they are nearly always arranged in some definite and evident order commonly in long ranks reaching sometimes from the zenith to the horizon each rank composed of an infinite number of transverse bars of about the same length each bar thickest in the middle and terminating in a traceless vaporous point at each side the ranks are in the direction of the wind and the bars of course at right angles to it these latter are commonly slightly bent in the middle frequently two systems of this kind indicative of two currents of wind at different altitudes intersect one another forming a network another frequent arrangement is in groups of excessively fine silky parallel fibres commonly radiating or having a tendency to radiate from one of their extremities and terminating in a plumy sweep at the otherthese are vulgarly known as mares tails the plumy and expanded extremity of these is often bent upwards sometimes back and up again giving an appearance of great flexibility and unity at the same time as if the clouds were tough and would hold together however bent the narrow extremity is invariably turned to the wind and the fibres are parallel with its direction the upper clouds always fall into some modification of one or other of these arrangements they thus differ from all other clouds in having a plan and system whereas other clouds though there are certain laws which they cannot break have yet perfect freedom from anything like a relative and general system of government the upper clouds are to the lower what soldiers on parade are to a mixed multitude no men walk on their heads or their hands and so there are certain laws which no clouds violate but there is nothing except in the upper clouds resembling symmetrical discipline   § 5 their exceeding delicacy  secondly sharpness of edge the edges of the bars of the upper clouds which are turned to the wind are often the sharpest which the sky shows no outline whatever of any other kind of cloud however marked and energetic ever approaches the delicate decision of these edges the outline of a black thundercloud is striking from the great energy of the color or shade of the general mass but as a line it is soft and indistinct compared with the edge of the cirrus in a clear sky with a brisk breeze on the other hand the edge of the bar turned away from the wind is always soft often imperceptible melting into the blue interstice between it and its next neighbor commonly the sharper one edge is the softer is the other and the clouds look flat and as if they slipped over each other like the scales of a fish when both edges are soft as is always the case when the sky is clear and windless the cloud looks solid round and fleecy   § 6 their number  thirdly multitude the delicacy of these vapors is sometimes carried into such an infinity of division that no other sensation of number that the earth or heaven can give is so impressive number is always most felt when it is symmetrical vide burke on sublime part ii sect 8 and therefore no seawaves nor fresh leaves make their number so evident or so impressive as these vapors nor is nature content with an infinity of bars or lines aloneeach bar is in its turn severed into a number of small undulatory masses more or less connected according to the violence of the wind when this division is merely effected by undulation the cloud exactly resembles seasand ribbed by the tide but when the division amounts to real separation we have the mottled or mackerel skies commonly the greater the division of its bars the broader and more shapeless is the rank or field so that in the mottled sky it is lost altogether and we have large irregular fields of equal size masses like flocks of sheep such clouds are three or four thousand feet below the legitimate cirrus i have seen them cast a shadow on the mont blanc at sunset so that they must descend nearly to within fifteen thousand feet of the earth   § 7 causes of their peculiarly delicate coloring  fourthly purity of color the nearest of these cloudsthose over the observers head being at least three miles above him and nearly all entering the ordinary sphere of vision farther from him stilltheir dark sides are much grayer and cooler than those of other clouds owing to their distance they are composed of the purest aqueous vapor free from all foulness of earthy gases and of this in the lightest and most ethereal state in which it can be to be visible farther they receive the light of the sun in a state of far greater intensity than lower objects the beams being transmitted to them through atmospheric air far less dense and wholly unaffected by mist smoke or any other impurity hence their colors are more pure and vivid and their white less sullied than those of any other clouds   § 8 their variety of form  lastly variety variety is never so conspicuous as when it is united with symmetry the perpetual change of form in other clouds is monotonous in its very dissimilarity nor is difference striking where no connection is implied but if through a range of barred clouds crossing half the heaven all governed by the same forces and falling into one general form there be yet a marked and evident dissimilarity between each member of the great massone more finely drawn the next more delicately moulded the next more gracefully benteach broken into differently modelled and variously numbered groups the variety is doubly striking because contrasted with the perfect symmetry of which it forms a part hence the importance of the truth that nature never lets one of the members of even her most disciplined groups of cloud be like another but though each is adapted for the same function and in its great features resembles all the others not one out of the millions with which the sky is checkered is without a separate beauty and character appearing to have had distinct thought occupied in its conception and distinct forces in its production and in addition to this perpetual invention visible in each member of each system we find systems of separate cloud intersecting one another the sweeping lines mingled and interwoven with the rigid bars these in their turn melting into banks of sandlike ripple and flakes of drifted and irregular foam under all perhaps the massy outline of some lower cloud moves heavily across the motionless buoyancy of the upper lines and indicates at once their elevation and their repose   § 9 total absence of even the slightest effort at their representation        in ancient landscape  such are the great attributes of the upper cloud region whether they are beautiful valuable or impressive it is not our present business to decide nor to endeavor to discover the reason of the somewhat remarkable fact that the whole field of ancient landscape art affords as far as we remember but one instance of any effort whatever to represent the character of this cloud region that one instance is the landscape of rubens in our own gallery in which the mottled or fleecy sky is given with perfect truth and exquisite beauty to this should perhaps be added some of the backgrounds of the historical painters where horizontal lines were required and a few level bars of white or warm color cross the serenity of the blue these as far as they go are often very perfect and the elevation and repose of their effect might we should have thought have pointed out to the landscape painters that there was something i do not say much but certainly something to be made out of the high clouds not one of them however took the hint to whom among them all can we look for the slightest realization of the fine and faithful descriptive passage of the excursion already alluded to                             but rays of light           now suddenly diverging from the orb           retired behind the mountain tops or veiled           by the dense air shot upwards to the crown           of the blue firmamentaloftand wide           and multitudes of little floating clouds           ere we who saw of change were conscious pierced           through their ethereal texture had become           vivid as fireclouds separately poised           innumerable multitude of forms           scattered through half the circle of the sky           and giving back and shedding each on each           with prodigal communion the bright hues           which from the unapparent fount of glory           they had imbibed and ceased not to receive           that which the heavens displayed the liquid deep           repeated but with unity sublime   § 10 the intense and constant study of them by turner  there is but one master whose works we can think of while we read this one alone has taken notice of the neglected upper sky it is his peculiar and favorite field he has watched its every modification and given its every phase and feature at all hours in all seasons he has followed its passions and its changes and has brought down and laid open to the world another apocalypse of heaven  there is scarcely a painting of turners in which serenity of sky and intensity of light are aimed at together in which these clouds are not used though there are not two cases in which they are used altogether alike sometimes they are crowded together in masses of mingling light as in the shylock every part and atom sympathizing in that continuous expression of slow movement which shelley has so beautifully touched                      underneath the young gray dawn         a multitude of dense white fleecy clouds         were wandering in thick flocks along the mountains         shepherded by the slow unwilling wind  at other times they are blended with the sky itself felt only here and there by a ray of light calling them into existence out of its misty shade as in the mercury and argus sometimes where great repose is to be given they appear in a few detached equal rounded flakes which seem to hang motionless each like the shadow of the other in the deep blue of the zenith as in the acrocorinth sometimes they are scattered in fiery flying fragments each burning with separate energy as in the temeraire sometimes woven together with fine threads of intermediate darkness melting into the blue as in the napoleon but in all cases the exquisite manipulation of the master gives to each atom of the multitude its own character and expression though they be countless as leaves each has its portion of light its shadow its reflex its peculiar and separating form   § 11 his vignette sunrise on the sea  take for instance the illustrated edition of rogerss poems31 and open it at the 80th page and observe how every attribute which i have pointed out in the upper sky is there rendered with the faithfulness of a mirror the long lines of parallel bars the delicate curvature from the wind which the inclination of the sail shows you to be from the west the excessive sharpness of every edge which is turned to the wind the faintness of every opposite one the breaking up of each bar into rounded masses and finally the inconceivable variety with which individual form has been given to every member of the multitude and not only individual form but roundness and substance even where there is scarcely a hairbreadth of cloud to express it in observe above everything the varying indication of space and depth in the whole so that you may look through and through from one cloud to another feeling not merely how they retire to the horizon but how they melt back into the recesses of the sky every interval being filled with absolute air and all its spaces so melting and fluctuating and fraught with change as with repose that as you look you will fancy that the rays shoot higher and higher into the vault of light and that the pale streak of horizontal vapor is melting away from the cloud that it crosses now watch for the next barred sunrise and take this vignette to the window and test it by natures own clouds among which you will find forms and passages i do not say merely like but apparently the actual originals of parts of this very drawing and with whom will you do this except with turner will you do it with claude and set that blank square yard of blue with its round white flat fixtures of similar cloud beside the purple infinity of nature with her countless multitude of shadowy lines and flaky waves and folded veils of variable mist will you do it with poussin and set those massy steps of unyielding solidity with the chariotandfour driving up them by the side of the delicate forms which terminate in threads too fine for the eye to follow them and of texture so thin woven that the earliest stars shine through them will you do it with salvator and set that volume of violent and restless manufactory smoke beside those calm and quiet bars which pause in the heaven as if they would never leave it more   § 12 his use of the cirrus in expressing mist  now we have just seen how turner uses the sharpedged cirri when he aims at giving great transparency of air but it was shown in the preceding chapter that sunbeams or the appearance of them are always sharper in their edge in proportion as the air is more misty as they are most defined in a room where there is most dust flying about in it consequently in the vignette we have been just noticing where transparency is to be given though there is a blaze of light its beams are never edged a tendency to rays is visible but you cannot in any part find a single marked edge of a rising sunbeam the sky is merely more flushed in one place than another now let us see what turner does when he wants mist turn to the alps at daybreak page 193 in the same book here we have the cirri used again but now they have no sharp edges they are all fleecy and mingling with each other though every one of them has the most exquisite indication of individual form and they melt back not till they are lost in exceeding light as in the other plate but into a mysterious fluctuating shadowy sky of which though the light penetrates through it all you perceive every part to be charged with vapor notice particularly the halfindicated forms even where it is most serene behind the snowy mountains and now how are the sunbeams drawn no longer indecisive flushing palpitating every one is sharp and clear and terminated by definite shadow note especially the marked lines on the upper cloud finally observe the difference in the mode of indicating the figures which are here misty and indistinguishable telling only as shadows though they are near and large while those in the former vignette came clear upon the eye though they were so far off as to appear mere points   § 13 his consistency in every minor feature  now is this perpetual consistency in all points this concentration of every fact which can possibly bear upon what we are to be told this watchfulness of the entire meaning and system of nature which fills every part and space of the picture with coincidences of witness which come out upon us as they would from the reality more fully and deeply in proportion to the knowledge we possess and the attention we give admirable or not i could go on writing page after page on every sky of turners and pointing out fresh truths in every one in the havre for instance of the rivers of france we have a new fact pointed out to us with respect to these cirri namely their being so faint and transparent as not to be distinguishable from the blue of the sky a frequent case except in the course of a sunbeam which however does not illumine their edges they being not solid enough to reflect light but penetrates their whole substance and renders them flat luminous forms in its path instantly and totally lost at its edge and thus a separate essay would be required by every picture to make fully understood the new phenomena which it treated and illustrated but after once showing what are the prevailing characteristics of these clouds we can only leave it to the reader to trace them wherever they occur there are some fine and characteristic passages of this kind of cloud given by stanfield though he dares not use them in multitude and is wanting in those refined qualities of form which it is totally impossible to explain in words but which perhaps by simple outlines on a large scale selected from the cloud forms of various artists i may in following portions of the work illustrate with the pencil   § 14 the color of the upper clouds  of the colors of these clouds i have spoken before sec i chap ii but though i then alluded to their purity and vividness i scarcely took proper notice of their variety there is indeed in nature variety in all things and it would be absurd to insist on it in each case yet the colors of these clouds are so marvellous in their changefulness that they require particular notice if you watch for the next sunset when there are a considerable number of these cirri in the sky you will see especially at the zenith that the sky does not remain of the same color for two inches together one cloud has a dark side of cold blue and a fringe of milky white another above it has a dark side of purple and an edge of red another nearer the sun has an underside of orange and an edge of gold these you will find mingled with and passing into the blue of the sky which in places you will not be able to distinguish from the cool gray of the darker clouds and which will be itself full of gradation now pure and deep now faint and feeble and all this is done not in large pieces nor on a large scale but over and over again in every square yard so that there is no single part nor portion of the whole sky which has not in itself variety of color enough for a separate picture and yet no single part which is like another or which has not some peculiar source of beauty and some peculiar arrangement of color of its own now instead of this you get in the old masterscuyp or claude or whoever they may bea field of blue delicately beautifully and uniformly shaded down to the yellow sun with a certain number of similar clouds each with a dark side of the same gray and an edge of the same yellow i do not say that nature never does anything like this but i say that her principle is to do a great deal more and that what she does more than thiswhat i have above described and what you may see in nine sunsets out of tenhas been observed attempted and rendered by turner only and by him with a fidelity and force which presents us with more essential truth and more clear expression and illustration of natural laws in every wreath of vapor than composed the whole stock of heavenly information which lasted cuyp and claude their lives   § 15 recapitulation  we close then our present consideration of the upper clouds to return to them when we know what is beautiful we have at present only to remember that of these clouds and the truths connected with them none before turner had taken any notice whatsoever that had they therefore been even feebly and imperfectly represented by him they would yet have given him a claim to be considered more extended and universal in his statement of truths than any of his predecessors how much more when we find that deep fidelity in his studied and perfect skies which opens new sources of delight to every advancement of our knowledge and to every added moment of our contemplation   footnotes    31 i use this work frequently for illustration because it is the     only one i know in which the engraver has worked with delicacy     enough to give the real forms and touches of turner i can reason     from these plates in questions of form only nearly as well as i     could from the drawings                                      chapter iii            of truth of cloudssecondly of the central cloud region   § 1 extent and typical character of the central cloud region  we have next to investigate the character of the central cloud region which i consider as including all clouds which are the usual characteristic of ordinary serene weather and which touch and envelop the mountains of switzerland but never affect those of our own island they may therefore be considered as occupying a space of air ten thousand feet in height extending from five to fifteen thousand feet above the sea   § 2 its characteristic clouds requiring no attention nor thought for        their representation are therefore favorite subjects with the        old masters  these clouds according to their elevation appear with great variety of form often partaking of the streaked or mottled character of the higher region and as often when the precursors of storm manifesting forms closely connected with the lowest rain clouds but the species especially characteristic of the central region is a white ragged irregular and scattered vapor which has little form and less color and of which a good example may be seen in the largest landscape of cuyp in the dulwich gallery when this vapor collects into masses it is partially rounded clumsy and ponderous as if it would tumble out of the sky shaded with a dull gray and totally devoid of any appearance of energy or motion even in nature these clouds are comparatively uninteresting scarcely worth raising our heads to look at and on canvas valuable only as a means of introducing light and breaking the monotony of blue yet they are perhaps beyond all others the favorite clouds of the dutch masters whether they had any motive for the adoption of such materials beyond the extreme facility with which acres of canvas might thus be covered without any troublesome exertion of thought or any temptation to such selections beyond the impossibility of error where nature shows no form and the impossibility of deficiency where she shows no beauty it is not here the place to determine such skies are happily beyond the reach of criticism for he who tells you nothing cannot tell you a falsehood a little flakewhite glazed with a light brush over the carefully toned blue permitted to fall into whatever forms chance might determine with the single precaution that their edges should be tolerably irregular supplied in hundreds of instances a sky quite good enough for all ordinary purposesquite good enough for cattle to graze or boors to play at ninepins underand equally devoid of all that could gratify inform or offend   § 3 the clouds of salvator and poussin  but although this kind of cloud is as i have said typical of the central region it is not one which nature is fond of she scarcely ever lets an hour pass without some manifestation of finer forms sometimes approaching the upper cirri sometimes the lower cumulus and then in the lower outlines we have the nearest approximation which nature ever presents to the clouds of claude salvator and poussin to the characters of which i must request especial attention as it is here only that we shall have a fair opportunity of comparing their skies with those of the modern school i shall as before glance rapidly at the great laws of specific form and so put it in the power of the reader to judge for himself of the truth of representation   § 4 their essential characters  § 5 their angular forms and general decision of outline  clouds it is to be remembered are not so much local vapor as vapor rendered locally visible by a fall of temperature thus a cloud whose parts are in constant motion will hover on a snowy mountain pursuing constantly the same track upon its flanks and yet remaining of the same size the same form and in the same place for half a day together no matter how violent or how capricious the wind may be the instant it approaches the spot where the chilly influence of the snow extends the moisture it carries becomes visible and then and there the cloud forms on the instant apparently maintaining its form against the wind though the careful and keen eye can see all its parts in the most rapid motion across the mountain the outlines of such a cloud are of course not determined by the irregular impulses of the wind but by the fixed lines of radiant heat which regulate the temperature of the atmosphere of the mountain it is terminated therefore not by changing curves but by steady right lines of more or less decision often exactly correspondent with the outline of the mountain on which it is formed and falling therefore into grotesque peaks and precipices i have seen the marked and angular outline of the grandes jorasses at chamounix mimicked in its every jag by a line of clouds above it another resultant phenomenon is the formation of cloud in the calm air to leeward of a steep summit cloud whose edges are in rapid motion where they are affected by the current of the wind above and stream from the peak like the smoke of a volcano yet always vanish at a certain distance from it as steam issuing from a chimney when wet weather of some duration is approaching a small white spot of cloud will sometimes appear low on the hill flanks it will not move but will increase gradually for some little time then diminish still without moving disappear altogether reappear ten minutes afterwards exactly in the same spot increase to a greater extent than before again disappear again return and at last permanently other similar spots of cloud forming simultaneously with various fluctuations each in its own spot and at the same level on the hillside until all expand join together and form an unbroken veil of threatening gray which darkens gradually into storm what in such cases takes place palpably and remarkably is more or less a law of formation in all clouds whatsoever they being bounded rather by lines expressive of changes of temperature in the atmosphere than by the impulses of the currents of wind in which those changes take place even when in rapid and visible motion across the sky the variations which take place in their outlines are not so much alterations of position and arrangement of parts as they are the alternate formation and disappearance of parts there is therefore usually a parallelism and consistency in their great outlines which give system to the smaller curves of which they are composed and if these great lines be taken rejecting the minutiæ of variation the resultant form will almost always be angular and full of character and decision in the flocklike fields of equal masses each individual mass has the effect not of an ellipse or circle but of a rhomboid the sky is crossed and checkered not honeycombed in the lower cumuli even though the most rounded of all clouds the groups are not like balloons or bubbles but like towers or mountains and the result of this arrangement in masses more or less angular varied with and chiefly constructed of curves of the utmost freedom and beauty is that appearance of exhaustless and fantastic energy which gives every cloud a marked character of its own suggesting resemblances to the specific outlines of organic objects i do not say that such accidental resemblances are a character to be imitated but merely that they bear witness to the originality and vigor of separate conception in cloud forms which give to the scenery of the sky a force and variety no less delightful than that of the changes of mountain outline in a hill district of great elevation and that there is added to this a spiritlike feeling a capricious mocking imagery of passion and life totally different from any effects of inanimate form that the earth can show   § 6 the composition of their minor curves  the minor contours out of which the larger outlines are composed are indeed beautifully curvilinear but they are never monotonous in their curves first comes a concave line then a convex one then an angular jag breaking off into spray then a downright straight line then a curve again then a deep gap and a place where all is lost and melted away and so on displaying in every inch of the form renewed and ceaseless invention setting off grace with rigidity and relieving flexibility with force in a manner scarcely less admirable and far more changeful than even in the muscular forms of the human frame nay such is the exquisite composition of all this that you may take any single fragment of any cloud in the sky and you will find it put together as if there had been a years thought over the plan of it arranged with the most studied inequalitywith the most delicate symmetrywith the most elaborate contrast a picture in itself you may try every other piece of cloud in the heaven and you will find them every one as perfect and yet not one in the least like another   § 7 their characters as given by s rosa  now it may perhaps for anything we know or have yet proved be highly expedient and proper in art that this variety individuality and angular character should be changed into a mass of convex curves each precisely like its neighbor in all respects and unbroken from beginning to endit may be highly original masterly bold whatever you choose to call it but it is false i do not take upon me to assert that the clouds which in ancient germany were more especially and peculiarly devoted to the business of catching princesses off desert islands and carrying them to enchanted castles might not have possessed something of the pillowy organization which we may suppose best adapted for functions of such delicacy and dispatch but i do mean to say that the clouds which god sends upon his earth as the ministers of dew and rain and shade and with which he adorns his heaven setting them in its vault for the thrones of his spirits have not in one instant or atom of their existence one feature in common with such conceptions and creations and there are beyond dispute more direct and unmitigated falsehoods told and more laws of nature set at open defiance in one of the rolling skies of salvator such as that marked 159 in the dulwich gallery than were ever attributed even by the ignorant and unfeeling to all the wildest flights of turner put together   § 8 monotony and falsehood of the clouds of the italian school        generally  and it is not as if the error were only occasional it is systematic and constant in all the italian masters of the seventeenth century and in most of the dutch they looked at clouds as at everything else which did not particularly help them in their great end of deception with utter carelessness and bluntness of feelingsaw that there were a great many rounded passages in themfound it much easier to sweep circles than to design beauties and sat down in their studies contented with perpetual repetitions of the same spherical conceptions having about the same relation to the clouds of nature that a childs carving of a turnip has to the head of the apollo look at the round things about the sun in the bricky claude the smallest of the three seaports in the national gallery they are a great deal more like halfcrowns than clouds take the ropy toughlooking wreath in the sacrifice of isaac and find one part of it if you can which is not the repetition of every other part of it all together being as round and vapid as the brush could draw them or take the two cauliflowerlike protuberances in no 220 of the dulwich gallery and admire the studied similarity between them you cannot tell which is which or take the socalled nicholas poussin no 212 dulwich gallery in which from the brown trees to the righthand side of the picture there is not one line which is not physically impossible   § 9 vast size of congregated masses of cloud  § 10 demonstrable by comparison with mountain ranges  but it is not the outline only which is thus systematically false the drawing of the solid form is worse still for it is to be remembered that although clouds of course arrange themselves more or less into broad masses with a light side and dark side both their light and shade are invariably composed of a series of divided masses each of which has in its outline as much variety and character as the great outline of the cloud presenting therefore a thousand times repeated all that i have described as characteristic of the general form nor are these multitudinous divisions a truth of slight importance in the character of sky for they are dependent on and illustrative of a quality which is usually in a great degree overlookedthe enormous retiring spaces of solid clouds between the illumined edge of a heaped cloud and that part of its body which turns into shadow there will generally be a clear distance of several miles more or less of course according to the general size of the cloud but in such large masses as in poussin and others of the old masters occupy the fourth or fifth of the visible sky the clear illumined breadth of vapor from the edge to the shadow involves at least a distance of five or six miles we are little apt in watching the changes of a mountainous range of cloud to reflect that the masses of vapor which compose it are huger and higher than any mountain range of the earth and the distances between mass and mass are not yards of air traversed in an instant by the flying form but valleys of changing atmosphere leagues over that the slow motion of ascending curves which we can scarcely trace is a boiling energy of exulting vapor rushing into the heaven a thousand feet in a minute and that the toppling angle whose sharp edge almost escapes notice in the multitudinous forms around it is a nodding precipice of storms 3000 feet from base to summit it is not until we have actually compared the forms of the sky with the hill ranges of the earth and seen the soaring alp overtopped and buried in one surge of the sky that we begin to conceive or appreciate the colossal scale of the phenomena of the latter but of this there can be no doubt in the mind of any one accustomed to trace the forms of clouds among hill rangesas it is there a demonstrable and evident fact that the space of vapor visibly extended over an ordinarily cloudy sky is not less from the point nearest to the observer to the horizon than twenty leagues that the size of every mass of separate form if it be at all largely divided is to be expressed in terms of miles and that every boiling heap of illuminated mist in the nearer sky is an enormous mountain fifteen or twenty thousand feet in height six or seven miles over an illuminated surface furrowed by a thousand colossal ravines torn by local tempests into peaks and promontories and changing its features with the majestic velocity of the volcano   § 11 and consequent divisions and varieties of feature  to those who have once convinced themselves of these proportions of the heaven it will be immediately evident that though we might without much violation of truth omit the minor divisions of a cloud four yards over it is the veriest audacity of falsehood to omit those of masses where for yards we have to read miles first because it is physically impossible that such a space should be without many and vast divisions secondly because divisions at such distances must be sharply and forcibly marked by aerial perspective so that not only they must be there but they must be visible and evident to the eye and thirdly because these multitudinous divisions are absolutely necessary in order to express this space and distance which cannot but be fully and imperfectly felt even with every aid and evidence that art can give of it   § 12 not lightly to be omitted  now if an artist taking for his subject a chain of vast mountains several leagues long were to unite all their varieties of ravine crag chasm and precipice into one solid unbroken mass with one light side and one dark side looking like a white ball or parallelopiped two yards broad the words breadth boldness or generalization would scarcely be received as a sufficient apology for a proceeding so glaringly false and so painfully degrading but when instead of the really large and simple forms of mountains united as they commonly are by some great principle of common organization and so closely resembling each other as often to correspond in line and join in effect when instead of this we have to do with spaces of cloud twice as vast broken up into a multiplicity of forms necessary to and characteristic of their very naturethose forms subject to a thousand local changes having no association with each other and rendered visible in a thousand places by their own transparency or cavities where the mountain forms would be lost in shadethat this far greater space and this far more complicated arrangement should be all summed up into one round mass with one swell of white and one flat side of unbroken gray is considered an evidence of the sublimest powers in the artist of generalization and breadth now it may be broad it may be grand it may be beautiful artistical and in every way desirable i dont say it is noti merely say it is a concentration of every kind of falsehood it is depriving heaven of its space clouds of their buoyancy winds of their motion and distance of its blue   § 13 imperfect conceptions of this size and extent in ancient         landscape  this is done more or less by all the old masters without an exception32 their idea of clouds was altogether similar more or less perfectly carried out according to their power of hand and accuracy of eye but universally the same in conception it was the idea of a comparatively small round puffedup white body irregularly associated with other round and puffedup white bodies each with a white light side and a gray dark side and a soft reflected light floating a great way below a blue dome such is the idea of a cloud formed by most people it is the first general uncultivated notion of what we see every day people think of the clouds as about as large as they lookforty yards over perhaps they see generally that they are solid bodies subject to the same laws as other solid bodies roundish whitish and apparently suspended a great way under a high blue concavity so that these ideas be tolerably given with smooth paint they are content and call it nature how different it is from anything that nature ever did or ever will do i have endeavored to show but i cannot and do not expect the contrast to be fully felt unless the reader will actually go out on days when either before or after rain the clouds arrange themselves into vigorous masses and after arriving at something like a conception of their distance and size from the mode in which they retire over the horizon will for himself trace and watch their varieties of form and outline as mass rises over mass in their illuminated bodies let him climb from step to step over their craggy and broken slopes let him plunge into the long vistas of immeasurable perspective that guide back to the blue sky and when he finds his imagination lost in their immensity and his senses confused with their multitude let him go to claude to salvator or to poussin and ask them for a like space or like infinity   § 14 total want of transparency and evanescence in the clouds of         ancient landscape  but perhaps the most grievous fault of all in the clouds of these painters is the utter want of transparency not in her most ponderous and lightless masses will nature ever leave us without some evidence of transmitted sunshine and she perpetually gives us passages in which the vapor becomes visible only by the sunshine which it arrests and holds within itself not caught on its surface but entangled in its massfloating fleeces precious with the gold of heaven and this translucency is especially indicated on the dark sides even of her heaviest wreaths which possess opalescent and delicate hues of partial illumination far more dependent upon the beams which pass through them than on those which are reflected upon them nothing on the contrary can be more painfully and ponderously opaque than the clouds of the old masters universally however far removed in aerial distance and however brilliant in light they never appear filmy or evanescent and their light is always on them not in them and this effect is much increased by the positive and persevering determination on the part of their outlines not to be broken in upon nor interfered with in the slightest degree by any presumptuous blue or impertinent winds there is no inequality no variation no losing or disguising of line no melting into nothingness nor shattering into spray edge succeeds edge with imperturbable equanimity and nothing short of the most decided interference on the part of treetops or the edge of the picture prevents us from being able to follow them all the way round like the coast of an island   § 15 farther proof of their deficiency in space  § 16 instance of perfect truth in the sky of turners babylon  and be it remembered that all these faults and deficiencies are to be found in their drawing merely of the separate masses of the solid cumulus the easiest drawn of all clouds but nature scarcely ever confines herself to such masses they form but the thousandth part of her variety of effect she builds up a pyramid of their boiling volumes bars this across like a mountain with the gray cirrus envelops it in black ragged drifting vapor covers the open part of the sky with mottled horizontal fields breaks through these with sudden and long sunbeams tears up their edges with local winds scatters over the gaps of blue the infinity of multitude of the high cirri and melts even the unoccupied azure into palpitating shades and all this is done over and over again in every quarter of a mile where poussin or claude have three similar masses nature has fifty pictures made up each of millions of minor thoughtsfifty aisles penetrating through angelic chapels to the shechinah of the bluefifty hollow ways among bewildered hillseach with their own nodding rocks and cloven precipices and radiant summits and robing vapors but all unlike each other except in beauty all bearing witness to the unwearied exhaustless operation of the infinite mind now in cases like these especially as we observed before of general nature though it is altogether hopeless to follow out in the space of any one picture this incalculable and inconceivable glory yet the painter can at least see that the space he has at his command narrow and confined as it is is made complete use of and that no part of it shall be without entertainment and food for thought if he could subdivide it by millionths of inches he could not reach the multitudinous majesty of nature but it is at least incumbent upon him to make the most of what he has and not by exaggerating the proportions banishing the variety and repeating the forms of his clouds to set at defiance the eternal principles of the heavensfitfulness and infinity and now let us keeping in memory what we have seen of poussin and salvator take up one of turners skies and see whether he is as narrow in his conception or as niggardly in his space it does not matter which we take his sublime babylon33 is a fair example for our present purpose ten miles away down the euphrates where it gleams last along the plain he gives us a drift of dark elongated vapor melting beneath into a dim haze which embraces the hills on the horizon it is exhausted with its own motion and broken up by the wind in its own body into numberless groups of billowy and tossing fragments which beaten by the weight of storm down to the earth are just lifting themselves again on wearied wings and perishing in the effort above these and far beyond them the eye goes back to a broad sea of white illuminated mist or rather cloud melted into rain and absorbed again before that rain has fallen but penetrated throughout whether it be vapor or whether it be dew with soft sunshine turning it as white as snow gradually as it rises the rainy fusion ceases you cannot tell where the film of blue on the left beginsbut it is deepening deepening stilland the cloud with its edge first invisible then all but imaginary then just felt when the eye is not fixed on it and lost when it is at last rises keen from excessive distance but soft and mantling in its body as a swans bosom fretted by faint wind heaving fitfully against the delicate deep blue with white waves whose forms are traced by the pale lines of opalescent shadow shade only because the light is within it and not upon it and which break with their own swiftness into a driven line of level spray winnowed into threads by the wind and flung before the following vapor like those swift shafts of arrowy water which a great cataract shoots into the air beside it trying to find the earth beyond these again rises a colossal mountain of gray cumulus through whose shadowed sides the sunbeams penetrate in dim sloping rainlike shafts and over which they fall in a broad burst of streaming light sinking to the earth and showing through their own visible radiance the three successive ranges of hills which connect its desolate plain with space above the edgy summit of the cumulus broken into fragments recedes into the sky which is peopled in its serenity with quiet multitudes of the white soft silent cirrus and under these again drift near the zenith disturbed and impatient shadows of a darker spirit seeking rest and finding none   § 17 and in his pools of solomon  now this is nature it is the exhaustless living energy with which the universe is filled and what will you set beside it of the works of other men show me a single picture in the whole compass of ancient art in which i can pass from cloud to cloud from region to region from first to second and third heaven as i can here and you may talk of turners want of truth turn to the pools of solomon and walk through the passages of mist as they melt on the one hand into those stormy fragments of fiery cloud or on the other into the cold solitary shadows that compass the sweeping hill and when you find an inch without air and transparency and a hairbreadth without changefulness and thought and when you can count the torn waves of tossing radiance that gush from the sun as you can count the fixed white insipidities of claude or when you can measure the modulation and the depth of that hollow mist as you can the flourishes of the brush upon the canvas of salvator talk of turners want of truth  but let us take up simpler and less elaborate works for there is too much in these to admit of being analyzed   § 18 truths of outline and character in his como  in the vignette of the lake of como in rogerss italy the space is so small that the details have been partially lost by the engraver but enough remain to illustrate the great principles of cloud from which we have endeavored to explain observe first the general angular outline of the volumes on the left of the sun if you mark the points where the direction of their outline changes and connect those points by right lines the cloud will touch but will not cut those lines throughout yet its contour is as graceful as it is full of charactertoppling ready to changefragile as enormousevanescent as colossal observe how where it crosses the line of the sun it becomes luminous illustrating what has been observed of the visibility of mist in sunlight observe above all the multiplicity of its solid form the depth of its shadows in perpetual transition it is not round and swelled half light and half dark but full of breaking irregular shadow and transparencyvariable as the wind and melting imperceptibly above into the haziness of the sunlighted atmosphere contrasted in all its vast forms with the delicacy and the multitude of the brightly touched cirri nothing can surpass the truth of this the cloud is as gigantic in its simplicity as the alp which it opposes but how various how transparent how infinite in its organization   § 19 association of the cirrostratus with the cumulus  i would draw especial attention both here and in all other works of turner to the beautiful use of the low horizontal bars or fields of cloud cirrostratus which associate themselves so frequentlymore especially before stormswith the true cumulus floating on its flanks or capping it as if it were a mountain and seldom mingling with its substance unless in the very formation of rain they supply us with one of those beautiful instances of natural composition by which the artist is superseded and excelledfor by the occurrence of these horizontal flakes the rolling form of the cumulus is both opposed in its principal lines and gifted with an apparent solidity and vastness which no other expedient could have exhibited and which far exceed in awfulness the impression of the noblest mountains of the earth i have seen in the evening light of italy the alps themselves outtowered by ranges of these mighty clouds alternately white in the starlight and inhabited by fire   § 20 the deepbased knowledge of the alps in turners lake of geneva  turn back to the first vignette in the italy the angular outlines and variety of modulation in the clouds above the sail and the delicate atmosphere of morning into which they are dissolved about the breathing hills require no comment but one part of this vignette demands especial notice it is the repetition of the outline of the snowy mountain by the light cloud above it the cause of this i have already explained vide page 228 and its occurrence here is especially valuable as bearing witness to the thorough and scientific knowledge thrown by turner into his slightest works the thing cannot be seen once in six months it would not have been noticed much less introduced by an ordinary artist and to the public it is a dead letter or an offence ninetynine persons in a hundred would not have observed this pale wreath of parallel cloud above the hill and the hundredth in all probability says it is unnatural it requires the most intimate and accurate knowledge of the alps before such a piece of refined truth can be understood   § 21 further principles of cloud form exemplified in his amalfi  at the 216th page we have another and a new case in which clouds in perfect repose unaffected by wind or any influence but that of their own elastic force boil rise and melt in the heaven with more approach to globular form than under any other circumstances is possible i name this vignette not only because it is most remarkable for the buoyancy and elasticity of inward energy indicated through the most ponderous forms and affords us a beautiful instance of the junction of the cirrostratus with the cumulus of which we have just been speaking § 19 but because it is a characteristic example of turners use of one of the facts of nature not hitherto noticed that the edge of a partially transparent body is often darker than its central surface because at the edge the light penetrates and passes through which from the centre is reflected to the eye the sharp cutting edge of a wave if not broken into foam frequently appears for an instant almost black and the outlines of these massy clouds where their projecting forms rise in relief against the light of their bodies are almost always marked clearly and firmly by very dark edges hence we have frequently if not constantly multitudinous forms indicated only by outline giving character and solidity to the great masses of light without taking away from their breadth and turner avails himself of these boldly and constantlyoutlining forms with the brush of which no other indication is given all the grace and solidity of the white cloud on the righthand side of the vignette before us depends upon such outlines   § 22 reasons for insisting on the infinity of turners works         infinity is almost an unerring test of all truth  as i before observed of mere execution that one of the best tests of its excellence was the expression of infinity so it may be noticed with respect to the painting of details generally that more difference lies between one artist and another in the attainment of this quality than in any other of the efforts of art and that if we wish without reference to beauty of composition or any other interfering circumstances to form a judgment of the truth of painting perhaps the very first thing we should look for whether in one thing or anotherfoliage or clouds or wavesshould be the expression of infinity always and everywhere in all parts and divisions of parts for we may be quite sure that what is not infinite cannot be true it does not indeed follow that what is infinite always is true but it cannot be altogether false for this simple reason that it is impossible for mortal mind to compose an infinity of any kind for itself or to form an idea of perpetual variation and to avoid all repetition merely by its own combining resources the moment that we trust to ourselves we repeat ourselves and therefore the moment we see in a work of any kind whatsoever the expression of infinity we may be certain that the workman has gone to nature for it while on the other hand the moment we see repetition or want of infinity we may be certain that the workman has not gone to nature for it   § 23 instances of the total want of it in the works of salvator  § 24 and of the universal presence of it in those of turner the         conclusions which may be arrived at from it  § 25 the multiplication of objects or increase of their size will not         give the impression of infinity but is the resource of novices  for instance in the picture of salvator before noticed no 220 in the dulwich gallery as we see at once that the two masses of cloud absolutely repeat each other in every one of their forms and that each is composed of about twelve white sweeps of the brush all forming the same curve and all of the same length and as we can count these and measure their common diameter and by stating the same to anybody else convey to him a full and perfect idea and knowledge of that sky in all its parts and proportionsas we can do this we may be absolutely certain without reference to the real sky or to any other part of nature without even knowing what the white things were intended for we may be certain that they cannot possibly resemble anything that whatever they were meant for they can be nothing but a violent contradiction of all natures principles and forms when on the other hand we take up such a sky as that of turners rouen seen from st catherines hill in the rivers of france and find in the first place that he has given us a distance over the hills in the horizon into which when we are tired of penetrating we must turn and come back again there being not the remotest chance of getting to the end of it and when we see that from this measureless distance up to the zenith the whole sky is one ocean of alternate waves of cloud and light so blended together that the eye cannot rest on any one without being guided to the next and so to a hundred more till it is lost over and over again in every wreaththat if it divides the sky into quarters of inches and tries to count or comprehend the component parts of any single one of those divisions it is still as utterly defied and defeated by the part as by the wholethat there is not one line out of the millions there which repeats another not one which is unconnected with another not one which does not in itself convey histories of distance and space and suggest new and changeful form then we may be all but certain though these forms are too mysterious and too delicate for us to analyzethough all is so crowded and so connected that it is impossible to test any single part by particular lawsyet without any such tests we may be sure that this infinity can only be based on truththat it must be nature because man could not have originated it and that every form must be faithful because none is like another and therefore it is that i insist so constantly on this great quality of landscape painting as it appears in turner because it is not merely a constant and most important truth in itself but it almost amounts to a demonstration of every other truth and it will be found a far rarer attainment in the works of other men than is commonly supposed and the sign wherever it is really found of the very highest art for we are apt to forget that the greatest number is no nearer infinity than the least if it be definite number and the vastest bulk is no nearer infinity than the most minute if it be definite bulk so that a man may multiply his objects forever and ever and be no nearer infinity than he had reached with one if he do not vary them and confuse them and a man may reach infinity in every touch and line and part and unit if in these he be truthfully various and obscure and we shall find the more we examine the works of the old masters that always and in all parts they are totally wanting in every feeling of infinity and therefore in all truth and even in the works of the moderns though the aim is far more just we shall frequently perceive an erroneous choice of means and a substitution of mere number or bulk for real infinity   § 26 farther instances of infinity in the gray skies of turner  and therefore in concluding our notice of the central cloud region i should wish to dwell particularly on those skies of turners in which we have the whole space of the heaven covered with the delicate dim flakes of gathering vapor which are the intermediate link between the central region and that of the raincloud and which assemble and grow out of the air shutting up the heaven with a gray interwoven veil before the approach of storm faint but universal letting the light of the upper sky pass pallidly through their body but never rending a passage for the ray we have the first approach and gathering of this kind of sky most gloriously given in the vignette at page 115 of rogerss italy which is one of the most perfect pieces of feeling if i may transgress my usual rules for an instant extant in art owing to the extreme grandeur and stern simplicity of the strange and ominous forms of level cloud behind the building in that at page 223 there are passages of the same kind of exceeding perfection the sky through which the dawn is breaking in the voyage of columbus and that with the moonlight under the rialto in rogerss poems the skies of the bethlehem and the pyramids in findens bible series and among the academy pictures that of the hero and leander and flight into egypt are characteristic and noble examples as far as any individual works can be characteristic of the universality of this mighty mind i ought not to forget the magnificent solemnity and fulness of the wreaths of gathering darkness in the folkestone   § 27 the excellence of the clouddrawing of stanfield  § 28 the average standing of the english school  we must not pass from the consideration of the central cloud region without noticing the general high quality of the clouddrawing of stanfield he is limited in his range and is apt in extensive compositions to repeat himself neither is he ever very refined but his cloudform is firmly and fearlessly chiselled with perfect knowledge though usually with some want of feeling as far as it goes it is very grand and very tasteful beautifully developed in the space of its solid parts and full of action next to turner he is incomparably the noblest master of cloudform of all our artists in fact he is the only one among them who really can draw a cloud for it is a very different thing to rub out an irregular white space neatly with the handkerchief or to leave a bright little bit of paper in the middle of a wash and to give the real anatomy of cloudform with perfect articulation of chiaroscuro we have multitudes of painters who can throw a light bit of straggling vapor across their sky or leave in it delicate and tender passages of breaking light but this is a very different thing from taking up each of those bits or passages and giving it structure and parts and solidity the eye is satisfied with exceedingly little as an indication of cloud and a few clever sweeps of the brush on wet paper may give all that it requires but this is not drawing clouds nor will it ever appeal fully and deeply to the mind except when it occurs only as a part of a higher system and there is not one of our modern artists except stanfield who can do much more than this as soon as they attempt to lay detail upon their clouds they appear to get bewildered forget that they are dealing with forms regulated by precisely the same simple laws of light and shade as more substantial matter overcharge their color confuse their shadows and dark sides and end in mere ragged confusion i believe the evil arises from their never attempting to render clouds except with the brush other objects at some period of study they take up with the chalk or lead and so learn something of their form but they appear to consider clouds as altogether dependent on cobalt and camels hair and so never understand anything of their real anatomy but whatever the cause i cannot point to any central clouds of the moderns except those of turner and stanfield as really showing much knowledge of or feeling for nature though all are superior to the conventional and narrow conceptions of the ancients we are all right as far as we go our work may be incomplete but it is not false and it is far better far less injurious to the mind that we should be little attracted to the sky and taught to be satisfied with a light suggestion of truthful form than that we should be drawn to it by violently pronounced outline and intense color to find in its finished falsehood everything to displease or to misleadto hurt our feelings if we have foundation for them and corrupt them if we have none   footnotes    32 here i include even the great oneseven titian and     veroneseexcepting only tintoret and the religious schools    33 engraved in findels bible illustrations                                      chapter iv          of truth of clouds thirdly of the region of the raincloud   § 1 the apparent difference in character between the lower and central        clouds is dependent chiefly on proximity  the clouds which i wish to consider as characteristic of the lower or rainy region differ not so much in their real nature from those of the central and uppermost regions as in appearance owing to their greater nearness for the central clouds and perhaps even the high cirri deposit moisture if not distinctly rain as is sufficiently proved by the existence of snow on the highest peaks of the himaleh and when on any such mountains we are brought into close contact with the central clouds34 we find them little differing from the ordinary raincloud of the plains except by being slightly less dense and dark but the apparent differences dependent on proximity are most marked and important   § 2 their marked difference in color  in the first place the clouds of the central region have as has been before observed pure and aerial grays for their dark sides owing to their necessary distance from the observer and as this distance permits a multitude of local phenomena capable of influencing color such as accidental sunbeams refractions transparencies or local mists and showers to be collected into a space comparatively small the colors of these clouds are always changeful and palpitating and whatever degree of gray or of gloom may be mixed with them is invariably pure and aerial but the nearness of the raincloud rendering it impossible for a number of phenomena to be at once visible makes its hue of gray monotonous and by losing the blue of distance warm and brown compared to that of the upper clouds this is especially remarkable on any part of it which may happen to be illumined which is of a brown bricky ochreous tone never bright always coming in dark outline on the lights of the central clouds but it is seldom that this takes place and when it does never over large spaces little being usually seen of the raincloud but its under and dark side this when the cloud above is dense becomes of an inky and cold gray and sulphureous and lurid if there be thunder in the air   § 3 and in definiteness of form  § 4 they are subject to precisely the same great laws  with these striking differences in color it presents no fewer nor less important in form chiefly from losing almost all definiteness of character and outline it is sometimes nothing more than a thin mist whose outline cannot be traced rendering the landscape locally indistinct or dark if its outline be visible it is ragged and torn rather a spray of cloud taken off its edge and sifted by the wind than an edge of the cloud itself in fact it rather partakes of the nature and assumes the appearance of real water in the state of spray than of elastic vapor this appearance is enhanced by the usual presence of formed rain carried along with it in a columnar form ordinarily of course reaching the ground like a veil but very often suspended with the cloud and hanging from it like a jagged fringe or over it in light rain being always lighter than the cloud it falls from these columns or fringes of rain are often waved and bent by the wind or twisted sometimes even swept upwards from the cloud the velocity of these vapors though not necessarily in reality greater than that of the central clouds appears greater owing to their proximity and of course also to the usual presence of a more violent wind they are also apparently much more in the power of the wind having less elastic force in themselves but they are precisely subject to the same great laws of form which regulate the upper clouds they are not solid bodies borne about with the wind but they carry the wind with them and cause it every one knows who has ever been out in a storm that the time when it rains heaviest is precisely the time when he cannot hold up his umbrella that the wind is carried with the cloud and lulls when it has passed every one who has ever seen rain in a hill country knows that a raincloud like any other may have all its parts in rapid motion and yet as a whole remain in one spot i remember once when in crossing the tête noire i had turned up the valley towards trient i noticed a raincloud forming on the glacier de trient with a west wind it proceeded towards the col de balme being followed by a prolonged wreath of vapor always forming exactly at the same spot over the glacier this long serpentlike line of cloud went on at a great rate till it reached the valley leading down from the col de balme under the slate rocks of the croix de fer there it turned sharp round and came down this valley at right angles to its former progress and finally directly contrary to it till it came down within five hundred feet of the village where it disappeared the line behind always advancing and always disappearing at the same spot this continued for half an hour the long line describing the curve of a horseshoe always coming into existence and always vanishing at exactly the same places traversing the space between with enormous swiftness this cloud ten miles off would have looked like a perfectly motionless wreath in the form of a horseshoe hanging over the hills   § 5 value to the painter of the raincloud  § 6 the old masters have not left a single instance of the painting of        the raincloud and very few efforts at it gaspar poussins        storms  to the region of the raincloud belong also all those phenomena of drifted smoke heathaze local mists in the morning or evening in valleys or over water mirage white steaming vapor rising in evaporation from moist and open surfaces and everything which visibly affects the condition of the atmosphere without actually assuming the form of cloud these phenomena are as perpetual in all countries as they are beautiful and afford by far the most effective and valuable means which the painter possesses for modification of the forms of fixed objects the upper clouds are distinct and comparatively opaque they do not modify but conceal but through the raincloud and its accessory phenomena all that is beautiful may be made manifest and all that is hurtful concealed what is paltry may be made to look vast and what is ponderous aerial mystery may be obtained without obscurity and decoration without disguise and accordingly nature herself uses it constantly as one of her chief means of most perfect effect not in one country nor another but everywhereeverywhere at least where there is anything worth calling landscape i cannot answer for the desert of the sahara but i know that there can be no greater mistake than supposing that delicate and variable effects of mist and raincloud are peculiar to northern climates i have never seen in any place or country effects of mist more perfect than in the campagna of rome and among the hills of sorrento it is therefore matter of no little marvel to me and i conceive that it can scarcely be otherwise to any reflecting person that throughout the whole range of ancient landscape art there occurs no instance of the painting of a real raincloud still less of any of the more delicate phenomena characteristic of the region storms indeed as the innocent public persist in calling such abuses of nature and abortions of art as the two windy gaspars in our national gallery are common enough massive concretions of ink and indigo wrung and twisted very hard apparently in a vain effort to get some moisture out of them bearing up courageously and successfully against a wind whose effects on the trees in the foreground can be accounted for only on the supposition that they are all of the indiarubber species enough of this in all conscience we have and to spare but for the legitimate raincloud with its ragged and spraylike edge its veilly transparency and its columnar burden of blessing neither it nor anything like it or approaching it occurs in any painting of the old masters that i have ever seen and i have seen enough to warrant my affirming that if it occur anywhere it must be through accident rather than intention nor is there stronger evidence of any perception on the part of these much respected artists that there were such things in the world as mists or vapors if a cloud under their direction ever touches a mountain it does it effectually and as if it meant to do it there is no mystifying the matter here is a cloud and there is a hill if it is to come on at all it comes on to some purpose and there is no hope of its ever going off again we have therefore little to say of the efforts of the old masters in any scenes which might naturally have been connected with the clouds of the lowest region except that the faults of form specified in considering the central clouds are by way of being energetic or sublime more glaringly and audaciously committed in their storms and that what is a wrong form among clouds possessing form is there given with increased generosity of fiction to clouds which have no form at all   § 7 the great power of the moderns in this respect  § 8 works of copley fielding  § 9 his peculiar truth  § 10 his weakness and its probable cause  supposing that we had nothing to show in modern art of the region of the raincloud but the dash of cox the blot of de wint or even the ordinary stormy skies of the body of our inferior watercolor painters we might yet laugh all efforts of the old masters to utter scorn but one among our watercolor artists deserves especial noticebefore we ascend the steps of the solitary throneas having done in his peculiar walk what for faithful and pure truth truth indeed of a limited range and unstudied application but yet most faithful and most pure will remain unsurpassed if not unrivalledcopley fielding we are well aware how much of what he has done depends in a great degree upon particular tricks of execution or on a labor somewhat too mechanical to be meritorious that it is rather the texture than the plan of his sky which is to be admired and that the greater part of what is pleasurable in it will fall rather under the head of dexterous imitation than of definite thought but whatever detractions from his merit we may be compelled to make on these grounds in considering art as the embodying of beauty or the channel of mind it is impossible when we are speaking of truth only to pass by his down scenes and moorland showers of some years ago in which he produced some of the most perfect and faultless passages of mist and raincloud which art has ever seen wet transparent formless full of motion felt rather by their shadows on the hills than by their presence in the sky becoming dark only through increased depth of space most translucent where most sombre and light only through increased buoyancy of motion letting the blue through their interstices and the sunlight through their chasms with the irregular playfulness and traceless gradation of nature herself his skies will remain as long as their colors stand among the most simple unadulterated and complete transcripts of a particular nature which art can point to had he painted five instead of five hundred such and gone on to other sources of beauty he might there can be little doubt have been one of our greatest artists but it often grieves us to see how his power is limited to a particular moment to that easiest moment for imitation when knowledge of form may be superseded by management of the brush and the judgment of the colorist by the manufacture of a color the moment when all form is melted down and drifted away in the descending veil of rain and when the variable and fitful colors of the heaven are lost in the monotonous gray of its storm tones35 we can only account for this by supposing that there is something radically wrong in his method of study for a man of his evident depth of feeling and pure love of truth ought not to be cannot be except from some strange error in his mode of outofdoor practice thus limited in his range and liable to decline of power we have little doubt that almost all such failures arise from the artists neglecting the use of the chalk and supposing that either the power of drawing forms or the sense of their beauty can be maintained unweakened or unblunted without constant and laborious studies in simple light and shade of form only the brush is at once the artists greatest aid and enemy it enables him to make his power available but at the same time it undermines his power and unless it be constantly rejected for the pencil never can be rightly used but whatever the obstacle be we do not doubt that it is one which once seen may be overcome or removed and we are in the constant hope of seeing this finelyminded artist shake off his lethargy break the shackles of habit seek in extended and right study the sources of real power and become what we have full faith in his capability of being one of the leading artists of his time   § 11 impossibility of reasoning on the rainclouds of turner from         engravings  in passing to the works of our greatest modern master it must be premised that the qualities which constitute a most essential part of the truth of the raincloud are in no degree to be rendered by engraving its indefiniteness of torn and transparent form is far beyond the power of even our best engravers i do not say beyond their possible power if they would make themselves artists as well as workmen but far beyond the power they actually possess while the depth and delicacy of the grays which turner employs or produces as well as the refinement of his execution are in the nature of things utterly beyond all imitation by the opaque and lifeless darkness of the steel what we say of his works therefore must be understood as referring only to the original drawings though we may name one or two instances in which the engraver has to a certain degree succeeded in distantly following the intention of the master   § 12 his rendering of fieldings particular moment in the jumieges  § 13 illustration of the nature of clouds in the opposed forms of smoke         and steam  jumieges in the rivers of france ought perhaps after what we have said of fielding to be our first object of attention because it is a rendering by turner of fieldings particular moment and the only one existing for turner never repeats himself one picture is allotted to one truth the statement is perfectly and gloriously made and he passes on to speak of a fresh portion of gods revelation36 the haze of sunlit rain of this most magnificent picture the gradual retirement of the dark wood into its depth and the sparkling and evanescent light which sends its variable flashes on the abbey figures foliage and foam require no commentthey speak home at once but there is added to this noble composition an incident which may serve us at once for a farther illustration of the nature and forms of cloud and for a final proof how deeply and philosophically turner has studied them  we have on the right of the picture the steam and the smoke of a passing steamboat now steam is nothing but an artificial cloud in the process of dissipation it is as much a cloud as those of the sky itself that is a quantity of moisture rendered visible in the air by imperfect solution accordingly observe how exquisitely irregular and broken are its forms how sharp and spraylike but with all the facts observed which were pointed out in chap ii of this section the convex side to the wind the sharp edge on that side the other soft and lost smoke on the contrary is an actual substance existing independently in the air a solid opaque body subject to no absorption nor dissipation but that of tenuity observe its volumes there is no breaking up nor disappearing here the wind carries its elastic globes before it but does not dissolve nor break them37 equally convex and void of angles on all sides they are the exact representatives of the clouds of the old masters and serve at once to show the ignorance and falsehood of these latter and the accuracy of study which has guided turner to the truth   § 14 moment of retiring rain in the llanthony  from this picture we should pass to the llanthony38 which is the rendering of the moment immediately following that given in the jumieges the shower is here half exhausted half passed by the last drops are rattling faintly through the glimmering hazel boughs the white torrent swelled by the sudden storm flings up its hasty jets of springing spray to meet the returning light and these as if the heaven regretted what it had given and were taking it back pass as they leap into vapor and fall not again but vanish in the shafts of the sunlight39hurrying fitful windwoven sunlightwhich glides through the thick leaves and paces along the pale rocks like rain half conquering half quenched by the very mists which it summons itself from the lighted pastures as it passes and gathers out of the drooping herbage and from the streaming crags sending them with messages of peace to the far summits of the yet unveiled mountains whose silence is still broken by the sound of the rushing rain   § 15 and of commencing chosen with peculiar meaning for loch coriskin  with this noble work we should compare one of which we can better judge by the engravingthe loch coriskin in the illustrations to scott because it introduces us to another and a most remarkable instance of the artists vast and varied knowledge when rain falls on a mountain composed chiefly of barren rocks their surfaces being violently heated by the sun whose most intense warmth always precedes rain occasion sudden and violent evaporation actually converting the first shower into steam consequently upon all such hills on the commencement of rain white volumes of vapor are instantaneously and universally formed which rise are absorbed by the atmosphere and again descend in rain to rise in fresh volumes until the surfaces of the hills are cooled where there is grass or vegetation this effect is diminished where there is foliage it scarcely takes place at all now this effect has evidently been especially chosen by turner for loch coriskin not only because it enabled him to relieve its jagged forms with veiling vapor but to tell the tale which no pencilling could the story of its utter absolute barrenness of unlichened dead desolated rock

again we see the absolute necessity of scientific and entire acquaintance with nature before this great artist can be understood that which to the ignorant is little more than an unnatural and meaningless confusion of steamlike vapor is to the experienced such a full and perfect expression of the character of the spot as no means of art could have otherwise given   § 16 the drawing of transparent vapor in the lands end  § 17 the individual character of its parts  in the long ships lighthouse lands end we have clouds without rainat twilightenveloping the cliffs of the coast but concealing nothing every outline being visible through their gloom and not only the outlinefor it is easy to do thisbut the surface the bank of rocky coast approaches the spectator inch by inch felt clearer and clearer as it withdraws from the garment of cloudnot by edges more and more defined but by a surface more and more unveiled we have thus the painting not of a mere transparent veil but of a solid body of cloud every inch of whose increasing distance is marked and felt but the great wonder of the picture is the intensity of gloom which is attained in pure warm gray without either blackness or blueness it is a gloom dependent rather on the enormous space and depth indicated than on actual pitch of color distant by real drawing without a grain of blue dark by real substance without a stroke of blackness and with all this it is not formless but full of indications of character wild irregular shattered and indefinitefull of the energy of storm fiery in haste and yet flinging back out of its motion the fitful swirls of bounding drift of tortured vapor tossed up like mens hands as in defiance of the tempest the jets of resulting whirlwind hurled back from the rocks into the face of the coming darkness which beyond all other characters mark the raised passion of the elements it is this untraceable unconnected yet perpetual formthis fulness of character absorbed in the universal energywhich distinguish nature and turner from all their imitators to roll a volume of smoke before the wind to indicate motion or violence by monotonous similarity of line and direction is for the multitude but to mark the independent passion the tumultuous separate existence of every wreath of writhing vapor yet swept away and overpowered by one omnipotence of storm and thus to bid us                 be as a presence or a motionone                 among the many therewhile the mists                 flying and rainy vapors call out shapes                 and phantoms

raincloud in the coventry  § 19 compared with forms given by salvator  the drawing of coventry may be particularized as a farther example of this fine suggestion of irregularity and fitfulness through very constant parallelism of direction both in rain and clouds the great mass of cloud which traverses the whole picture is characterized throughout by severe right lines nearly parallel with each other into which every one of its wreaths has a tendency to range itself but no one of these right lines is actually and entirely parallel to any other though all have a certain tendency more or less defined in each which impresses the mind with the most distinct idea of parallelism neither are any of the lines actually straight and unbroken on the contrary they are all made up of the most exquisite and varied curves and it is the imagined line which joins the apices of thesea tangent to them all which is in reality straight40 they are suggested not represented right lines but the whole volume of cloud is visibly and totally bounded by them and in consequence its whole body is felt to be dragged out and elongated by the force of the tempest which it carries with it and every one of its wreaths to be as was before explained not so much something borne before or by the wind as the visible form and presence of the wind itself we could not possibly point out a more magnificent piece of drawing as a contrast to such works of salvator as that before alluded to 159 dulwich gallery both are rolling masses of connected cloud but in turners there is not one curve that repeats another nor one curve in itself monotonous nor without character and yet every part and portion of the cloud is rigidly subjected to the same forward fierce inevitable influence of storm in salvators every curve repeats its neighbor every curve is monotonous in itself and yet the whole cloud is curling about hither and thither evidently without the slightest notion where it is going to and unregulated by any general influence whatsoever i could not bring together two finer or more instructive examples the one of everything that is perfect the other of everything that is childish or abominable in the representation of the same facts   § 20 entire expression of tempest by minute touches and circumstances         in the coventry  but there is yet more to be noticed in this noble sky of turners not only are the lines of the rolling cloud thus irregular in their parallelism but those of the falling rain are equally varied in their direction indicating the gusty changefulness of the wind and yet kept so straight and stern in their individual descent that we are not suffered to forget its strength this impression is still farther enhanced by the drawing of the smoke which blows every way at once yet turning perpetually in each of its swirls back in the direction of the wind but so suddenly and violently as almost to assume the angular lines of lightning farther to complete the impression be it observed that all the cattle both upon the near and distant hillside have left off grazing and are standing stock still and stiff with their heads down and their backs to the wind and finally that we may be told not only what the storm is but what it has been the gutter at the side of the road is gushing in a complete torrent and particular attention is directed to it by the full burst of light in the sky being brought just above it so that all its waves are bright with the reflection   § 21 especially by contrast with a passage of extreme repose  but i have not quite done with this noble picture yet impetuous clouds twisted rain flickering sunshine fleeting shadow gushing water and oppressed cattle all speak the same story of tumult fitfulness power and velocity only one thing is wanted a passage of repose to contrast with it all and it is given high and far above the dark volumes of the swift raincloud are seen on the left through their opening the quiet horizontal silent flakes of the highest cirrus resting in the repose of the deep sky of all else that we have noticed in this drawing some faint idea can be formed from the engraving but not the slightest of the delicate and soft forms of these pausing vapors and still less of the exquisite depth and palpitating tenderness of the blue with which they are islanded engravers indeed invariably lose the effect of all passages of cold color under the mistaken idea that it is to be kept pale in order to indicate distance whereas it ought commonly to be darker than the rest of the sky   § 22 the truth of this particular passage perfectly pure blue sky only         seen after rain and how seen  § 23 absence of this effect in the works of the old masters  to appreciate the full truth of this passage we must understand another effect peculiar to the raincloud that its openings exhibit the purest blue which the sky ever shows for as we saw in the first chapter of this section that aqueous vapor always turns the sky more or less gray it follows that we never can see the azure so intense as when the greater part of this vapor has just fallen in rain then and then only pure blue sky becomes visible in the first openings distinguished especially by the manner in which the clouds melt into it their edges passing off in faint white threads and fringes through which the blue shines more and more intensely till the last trace of vapor is lost in its perfect color it is only the upper white clouds however which do this or the last fragments of rainclouds becoming white as they disappear so that the blue is never corrupted by the cloud but only paled and broken with pure white the purest white which the sky ever shows thus we have a melting and palpitating color never the same for two inches together deepening and broadening here and there into intensity of perfect azure then drifted and dying away through every tone of pure pale sky into the snow white of the filmy cloud over this roll the determined edges of the rainclouds throwing it all far back as a retired scene into the upper sky of this effect the old masters as far as i remember have taken no cognizance whatsoever all with them is as we partially noticed before either white cloud or pure blue they have no notion of any doubledealing or middle measures they bore a hole in the sky and let you up into a pool of deep stagnant blue marked off by the clear round edges of imperturbable impenetrable cloud on all sidesbeautiful in positive color but totally destitute of that exquisite gradation and change that fleeting panting hesitating effort with which the first glance of the natural sky is shed through the turbulence of the earthstorm   § 24 success of our watercolor artists in its rendering use of it by         turner  they have some excuse however for not attempting this in the nature of their material as one accidental dash of the brush with watercolor on a piece of wet or damp paper will come nearer the truth and transparency of this rainblue than the labor of a day in oils and the purity and felicity of some of the careless melting watercolor skies of cox and tayler may well make us fastidious in all effects of this kind it is however only in the drawings of turner that we have this perfect transparency and variation of blue given in association with the perfection of considered form in tayler and cox the forms are always partially accidental and unconsidered often essentially bad and always incomplete in turner the dash of the brush is as completely under the rule of thought and feeling as its slowest line all that it does is perfect and could not be altered even in a hairbreadth without injury in addition to this peculiar management and execution are used in obtaining quality in the color itself totally different from the manipulation of any other artist and none who have ever spent so much as one hour of their lives over his drawing can forget those dim passages of dreamy blue barred and severed with a thousand delicate and soft and snowy forms which gleaming in their patience of hope between the troubled rushing of the racked earthcloud melt farther and farther back into the height of heaven until the eye is bewildered and the heart lost in the intensity of their peace i do not say that this is beautifuli do not say it is ideal nor refinedi only ask you to watch for the first opening of the clouds after the next south rain and tell me if it be not true   § 25 expression of near raincloud in the gosport and other works  § 26 contrasted with gaspar poussins raincloud in the dido and Æneas  the gosport affords us an instance more exquisite even than the passage above named in the coventry of the use of this melting and dewy blue accompanied by two distances of raincloud one towering over the horizon seen blue with excessive distance through crystal atmosphere the other breaking overhead in the warm sulphurous fragments of spray whose loose and shattering transparency being the most essential characteristic of the near raincloud is precisely that which the old masters are sure to contradict look for instance at the wreaths of cloud in the dido and Æneas of gaspar poussin with their unpleasant edges cut as hard and solid and opaque and smooth as thick black paint can make them rolled up over one another like a dirty sail badly reefed or look at the agreeable transparency and variety of the cloudedge where it cuts the mountain in n poussins phocion and compare this with the wreaths which float across the precipice in the second vignette in campbell or which gather around the ben lomond the white rain gleaming beneath their dark transparent shadows or which drift up along the flanks of the wooded hills called from the river by the morning light in the oakhampton or which island the crags of snowdon in the llanberis or melt along the cumberland hills while turner leads us across the sands of morecambe bay this last drawing deserves especial notice it is of an evening in spring when the south rain has ceased at sunset and through the lulled and golden air the confused and fantastic mists float up along the hollows of the mountains white and pure the resurrection in spirit of the newfallen rain catching shadows from the precipices and mocking the dark peaks with their own mountainlike but melting forms till the solid mountains seem in motion like those waves of cloud emerging and vanishing as the weak wind passes by their summits while the blue level night advances along the sea and the surging breakers leap up to catch the last light from the path of the sunset  illustration okehampton castle                  from a painting by turner   § 27 turners power of rendering mist  § 28 his effects of mist so perfect that if not at once understood         they can no more be explained or reasoned on than nature         herself  i need not however insist upon turners peculiar power of rendering mist and all those passages of intermediate mystery between earth and air when the mountain is melting into the cloud or the horizon into the twilight because his supremacy in these points is altogether undisputed except by persons to whom it would be impossible to prove anything which did not fall under the form of a rule of three nothing is more natural than that the studied form and color of this great artist should be little understood because they require for the full perception of their meaning and truth such knowledge and such time as not one in a thousand possesses or can bestow but yet the truth of them for that very reason is capable of demonstration and there is hope of our being able to make it in some degree felt and comprehended even by those to whom it is now a dead letter or an offence but the aerial and misty effects of landscape being matters of which the eye should be simply cognizant and without effort of thought as it is of light must where they are exquisitely rendered either be felt at once or prove that degree of blindness and bluntness in the feelings of the observer which there is little hope of ever conquering of course for persons who have never seen in their lives a cloud vanishing on a mountainside and whose conceptions of mist or vapor are limited to ambiguous outlines of spectral hackneycoaches and bodiless lampposts discern through a brown combination of sulphur soot and gaslight there is yet some hope we cannot indeed tell them what the morning mist is like in mountain air but far be it from us to tell them that they are incapable of feeling its beauty if they will seek it for themselves but if you have ever in your life had one opportunity with your eyes and heart open of seeing the dew rise from a hillpasture or the storm gather on a seacliff and if you have yet no feeling for the glorious passages of mingled earth and heaven which turner calls up before you into breathing tangible being there is indeed no hope for your apathyart will never touch you nor nature inform   § 29 various instances  it would be utterly absurd among the innumerable passages of this kind given throughout his works to point to one as more characteristic or more perfect than another the simmer lake near askrig for expression of mist pervaded with sunlightthe lake lucerne a recent and unengraved drawing for the recession of near mountain form not into dark but into luminous cloud the most difficult thing to do in artthe harlech for expression of the same phenomena shown over vast spaces in distant ranges of hills the ehrenbreitstein a recent drawing for expression of mist rising from the surface of water at sunsetand finally the glorious oberwesel and nemi41 for passages of all united may however be named as noble instances though in naming five works i insult five hundred   § 30 turners more violent effects of tempest are never rendered by         engravers  § 31 general system of landscape engraving  § 32 the storm in the stonehenge  one word respecting turners more violent storms for we have hitherto been speaking only of the softer rainclouds associated with gusty tempest but not of the thundercloud and the whirlwind if there be any one point in which engravers disgrace themselves more than in another it is in their rendering of dark and furious storm it appears to be utterly impossible to force it into their heads that an artist does not leave his color with a sharp edge and an angular form by accident or that they may have the pleasure of altering it and improving upon it and equally impossible to persuade them that energy and gloom may in some circumstances be arrived at without any extraordinary expenditure of ink i am aware of no engraver of the present day whose ideas of a stormcloud are not comprised under two heads roundness and blackness and indeed their general principles of translation as may be distinctly gathered from their larger works are the following 1 where the drawing is gray make the paper black 2 where the drawing is white cover the page with zigzag lines 3 where the drawing has particularly tender tones crosshatch them 4 where any outline is particularly angular make it round 5 where there are vertical reflections in water express them with very distinct horizontal lines 6 where there is a passage of particular simplicity treat it in sections 7 where there is anything intentionally concealed make it out yet in spite of the necessity which all engravers impose upon themselves of rigidly observing this code of general laws it is difficult to conceive how such pieces of work as the plates of stonehenge and winchelsea can ever have been presented to the public as in any way resembling or possessing even the most fanciful relation to the turner drawings of the same subjects the original of the stonehenge is perhaps the standard of stormdrawing both for the overwhelming power and gigantic proportions and spaces of its cloudforms and for the tremendous qualities of lurid and sulphurous colors which are gained in them all its forms are marked with violent angles as if the whole muscular energyso to speakof the cloud were writhing in every fold and their fantastic and fiery volumes have a peculiar horroran awful lifeshadowed out in their strange swift fearful outlines which oppress the mind more than even the threatening of their gigantic gloom the white lightning not as it is drawn by less observant or less capable painters in zigzag fortifications but in its own dreadful irregularity of streaming fire is brought down not merely over the dark clouds but through the full light of an illumined opening to the blue which yet cannot abate the brilliancy of its white line and the track of the last flash along the ground is fearfully marked by the dog howling over the fallen shepherd and the ewe pressing her head upon the body of her dead lamb   § 33 general character of such effects given by turner his expression         of falling rain  i have not space however to enter into examination of turners stormdrawing i can only warn the public against supposing that its effect is ever rendered by engravers the great principles of turner are angular outline vastness and energy of form infinity of gradation and depth without blackness the great principles of the engravers vide pæstum in rogerss italy and the stonehenge above alluded to are rounded outline no edges want of character equality of strength and blackness without depth   § 34 recapitulation of the section  i have scarcely i see on referring to what i have written sufficiently insisted on turners rendering of the rainy fringe whether in distances admitting or concealing more or less of the extended plain as in the waterloo and richmond with the girl and dog in the foreground or as in the dunstaffnage glencoe st michaels mount and slave ship not reaching the earth but suspended in waving and twisted lines from the darkness of the zenith but i have no time for farther development of particular points i must defer discussion of them until we take up each picture to be viewed as a whole for the division of the sky which i have been obliged to make in order to render fully understood the peculiarities of character in the separate cloud regions prevents my speaking of any one work with justice to its concentration of various truth be it always remembered that we pretend not at present to give any account or idea of the sum of the works of any painter much less of the universality of turners but only to explain in what real truth as far as it is explicable consists and to illustrate it by those pictures in which it most distinctly occurs or from which it is most visibly absent and it will only be in the full and separate discussion of individual works when we are acquainted also with what is beautiful that we shall be completely able to prove or disprove the presence of the truth of nature  the conclusion then to which we are led by our present examination of the truth of clouds is that the old masters attempted the representation of only one among the thousands of their systems of scenery and were altogether false in the little they attempted while we can find records in modern art of every form or phenomenon of the heavens from the highest film that glorifies the ether to the wildest vapor that darkens the dust and in all these records we find the most clear language and close thought firm words and true message unstinted fulness and unfailing faith   § 35 sketch of a few of the skies of nature taken as a whole compared         with the works of turner and of the old masters morning on the         plains  § 36 noon with gathering storms  § 37 sunset in tempest serene midnight  § 38 and sunrise on the alps  and indeed it is difficult for us to conceive how even without such laborious investigation as we have gone through any person can go to nature for a single day or hour when she is really at work in any of her nobler spheres of action and yet retain respect for the old masters finding as find he will that every scene which rises rests or departs before him bears with it a thousand glories of which there is not one shadow one image one trace or line in any of their works but which will illustrate to him at every new instant some passage which he had not before understood in the high works of modern art stand upon the peak of some isolated mountain at daybreak when the night mists first rise from off the plains and watch their white and lakelike fields as they float in level bays and winding gulfs about the islanded summits of the lower hills untouched yet by more than dawn colder and more quiet than a windless sea under the moon of midnight watch when the first sunbeam is sent upon the silver channels how the foam of their undulating surface parts and passes away and down under their depths the glittering city and green pasture lie like atlantis between the white paths of winding rivers the flakes of light falling every moment faster and broader among the starry spires as the wreathed surges break and vanish above them and the confused crests and ridges of the dark hills shorten their gray shadows upon the plain has claude given this wait a little longer and you shall see those scattered mists rallying in the ravines and floating up towards you along the winding valleys till they couch in quiet masses iridescent with the morning light42 upon the broad breasts of the higher hills whose leagues of massy undulation will melt back and back into that robe of material light until they fade away lost in its lustre to appear again above in the serene heaven like a wild bright impossible dream foundationless and inaccessible their very bases vanishing in the unsubstantial and mocking blue of the deep lake below43 has claude given this wait yet a little longer and you shall see those mists gather themselves into white towers and stand like fortresses along the promontories massy and motionless only piled with every instant higher and higher into the sky44 and casting longer shadows athwart the rocks and out of the pale blue of the horizon you will see forming and advancing a troop of narrow dark pointed vapors45 which will cover the sky inch by inch with their gray network and take the light off the landscape with an eclipse which will stop the singing of the birds and the motion of the leaves together and then you will see horizontal bars of black shadow forming under them and lurid wreaths create themselves you know not how along the shoulders of the hills you never see them form but when you look back to a place which was clear an instant ago there is a cloud on it hanging by the precipices as a hawk pauses over his prey46 has claude given this and then you will hear the sudden rush of the awakened wind and you will see those watchtowers of vapor swept away from their foundations and waving curtains of opaque rain let down to the valleys swinging from the burdened clouds in black bending fringes47 or pacing in pale columns along the lake level grazing its surface into foam as they go and then as the sun sinks you shall see the storm drift for an instant from on the hills leaving their broad sides smoking and loaded yet with snowwhite torn steamlike rags of capricious vapor now gone now gathered again48 while the smouldering sun seeming not far away but burning like a redhot ball beside you and as if you could reach it plunges through the rushing wind and rolling cloud with headlong fall as if it meant to rise no more dyeing all the air about it with blood49 has claude given this and then you shall hear the fainting tempest die in the hollow of the night and you shall see a green halo kindling on the summit of the eastern hills50 brighterbrighter yet till the large white circle of the slow moon is lifted up among the barred clouds51 step by step line by line star after star she quenches with her kindling light setting in their stead an army of pale penetrable fleecy wreaths in the heaven to give light upon the earth which move together hand in hand company by company troop by troop so measured in their unity of motion that the whole heaven seems to roll with them and the earth to reel under them ask claude or his brethren for that and then wait yet for one hour until the east again becomes purple52 and the heaving mountains rolling against it in darkness like waves of a wild sea are drowned one by one in the glory of its burning watch the white glaciers blaze in their winding paths about the mountains like mighty serpents with scales of fire watch the columnar peaks of solitary snow kindling downwards chasm by chasm each in itself a new morning their long avalanches cast down in keen streams brighter than the lightning sending each his tribute of driven snow like altarsmoke up to the heaven the roselight of their silent domes flushing that heaven about them and above them piercing with purer light through its purple lines of lifted cloud casting a new glory on every wreath as it passes by until the whole heavenone scarlet canopyis interwoven with a roof of waving flame and tossing vault beyond vault as with the drifted wings of many companies of angels and then when you can look no more for gladness and when you are bowed down with fear and love of the maker and doer of this tell me who has best delivered this his message unto men   footnotes    34 i am unable to say to what height the real raincloud may     extend perhaps there are no mountains which rise altogether above     storm i have never been in a violent storm at a greater height than     between 8000 and 9000 feet above the level of the sea there the     raincloud is exceedingly light compared to the ponderous darkness     of the lower air    35 i ought here however to have noted another effect of the     raincloud which so far as i know has been rendered only by     copley fielding it is seen chiefly in clouds gathering for rain     when the sky is entirely covered with a gray veil rippled or waved     with pendent swells of soft texture but excessively hard and liny     in their edges i am not sure that this is an agreeable or     impressive form of the raincloud but it is a frequent one and it     is often most faithfully given by fielding only in some cases the     edges becoming a little doubled and harsh have given a look of     failure or misadventure to some even of the best studied passages     and something of the same hardness of line is occasionally visible     in his drawing of clouds by whose nature it is not warranted    36 compare sect i chap iv § 5    37 it does not do so until the volumes lose their density by     inequality of motion and by the expansion of the warm air which     conveys them they are then of course broken into forms resembling     those of clouds    38 no conception can be formed of this picture from the engraving     it is perhaps the most marvellous piece of execution and of gray     color existing except perhaps the drawing presently to be noticed     lands end nothing else can be set beside it even of turners own     worksmuch less of any other mans      39 i know no effect more strikingly characteristic of the     departure of a storm than the smoking of the mountain torrents     the exhausted air is so thirsty of moisture that every jet of spray     is seized upon by it and converted into vapor as it springs and     this vapor rises so densely from the surface of the stream as to     give it the exact appearance of boiling water i have seen the whole     course of the arve at chamonix one line of dense cloud dissipating     as soon as it had risen ten or twelve feet from the surface but     entirely concealing the water from an observer placed above it    40 note especially the dark uppermost outline of the mass    41 in the possession of b g windus esq of tottenham    42 i have often seen the white thin morning cloud edged with the     seven colors of the prism i am not aware of the cause of this     phenomenon for it takes place not when we stand with our backs to     the sun but in clouds near the sun itself irregularly and over     indefinite spaces sometimes taking place in the body of the cloud     the colors are distinct and vivid but have a kind of metallic     lustre upon them    43 lake lucerne    44 st maurice rogerss italy    45 vignette the great st bernard    46 vignette of the

at present naming without examining the        particular effects of light rendered by turner  § 2 hopes of the author for assistance in the future investigation of        them  i have before given my reasons sect ii chap iii for not wishing at present to enter upon the discussion of particular effects of light not only are we incapable of rightly viewing them or reasoning upon them until we are acquainted with the principles of the beautiful but as i distinctly limited myself in the present portion of the work to the examination of general truths it would be out of place to take cognizance of the particular phases of light even if it were possible to do so before we have some more definite knowledge of the material objects which they illustrate i shall therefore at present merely set down a rough catalogue of the effects of light at different hours of the day which turner has represented naming a picture or two as an example of each which we will hereafter take up one by one and consider the physical science and the feeling together and i do this in the hope that in the mean time some admirer of the old masters will be kind enough to select from the works of any one of them a series of examples of the same effects and to give me a reference to the pictures so that i may be able to compare each with each for as my limited knowledge of the works of claude or poussin does not supply me with the requisite variety of effect i shall be grateful for assistance  the following list of course does not name the hundredth part of the effects of light given by turner it only names those which are distinctly and markedly separate from each other and representative each of an entire class ten or twelve examples often many more might be given of each every one of which would display the effects of the same hour and light modified by different circumstances of weather situation and character of objects subjected to them and especially by the management of the sky but it

organization of the earth and their importance        in art  by truth of earth we mean the faithful representation of the facts and forms of the bare ground considered as entirely divested of vegetation through whatever disguise or under whatever modification the clothing of the landscape may occasion ground is to the landscape painter what the naked human body is to the historical the growth of vegetation the action of water and even of clouds upon it and around it are so far subject and subordinate to its forms as the folds of the dress and the fall of the hair are to the modulation of the animal anatomy nor is this anatomy always so concealed but in all sublime compositions whether of nature or art it must be seen in its naked purity the laws of the organization of the earth are distinct and fixed as those of the animal frame simpler and broader but equally authoritative and inviolable their results may be arrived at without knowledge of the interior mechanism but for that very reason ignorance of them is the more disgraceful and violation of them more unpardonable they are in the landscape the foundation of all other truthsthe most necessary therefore even if they were not in themselves attractive but they are as beautiful as they are essential and every abandonment of them by the artist must end in deformity as it begins in falsehood   § 2 the slight attention ordinarily paid to them their careful study        by modern artists  that such abandonment is constant and total in the works of the old masters has escaped detection only because of persons generally cognizant of art few have spent time enough in hill countries to perceive the certainty of the laws of hill anatomy and because few even of those who possess such opportunities ever think of the common earth beneath their feet as anything possessing specific form or governed by steadfast principles that such abandonment should have taken place cannot be surprising after what we have seen of their fidelity to skies those artists who day after day could so falsely represent what was forever before their eyes when it was to be one of the most important and attractive parts of their picture can scarcely be expected to give with truth what they could see only partially and at intervals and what was only to be in their picture a blue line in the horizon or a bright spot under the feet of their figures  that such should be all the space allotted by the old landscape painters to the most magnificent phenomena of nature that the only traces of those apennines which in claudes walks along the brow of the pincian forever bounded his horizon with their azure wall should in his pictures be a cold white outline in the extreme of his tame distance and that salvators sojourns among their fastnesses should only have taught him to shelter his banditti with such paltry morsels of crag as an alpine stream would toss down before it like a foamglobe though it may indeed excite our surprise will perhaps when we have seen how these slight passages are executed be rather a subject of congratulation than of regret it might indeed have shortened our labor in the investigation of mountain truth had not modern artists been so vast comprehensive and multitudinous in their mountain drawings as to compel us in order to form the slightest estimate of their knowledge to enter into some examination of every variety of hill scenery we shall first gain some general notion of the broad organization of large masses and then take those masses to pieces until we come down to the crumbling soil of the foreground   § 3 general structure of the earth the hills are its action the        plains its rest  mountains are to the rest of the body of the earth what violent muscular action is to the body of man the muscles and tendons of its anatomy are in the mountain brought out with fierce and convulsive energy full of expression passion and strength the plains and the lower hills are the repose and the effortless motion of the frame when its muscles lie dormant and concealed beneath the lines of its beauty yet ruling those lines in their every undulation this then is the first grand principle of the truth of the earth the spirit of the hills is action that of the lowlands repose and between these there is to be found every variety of motion and of rest from the inactive plain sleeping like the firmament with cities for stars to the fiery peaks which with heaving bosoms and exulting limbs with the clouds drifting like hair from their bright foreheads lift up their titan hands to heaven saying i live forever   § 4 mountains come out from underneath the plains and are their        support  but there is this difference between the action of the earth and that of a living creature that while the exerted limb marks its bones and tendons through the flesh the excited earth casts off the flesh altogether and its bones come out from beneath mountains are the bones of the earth their highest peaks are invariably those parts of its anatomy which in the plains lie buried under five and twenty thousand feet of solid thickness of superincumbent soil and which spring up in the mountain ranges in vast pyramids or wedges flinging their garment of earth away from them on each side the masses of the lower hills are laid over and against their sides like the masses of lateral masonry against the skeleton arch of an unfinished bridge except that they slope up to and lean against the central ridge and finally upon the slopes of these lower hills are strewed the level beds of sprinkled gravel sand and clay which form the extent of the champaign here then is another grand principle of the truth of earth that the mountains must come from under all and be the support of all and that everything else must be laid in their arms heap above heap the plains being the uppermost opposed to this truth is every appearance of the hills being laid upon the plains or built upon them nor is this a truth only of the earth on a large scale for every minor rock in position comes out from the soil about it as an island out of the sea lifting the earth near it like waves beating on its sides   § 5 structure of the plains themselves their perfect level when        deposited by quiet water  such being the structure of the framework of the earth it is next to be remembered that all soil whatsoever wherever it is accumulated in greater quantity than is sufficient to nourish the moss of the wallflower has been so either by the direct transporting agency of water or under the guiding influence and power of water all plains capable of cultivation are deposits from some kind of watersome from swift and tremendous currents leaving their soil in sweeping banks and furrowed ridgesothers and this is in mountain districts almost invariably the case by slow deposit from a quiet lake in the mountain hollow which has been gradually filled by the soil carried into it by streams which soil is of course finally left spread at the exact level of the surface of the former lake as level as the quiet water itself hence we constantly meet with plains in hill districts which fill the hollows of the hills with as perfect and faultless a level as water and out of which the steep rocks rise at the edge with as little previous disturbance or indication of their forms beneath as they do from the margin of a quiet lake every deltaand there is one at the head of every lake in every hilldistrictsupplies an instance of this the rocks at altorf plunge beneath the plain which the lake has left at as sharp an angle as they do into the lake itself beside the chapel of tell the plain of the arve at sallenche is terminated so sharply by the hills to the southeast that i have seen a man sleeping with his back supported against the mountain and his legs stretched on the plain the slope which supported his back rising 5000 feet above him and the couch of his legs stretched for five miles before him in distant effect these champaigns lie like deep blue undisturbed water while the mighty hills around them burst out from beneath raging and tossing like a tumultuous sea the valleys of meyringen interlachen altorf sallenche st jean de maurienne the great plain of lombardy itself as seen from milan or padua under the alps the euganeans and the apennines and the campo felice under vesuvius are a few out of the thousand instances which must occur at once to the mind of every traveller   § 6 illustrated by turners marengo  let the reader now open rogerss italy at the seventeenth page and look at the vignette which heads it of the battle of marengo it needs no comment it cannot but carry with it after what has been said the instant conviction that turner is as much of a geologist as he is of a painter it is a summary of all we have been saying and a summary so distinct and clear that without any such explanation it must have forced upon the mind the impression of such factsof the plunging of the hills underneath the plainof the perfect level and repose of this latter laid in their arms and of the tumultuous action of the emergent summits   § 7 general divisions of formation resulting from this arrangement        plan of investigation  we find according to this its internal structure which i believe with the assistance of turner can scarcely now be misunderstood that the earth may be considered as divided into three great classes of formation which geology has already named for us primarythe rocks which though in position lower than all others rise to form the central peaks or interior nuclei of all mountain ranges secondarythe rocks which are laid in beds above these and which form the greater proportion of all hill scenery tertiarythe light beds of sand gravel and clay which are strewed upon the surface of all forming plains and habitable territory for man we shall find it convenient in examining the truth of art to adopt with a little modification the geological arrangement considering first the formation and character of the highest or central peaks then the general structure of the lower mountains including in this division those composed of the various slates which a geologist would call primary and lastly the minutiæ and most delicate characters of the beds of these hills when they are so near as to become foreground objects and the structure of the common soil which usually forms the greater space of an artists foreground hence our task will arrange itself into three divisionsthe investigation of the central mountains of the interior mountains and of the foreground                                      chapter ii                            of the central mountains   § 1 similar character of the central peaks in all parts of the world  it does not always follow because a mountain is the highest of its group that it is in reality one of the central range the jungfrau is only surpassed in elevation in the chain of which it is a member by the schreckhorn and finsteraarhorn but it is entirely a secondary mountain but the central peaks are usually the highest and may be considered as the chief components of all mountain scenery in the snowy regions being composed of the same rocks in all countries their external character is the same everywhere its chief essential points are the following   § 2 their arrangements in pyramids or wedges divided by vertical        fissures  their summits are almost invariably either pyramids or wedges domes may be formed by superincumbent snow or appear to be formed by the continuous outline of a sharp ridge seen transversely with its precipice to the spectator but wherever a rock appears the uppermost termination of that rock will be a steep edgy ridge or a sharp point very rarely presenting even a gentle slope on any of its sides but usually inaccessible unless encumbered with snow  these pyramids and wedges split vertically or nearly so giving smooth faces of rock either perpendicular or very steeply inclined which appear to be laid against the central wedge or peak like planks upright against a wall the surfaces of these show close parallelism their fissures are vertical and cut them smoothly like the edges of shaped planks often groups of these planks if i may so call them rise higher than those between them and the central ridge forming detached ridges inclining towards the central one the planks are cut transversely sometimes by graceful curvilinear fissures sometimes by straight fissures which are commonly parallel to the slope of one of the sides of the peak while the main direction of the planks or leaves is parallel to that of its other side or points directly to its summit but the universal law of fracture isfirst that it is clean and sharp having a perfectly smooth surface and a perfectly sharp edge to all the fissures secondly that every fissure is steeply inclined and that a horizontal line or one approaching to it is an impossibility except in some turn of a curve   § 3 causing groups of rock resembling an artichoke or rose  hence however the light may fall these peaks are seen marked with sharp and defined shadows indicating the square edges of the planks of which they are made up which shadows sometimes are vertical pointing to the summit but are oftener parallel to one of the sides of the peak and intersected by a second series parallel to the other side where there has been much disintegration the peak is often surrounded with groups of lower ridges or peaks like the leaves of an artichoke or a rose all evidently part and parcel of the great peak but falling back from it as if it were a budding flower expanding its leaves one by one   § 4 the faithful statement of these facts by turner in his alps at        daybreak  now if i were giving a lecture on geology and were searching for some means of giving the most faithful idea possible of the external appearance caused by this structure of the primary hills i should throw my geological outlines aside and take up turners vignette of the alps at daybreak after what has been said a single glance at it will be enough observe the exquisite decision with which the edge of the uppermost plank of the great peak is indicated by its clear dark side and sharp shadow then the rise of the second low ridge on its side only to descend again precisely in the same line the two fissures of this peak one pointing to its summit the other rigidly parallel to the great slope which descends towards the sun then the sharp white aiguille on the right with the great fissure from its summit rigidly and severely square as marked below where another edge of rock is laid upon it but this is not all the black rock in the foreground is equally a member of the mass its chief slope parallel with that of the mountain and all its fissures and lines inclined in the same direction and to complete the mass of evidence more forcibly still we have the dark mass on the left articulated with absolute right lines as parallel as if they had been drawn with a ruler indicating the tops of two of these huge plates or planks pointing with the universal tendency to the great ridge and intersected by fissures parallel to it throughout the extent of mountain not one horizontal line nor an approach to it is discernible this cannot be chanceit cannot be compositionit may not be beautifulperhaps nature is very wrong to be so parallel and very disagreeable in being so straightbut this is nature whether we admire it or not   § 5 vignette of the andes and others  in the vignette illustration to jacqueline we have another series of peaks whose structure is less developed owing to their distance but equally clear and faithful in all points as far as it is given but the vignette of aosta in italy is perhaps more striking than any that could be named for its rendering of the perfect parallelism of the lower and smaller peaks with the great lines of the mass they compose and that of the andes the second in campbell for its indication of the multitudes of the vertical and planklike beds arranged almost like the leaves of a flower this last especially one of the very noblest most faithful most scientific statements of mountain form which even turner has ever made can leave little more to be said or doubted   § 6 necessary distance and consequent aerial effect on all such        mountains  now whenever these vast peaks rising from 12000 to 24000 feet above the sea form part of anything like a landscape that is to say whenever the spectator beholds them from the region of vegetation or even from any distance at which it is possible to get something like a view of their whole mass they must be at so great a distance from him as to become aerial and faint in all their details their summits and all those higher masses of whose character we have been speaking can by no possibility be nearer to him than twelve or fifteen miles to approach them nearer he must climbmust leave the region of vegetation and must confine his view to a part and that a very limited one of the mountain he is ascending whenever therefore these mountains are seen over anything like vegetation or are seen in mass they must be in the far distance most artists would treat an horizon fifteen miles off very much as if it were mere air and though the greater clearness of the upper air permits the high summits to be seen with extraordinary distinctness yet they never can by any possibility have dark or deep shadows or intense dark relief against a light clear they may be but faint they must be and their great and prevailing characteristic as distinguished from other mountains is want of apparent solidity they rise in the morning light rather like sharp shades cast up into the sky than solid earth their lights are pure roseate and cloudliketheir shadows transparent pale and opalescent and often indistinguishable from the air around them so that the mountaintop is seen in the heaven only by its flakes of motionless fire   § 7 total want of any rendering of their phenomena in ancient art  now let me once more ask though i am sufficiently tired of asking what record have we of anything like this in the works of the old masters there is no vestige in any existing picture of the slightest effort to represent the high hill ranges and as for such drawing of their forms as we have found in turner we might as well look for them among the chinese very possibly it may be all quite rightvery probably these men showed the most cultivated taste the most unerring judgment in filling their pictures with molehills and sandheaps very probably the withered and poisonous banks of avernus and the sand and cinders of the campagna are much more sublime things than the alps but still what limited truth it is if truth it be when through the last fifty pages we have been pointing out fact after fact scene after scene in clouds and hills and not individual facts nor scenes but great and important classes of them and still we have nothing to say when we come to the old masters but they are not here yet this is what we hear so constantly called painting general nature   § 8 character of the representations of alps in the distances of        claude  § 9 their total want of magnitude and aerial distance  although however there is no vestige among the old masters of any effort to represent the attributes of the higher mountains seen in comparative proximity we are not altogether left without evidence of their having thought of them as sources of light in the extreme distance as for example in that of the reputed claude in our national gallery called the marriage of isaac and rebecca i have not the slightest doubt of its being a most execrable copy for there is not one touch nor line of even decent painting in the whole picture but as connoisseurs have considered it a claude as it has been put in our gallery for a claude and as people admire it every day for a claude i may at least presume it has those qualities of claude in it which are wont to excite the public admiration though it possesses none of those which sometimes give him claim to it and i have so reasoned and shall continue to reason upon it especially with respect to facts of form which cannot have been much altered by the copyist in the distance of that picture as well as in that of the sinon before priam which i have little doubt is at least partially original and whose central group of trees is a very noble piece of painting is something white which i believe must be intended for a snowy mountain because i do not see that it can well be intended for anything else now no mountain of elevation sufficient to be so sheeted with perpetual snow can by any possibility sink so low on the horizon as this something of claudes unless it be at a distance of from fifty to seventy miles at such distances though the outline is invariably sharp and edgy to an excess yet all the circumstances of aerial perspective faintness of shadow and isolation of light which i have described as characteristic of the alps fifteen miles off take place of course in a threefold degree the mountains rise from the horizon like transparent films only distinguishable from mist by their excessively keen edges and their brilliant flashes of sudden light they are as unsubstantial as the air itself and impress their enormous size by means of this aerialness in a far greater degree at these vast distances than even when towering above the spectators head now i ask of the candid observer if there be the smallest vestige of an effort to attainif there be the most miserable the most contemptible shadow of attainment of such an effect by claude does that white thing on the horizon look seventy miles off is it faint or fading or to be looked for by the eye before it can be found out does it look high does it look large does it look impressive you cannot but feel that there is not a vestige of any kind or species of truth in that horizon and that however artistical it may be as giving brilliancy to the distance though as far as i have any feeling in the matter it only gives coldness it is in the very branch of art on which claudes reputation chiefly rests aerial perspective hurling defiance to nature in her very teeth   § 10 and violation of specific form  but there are worse failures yet in this unlucky distance aerial perspective is not a matter of paramount importance because nature infringes its laws herself and boldly too though never in a case like this before us but there are some laws which nature never violatesher laws of form no mountain was ever raised to the level of perpetual snow without an infinite multiplicity of form its foundation is built of a hundred minor mountains and from these great buttresses run in converging ridges to the central peak there is no exception to this rule no mountain 15000 feet high is ever raised without such preparation and variety of outwork consequently in distant effect when chains of such peaks are visible at once the multiplicity of form is absolutely oceanic and though it is possible in near scenes to find vast and simple masses composed of lines which run unbroken for a thousand feet or more it is physically impossible when these masses are thrown seventy miles back to have simple outlines for then these large features become mere jags and hillocks and are heaped and huddled together with endless confusion to get a simple form seventy miles away mountain lines would be required unbroken for leagues and this i repeat is physically impossible hence these mountains of claude having no indication of the steep vertical summits which we have shown to be the characteristic of the central ridges having soft edges instead of decisive ones simple forms one line to the plain on each side instead of varied and broken ones and being painted with a crude raw white having no transparency nor filminess nor air in it instead of rising in the opalescent mystery which invariably characterizes the distant snows have the forms and the colors of heaps of chalk in a limekiln not of alps they are destitute of energy of height of distance of splendor and of variety and are the work of a man whether claude or not who had neither feeling for nature nor knowledge of art   § 11 even in his best works  i should not however insist upon the faults of this picture believing it to be a copy if i had ever seen even in his most genuine works an extreme distance of claude with any of the essential characters of nature but although in his better pictures we have always beautiful drawing of the air which in the copy before us is entirely wanting the real features of the extreme mountain distance are equally neglected or maligned in all there is indeed air between us and it but ten miles not seventy miles of space let us observe a little more closely the practice of nature in such cases   § 12 farther illustration of the distant character of mountain chains  § 13 their excessive appearance of transparency  the multiplicity of form which i have shown to be necessary in the outline is not less felt in the body of the mass for in all extensive hill ranges there are five or six lateral chains separated by deep valleys which rise between the spectator and the central ridge showing their tops one over another wave beyond wave until the eye is carried back to the faintest and highest forms of the principal chain these successive ridges and i speak now not merely of the alps but of mountains generally even as low as 3000 feet above the sea show themselves in extreme distance merely as vertical shades with very sharp outlines detached from one another by greater intensity according to their nearness it is with the utmost difficulty that the eye can discern any solidity or roundness in them the lights and shades of solid form are both equally lost in the blue of the atmosphere and the mountain tells only as a flat sharpedged film of which multitudes intersect and overtop one another separated by the greater faintness of the retiring masses this is the most simple and easily imitated arrangement possible and yet both in nature and art it expresses distance and size in a way otherwise quite unattainable for thus the whole mass of one mountain being of one shade only the smallest possible difference in shade will serve completely to detach it from another and thus ten or twelve distances may be made evident when the darkest and nearest is an aerial gray as faint as the sky and the beauty of such arrangements carried out as nature carries them to their highest degree is perhaps the most striking feature connected with hill scenery you will never by any chance perceive in extreme distance anything like solid form or projection of the hills each is a dead flat perpendicular film or shade with a sharp edge darkest at the summit and lost as it descends and about equally dark whether turned towards the light or from it and of these successive films of mountain you will probably have half a dozen one behind another all showing with perfect clearness their every chasm and peak in the outline and not one of them showing the slightest vestige of solidity but on the contrary looking so thoroughly transparent that if it so happens as i have seen frequently that a conical near hill meets with its summit the separation of two distant ones so that the righthand slope of the nearer hill forms an apparent continuation of the righthand slope of the lefthand farther hill and vice versa it is impossible to get rid of the impression that one or the more distant peaks is seen through the other   § 14 illustrated from the works of turner and stanfield the borromean         islands of the latter  i may point out in illustration of these facts the engravings of two drawings of precisely the same chain of distant hillsstanfields borromean islands with the st gothard in the distance and turners arona also with the st gothard in the distance far be it from me to indicate the former of these plates as in any way exemplifying the power of stanfield or affecting his reputation it is an unlucky drawing murdered by the engraver and as far from being characteristic of stanfield as it is from being like nature but it is just what i want to illustrate the particular error of which i speak and i prefer showing this error where it accidentally exists in the works of a really great artist standing there alone to point it out where it is confused with other faults and falsehoods in the works of inferior hands the former of these plates is an example of everything which a hill distance is not and the latter of everything which it is in the former we have the mountains covered with patchy lights which being of equal intensity whether near or distant confuse all the distances together while the eye perceiving that the light falls so as to give details of solid form yet finding nothing but insipid and formless spaces displayed by it is compelled to suppose that the whole body of the hill is equally monotonous and devoid of character and the effect upon it is not one whit more impressive and agreeable than might be received from a group of sandheaps washed into uniformity by recent rain   § 15 turners arona  compare with this the distance of turner in arona it is totally impossible here to say which way the light falls on the distant hills except by the slightly increased decision of their edges turned towards it but the greatest attention is paid to get these edges decisive yet full of gradation and perfectly true in character of form all the rest of the mountain is then indistinguishable haze and by the bringing of these edges more and more decisively over one another turner has given us between the righthand side of the picture and the snow fifteen distinct distances yet every one of these distances in itself palpitating changeful and suggesting subdivision into countless multitude something of this is traceable even in the engraving and all the essential characters are perfectly well marked i think even the least experienced eye can scarcely but feel the truth of this distance as compared with stanfields in the latter the eye gets something of the form and therefore wonders it sees no more the impression on it therefore is of hills within distinctly visible distance indiscernible through want of light or dim atmosphere and the effect is of course smallness of space with obscurity of light and thickness of air in turners the eye gets nothing of the substance and wonders it sees so much of the outline the impression is therefore of mountains too far off to be ever distinctly seen rendered clear by brilliancy of light and purity of atmosphere and the effect consequently vastness of space with intensity of light and crystalline transparency of air   § 16 extreme distance of large objects always characterized by very         sharp outline  these truths are invariably given in every one of turners distances that is to say we have always in them two principal facts forced on our notice transparency or filminess of mass and excessive sharpness of edge and i wish particularly to insist upon this sharpness of edge because it is not a casual or changeful habit of nature it is the unfailing characteristic of all very great distances it is quite a mistake to suppose that slurred or melting lines are characteristic of distant large objects they may be so as before observed sec ii chap iv § 4 when the focus of the eye is not adapted to them but when the eye is really directed to the distance melting lines are characteristic only of thick mist and vapor between us and the object not of the removal of the object if a thing has character upon its outline as a tree for instance or a mossy stone the farther it is removed from us the sharper the outline of the whole mass will become though in doing so the particular details which make up the character will become confused in the manner described in the same chapter a tree fifty yards from us taken as a mass has a soft outline because the leaves and interstices have some effect on the eye but put it ten miles off against the sky and its outline will be so sharp that you cannot tell it from a rock there are three trees on the mont saleve about five miles from geneva which from the city as they stand on the ridge of the hill are seen defined against the sky the keenest eye in the world could not tell them from stones so in a mountain five or six miles off bushes and heather and roughnesses of knotty ground and rock have still some effect on the eye and by becoming confused and mingled as before described soften the outline but let the mountain be thirty miles off and its edge will be as sharp as a knife let it as in the case of the alps be seventy or eighty miles off and though it has become so faint that the morning mist is not so transparent its outline will be beyond all imitation for excessive sharpness thus then the character of extreme distance is always excessive keenness of edge if you soften your outline you either put mist between you and the object and in doing so diminish your distance for it is impossible you should see so far through mist as through clear air or if you keep an impression of clear air you bring the object close to the observer diminish its size in proportion and if the aerial colors excessive blues etc be retained represent an impossibility   § 17 want of this decision in claude  take claudes distance in no 244 dulwich gallery53 on the right of the picture it is as pure blue as ever came from the pallet laid on thick you cannot see through it there is not the slightest vestige of transparency or filminess about it and its edge is soft and blunt hence if it be meant for near hills the blue is impossible and the want of details impossible in the clear atmosphere indicated through the whole picture if it be meant for extreme distance the blunt edge is impossible and the opacity is impossible i do not know a single distance of the italian school to which the same observation is not entirely applicable except perhaps one or two of nicholas poussins they always involve under any supposition whatsoever at least two impossibilities   § 18 the perpetual rendering of it by turner  i need scarcely mention in particular any more of the works of turner because there is not one of his mountain distances in which these facts are not fully exemplified look at the last vignettethe farewell in rogerss italy observe the excessive sharpness of all the edges almost amounting to lines in the distance while there is scarcely one decisive edge in the foreground look at the hills of the distance in the dunstaffnage glencoe and loch achray illustrations to scott in the latter of which the lefthand side of the benvenue is actually marked with a dark line in fact turners usual mode of executing these passages is perfectly evident in all his drawings it is not often that we meet with a very broad dash of wet color in his finished works but in these distances as we before saw of his shadows all the effect has been evidently given by a dash of very moist pale color probably turning the paper upside down so that a very firm edge may be left at the top of the mountain as the color dries and in the battle of marengo we find the principle carried so far as to give nothing more than actual outline for the representation of the extreme distance while all the other hills in the picture are distinctly darkest at the edge this plate though coarsely executed is yet one of the noblest illustrations of mountain character and magnitude existing   § 19 effects of snow how imperfectly studied  such then are the chief characteristics of the highest peaks and extreme distances of all hills as far as the forms of the rocks themselves and the aerial appearances especially belonging to them are alone concerned there is however yet another point to be consideredthe modification of their form caused by incumbent snow  pictures of winter scenery are nearly as common as moonlights and are usually executed by the same order of artists that is to say the most incapable it being remarkably easy to represent the moon as a white wafer on a black ground or to scratch out white branches on a cloudy sky nevertheless among flemish paintings several valuable representations of winter are to be found and some clever pieces of effect among the moderns as hunts for instance and de wints but all such efforts end in effect alone nor have i ever in any single instance seen a snow wreath i do not say thoroughly but even decently drawn  in the range of inorganic nature i doubt if any object can be found more perfectly beautiful than a fresh deep snowdrift seen under warm light54 its curves are of inconceivable perfection and changefulness its surface and transparency alike exquisite its light and shade of inexhaustible variety and inimitable finish the shadows sharp pale and of heavenly color the reflected lights intense and multitudinous and mingled with the sweet occurrences of transmitted light no mortal hand can approach the majesty or loveliness of it yet it is possible by care and skill at least to suggest the preciousness of its forms and intimate the nature of its light and shade but this has never been attempted it could not be done except by artists of a rank exceedingly high and there is something about the feeling of snow in ordinary scenery which such men do not like but when the same qualities are exhibited on a magnificent alpine scale and in a position where they interfere with no feeling of life i see not why they should be neglected as they have hitherto been unless that the difficulty of reconciling the brilliancy of snow with a picturesque light and shade is so great that most good artists disguise or avoid the greater part of upper alpine scenery and hint at the glacier so slightly that they do not feel the necessity of careful study of its forms habits of exaggeration increase the evil i have seen a sketch from nature by one of the most able of our landscape painters in which a cloud had been mistaken for a snowy summit and the hint thus taken exaggerated as was likely into an enormous mass of impossible height and unintelligent form when the mountain itself for which the cloud had been mistaken though subtending an angle of about eighteen or twenty degrees instead of the fifty attributed to it was of a form so exquisite that it might have been a profitable lesson truly studied to phidias nothing but failure can result from such methods of sketching nor have i ever seen a single instance of an earnest study of snowy mountains by any one hence wherever they are introduced their drawing is utterly unintelligent the forms being those of white rocks or of rocks lightly powdered with snow showing sufficiently that not only the painters have never studied the mountain carefully from below but that they have never climbed into the snowy region hardings rendering of the high alps vide the engraving of chamonix and of the wengern alp in the illustrations to byron is best but even he shows no perception of the real anatomy stanfield paints only white rocks instead of snow turner invariably avoids the difficulty though he has shown himself capable of grappling with it in the ice of the liber studiorum mer de glace which is very cold and slippery and very like ice but of the crusts and wreaths of the higher snow he has taken no cognizance even the vignettes to rogerss poems fail in this respect it would be vain to attempt in this place to give any detailed account of the phenomena of the upper snows but it may be well to note those general principles which every artist ought to keep in mind when he has to paint an alp   § 20 general principles of its forms on the alps  snow is modified by the under forms of the hill in some sort as dress is by the anatomy of the human frame and as no dress can be well laid on without conceiving the body beneath so no alp can be drawn unless its under form is conceived first and its snow laid on afterwards  every high alp has as much snow upon it as it can hold or carry it is not observe a mere coating of snow of given depth throughout but it is snow loaded on until the rocks can hold no more the surplus does not fall in the winter because fastened by continual frost the quantity of snow which an alp can carry is greater than each single winter can bestow it falls in the first mild days of spring in enormous avalanches afterwards the melting continues gradually removing from all the steep rocks the small quantity of snow which was all they could hold and leaving them black and bare among the accumulated fields of unknown depth which occupy the capacious valleys and less inclined superfices of the mountain  hence it follows that the deepest snow does not take nor indicate the actual forms of the rocks on which it lies but it hangs from peak to peak in unbroken and sweeping festoons or covers whole groups of peaks which afford it sufficient hold with vast and unbroken domes these festoons and domes being guided in their curves and modified in size by the violence and prevalent direction of the winter winds  we have therefore every variety of indication of the under mountain form first the mere coating which is soon to be withdrawn and which shows as a mere sprinkling or powdering after a storm on the higher peaks then the shallow incrustation on the steep sides glazed by the running down of its frequent meltings frozen again in the night then the deep snow more or less cramped or modified by sudden eminences of emergent rock or hanging in fractured festoons and huge blue irregular cliffs on the mountain flanks and over the edges and summits of their precipices in nodding drifts far overhanging like a cornice perilous things to approach the edge of from above finally the pure accumulation of overwhelming depth smooth sweeping and almost cleftless and modified only by its lines of drifting countless phenomena of exquisite beauty belong to each of these conditions not to speak of the transition of the snow into ice at lower levels but all on which i shall at present insist is that the artist should not think of his alp merely as a white mountain but conceive it as a group of peaks loaded with an accumulation of snow and that especially he should avail himself of the exquisite curvatures never failing by which the snow unites and opposes the harsh and broken lines of the rock i shall enter into farther detail on this subject hereafter at present it is useless to do so as i have no examples to refer to either in ancient or modern art no statement of these facts has hitherto been made nor any evidence given even of their observation except by the most inferior painters55   § 21 average paintings of switzerland its real spirit has scarcely yet         been caught  various works in green and white appear from time to time on the walls of the academy like the alps indeed but so frightfully like that we shudder and sicken at the sight of them as we do when our best friend shows us into his diningroom to see a portrait of himself which everybody thinks very like we should be glad to see fewer of these for switzerland is quite beyond the power of any but firstrate men and is exceedingly bad practice for a rising artist but let us express a hope that alpine scenery will not continue to be neglected as it has been by those who alone are capable of treating it we love italy but we have had rather a surfeit of it latelytoo many peaked caps and flatheaded pines we should be very grateful to harding and stanfield if they would refresh us a little among the snow and give us what we believe them to be capable of giving us a faithful expression of alpine ideal we are well aware of the pain inflicted on an artists mind by the preponderance of black and white and green over more available colors but there is nevertheless in generic alpine scenery a fountain of feeling yet unopeneda chord of harmony yet untouched by art it will be struck by the first man who can separate what is national in switzerland from what is ideal we do not want chalets and threelegged stools cowbells and buttermilk we want the pure and holy hills treated as a link between heaven and earth   footnotes    53 one of the most genuine claudes i know    54 compare part iii sect i chap 9 § 5    55 i hear of some study of alpine scenery among the professors at     geneva but all foreign landscape that i have ever met with has been     so utterly ignorant that i hope for nothing except from our own     painters                                      chapter iii                            of the inferior mountains   § 1 the inferior mountains are distinguished from the central by being        divided into beds  we have next to investigate the character of those intermediate masses which constitute the greater part of all hill scenery forming the outworks of the high ranges and being almost the sole constituents of such lower groups as those of cumberland scotland or south italy  all mountains whatsoever not composed of the granite or gneiss rocks described in the preceding chapter nor volcanic these latter being comparatively rare are composed of beds not of homogeneous heaped materials but of accumulated layers whether of rock or soil it may be slate sandstone limestone gravel or clay but whatever the substance it is laid in layers not in a mass these layers are scarcely ever horizontal and may slope to any degree often occurring vertical the boldness of the hill outline commonly depending in a great degree on their inclination in consequence of this division into beds every mountain will have two great sets of lines more or less prevailing in its contoursone indicative of the surfaces of the beds where they come out from under each otherand the other indicative of the extremities or edges of the beds where their continuity has been interrupted and these two great sets of lines will commonly be at right angles with each other or nearly so if the surface of the bed approach a horizontal line its termination will approach the vertical and this is the most usual and ordinary way in which a precipice is produced   § 2 farther division of these beds by joints  farther in almost all rocks there is a third division of substance which gives to their beds a tendency to split transversely in some directions rather than others giving rise to what geologists call joints and throwing the whole rock into blocks more or less rhomboidal so that the beds are not terminated by torn or ragged edges but by faces comparatively smooth and even usually inclined to each other at some definite angle the whole arrangement may be tolerably represented by the bricks of a wall whose tiers may be considered as strata and whose sides and extremities will represent the joints by which those strata are divided varying however their direction in different rocks and in the same rock under differing circumstances   § 3 and by lines of lamination  finally in the slates grauwackes and some calcareous beds in the greater number indeed of mountain rocks we find another most conspicuous feature of general structurethe lines of lamination which divide the whole rock into an infinite number of delicate plates or layers sometimes parallel to the direction or strike of the strata oftener obliquely crossing it and sometimes apparently altogether independent of it maintaining a consistent and unvarying slope through a series of beds contorted and undulating in every conceivable direction these lines of lamination extend their influence to the smallest fragment causing it as for example common roofing slate to break smooth in one direction and with a ragged edge in another and marking the faces of the beds and joints with distinct and numberless lines commonly far more conspicuous in a near view than the larger and more important divisions   § 4 variety and seeming uncertainty under which these laws are        manifested  now it cannot be too carefully held in mind in examining the principles of mountain structure that nearly all the laws of nature with respect to external form are rather universal tendencies evidenced by a plurality of instances than imperative necessities complied with by all for instance it may be said to be a universal law with respect to the boughs of all trees that they incline their extremities more to the ground in proportion as they are lower on the trunk and that the higher their point of insertion is the more they share in the upward tendency of the trunk itself but yet there is not a single group of boughs in any one tree which does not show exceptions to the rule and present boughs lower in insertion and yet steeper in inclination than their neighbors nor is this defect or deformity but the result of the constant habit of nature to carry variety into her very principles and make the symmetry and beauty of her laws the more felt by the grace and accidentalism with which they are carried out no one familiar with foliage could doubt for an instant of the necessity of giving evidence of this downward tendency in the boughs but it would be nearly as great an offence against truth to make the law hold good with every individual branch as not to exhibit its influence on the majority now though the laws of mountain form are more rigid and constant than those of vegetation they are subject to the same species of exception in carrying out though every mountain has these great tendencies in its lines not one in a thousand of those lines is absolutely consistent with and obedient to this universal tendency there are lines in every direction and of almost every kind but the sum and aggregate of those lines will invariably indicate the universal force and influence to which they are all subjected and of these lines there will i repeat be two principal sets or classes pretty nearly at right angles with each other when both are inclined they give rise to peaks or ridges when one is nearly horizontal and the other vertical to tablelands and precipices  this then is the broad organization of all hills modified afterwards by time and weather concealed by superincumbent soil and vegetation and ramified into minor and more delicate details in a way presently to be considered but nevertheless universal in its great first influence and giving to all mountains a particular cast and inclination like the exertion of voluntary power in a definite direction an internal spirit manifesting itself in every crag and breathing in every slope flinging and forcing the mighty mass towards the heaven with an expression and an energy like that of life   § 5 the perfect expression of them in turners loch coriskin  now as in the case of the structure of the central peaks described above so also here if i had to give a clear idea of this organization of the lower hills where it is seen in its greatest perfection with a mere view to geological truth i should not refer to any geological drawings but i should take the loch coriskin of turner it has luckily been admirably engraved and for all purposes of reasoning or form is nearly as effective in the print as in the drawing looking at any group of the multitudinous lines which make up this mass of mountain they appear to be running anywhere and everywhere there are none parallel to each other none resembling each other for a moment yet the whole mass is felt at once to be composed with the most rigid parallelism the surfaces of the beds towards the left their edges or escarpments towards the right in the centre near the top of the ridge the edge of a bed is beautifully defined casting its shadow on the surface of the one beneath it this shadow marking by three jags the chasms caused in the inferior one by three of its parallel joints every peak in the distance is evidently subject to the same great influence and the evidence is completed by the flatness and evenness of the steep surfaces of the beds which rise out of the lake on the extreme right parallel with those in the centre   § 6 glencoe and other works  § 7 especially the mount lebanon  turn to glencoe in the same series the illustrations to scott we have in the mass of mountain on the left the most beautiful indication of vertical beds of a finely laminated rock terminated by even joints towards the precipice while the whole sweep of the landscape as far as the most distant peaks is evidently governed by one great and simple tendency upwards to the left those most distant peaks themselves lying over one another in the same direction in the daphne hunting with leucippus the mountains on the left descend in two precipices to the plain each of which is formed by a vast escarpment of the beds whose upper surfaces are shown between the two cliffs sinking with an even slope from the summit of the lowest to the base of the highest under which they evidently descend being exposed in this manner for a length of five or six miles the same structure is shown though with more complicated development on the left of the loch katrine but perhaps the finest instance or at least the most marked of all will be found in the exquisite mount lebanon with the convent of st antonio engraved in findens bible there is not one shade nor touch on the rock which is not indicative of the lines of stratification and every fracture is marked with a straightforward simplicity which makes you feel that the artist has nothing in his heart but a keen love of the pure unmodified truth there is no effort to disguise the repetition of forms no apparent aim at artificial arrangement or scientific grouping the rocks are laid one above another with unhesitating decision every shade is understood in a moment felt as a dark side or a shadow or a fissure and you may step from one block or bed to another until you reach the mountain summit and yet though there seems no effort to disguise the repetition of forms see how it is disguised just as nature would have done it by the perpetual play and changefulness of the very lines which appear so parallel now bending a little up or down or losing themselves or running into each other the old story over and over againinfinity for here is still the great distinction between turners work and that of a common artist hundreds could have given the parallelism of blocks but none but himself could have done so without the actual repetition of a single line or feature   § 8 compared with the work of salvator  now compare with this the second mountain from the left in the picture of salvator no 220 in the dulwich gallery the whole is first laid in with a very delicate and masterly gray right in tone agreeable in color quite unobjectionable for a beginning but how is this made into rock on the light side salvator gives us a multitude of touches all exactly like one another and therefore it is to be hoped quite patterns of perfection in rockdrawing since they are too good to be even varied every touch is a dash of the brush as nearly as possible in the shape of a comma round and bright at the top convex on its right side concave on its left and melting off at the bottom into the gray these are laid in confusion one above another some paler some brighter some scarcely discernible but all alike in shape now i am not aware myself of any particular object either in earth or heaven which these said touches do at all resemble or portray i do not however assert that they may not resemble somethingfeathers perhaps but i do say and say with perfect confidence that they may be chinese for rocks or sanscrit for rocks or symbolical of rocks in some mysterious and undeveloped character but that they are no more like rocks than the brush that made them the dark sides appear to embrace and overhang the lights they cast no shadows are broken by no fissures and furnish as food for contemplation nothing but a series of concave curves   § 9 and of poussin  yet if we go on to no 269 we shall find something a great deal worse i can believe gaspar poussin capable of committing as much sin against nature as most people but i certainly do not suspect him of having had any hand in this thing at least after he was ten years old nevertheless it shows what he is supposed capable of by his admirers and will serve for a broad illustration of all those absurdities which he himself in a less degree and with feeling and thought to atone for them perpetually commits take the white bit of rock on the opposite side of the river just above the right arm of the niobe and tell me of what the square green daubs of the brush at its base can be conjectured to be typical rocks with palebrown light sides and rich green dark sides are a phenomenon perhaps occurring in some of the improved passages of nature among our cumberland lakes where i remember once having seen a bed of roses of peculiar magnificence tastefully and artistically assisted in effect by the rocks above it being painted pink to match but i do not think that they are a kind of thing which the clumsiness and false taste of nature can be supposed frequently to produce even granting that these same sweeps of the brush could by any exercise of the imagination be conceived representative of a dark or any other side which is far more than i am inclined to grant seeing that there is no east shadow no appearance of reflected light of substance or of character on the edge nothing in short but pure staring green paint scratched heavily on a white ground nor is there a touch in the picture more expressive all are the mere dragging of the brush here and there and everywhere without meaning or intention winding twisting zigzagging doing anything in fact which may serve to break up the light and destroy its breadth without bestowing in return one hint or shadow of anything like form this picture is indeed an extraordinary case but the salvator above mentioned is a characteristic and exceedingly favorable example of the usual mode of mountain drawing among the old landscape painters56 their admirers may be challenged to bring forward a single instance of their expressing or even appearing to have noted the great laws of structure above explained their hills are without exception irregular earthy heaps without energy or direction of any kind marked with shapeless shadows and meaningless lines sometimes indeed where great sublimity has been aimed at approximating to the pure and exalted ideal of rocks which in the most artistical specimens of china cups and plates we see suspended from aerial pagodas or balanced upon peacocks tails but never warranting even the wildest theorist in the conjecture that their perpetrators had ever seen a mountain in their lives let us however look farther into the modifications of character by which nature conceals the regularity of her first plan for although all mountains are organized as we have seen their organization is always modified and often nearly concealed by changes wrought upon them by external influence   § 10 effects of external influence on mountain form  we ought when speaking of their stratification to have noticed another great law which must however be understood with greater latitude of application than any of the others as very far from imperative or constant in particular cases though universal in its influence on the aggregate of all it is that the lines by which rocks are terminated are always steeper and more inclined to the vertical as we approach the summit of the mountain thousands of cases are to be found in every group of rocks and lines horizontal at the top of the mountain and vertical at the bottom but they are still the exceptions and the average out of a given number of lines in any rock formation whatsoever will be found increasing in perpendicularity as they rise consequently the great skeleton lines of rock outline are always concave that is to say all distant ranges of rocky mountain approximate more or less to a series of concave curves meeting in peaks like a range of posts with chains hanging between i do not say that convex forms will not perpetually occur but that the tendency of the majority will always be to assume the form of sweeping curved valleys with angular peaks not of rounded convex summits with angular valleys this structure is admirably exemplified in the second vignette in rogerss italy and in piacenza   § 11 the gentle convexity caused by aqueous erosion  but although this is the primary form of all hills and that which will always cut against the sky in every distant range there are two great influences whose tendency is directly the reverse and which modify to a great degree both the evidences of stratification and this external form these are aqueous erosion and disintegration the latter only is to be taken into consideration when we have to do with minor features of crag but the former is a force in constant actionof the very utmost importancea force to which onehalf of the great outlines of all mountains is entirely owing and which has much influence upon every one of their details  now the tendency of aqueous action over a large elevated surface is always to make that surface symmetrically and evenly convex and domelike sloping gradually more and more as it descends until it reaches an inclination of about 40° at which slope it will descend perfectly straight to the valley for at that slope the soil washed from above will accumulate upon the hillside as it cannot lie in steeper beds this influence then is exercised more or less on all mountains with greater or less effect in proportion as the rock is harder or softer more or less liable to decomposition more or less recent in date of elevation and more or less characteristic in its original forms but it universally induces in the lower parts of mountains a series of the most exquisitely symmetrical convex curves terminating as they descend to the valley in uniform and uninterrupted slopes this symmetrical structure being perpetually interrupted by cliffs and projecting masses which give evidence of the interior parallelism of the mountain anatomy but which interrupt the convex forms more frequently by rising out of them than by indentation   § 12 and the effect of the action of torrents  there remains but one fact more to be noticed all mountains in some degree but especially those which are composed of soft or decomposing substance are delicately and symmetrically furrowed by the descent of streams the traces of their action commence at the very summits fine threads and multitudinous like the uppermost branches of a delicate tree they unite in groups as they descend concentrating gradually into dark undulating ravines into which the body of the mountain descends on each side at first in a convex curve but at the bottom with the same uniform slope on each side which it assumes in its final descent to the plain unless the rock be very hard when the stream will cut itself a vertical chasm at the bottom of the curves and there will be no even slope57 if on the other hand the rock be very soft the slopes will increase rapidly in height and depth from day to day washed away at the bottom and crumbling at the top until by their reaching the summit of the masses of rock which separate the active torrents the whole mountain is divided into a series of penthouselike ridges all guiding to its summit and becoming steeper and narrower as they ascend these in their turn being divided by similar but smaller ravinescaused in the same mannerinto the same kind of ridges and these again by another series the arrangement being carried finer and farther according to the softness of the rock the south side of saddleback in cumberland is a characteristic example and the montagne du tacondy in chamonix a noble instance of one of these ridges or buttresses with all its subdivisions on a colossal scale   § 13 the exceeding simplicity of contour caused by these influences  § 14 and multiplicity of feature  now we wish to draw especial attention to the broad and bold simplicity of mass and the excessive complication of details which influences like these acting on an enormous scale must inevitably produce in all mountain groups because each individual part and promontory being compelled to assume the same symmetrical curves as its neighbors and to descend at precisely the same slope to the valley falls in with their prevailing lines and becomes a part of a great and harmonious whole instead of an unconnected and discordant individual it is true that each of these members has its own touches of specific character its own projecting crags and peculiar hollows but by far the greater portion of its lines will be such as unite with though they do not repeat those of its neighbors and carry out the evidence of one great influence and spirit to the limits of the scene this effort is farther aided by the original unity and connection of the rocks themselves which though it often may be violently interrupted is never without evidence of existence for the very interruption itself forces the eye to feel that there is something to be interrupted a sympathy and similarity of lines and fractures which however full of variety and change of direction never lose the appearance of symmetry of one kind or another but on the other hand it is to be remembered that these great sympathizing masses are not one mountain but a thousand mountains that they are originally composed of a multitude of separate eminences hewn and chiselled indeed into associating form but each retaining still its marked points and features of characterthat each of these individual members has by the very process which assimilated it to the rest been divided and subdivided into equally multitudinous groups of minor mountains finally that the whole complicated system is interrupted forever and ever by daring manifestations of the inward mountain willby the precipice which has submitted to no modulation of the torrent and the peak which has bowed itself to no terror of the storm hence we see that the same imperative laws which require perfect simplicity of mass require infinite and termless complication of detailthat there will not be an inch nor a hairbreadth of the gigantic heap which has not its touch of separate character its own peculiar curve stealing out for an instant and then melting into the common line felt for a moment by the blue mist of the hollow beyond then lost when it crosses the enlightened slopethat all this multiplicity will be grouped into larger divisions each felt by their increasing aerial perspective and their instants of individual form these into larger and these into larger still until all are merged in the great impression and prevailing energy of the two or three vast dynasties which divide the kingdom of the scene   § 15 both utterly neglected in ancient art  there is no vestige nor shadow of approach to such treatment as this in the whole compass of ancient art whoever the master his hills wherever he has attempted them have not the slightest trace of association or connection they are separate conflicting confused petty and paltry heaps of earth there is no marking of distances or divisions in their body they may have holes in them but no valleysprotuberances and excrescences but no parts and in consequence are invariably diminutive and contemptible in their whole appearance and impression   § 16 the fidelity of treatment in turners daphne and leucippas  but look at the mass of mountain on the right in turners daphne hunting with leucippus it is simple broad and united as one surge of a swelling sea it rises in an unbroken line along the valley and lifts its promontories with an equal slope but it contains in its body ten thousand hills there is not a quarter of an inch of its surface without its suggestion of increasing distance and individual form first on the right you have a range of towerlike precipices the clinging wood climbing along their ledges and cresting their summits white waterfalls gleaming through its leaves not as in claudes scientific ideals poured in vast torrents over the top and carefully keeping all the way down on the most projecting parts of the sides but stealing down traced from point to point through shadow after shadow by their evanescent foam and flashing lighthere a wreath and there a raythrough the deep chasms and hollow ravines out of which rise the soft rounded slopes of mightier mountain surge beyond surge immense and numberless of delicate and gradual curve accumulating in the sky until their garment of forest is exchanged for the shadowy fold of slumbrous morning cloud above which the utmost silver peak shines islanded and alone put what mountain painting you will beside this of any other artist and its heights will look like molehills in comparison because it will not have the unity nor the multiplicity which are in nature and with turner the signs of size   § 17 and in the avalanche and inundation  again in the avalanche and inundation we have for the whole subject nothing but one vast bank of united mountain and one stretch of uninterrupted valley though the bank is broken into promontory beyond promontory peak above peak each the abode of a new tempest the arbiter of a separate desolation divided from each other by the rushing of the snow by the motion of the storm by the thunder of the torrent the mighty unison of their dark and lofty line the brotherhood of ages is preserved unbroken and the broad valley at their feet though measured league after league away by a thousand passages of sun and darkness and marked with fate beyond fate of hamlet and of inhabitant lies yet but as a straight and narrow channel a filling furrow before the flood whose work will you compare with this salvators gray heaps of earth seven yards high covered with bunchy brambles that we may be under no mistake about the size thrown about at random in a little plain beside a zigzagging river just wide enough to admit of the possibility of there being fish in it and with banks just broad enough to allow the respectable angler or hermit to sit upon them conveniently in the foreground is there more of nature in such paltriness think you than in the valley and the mountain which bend to each other like the trough of the sea with the flank of the one swept in one surge into the height of heaven until the pine forests lie on its immensity like the shadows of narrow clouds and the hollow of the other laid league by league into the blue of the air until its white villages flash in the distance only like the fall of a sunbeam   § 18 the rarity among secondary hills of steep slopes or high         precipices  but let us examine by what management of the details themselves this wholeness and vastness of effect are given we have just seen § 11 that it is impossible for the slope of a mountain not actually a precipice of rock to exceed 35° or among secondary 40° and that by far the greater part of all hillsurface is composed of graceful curves of much less degree than this reaching 40° only as their ultimate and utmost inclination it must be farther observed that the interruptions to such curves by precipices or steps are always small in proportion to the slopes themselves precipices rising vertically more than 100 feet are very rare among the secondary hills of which we are speaking i am not aware of any cliff in england or wales where a plumbline can swing clear for 200 feet and even although sometimes with intervals breaks and steps we get perhaps 800 feet of a slope of 60° or 70° yet not only are these cases very rare but even these have little influence on the great contours of a mountain 4000 or 5000 feet in elevation being commonly balanced by intervals of ascent not exceeding 6° or 8° the result of which is first that the peaks and precipices of a mountain appear as little more than jags or steps emerging from its great curves and secondly that the bases of all hills are enormously extensive as compared with their elevation so that there must be always a horizontal distance between the observer and the summit five or six times exceeding the perpendicular one   § 19 and consequent expression of horizontal distance in their ascent  now it is evident that whatever the actual angle of elevation of the mountain may be every exhibition of this horizontal distance between us and the summit is an addition to its height and of course to its impressiveness while every endeavor to exhibit its slope as steep and sudden is diminution at once of its distance and elevation in consequence nature is constantly endeavoring to impress upon us this horizontal distance which even in spite of all her means of manifesting it we are apt to forget or underestimate and all her noblest effects depend on the full measurement and feeling of it and it is to the abundant and marvellous expression of it by turner that i would direct especial attention as being that which is in itself demonstrative of the highest knowledge and powerknowledge in the constant use of lines of subdued slope in preference to steep or violent ascents and in the perfect subjection of all such features when they necessarily occur to the larger masses and power in the inimitable statements of retiring space by mere painting of surface details without the aid of crossing shadows divided forms or any other artifice   § 20 full statement of all these facts in various works of turner         caudebec etc  the caudebec in the rivers of france is a fine instance of almost every fact which we have been pointing out we have in it first the clear expression of what takes place constantly among hillsthat the river as it passes through the valley will fall backwards and forwards from side to side lying first if i may so speak with all its weight against the hills on the one side and then against those on the other so that as here it is exquisitely told in each of its circular sweeps the whole force of its current is brought deep and close to the bases of the hills while the water on the side next the plain is shallow deepening gradually in consequence of this the hills are cut away at their bases by the current so that their slopes are interrupted by precipices mouldering to the water observe first how nobly turner has given us the perfect unity of the whole mass of hill making us understand that every ravine in it has been cut gradually by streams the first eminence beyond the city is not disjointed from or independent of the one succeeding but evidently part of the same whole originally united separated only by the action of the stream between the association of the second and third is still more clearly told for we see that there has been a little longitudinal valley running along the brow of their former united mass which after the ravine had been cut between formed the two jags which turner has given us at the same point in each of their curves this great triple group has however been originally distinct from those beyond it for we see that these latter are only the termination of the enormous even slope which appears again on the extreme right having been interrupted by the rise of the near hills observe how the descent of the whole series is kept gentle and subdued never suffered to become steep except where it has been cut away by the river the sudden precipice caused by which is exquisitely marked in the last two promontories where they are defined against the bright horizon and finally observe how in the ascent of the nearest eminence beyond the city without one cast shadow or any division of distances every yard of surface is felt to be retiring by the mere painting of its detailshow we are permitted to walk up it and along its top and are carried before we are half way up a league or two forward into the picture the difficulty of doing this however can scarcely be appreciated except by an artist   § 21 the use of considering geological truths  i do not mean to assert that this great painter is acquainted with the geological laws and facts he has thus illustrated i am not aware whether he be or not i merely wish to demonstrate in points admitting of demonstration that intense observation of and strict adherence to truth which it is impossible to demonstrate in its less tangible and more delicate manifestations however i may feel the truth of every touch and line i cannot prove truth except in large and general features and i leave it to the arbitration of every mans reason whether it be not likely that the painter who is thus so rigidly faithful in great things that every one of his pictures might be the illustration of a lecture on the physical sciences is not likely to be faithful also in small   § 22 expression of retiring surface by turner contrasted with the work         of claude  honfleur and the scene between clairmont and mauves supply us with farther instances of the same grand simplicity of treatment and the latter is especially remarkable for its expression of the furrowing of the hills by descending water in the complete roundness and symmetry of their curves and in the delicate and sharp shadows which are cast in the undulating ravines it is interesting to compare with either of these noble works such hills as those of claude on the left of the picture marked 260 in the dulwich gallery there is no detail nor surface in one of them not an inch of ground for us to stand upon we must either sit astride upon the edge or fall to the bottom i could not point to a more complete instance of mountain calumniation nor can i oppose it more completely in every circumstance than with the honfleur of turner already mentioned in which there is not one edge nor division admitted and yet we are permitted to climb up the hill from the town and pass far into the mist along its top and so descend mile after mile along the ridge to seaward until without one break in the magnificent unity of progress we are carried down to the utmost horizon and contrast the brown paint of claude which you can only guess to be meant for rock or soil because it is brown with turners profuse pauseless richness of feature carried through all the enormous spacethe unmeasured wealth of exquisite detail over which the mind can dwell and walk and wander and feast forever without finding either one break in its vast simplicity or one vacuity in its exhaustless splendor   § 23 the same moderation of slope in the contours of his higher hills  but these and hundreds of others which it is sin not to dwell uponwooded hills and undulating moors of north englandrolling surges of park and forest of the southsoft and vineclad ranges of french coteaux casting their oblique shadows on silver leagues of glancing riversand olivewhitened promontories of alp and apennine are only instances of turners management of the lower and softer hills in the bolder examples of his powers where he is dealing with lifted masses of enormous mountain we shall still find him as cautious in his use of violent slopes or vertical lines and still as studied in his expression of retiring surface we never get to the top of one of his hills without being tired with our walk not by the steepness observe but by the stretch for we are carried up towards the heaven by such delicate gradation of line that we scarcely feel that we have left the earth before we find ourselves among the clouds the skiddaw in the illustrations to scott is a noble instance of this majestic moderation the mountain lies in the morning light like a level vapor its gentle lines of ascent are scarcely felt by the eye it rises without effort or exertion by the mightiness of its mass every slope is full of slumber and we know not how it has been exalted until we find it laid as a floor for the walking of the eastern clouds so again in the fort augustus where the whole elevation of the hills depends on the soft lines of swelling surface which undulate back through leagues of mist carrying us unawares higher and higher above the diminished lake until when we are all but exhausted with the endless distance the mountains make their last spring and bear us in that instant of exertion half way to heaven   § 24 the peculiar difficulty of investigating the more essential truths         of hill outline  i ought perhaps rather to have selected as instances of mountain form such elaborate works as the oberwesel or lake of uri but i have before expressed my dislike of speaking of such magnificent pictures as these by parts and indeed all proper consideration of the hill drawing of turner must be deferred until we are capable of testing it by the principles of beauty for after all the most essential qualities of linethose on which all right delineation of mountain character must depend are those which are only to be explained or illustrated by appeals to our feeling of what is beautiful there is an expression and a feeling about all the hill lines of nature which i think i shall be able hereafter to explain but it is not to be reduced to line and rulenot to be measured by angles or described by compassesnot to be chipped out by the geologist or equated by the mathematician it is intangible incalculablea thing to be felt not understoodto be loved not comprehendeda music of the eyes a melody of the heart whose truth is known only by its sweetness   § 25 works of other modern artists clarkson stanfield  § 26 importance of particular and individual truth in hill drawing  i can scarcely without repeating myself to tediousness enter at present into proper consideration of the mountain drawing of other modern painters we have fortunately several by whom the noble truths which we have seen so fully exemplified by turner are also deeply felt and faithfully rendered though there is a necessity for the perfect statement of them of such an unison of freedom of thought with perfect mastery over the greatest mechanical difficulties as we can scarcely hope to see attained by more than one man in our age very nearly the same words which we used in reference to stanfields drawings of the central clouds might be applied to his rendering of mountain truth he occupies exactly the same position with respect to other artists in earth as in cloud none can be said really to draw the mountain as he will to have so perfect a mastery over its organic development but there is nevertheless in all his works some want of feeling and individuality he has studied and mastered his subject to the bottom but he trusts too much to that past study and rather invents his hills from his possessed stores of knowledge than expresses in them the fresh ideas received from nature hence in all that he does we feel a little too much that the hills are his own we cannot swear to their being the particular crags and individual promontories which break the cone of ischia or shadow the waves of maggiore we are nearly sure on the contrary that nothing but the outline is local and that all the filling up has been done in the study now we have already shown sect i chap iii that particular truths are more important than general ones and this is just one of the cases in which that rule especially applies nothing is so great a sign of truth and beauty in mountain drawing as the appearance of individualitynothing is so great a proof of real imagination and invention as the appearance that nothing has been imagined or invented we ought to feel of every inch of mountain that it must have existence in reality that if we had lived near the place we should have known every crag of it and that there must be people to whom every crevice and shadow of the picture is fraught with recollections and colored with associations the moment the artist can make us feel thisthe moment he can make us think that he has done nothing that nature has done allthat moment he becomes ennobled he proves himself great as long as we remember him we cannot respect him we honor him most when we most forget him he becomes great when he becomes invisible and we may perhaps be permitted to express our hope that mr stanfield willour conviction that he mustif he would advance in his rank as an artist attend more to local character and give us generally less of the stanfield limestone he ought to study with greater attention the rocks which afford finer divisions and more delicate parts slates and gneiss and he ought to observe more fondly and faithfully those beautiful laws and lines of swell and curvature by intervals of which nature sets off and relieves the energy of her peaked outlines he is at present apt to be too rugged and in consequence to lose size of his best manner of drawing hills i believe i can scarcely give a better example than the rocks of suli engraved in findens illustrations to byron it is very grand and perfect in all parts and points   § 27 works of copley fielding his hill feeling  copley fielding is peculiarly graceful and affectionate in his drawing of the inferior mountains but as with his clouds so with his hills as long as he keeps to silvery films of misty outline or purple shadows mingled with the evening light he is true and beautiful but the moment he withdraws the mass out of its veiling mystery he is lost his worst drawings therefore are those on which he has spent most time for he is sure to show weakness wherever he gives detail we believe that all his errors proceed as we observed before from his not working with the chalk or pencil and that if he would paint half the number of pictures in the year which he usually produces and spend his spare time in hard dry study of forms the half he painted would be soon worth double the present value of all for he really has deep and genuine feeling of hill charactera far higher perception of space elevation incorporeal color and all those qualities which are the poetry of mountains than any other of our watercolor painters and it is an infinite pity that he should not give to these delicate feelings the power of realization which might be attained by a little labor a few thorough studies of his favorite mountains benvenue or bencruachan in clear strong front chiaroscuro allowing himself neither color nor mist nor any means of getting over the ground but downright drawing would we think open his eyes to sources of beauty of which he now takes no cognizance he ought not however to repeat the same subjects so frequently as the casting about of the mind for means of varying them blunts the feelings to truth and he should remember that an artist who is not making progress is nearly certain to be retrograding and that progress is not to be made by working in the study or by mere labor bestowed on the repetition of unchanging conceptions   § 28 works of j d harding and others  j d harding would paint mountains very nobly if he made them of more importance in his compositions but they are usually little more than backgrounds for his foliage or buildings and it is his present system to make his backgrounds very slight his color is very beautiful indeed both his and fieldings are far more refined than stanfields we wish he would oftener take up some wild subject dependent for interest on its mountain forms alone as we should anticipate the highest results from his perfect drawing and we think that such an exercise occasionally gone completely through would counteract a tendency which we perceive in his present distances to become a little thin and cutting if not incomplete  the late g robson was a man most thoroughly acquainted with all the characteristics of our own island hills and some of the outlines of john varley showed very grand feeling of energy of form   footnotes    56 i have above exhausted all terms of vituperation and probably     disgusted the reader and yet i have not spoken with enough     severity i know not any terms of blame that are bitter enough to     chastise justly the mountain drawings of salvator in the pictures of     the pitti palace    57 some terrific cuts and chasms of this kind occur on the north     side of the valais from sion to briey the torrent from the great     aletsch glacier descends through one of them elsewhere chasms may     be found as narrow but few so narrow and deep                                      chapter iv                               of the foreground   we have now only to observe the close characteristics of the rocks and soils to which the large masses of which we have been speaking owe their ultimate characters   § 1 what rocks were the chief components of ancient landscape        foreground  we have already seen that there exists a marked distinction between those stratified rocks whose beds are amorphous and without subdivision as many limestones and sandstones and those which are divided by lines of lamination as all slates the last kind of rock is the more frequent in nature and forms the greater part of all hill scenery it has however been successfully grappled with by few even of the moderns except turner while there is no single example of any aim at it or thought of it among the ancients whose foregrounds as far as it is possible to guess at their intention through their concentrated errors are chosen from among the tufa and travertin of the lower apennines the ugliest as well as the least characteristic rocks of nature and whose larger features of rock scenery if we look at them with a predetermination to find in them a resemblance of something may be pronounced at least liker the mountain limestone than anything else i shall glance therefore at the general characters of these materials first in order that we may be able to appreciate the fidelity of rockdrawing on which salvators reputation has been built   § 2 salvators limestones the real characters of the rock its        fractures and obtuseness of angles  the massive limestones separate generally into irregular blocks tending to the form of cubes or parallelopipeds and terminated by tolerably smooth planes the weather acting on the edges of these blocks rounds them off but the frost which while it cannot penetrate nor split the body of the stone acts energetically on the angles splits off the rounded fragments and supplies sharp fresh and complicated edges hence the angles of such blocks are usually marked by a series of steps and fractures in which the peculiar character of the rock is most distinctly seen the effect being increased in many limestones by the interposition of two or three thinner beds between the large strata of which the block has been a part these thin laminæ breaking easily and supplying a number of fissures and lines at the edge of the detached mass thus as a general principle if a rock have character anywhere it will be on the angle and however even and smooth its great planes may be it will usually break into variety where it turns a corner in one of the most exquisite pieces of rock truth ever put on canvas the foreground of the napoleon in the academy 1842 this principle was beautifully exemplified in the complicated fractures of the upper angle just where it turned from the light while the planes of the rock were varied only by the modulation they owed to the waves it follows from this structure that the edges of all rock being partially truncated first by large fractures and then by the rounding of the fine edges of these by the weather perpetually present convex transitions from the light to the dark side the planes of the rock almost always swelling a little from the angle   § 3 salvators acute angles caused by the meeting of concave curves  now it will be found throughout the works of salvator that his most usual practice was to give a concave sweep of the brush for his first expression of the dark side leaving the paint darkest towards the light by which daring and original method of procedure he has succeeded in covering his foregrounds with forms which approximate to those of drapery of ribbons of crushed cocked hats of locks of hair of waves leaves or anything in short flexible or tough but which of course are not only unlike but directly contrary to the forms which nature has impressed on rocks58   § 4 peculiar distinctness of light and shade in the rocks of nature  § 5 peculiar confusion of both in the rocks of salvator  and the circular and sweeping strokes or stains which are dashed at random over their surfaces only fail of destroying all resemblance whatever to rock structure from their frequent want of any meaning at all and from the impossibility of our supposing any of them to be representative of shade now if there be any part of landscape in which nature develops her principles of light and shade more clearly than another it is rock for the dark sides of fractured stone receive brilliant reflexes from the lighted surfaces on which the shadows are marked with the most exquisite precision especially because owing to the parallelism of cleavage the surfaces lie usually in directions nearly parallel hence every crack and fissure has its shadow and reflected light separated with the most delicious distinctness and the organization and solid form of all parts are told with a decision of language which to be followed with anything like fidelity requires the most transparent color and the most delicate and scientific drawing so far are the works of the old landscapepainters from rendering this that it is exceedingly rare to find a single passage in which the shadow can even be distinguished from the dark sidethey scarcely seem to know the one to be darker than the other and the strokes of the brush are not used to explain or express a form known or conceived but are dashed and daubed about without any aim beyond the covering of the canvas a rock the old masters appear to say to themselves is a great irregular formless characterless lump but it must have shade upon it and any gray marks will do for that shade   § 6 and total want of any expression of hardness or brittleness  § 7 instances in particular pictures  finally while few if any of the rocks of nature are untraversed by delicate and slender fissures whose black sharp lines are the only means by which the peculiar quality in which rocks most differ from the other objects of the landscape brittleness can be effectually suggested we look in vain among the blots and stains with which the rocks of ancient art are loaded for any vestige or appearance of fissure or splintering toughness and malleability appear to be the qualities whose expression is most aimed at sometimes sponginess softness flexibility tenuity and occasionally transparency take for instance the foreground of salvator in no 220 of the dulwich gallery there is on the righthand side of it an object which i never walk through the room without contemplating for a minute or two with renewed solicitude and anxiety of mind indulging in a series of very wild and imaginative conjectures as to its probable or possible meaning i think there is reason to suppose that the artist intended it either for a very large stone or for the trunk of a tree but any decision as to its being either one or the other of these must i conceive be the extreme of rashness it melts into the ground on one side and might reasonably be conjectured to form a part of it having no trace of woody structure or color but on the other side it presents a series of concave curves interrupted by cogs like those of a waterwheel which the boldest theorist would certainly not feel himself warranted in supposing symbolical of rock the forms which this substance whatever it be assumes will be found repeated though in a less degree in the foreground of no 159 where they are evidently meant for rock   § 8 compared with the works of stanfield  § 9 their absolute opposition in every particular  let us contrast with this system of rockdrawing the faithful scientific and dexterous studies of nature which we find in the works of clarkson stanfield he is a man especially to be opposed to the old masters because he usually confines himself to the same rock subjects as theythe mouldering and furrowed crags of the secondary formation which arrange themselves more or less into broad and simple masses and in the rendering of these it is impossible to go beyond him nothing can surpass his care his firmness or his success in marking the distinct and sharp light and shade by which the form is explained never confusing it with local color however richly his surfacetexture may be given while the wonderful play of line with which he will vary and through which he will indicate the regularity of stratification is almost as instructive as that of nature herself i cannot point to any of his works as better or more characteristic than others but his ischia in the present british institution may be taken as a fair average example the botallack mine cornwall engraved in the coast scenery gives us a very finished and generic representation of rock whose primal organization has been violently affected by external influences we have the stratification and cleavage indicated at its base every fissure being sharp angular and decisive disguised gradually as it rises by the rounding of the surface and the successive furrows caused by the descent of streams but the exquisite drawing of the foreground is especially worthy of notice no huge concave sweeps of the brush no daubing or splashing here every inch of it is brittle and splintery and the fissures are explained to the eye by the most perfect speaking light and shadewe can stumble over the edges of them the east cliff hastings is another very fine example from the exquisite irregularity with which its squareness of general structure is varied and disguised observe how totally contrary every one of its lines is to the absurdities of salvator stanfields are all angular and straight every apparent curve made up of right lines while salvators are all sweeping and flourishing like so much penmanship stanfields lines pass away into delicate splintery fissures salvators are broad daubs throughout not one of stanfields lines is like another every one of salvators mocks all the rest all stanfields curves where his universal angular character is massed as on the lefthand side into large sweeping forms are convex salvators are every one concave   § 10 the rocks of j d harding  the foregrounds of j d harding and rocks of his middle distances are also thoroughly admirable he is not quite so various and undulating in his line as stanfield and sometimes in his middle distances is wanting in solidity owing to a little confusion of the dark side and shadow with each other or with the local color but his work in near passages of freshbroken sharpedged rock is absolute perfection excelling stanfield in the perfect freedom and facility with which his fragments are splintered and scattered true in every line without the least apparent effort stanfields best works are laborious but hardings rocks fall from under his hand as if they had just crashed down the hillside flying on the instant into lovely form in color also he incomparably surpasses stanfield who is apt to verge upon mud or be cold in his gray the rich lichenous and changeful warmth and delicate weathered grays of hardings rock illustrated as they are by the most fearless firm and unerring drawing render his wild pieces of torrent shore the finest things next to the work of turner in english foreground art  j b pyne has very accurate knowledge of limestone rock and expresses it clearly and forcibly but it is much to be regretted that this clever artist appears to be losing all sense of color and is getting more and more mannered in execution evidently never studying from nature except with the previous determination to pynize everything59   § 11 characters of loose earth and soil  § 12 its exceeding grace and fulness of feature  before passing to turner let us take one more glance at the foregrounds of the old masters with reference not to their management of rock which is comparatively a rare component part of their foregrounds but to the common soil which they were obliged to paint constantly and whose forms and appearances are the same all over the world a steep bank of loose earth of any kind that has been at all exposed to the weather contains in it though it may not be three feet high features capable of giving high gratification to a careful observer it is almost a facsimile of a mountain slope of soft and decomposing rock it possesses nearly as much variety of character and is governed by laws of organization no less rigid it is furrowed in the first place by undulating lines by the descent of the rain little ravines which are cut precisely at the same slope as those of the mountain and leave ridges scarcely less graceful in their contour and beautifully sharp in their chiselling where a harder knot of ground or a stone occurs the earth is washed from beneath it and accumulates above it and there we have a little precipice connected by a sweeping curve at its summit with the great slope and casting a sharp dark shadow where the soil has been soft it will probably be washed away underneath until it gives way and leaves a jagged hanging irregular line of fracture and all these circumstances are explained to the eye in sunshine with the most delicious clearness every touch of shadow being expressive of some particular truth of structure and bearing witness to the symmetry into which the whole mass has been reduced where this operation has gone on long and vegetation has assisted in softening the outlines we have our ground brought into graceful and irregular curves of infinite variety but yet always so connected with each other and guiding to each other that the eye never feels them as separate things nor feels inclined to count them nor perceives a likeness in one to the other they are not repetitions of each other but are different parts of one system each would be imperfect without the one next to it   § 13 the ground of teniers  now it is all but impossible to express distinctly the particulars wherein this fine character of curve consists and to show in definite examples what it is which makes one representation right and another wrong the ground of teniers for instance in no 139 in the dulwich gallery is an example of all that is wrong it is a representation of the forms of shaken and disturbed soil such as we should see here and there after an earthquake or over the ruins of fallen buildings it has not one contour nor character of the soil of nature and yet i can scarcely tell you why except that the curves repeat one another and are monotonous in their flow and are unbroken by the delicate angle and momentary pause with which the feeling of nature would have touched them and are disunited so that the eye leaps from this to that and does not pass from one to the other without being able to stop drawn on by the continuity of line neither is there any undulation or furrowing of watermark nor in one spot or atom of the whole surface is there distinct explanation of form to the eye by means of a determined shadow all is mere sweeping of the brush over the surface with various ground colors without a single indication of character by means of real shade   § 14 importance of these minor parts and points  § 15 the observance of them is the real distinction between the master         and the novice  let not these points be deemed unimportant the truths of form in common ground are quite as valuable let me anticipate myself for a moment quite as beautiful as any others which nature presents and in lowland landscape they present us with a species of line which it is quite impossible to obtain in any other waythe alternately flowing and broken line of mountain scenery which however small its scale is always of inestimable value contrasted with the repetitions of organic form which we are compelled to give in vegetation a really great artist dwells on every inch of exposed soil with care and delight and renders it one of the most essential speaking and pleasurable parts of his composition and be it remembered that the man who in the most conspicuous part of his foreground will violate truth with every stroke of the pencil is not likely to be more careful in other parts of it and that in the little bits which i fix upon for animadversion i am not pointing out solitary faults but only the most characteristic examples of the falsehood which is everywhere and which renders the whole foreground one mass of contradictions and absurdities nor do i myself see wherein the great difference lies between a master and a novice except in the rendering of the finer truths of which i am at present speaking to handle the brush freely and to paint grass and weeds with accuracy enough to satisfy the eye are accomplishments which a year or twos practice will give any man but to trace among the grass and weeds those mysteries of invention and combination by which nature appeals to the intellectto render the delicate fissure and descending curve and undulating shadow of the mouldering soil with gentle and fine finger like the touch of the rain itselfto find even in all that appears most trifling or contemptible fresh evidence of the constant working of the divine power for glory and for beauty and to teach it and proclaim it to the unthinking and the unregardlessthis as it is the peculiar province and faculty of the mastermind so it is the peculiar duty which is demanded of it by the deity   § 16 the ground of cuyp  § 17 and of claude  § 18 the entire weakness and childishness of the latter  § 19 compared with the work of turner  it would take me no reasonable nor endurable time if i were to point out one half of the various kinds and classes of falsehood which the inventive faculties of the old masters succeeded in originating in the drawing of foregrounds it is not this man nor that man nor one school nor another all agree in entire repudiation of everything resembling facts and in the high degree of absurdity of what they substitute for them even cuyp who evidently saw and studied near nature as an artist should donot fishing for idealities but taking what nature gave him and thanking her for iteven he appears to have supposed that the drawing of the earth might be trusted to chance or imagination and in consequence strews his banks with lumps of dough instead of stones perhaps however the beautiful foregrounds of claude afford the most remarkable instances of childishness and incompetence of all that of his morning landscape with the large group of trees and high singlearched bridge in the national gallery is a pretty fair example of the kind of error which he constantly falls into i will not say anything of the agreeable composition of the three banks rising one behind another from the water i merely affirm that it amounts to a demonstration that all three were painted in the artists study without any reference to nature whatever in fact there is quite enough intrinsic evidence in each of them to prove this seeing that what appears to be meant for vegetation upon them amounts to nothing more than a green stain on their surfaces the more evidently false because the leaves of the trees twenty yards farther off are all perfectly visible and distinct and that the sharp lines with which each cuts against that beyond it are not only such as crumbling earth could never show or assume but are maintained through their whole progress ungraduated unchanging and unaffected by any of the circumstances of varying shade to which every one of natures lines is inevitably subjected in fact the whole arrangement is the impotent struggle of a tyro to express by successive edges that approach of earth which he finds himself incapable of expressing by the drawing of the surface claude wished to make you understand that the edge of his pond came nearer and nearer he had probably often tried to do this with an unbroken bank or a bank only varied by the delicate and harmonized anatomy of nature and he had found that owing to his total ignorance of the laws of perspective such efforts on his part invariably ended in his reducing his pond to the form of a round o and making it look perpendicular much comfort and solace of mind in such unpleasant circumstances may be derived from instantly dividing the obnoxious bank into a number of successive promontories and developing their edges with completeness and intensity every schoolgirls drawing as soon as her mind has arrived at so great a degree of enlightenment as to perceive that perpendicular water is objectionable will supply us with edifying instances of this unfailing resource and this foreground of claudes is only one out of the thousand cases in which he has been reduced to it and if it be asked how the proceeding differs from that of nature i have only to point to nature herself as she is drawn in the foreground of turners mercury and argus a case precisely similar to claudes of earthy crumbling banks cut away by water it will be found in this picture and i am now describing natures work and turners with the same words that the whole distance is given by retirement of solid surface and that if ever an edge is expressed it is only felt for an instant and then lost again so that the eye cannot stop at it and prepare for a long jump to another like it but is guided over it and round it into the hollow beyond and thus the whole receding mass of ground going back for more than a quarter of a mile is made completely oneno part of it is separated from the rest for an instantit is all united and its modulations are members not divisions of its mass but those modulations are countlessheaving here sinking therenow swelling now mouldering now blending now breakinggiving in fact to the foreground of this universal master precisely the same qualities which we have before seen in his hills as claude gave to his foreground precisely the same qualities which we had before found in his hillsinfinite unity in the one case finite division in the other   § 20 general features of turners foreground  let us then having now obtained some insight into the principles of the old masters in foreground drawing contrast them throughout with those of our great modern master the investigation of the excellence of turners drawing becomes shorter and easier as we proceed because the great distinctions between his work and that of other painters are the same whatever the object or subject may be and after once showing the general characters of the particular specific forms under consideration we have only to point in the works of turner to the same principles of infinity and variety in carrying them out which we have before insisted upon with reference to other subjects   § 21 geological structure of his rocks in the fall of the tees  § 22 their convex surfaces and fractured edges  § 23 and perfect unity  § 24 various parts whose history is told us by the details of the         drawing  the upper fall of the tees yorkshire engraved in the england series may be given as a standard example of rockdrawing to be opposed to the work of salvator we have in the great face of rock which divides the two streams horizontal lines which indicate the real direction of the strata and these same lines are given in ascending perspective all along the precipice on the right but we see also on the central precipice fissures absolutely vertical which inform us of one series of joints dividing these horizontal strata and the exceeding smoothness and evenness of the precipice itself inform us that it has been caused by a great separation of substance in the direction of another more important line of joints running in a direction across the river accordingly we see on the left that the whole summit of the precipice is divided again and again by this great series of joints into vertical beds which lie against each other with their sides towards us and are traversed downwards by the same vertical lines traceable on the face of the central cliff now let me direct especial attention to the way in which turner has marked over this general and grand unity of structure the modifying effects of the weather and the torrent observe how the whole surface of the hill above the precipice on the left60 is brought into one smooth unbroken curvature of gentle convexity until it comes to the edge of the precipice and then just on the angle compare § 2 breaks into the multiplicity of fissure which marks its geological structure observe how every one of the separate blocks into which it divides is rounded and convex in its salient edges turned to the weather and how every one of their inward angles is marked clear and sharp by the determined shadow and transparent reflex observe how exquisitely graceful are all the curves of the convex surfaces indicating that every one of them has been modelled by the winding and undulating of running water and how gradually they become steeper as they descend until they are torn down into the face of the precipice finally observe the exquisite variety of all the touches which express fissure or shade every one in varying directions and with new forms and yet throughout indicating that perfect parallelism which at once explained to us the geology of the rock and falling into one grand mass treated with the same simplicity of light and shade which a great portrait painter adopts in treating the features of the human face which though each has its own separate chiaroscuro never disturb the wholeness and grandeur of the head considered as one ball or mass so here one deep and marked piece of shadow indicates the greatest proximity of the rounded mass and from this every shade becomes fainter and fainter until all are lost in the obscurity and dimness of the hanging precipice and the shattering fall again see how the same fractures just upon the edge take place with the central cliff above the righthand fall and how the force of the water is told us by the confusion of débris accumulated in its channel in fact the great quality about turners drawings which more especially proves their transcendent truth is the capability they afford us of reasoning on past and future phenomena just as if we had the actual rocks before us for this indicates not that one truth is given nor another not that a pretty or interesting morsel has been selected here and there but that the whole truth has been given with all the relations of its parts so that we can pick and choose our points of pleasure or of thought for ourselves and reason upon the whole with the same certainty which we should after having climbed and hammered over the rocks bit by bit with this drawing before him a geologist could give a lecture upon the whole system of aqueous erosion and speculate as safely upon the past and future states of this very spot as if he were standing and getting wet with the spray he would tell you at once that the waterfall was in a state of rapid recession that it had once formed a wide cataract just at the spot where the figure is sitting on the heap of débris and that when it was there part of it came down by the channel on the left its bed being still marked by the delicately chiselled lines of fissure he would tell you that the foreground had also once been the top of the fall and that the vertical fissures on the right of it were evidently then the channel of a side stream he would tell you that the fall was then much lower than it is now and that being lower it had less force and cut itself a narrower bed and that the spot where it reached the higher precipice is marked by the expansion of the wide basin which its increased violence has excavated and by the gradually increasing concavity of the rocks below which we see have been hollowed into a complete vault by the elastic bound of the water but neither he nor i could tell you with what exquisite and finished marking of every fragment and particle of soil or rock both in its own structure and the evidence it bears of these great influences the whole of this is confirmed and carried out   § 25 beautiful instance of an exception to general rules in the         llanthony  with this inimitable drawing we may compare the rocks in the foreground of the llanthony these latter are not divided by joints but into thin horizontal and united beds which the torrent in its times of flood has chiselled away leaving one exposed under another with the sweeping marks of its eddies upon their edges and here we have an instance of an exception to a general rule occasioned by particular and local action we have seen that the action of water over any surface universally whether falling as in rain or sweeping as a torrent induces convexity of form but when we have rocks in situ as here exposed at their edges to the violent action of an eddy that eddy will cut a vault or circular space for itself as we saw on a large scale with the high waterfall and we have a concave curve interrupting the general contours of the rock and thus turner while every edge of his masses is rounded and the moment we rise above the level of the water all is convex has interrupted the great contours of his strata with concave curves precisely where the last waves of the torrent have swept against the exposed edges of the beds nothing could more strikingly prove the depth of that knowledge by which every touch of this consummate artist is regulated that universal command of subject which never acts for a moment on anything conventional or habitual but fills every corner and space with new evidence of knowledge and fresh manifestation of thought   § 26 turners drawing of detached blocks of weathered stone  the lower fall of the tees with the chainbridge might serve us for an illustration of all the properties and forms of vertical beds of rock as the upper fall has of horizontal but we pass rather to observe in detached pieces of foreground the particular modulation of parts which cannot be investigated in the grand combinations of general mass  the blocks of stone which form the foreground of the ulleswater are i believe the finest example in the world of the finished drawing of rocks which have been subjected to violent aqueous action their surfaces seem to palpitate from the fine touch of the waves and every part of them is rising or falling in soft swell or gentle depression though the eye can scarcely trace the fine shadows on which this chiselling of the surface depends and with all this every block of them has individual character dependent on the expression of the angular lines of which its contours were first formed and which is retained and felt through all the modulation and melting of the waterworn surface and what is done here in the most important part of the picture to be especially attractive to the eye is often done by turner with lavish and overwhelming power in the accumulated débris of a wide foreground strewed with the ruin of ages as for instance in the junction of the greta and tees where he has choked the torrent bed with a mass of shattered rock thrown down with the profusion and carelessness of nature herself and yet every separate block is a study and has evidently been drawn from nature chiselled and varied in its parts as if it were to be the chief member of a separate subject yet without ever losing in a single instance its subordinate position or occasioning throughout the whole accumulated multitude the repetition of a single line   § 27 and of complicated foreground  i consider cases like these of perfect finish and new conception applied and exerted in the drawing of every member of a confused and almost countlesslydivided system about the most wonderful as well as the most characteristic passages of turners foregrounds it is done not less marvellously though less distinctly in the individual parts of all his broken ground as in examples like these of separate blocks the articulation of such a passage as the nearest bank in the picture we have already spoken of at so great length the upper fall of the tees might serve us for a days study if we were to go into it part by part but it is impossible to do this except with the pencil we can only repeat the same general observations about eternal change and unbroken unity and tell you to observe how the eye is kept throughout on solid and retiring surfaces instead of being thrown as by claude on flat and equal edges you cannot find a single edge in turners work you are everywhere kept upon round surfaces and you go back on these you cannot tell hownever taking a leap but progressing imperceptibly along the unbroken bank till you find yourself a quarter of a mile into the picture beside the figure at the bottom of the waterfall   § 28 and of loose soil  finally the bank of earth on the right of the grand drawing of penmaen mawr may be taken as the standard of the representation of soft soil modelled by descending rain and may serve to show us how exquisite in character are the resultant lines and how full of every species of attractive and even sublime quality if we only are wise enough not to scorn the study of them the higher the mind it may be taken as a universal rule the less it will scorn that which appears to be small or unimportant and the rank of a painter may always be determined by observing how he uses and with what respect he views the minutiæ of nature greatness of mind is not shown by admitting small things but by making small things great under its influence he who can take no interest in what is small will take false interest in what is great he who cannot make a bank sublime will make a mountain ridiculous   § 29 the unison of all in the ideal foregrounds of the academy         pictures  § 30 and the great lesson to be received from all  it is not until we have made ourselves acquainted with these simple facts of form as they are illustrated by the slighter works of turner that we can become at all competent to enjoy the combination of all in such works as the mercury and argus or bay of baiæ in which the mind is at first bewildered by the abundant outpouring of the masters knowledge often as i have paused before these noble works i never felt on returning to them as if i had ever seen them before for their abundance is so deep and various that the mind according to its own temper at the time of seeing perceives some new series of truths rendered in them just as it would on revisiting a natural scene and detects new relations and associations of these truths which set the whole picture in a different light at every return to it and this effect is especially caused by the management of the foreground for the more marked objects of the picture may be taken one by one and thus examined and known but the foregrounds of turner are so united in all their parts that the eye cannot take them by divisions but is guided from stone to stone and bank to bank discovering truths totally different in aspect according to the direction in which it approaches them and approaching them in a different direction and viewing them as a part of a new system every time that it begins its course at a new point one lesson however we are invariably taught by all however approached or viewedthat the work of the great spirit of nature is as deep and unapproachable in the lowest as in the noblest objectsthat the divine mind is as visible in its full energy of operation on every lowly bank and mouldering stone as in the lifting of the pillars of heaven and settling the foundation of the earth and that to the rightly perceiving mind there is the same infinity the same majesty the same power the same unity and the same perfection manifest in the casting of the clay as in the scattering of the cloud in the mouldering of the dust as in the kindling of the daystar   footnotes    58 i have cut out a passage in this place which insisted on the     angular character of rocksnot because it was false but because     it was incomplete and i cannot explain it nor complete it without     example it is not the absence of curves but the suggestion of     hardness through curves and of the under tendencies of the inward     structure which form the true characteristics of rock form and     salvator whom neither here nor elsewhere i have abused enough is     not wrong because he paints curved rocks but because his curves are     the curves of ribbons and not of rocks and the difference between     rock curvature and other curvature i cannot explain verbally but i     hope to do it hereafter by illustration and at present let the     reader study the rockdrawing of the mont st gothard subject in     the liber studiorum and compare it with any examples of salvator to     which he may happen to have access all the account of rocks here     given is altogether inadequate and i only do not alter it because i     first wish to give longer study to the subject    59 a passage which i happened to see in an essay of mr pynes in     the artunion about natures foisting rubbish upon the artist     sufficiently explains the cause of this decline if mr pyne will go     to nature as all great men have done and as all men who mean to be     great must do that is not merely to be helped but to be taught     by her and will once or twice take her gifts without looking them     in the mouth he will most assuredly findand i say this in no     unkind or depreciatory feeling for i should say the same of all     artists who are in the habit of only sketching nature and not     studying herthat her worst is better than his best i am quite     sure that if mr pyne or any other painter who has hitherto been     very careful in his choice of subject will go into the next     turnpikeroad and taking the first four trees that he comes to in     the hedge give them a day each drawing them leaf for leaf as far     as may be and even their smallest boughs with as much care as if     they were rivers or an important map of a newlysurveyed country     he will find when he has brought them all home that at least

or combination water is the most wonderful if we think of it as the source of all the changefulness and beauty which we have seen in clouds then as the instrument by which the earth we have contemplated was modelled into symmetry and its crags chiselled into grace then as in the form of snow it robes the mountains it has made with that transcendent light which we could not have conceived if we had not seen then as it exists in the form of the torrentin the iris which spans it in the morning mist which rises from it in the deep crystalline pools which mirror its hanging shore in the broad lake and glancing river finally in that which is to all human minds the best emblem of unwearied unconquerable power the wild various fantastic tameless unity of the sea what shall we compare to this mighty this universal element for glory and for beauty or how shall we follow its eternal changefulness of feeling it is like trying to paint a soul   § 2 the ease with which a common representation of it may be given the        impossibility of a faithful one  to suggest the ordinary appearance of calm waterto lay on canvas as much evidence of surface and reflection as may make us understand that water is meantis perhaps the easiest task of art and even ordinary running or falling water may be sufficiently rendered by observing careful curves of projection with a dark ground and breaking a little white over it as we see done with judgment and truth by ruysdael but to paint the actual play of hue on the reflective surface or to give the forms and fury of water when it begins to show itselfto give the flashing and rocketlike velocity of a noble cataract or the precision and grace of the sea waves so exquisitely modelled though so mockingly transientso mountainous in its form yet so cloudlike in its motionwith its variety and delicacy of color when every ripple and wreath has some peculiar passage of reflection upon itself alone and the radiating and scintillating sunbeams are mixed with the dim hues of transparent depth and dark rock belowto do this perfectly is beyond the power of man to do it even partially has been granted to but one or two even of those few who have dared to attempt it   § 3 difficulty of properly dividing the subject  as the general laws which govern the appearances of water have equal effect on all its forms it would be injudicious to treat the subject in divisions for the same forces which govern the waves and foam of the torrent are equally influential on those of the sea and it will be more convenient to glance generally at the system of waterpainting of each school and artist than to devote separate chapters to the examination of the lake river or seapainting of all we shall therefore vary our usual plan and look first at the waterpainting of the ancients then at that of the moderns generally lastly at that of turner   § 4 inaccuracy of study of watereffect among all painters  it is necessary in the outset to state briefly one or two of the optical conditions by which the appearance of the surface of water is affected to describe them all would require a separate essay even if i possessed the requisite knowledge which i do not the accidental modifications under which general laws come into play are innumerable and often in their extreme complexity inexplicable i suppose even by men of the most extended optical knowledge what i shall here state are a few only of the broadest laws verifiable by the readers immediate observation but of which nevertheless i have found artists frequently ignorant owing to their habit of sketching from nature without thinking or reasoning and especially of finishing at home it is not often i believe that an artist draws the reflections in water as he sees them over large spaces and in weather that is not very calm it is nearly impossible to do so when it is possible sometimes in haste and sometimes in idleness and sometimes under the idea of improving nature they are slurred or misrepresented it is so easy to give something like a suggestive resemblance of calm water that even when the landscape is finished from nature the water is merely indicated as something that may be done at any time and then in the home work come the cold leaden grays with some and the violent blues and greens with others and the horizontal lines with the feeble and the bright touches and sparkles with the dexterous and everything that is shallow and commonplace with all now the fact is that there is hardly a roadside pond or pool which has not as much landscape in it as above it it is not the brown muddy dull thing we suppose it to be it has a heart like ourselves and in the bottom of that there are the boughs of the tall trees and the blades of the shakinggrass and all manner of hues of variable pleasant light out of the sky nay the ugly gutter that stagnates over the drain bars in the heart of the foul city is not altogether base down in that if you will look deep enough you may see the dark serious blue of faroff sky and the passing of pure clouds it is at your own will that you see in that despised stream either the refuse of the street or the image of the skyso it is with almost all other things that we unkindly despise now this farseeing is just the difference between the great and the vulgar painter the common man knows the roadside pool is muddy and draws its mud the great painter sees beneath and behind the brown surface what will take him a days work to follow but he follows it cost what it will and if painters would only go out to the nearest common and take the nearest dirty pond among the furze and draw that thoroughly not considering that it is water that they are drawing and that water must be done in a certain way but drawing determinedly what they see that is to say all the trees and their shaking leaves and all the hazy passages of disturbing sunshine and the bottom seen in the clearer little bits at the edge and the stones of it and all the sky and the clouds far down in the middle drawn as completely and more delicately they must be than the real clouds above they would come home with such a notion of waterpainting as might save me and every one else all trouble of writing more about the matter but now they do nothing of the kind but take the ugly round yellow surface for granted or else improve it and instead of giving that refined complex delicate but saddened and gloomy reflection in the polluted water they clear it up with coarse flashes of yellow and green and blue and spoil their own eyes and hurt ours failing of course still more hopelessly in touching the pure inimitable light of waves thrown loose and so canaletto is still thought to have painted canals and vandevelde and backhuysen to have painted sea and the uninterpreted streams and maligned sea hiss shame upon us from all their rocky beds and hollow shores   § 5 difficulty of treating this part of the subject  i approach this part of my subject with more despondency than any other and that for several reasons first the water painting of all the elder landscape painters excepting a few of the better passages of claude and ruysdael is so execrable so beyond all expression and explanation bad claudes and ruysdaels best so cold and valueless that i do not know how to address those who like such painting i do not know what their sensations are respecting sea i can perceive nothing in vandevelde or backhuysen of the lowest redeeming merit no power no presence of intellector evidence of perceptionof any sort or kind no resemblanceeven the feeblestof anything natural no inventioneven the most sluggishof anything agreeable had they given us staring green seas with hatchet edges such as we see her majestys ships soandso fixed into by the heads or sterns in the first room of the royal academy the admiration of them would have been comprehensible there being a natural predilection in the mind of men for green waves with curling tops but not for clay and wool so that though i can understand in some sort why people admire everything else in old art why they admire salvators rocks and claudes foregrounds and hobbimas trees and paul potters cattle and jan steens pans and while i can perceive in all these likings a root which seems right and legitimate and to be appealed to yet when i find they can even endure the sight of a backhuysen on their room walls i speak seriously it makes me hopeless at once i may be wrong or they may be wrong but at least i can conceive of no principle or opinion common between us which either can address or understand in the other and yet i am wrong in this want of conception for i know that turner once liked vandevelde and i can trace the evil influence of vandevelde on most of his early sea painting but turner certainly could not have liked vandevelde without some legitimate cause another discouraging point is that i cannot catch a wave nor daguerreotype it and so there is no coming to pure demonstration but the forms and hues of water must always be in some measure a matter of dispute and feeling and the more so because there is no perfect or even tolerably perfect sea painting to refer to the sea never has been and i fancy never will be nor can be painted it is only suggested by means of more or less spiritual and intelligent conventionalism and though turner has done enough to suggest the sea mightily and gloriously after all it is by conventionalism still and there remains so much that is unlike nature that it is always possible for those who do not feel his power to justify their dislike on very sufficient and reasonable grounds and to maintain themselves obstinately unreceptant of the good by insisting on the deficiency which no mortal hand can supply and which commonly is most manifest on the one hand where most has been achieved on the other  with calm water the case is different facts are ascertainable and demonstrable there and by the notice of one or two of the simplest we may obtain some notion of the little success and intelligence of the elder painters in this easier field and so prove their probable failure in contending with greater difficulties   § 6 general laws which regulate the phenomena of water first the        imperfection of its reflective surface  first water of course owing to its transparency possesses not a perfectly reflective surface like that of speculum metal but a surface whose reflective power is dependent on the angle at which the rays to be reflected fall the smaller this angle the greater are the number of rays reflected now according to the number of rays reflected is the force of the image of objects above and according to the number of rays transmitted is the perceptibility of objects below the water hence the visible transparency and reflective power of water are in inverse ratio in looking down into it from above we receive transmitted rays which exhibit either the bottom or the objects floating in the water or else if the water be deep and clear we receive very few rays and the water looks black in looking along water we receive reflected rays and therefore the image of objects above it hence in shallow water on a level shore the bottom is seen at our feet clearly it becomes more and more obscure as it retires even though the water do not increase in depth and at a distance of twelve or twenty yardsmore or less according to our height above the waterbecomes entirely invisible lost in the lustre of the reflected surface   § 7 the inherent hue of water modifies dark reflections and does not        affect bright ones  second the brighter the objects reflected the larger the angle at which reflection is visible it is always to be remembered that strictly speaking only light objects are reflected and that the darker ones are seen only in proportion to the number of rays of light that they can send so that a dark object comparatively loses its power to affect the surface of water and the water in the space of a dark reflection is seen partially with the image of the object and partially transparent it will be found on observation that under a banksuppose with dark trees above showing spaces of bright sky the bright sky is reflected distinctly and the bottom of the water is in those spaces not seen but in the dark spaces of reflection we see the bottom of the water and the color of that bottom and of the water itself mingles with and modifies that of the color of the trees casting the dark reflection  this is one of the most beautiful circumstances connected with water surface for by these means a variety of color and a grace and evanescence are introduced in the reflection otherwise impossible of course at great distances even the darkest objects cast distinct images and the hue of the water cannot be seen but in near water the occurrence of its own color modifying the dark reflections while it leaves light ones unaffected is of infinite value  take by way of example an extract from my own diary at venice  may 17th 4 pm looking east the water is calm and reflects the sky and vessels with this peculiarity the sky which is pale blue is in its reflection of the same kind of blue only a little deeper but the vessels hulls which are black are reflected in pale sea green ie the natural color of the water under sunlight while the orange masts of the vessels wet with a recent shower are reflected without change of color only not quite so bright as above one ship has a white another a red stripe i ought to have said horizontal along the gunwales of these the water takes no notice  what is curious a boat passes across with white and dark figures the water reflects the dark ones in green and misses out all the white this is chiefly owing to the dark images being opposed to the bright reflected sky  i have left the passage about the white and red stripe because it will be useful to us presently all that i wish to insist upon here is the showing of the local color pea green of the water in the spaces which were occupied by dark reflections and the unaltered color of the bright ones   § 8 water takes no shadow  third clear water takes no shadow and that for two reasons a perfect surface of speculum metal takes no shadow this the reader may instantly demonstrate for himself and a perfectly transparent body as air takes no shadow hence water whether transparent or reflective takes no shadow  but shadows or the forms of them appear on water frequently and sharply it is necessary carefully to explain the causes of these as they are one of the most eminent sources of error in water painting  first water in shade is much more reflective than water in sunlight under sunlight the local color of the water is commonly vigorous and active and forcibly affects as we have seen all the dark reflections commonly diminishing their depth under shade the reflective power is in a high degree increased61 and it will be found most frequently that the forms of shadows are expressed on the surface of water not by actual shade but by more genuine reflection of objects above this is another most important and valuable circumstance and we owe to it some phenomena of the highest beauty  a very muddy river as the arno for instance at florence is seen during sunshine of its own yellow color rendering all reflections discolored and feeble at twilight it recovers its reflective power to the fullest extent and the mountains of carrara are seen reflected in it as clearly as if it were a crystalline lake the mediterranean whose determined blue yields to hardly any modifying color in daytime receives at evening the image of its rocky shores on our own seas seeming shadows are seen constantly cast in purple and blue upon pale green these are no shadows but the pure reflection of dark or blue sky above seen in the shadowed space refused by the local color of the sea in the sunlighted spaces and turned more or less purple by the opposition of the vivid green   § 9 modification of dark reflections by shadow  we have seen however above that the local color of water while it comparatively refuses dark reflections accepts bright ones without deadening them hence when a shadow is thrown across a space of water of strong local color receiving alternately light and dark reflections it has no power of increasing the reflectiveness of the water in the bright spaces still less of diminishing it hence on all the dark reflections it is seen more or less distinctly on all the light ones it vanishes altogether  let us take an instance of the exquisite complexity of effect induced by these various circumstances in cooperation  suppose a space of clear water showing the bottom under a group of trees showing sky through their branches casting shadows on the surface of the water which we will suppose also to possess some color of its own close to us we shall see the bottom with the shadows of the trees clearly thrown upon it and the color of the water seen in its genuineness by transmitted light farther off the bottom will be gradually lost sight of but it will be seen in the dark reflections much farther than in the light ones at last it ceases to affect even the former and the pure surface effect takes place the blue bright sky is reflected truly but the dark trees are reflected imperfectly and the color of the water is seen instead where the shadow falls on these dark reflections a darkness is seen plainly which is found to be composed of the pure clear reflection of the dark trees when it crosses the reflection of the sky the shadow of course being thus fictitious vanishes  farther of course on whatever dust and other foulness may be present in water real shadow falls clear and dark in proportion to the quantity of solid substance present on very muddy rivers real shadow falls in sunlight nearly as sharply as on land on our own sea the apparent shadow caused by increased reflection is much increased in depth by the chalkiness and impurity of the water  farther when surface is rippled every ripple up to a certain variable distance on each side of the spectator and at a certain angle between him and the sun varying with the size and shape of the ripples reflects to him a small image of the sun hence those dazzling fields of expanding light so often seen upon the sea  any object that comes between the sun and these ripples takes from them the power of reflecting the sun and in consequence all their light hence any intervening objects cast apparent shadows upon such spaces of intense force and of the exact shape and in the exact place of real shadows and yet which are no more real shadows than the withdrawal of an image of a piece of white paper from a mirror is a shadow on the mirror farther in all shallow water more or less in proportion to its shallowness but in some measure i suppose up to depths of forty or fifty fathoms and perhaps more the local color of the water depends in great measure on light reflected from the bottom this however is especially manifest in clear rivers like the rhone where the absence of the light reflected from below forms an apparent shadow often visibly detached some distance from the floating object which casts it   § 10 examples on the water of the rhone  the following extract from my own diary at geneva with the subsequent one which is a continuation of that already given in part at venice will illustrate both this and the other points we have been stating                                      geneva 21st april morning  the sunlight falls from the cypresses of rousseaus island straight towards the bridge the shadows of the bridge and of the trees fall on the water in leaden purple opposed to its general hue of aquamarine green this green color is caused by the light being reflected from the bottom though the bottom is not seen as is evident by its becoming paler towards the middle of the river where the water shoals on which pale part the purple shadow of the small bridge falls most forcibly which shadow however is still only apparent being the absence of this reflected light associated with the increased reflective power of the water which in those spaces reflects blue sky above a boat swings in the shoal water its reflection is cast in a transparent peagreen which is considerably darker than the pale aquamarine of the surface at the spot its shadow is detached from it just about half the depth of the reflection which therefore forms a bright green light between the keel of the boat and its shadow where the shadow cuts the reflection the reflection is darkest and something like the true color of the boat where the shadow falls out of the reflection it is of a leaden purple pale the boat is at an angle of about 20° below another boat nearer in deeper water shows no shadow whatsoever and the reflection is marked by its transparent green while the surrounding water takes a lightish blue reflection from the sky  the above notes after what has been said require no comment but one more case must be stated belonging to rough water every large wave of the sea is in ordinary circumstances divided into or rather covered by innumerable smaller waves each of which in all probability from some of its edges or surfaces reflects the sunbeams and hence result a glitter polish and vigorous light over the whole flank of the wave which are of course instantly withdrawn within the space of a cast shadow whose form therefore though it does not affect the great body or ground of the water in the least is sufficiently traceable by the withdrawal of the high lights also every string and wreath of foam above or within the wave takes real shadow and thus adds to the impression  i have not stated onehalf of the circumstances which produce or influence effects of shadow on water but lest i should confuse or weary the reader i leave him to pursue the subject for himself enough having been stated to establish this general principle that whenever shadow is seen on clear water and in a measure even on foul water it is not as on land a dark shade subduing where it falls the sunny general hue to a lower tone but it is a space of an entirely different color subject itself by its susceptibility of reflection to infinite varieties of depth and hue and liable under certain circumstances to disappear altogether and that therefore whenever we have to paint such shadows it is not only the hue of the water itself that we have to consider but all the circumstances by which in the position attributed to them such shaded spaces could be affected   § 11 effect of ripple on distant water  fourth if water be rippled the side of every ripple next to us reflects a piece of the sky and the side of every ripple farthest from us reflects a piece of the opposite shore or of whatever objects may be beyond the ripple but as we soon lose sight of the farther sides of the ripples on the retiring surface the whole rippled space will then be reflective of the sky only thus where calm distant water receives reflections of high shores every extent of rippled surface appears as a bright line interrupting that reflection with the color of the sky   § 12 elongation of reflections by moving water  fifth when a ripple or swell is seen at such an angle as to afford a view of its farther side it carries the reflection of objects farther down than calm water would therefore all motion in water elongates reflections and throws them into confused vertical lines the real amount of this elongation is not distinctly visible except in the case of very bright objects and especially of lights as of the sun moon or lamps by a river shore whose reflections are hardly ever seen as circles or points which of course they are on perfectly calm water but as long streams of tremulous light  but it is strange that while we are constantly in the habit of seeing the reflection of the sun which ought to be a mere circle elongated into a stream of light extending from the horizon to the shore the elongation of the reflection of a sail or other object to onehalf of this extent is received if represented in a picture with incredulity by the greater number of spectators in one of turners venices the image of the white lateensails of the principal boat is about twice as long as the sails themselves i have heard the truth of this simple effect disputed over and over again by intelligent persons and yet on any water so exposed as the lagoons of venice the periods are few and short when there is so little motion as that the reflection of sails a mile off shall not affect the swell within six feet of the spectator  there is however a strange arbitrariness about this elongation of reflection which prevents it from being truly felt if we see on an extent of lightly swelling water surface the image of a bank of white clouds with masses of higher accumulation at intervals the water will not usually reflect the whole bank in an elongated form but it will commonly take the eminent parts and reflect them in long straight columns of defined breadth and miss the intermediate lower parts altogether and even in doing this it will be capricious for it will take one eminence and miss another with no apparent reason and often when the sky is covered with white clouds some of those clouds will cast long towerlike reflections and others none so arbitrarily that the spectator is often puzzled to find out which are the accepted and which the refused  in many cases of this kind it will be found rather that the eye is from want of use and care insensible to the reflection than that the reflection is not there and a little thought and careful observation will show us that what we commonly suppose to be a surface of uniform color is indeed affected more or less by an infinite variety of hues prolonged like the sun image from a great distance and that our apprehension of its lustre purity and even of its surface is in no small degree dependent on our feeling of these multitudinous hues which the continual motion of that surface prevents us from analyzing or understanding for what they are   § 13 effect of rippled water on horizontal and inclined images  sixth rippled water of which we can see the farther side of the waves will reflect a perpendicular line clearly a bit of its length being given on the side of each wave and easily joined by the eye but if the line slope its reflection will be excessively confused and disjointed and if horizontal nearly invisible it was this circumstance which prevented the red and white stripe of the ships at venice noticed above from being visible   § 14 to what extent reflection is visible from above  seventh every reflection is the image in reverse of just so much of the objects beside the water as we could see if we were placed as much under the level of the water as we are actually above it if an object be so far back from the bank that if we were five feet under the water level we could not see it over the bank then standing five feet above the water we shall not be able to see its image under the reflected bank hence the reflection of all objects that have any slope back from the water is shortened and at last disappears as we rise above it lakes seen from a great height appear like plates of metal set in the landscape reflecting the sky but none of their shores   § 15 deflection of images on agitated water  eighth any given point of the object above the water is reflected if reflected at all at some spot in a vertical line beneath it so long as the plane of the water is horizontal on rippled water a slight deflection sometimes takes place and the image of a vertical tower will slope a little away from the wind owing to the casting of the image on the sloping sides of the ripples on the sloping sides of large waves the deflection is in proportion to the slope for rough practice after the slope of the wave is determined let the artist turn his paper until it becomes horizontal and then paint the reflections of any object upon it as on level water and he will be right   § 16 necessity of watchfulness as well as of science       licenses how taken by great men  such are the most common and general optical laws which are to be taken into consideration in the painting of water yet in the application of them as tests of good or bad water painting we must be cautious in the extreme an artist may know all these laws and comply with them and yet paint water execrably and he may be ignorant of every one of them and in their turn and in certain places violate every one of them and yet paint water gloriously thousands of exquisite effects take place in nature utterly inexplicable and which can be believed only while they are seen the combinations and applications of the above laws are so varied and complicated that no knowledge or labor could if applied analytically keep pace with them constant and eager watchfulness and portfolios filled with actual statements of watereffect drawn on the spot and on the instant are worth more to the painter than the most extended optical knowledge without these all his knowledge will end in a pedantic falsehood with these it does not matter how gross or how daring here and there may be his violations of this or that law his very transgressions will be admirable  it may be said that this is a dangerous principle to advance in these days of idleness i cannot help it it is true and must be affirmed of all contemptible criticism the most to be contemned is that which punishes great works of art when they fight without armor and refuses to feel or acknowledge the great spiritual refracted sun of their truth because it has risen at a false angle and burst upon them before its appointed time and yet on the other hand let it be observed that it is not feeling nor fancy nor imagination so called that i have put before science but watchfulness experience affection and trust in nature and farther let it be observed that there is a difference between the license taken by one man and another which makes one license admirable and the other punishable and that this difference is of a kind sufficiently discernible by every earnest person though it is not so explicable as that we can beforehand say where and when or even to whom the license is to be forgiven in the paradise of tintoret in the academy of venice the angel is seen in the distance driving adam and eve out of the garden not for tintoret the leading to the gate with consolation or counsel his strange ardor of conception is seen here as everywhere full speed they fly the angel and the human creatures the angel wrapt in an orb of light floats on stooped forward in his fierce flight and does not touch the ground the chastised creatures rush before him in abandoned terror all this might have been invented by another though in other hands it would assuredly have been offensive but one circumstance which completes the story could have been thought of or dared by none but tintoret the angel casts a shadow before him towards adam and eve  now that a globe of light should cast a shadow is a license as far as mere optical matters are concerned of the most audacious kind but how beautiful is the circumstance in its application here showing that the angel who is light to all else around him is darkness to those whom he is commissioned to banish forever  i have before noticed the license of rubens in making his horizon an oblique line his object is to carry the eye to a given point in the distance the road winds to it the clouds fly at it the trees nod to it a flock of sheep scamper towards it a carter points his whip at it his horses pull for it the figures push for it and the horizon slopes to it if the horizon had been horizontal it would have embarrassed everything and everybody  in turners pas de calais there is a buoy poised on the ridge of a near wave it casts its reflection vertically down the flank of the wave which slopes steeply i cannot tell whether this is a license or a mistake i suspect the latter for the same thing occurs not unfrequently in turners seas but i am almost certain that it would have been done wilfully in this case even had the mistake been pointed out for the vertical line is necessary to the picture and the eye is so little accustomed to catch the real bearing of the reflections on the slopes of waves that it does not feel the fault   § 17 various licenses or errors in water painting of claude cuyp         vandevelde  in one of the smaller rooms of the uffizii at florence off the tribune there are two socalled claudes one a pretty wooded landscape i think a copy the other a marine with architecture very sweet and genuine the sun is setting at the side of the picture it casts a long stream of light upon the water this stream of light is oblique and comes from the horizon where it is under the sun to a point near the centre of the picture if this had been done as a license it would be an instance of most absurd and unjustifiable license as the fault is detected by the eye in a moment and there is no occasion nor excuse for it but i imagine it to be an instance rather of the harm of imperfect science taking his impression instinctively from nature claude usually did what is right and put his reflection vertically under the sun probably however he had read in some treatise on optics that every point in this reflection was in a vertical plane between the sun and spectator or he might have noticed walking on the shore that the reflection came straight from the sun to his feet and intending to indicate the position of the spectator drew in his next picture the reflection sloping to the supposed point the error being excusable enough and plausible enough to have been lately revived and systematized62  in the picture of cuyp no 83 in the dulwich gallery the post at the end of the bank casts three or four radiating reflections this is visibly neither license nor half science but pure ignorance again in the picture attributed to paul potter no 176 dulwich gallery i believe most people must feel the moment they look at it that there is something wrong with the water that it looks odd and hard and like ice or lead and though they may not be able to tell the reason of the impressionfor when they go near they will find it smooth and lustrous and prettily paintedyet they will not be able to shake off the unpleasant sense of its being like a plate of bad mirror set in a model landscape among moss rather than like a pond the reason is that while this water receives clear reflections from the fence and hedge on the left and is everywhere smooth and evidently capable of giving true images it yet reflects none of the cows  in the vandevelde 113 there is not a line of ripple or swell in any part of the sea it is absolutely windless and the near boat casts its image with great fidelity which being unprolonged downwards informs us that the calm is perfect rule v and being unshortened informs us that we are on a level with the water or nearly so rule vii yet underneath the vessel on the right the gray shade which stands for reflection breaks off immediately descending like smoke a little way below the hull then leaving the masts and sails entirely unrecorded this i imagine to be not ignorance but unjustifiable license vandevelde evidently desired to give an impression of great extent of surface and thought that if he gave the reflection more faithfully as the tops of the masts would come down to the nearest part of the surface they would destroy the evidence of distance and appear to set the ship above the boat instead of beyond it i doubt not in such awkward hands that such would indeed have been the case but he is not on that account to be excused for painting his surface with gray horizontal lines as is done by nauticallydisposed children for no destruction of distance in the ocean is so serious a loss as that of its liquidity it is better to feel a want of extent in the sea than an extent which we might walk upon or play at billiards upon   § 18 and canaletto  among all the pictures of canaletto which i have ever seen and they are not a few i remember but one or two where there is any variation from one method of treatment of the water he almost always covers the whole space of it with one monotonous ripple composed of a coat of wellchosen but perfectly opaque and smooth seagreen covered with a certain number i cannot state the exact average but it varies from three hundred and fifty to four hundred and upwards according to the extent of canvas to be covered of white concave touches which are very properly symbolical of ripple  and as the canal retires back from the eye he very geometrically diminishes the size of his ripples until he arrives at an even field of apparently smooth water by our sixth rule this rippling water as it retires should show more and more of the reflection of the sky above it and less and less of that of objects beyond it until at two or three hundred yards down the canal the whole field of water should be one even gray or blue the color of the sky receiving no reflections whatever of other objects what does canaletto do exactly in proportion as he retires he displays more and more of the reflection of objects and less and less of the sky until three hundred yards away all the houses are reflected as clear and sharp as in a quiet lake  this again is wilful and inexcusable violation of truth of which the reason as in the last case is the painters consciousness of weakness it is one of the most difficult things in the world to express the light reflection of the blue sky on a distant ripple and to make the eye understand the cause of the color and the motion of the apparently smooth water especially where there are buildings above to be reflected for the eye never understands the want of the reflection but it is the easiest and most agreeable thing in the world to give the inverted image it occupies a vast space of otherwise troublesome distance in the simplest way possible and is understood by the eye at once hence canaletto is glad as any other inferior workman would be not to say obliged to give the reflections in the distance but when he comes up close to the spectator he finds the smooth surface just as troublesome near as the ripple would have been far off it is a very nervous thing for an ignorant artist to have a great space of vacant smooth water to deal with close to him too far down to take reflections from buildings and yet which must be made to look flat and retiring and transparent canaletto with his seagreen did not at all feel himself equal to anything of this kind and had therefore no resource but in the white touches above described which occupy the alarming space without any troublesome necessity for knowledge or invention and supply by their gradual diminution some means of expressing retirement of surface it is easily understood therefore why he should adopt this system which is just what any awkward workman would naturally cling to trusting to the inaccuracy of observation of the public to secure him from detection   § 19 why unpardonable  now in all these cases it is not the mistake or the license itself it is not the infringement of this or that law which condemns the picture but it is the spirit and habit of mind in which the license is taken the cowardice or bluntness of feeling which infects every part alike and deprives the whole picture of vitality canaletto had he been a great painter might have cast his reflections wherever he chose and rippled the water wherever he chose and painted his sea sloping if he chose and neither i nor any one else should have dared to say a word against him but he is a little and a bad painter and so continues everywhere multiplying and magnifying mistakes and adding apathy to error until nothing can any more be pardoned in him if it be but remembered that every one of the surfaces of those multitudinous ripples is in nature a mirror which catches according to its position either the image of the sky or of the silver beaks of the gondolas or of their black bodies and scarlet draperies or of the white marble or the green seaweed on the low stones it cannot but be felt that those waves would have something more of color upon them than that opaque dead green green they are by their own nature but it is a transparent and emerald hue mixing itself with the thousand reflected tints without overpowering the weakest of them and thus in every one of those individual waves the truths of color are contradicted by canaletto by the thousand  venice is sad and silent now to what she was in his time the canals are choked gradually one by one and the foul water laps more and more sluggishly against the rent foundations but even yet could i but place the reader at the early morning on the quay below the rialto when the market boats full laden float into groups of golden color and let him watch the dashing of the water about their glittering steely heads and under the shadows of the vine leaves and show him the purple of the grapes and the figs and the glowing of the scarlet gourds carried away in long streams upon the waves and among them the crimson fish baskets plashing and sparkling and flaming as the morning sun falls on their wet tawny sides and above the painted sails of the fishing boats orange and white scarlet and blue and better than all such florid color the naked bronzed burning limbs of the seamen the last of the old venetian race who yet keep the right giorgione color on their brows and bosoms in strange contrast with the sallow sensual degradation of the creatures that live in the cafés of the piazza he would not be merciful to canaletto any more   § 20 the dutch painters of sea  yet even canaletto in relation to the truths he had to paint is spiritual faithful powerful compared to the dutch painters of sea it is easily understood why his green paint and concave touches should be thought expressive of the water on which the real colors are not to be discerned but by attention which is never given but it is not so easily understood considering how many there are who love the sea and look at it that vandevelde and such others should be tolerated as i before said i feel utterly hopeless in addressing the admirers of these men because i do not know what it is in their works which is supposed to be like nature foam appears to me to curdle and cream on the wave sides and to fly flashing from their crests and not to be set astride upon them like a peruke and waves appear to me to fall and plunge and toss and nod and crash over and not to curl up like shavings and water appears to me when it is gray to have the gray of stormy air mixed with its own deep heavy thunderous threatening blue and not the gray of the first coat of cheap paint on a deal door and many other such things appear to me which as far as i can conjecture by what is admired of marine painting appear to no one else yet i shall have something more to say about these men presently with respect to the effect they have had upon turner and something more i hope hereafter with the help of illustration   § 21 ruysdael claude and salvator  there is a seapiece of ruysdaels in the louvre63 which though nothing very remarkable in any quality of art is at least forceful agreeable and as far as it goes natural the waves have much freedom of action and power of color the wind blows hard over the shore and the whole picture may be studied with profit as a proof that the deficiency of color and everything else in backhuysens works is no fault of the dutch sea there is sublimity and power in every field of nature from the pole to the line and though the painters of one country are often better and greater universally than those of another this is less because the subjects of art are wanting anywhere than because one country or one age breeds mighty and thinking men and another none  ruysdaels painting of falling water and brook scenery is also generally agreeablemore than agreeable it can hardly be considered there appears no exertion of mind in any of his works nor are they calculated to produce either harm or good by their feeble influence they are good furniture pictures unworthy of praise and undeserving of blame  the seas of claude are the finest pieces of waterpainting in ancient art i do not say that i like them because they appear to me selections of the particular moment when the sea is most insipid and characterless but i think that they are exceedingly true to the forms and time selected or at least that the fine instances of them are so of which there are exceedingly few  on the right hand of one of the marines of salvator in the pitti palace there is a passage of sea reflecting the sunrise which is thoroughly good and very like turner the rest of the picture as the one opposite to it utterly virtueless i have not seen any other instance of salvators painting water with any care it is usually as conventional as the rest of his work yet conventionalism is perhaps more tolerable in waterpainting than elsewhere and if his trees and rocks had been good the rivers might have been generally accepted without objection   § 22 nicholas poussin  the merits of poussin as a sea or water painter may i think be sufficiently determined by the deluge in the louvre where the breaking up of the fountains of the deep is typified by the capsizing of a wherry over a weir  in the outer porch of st marks at venice among the mosaics on the roof there is a representation of the deluge the ground is dark blue the rain is represented in bright white undulating parallel stripes between these stripes is seen the massy outline of the ark a bit between each stripe very dark and hardly distinguishable from the sky but it has a square window with a bright golden border which glitters out conspicuously and leads the eye to the restthe sea below is almost concealed with dead bodies  on the font of the church of san frediano at lucca there is a representation ofpossiblythe israelites and egyptians in the red sea the sea is typified by undulating bands of stone each band composed of three plies almost the same type is to be seen in the glasspainting of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries as especially at chartres these bands would perhaps be hardly felt as very aqueous but for the fish which are interwoven with them in a complicated manner their heads appearing at one side of every band and their tails at the other  both of these representatives of deluge archaic and rude as they are i consider better more suggestive more inventive and more natural than poussins indeed this is not saying anything very depreciatory as regards the st marks one for the glittering of the golden window through the rain is wonderfully well conceived and almost deceptive looking as if it had just caught a gleam of sunlight on its panes and there is something very sublime in the gleam of this light above the floating corpses but the other instance is sufficiently grotesque and imperfect and yet i speak with perfect seriousness it is i think very far preferable to poussins  on the other hand there is a just medium between the meanness and apathy of such a conception as his and the extravagance still more contemptible with which the subject has been treated in modern days64 i am not aware that i can refer to any instructive example of this intermediate course for i fear the reader is by this time wearied of hearing of turner and the plate of turners picture of the deluge is so rare that it is of no use to refer to it   § 23 venetians and florentines conclusion  it seems exceedingly strange that the great venetian painters should have left us no instance as far as i know of any marine effects carefully studied as already noted whatever passages of sea occur in their backgrounds are merely broad extents of blue or green surface fine in color and coming dark usually against the horizon well enough to be understood as sea yet even that not always without the help of a ship but utterly unregarded in all questions of completion and detail the water even in titians landscape is almost always violently though grandly conventional and seldom forms an important feature among the religious schools very sweet motives occur but nothing which for a moment can be considered as real waterpainting peruginos sea is usually very beautifully felt his river in the fresco of sta maddalena at florence is freely indicated and looks level and clear the reflections of the trees given with a rapid zigzag stroke of the brush on the whole i suppose that the best imitations of level water surface to be found in ancient art are in the clear flemish landscapes cuyps are usually very satisfactory but even the best of these attain nothing more than the agreeable suggestion of calm pond or river of any tolerable representation of water in agitation or under any circumstances that bring out its power and character i know no instance and the more capable of noble treatment the subject happens to be the more manifest invariably is the painters want of feeling in every effort and of knowledge in every line   footnotes    61 i state this merely as a fact i am unable satisfactorily to     account for it on optical principles and were it otherwise the     investigation would be of little interest to the general reader and     little value to the artist    62 parseys convergence of perpendiculars i have not space here     to enter into any lengthy exposure of this mistake but reasoning is     fortunately unnecessary the appeal to experiment being easy every     picture is the representation as before stated of a vertical plate     of glass with what might be seen through it drawn on its surface     let a vertical plate of glass be taken and wherever it be placed     whether the sun be at its side or at its centre the reflection will     always be found in a vertical line under the sun parallel with the     side of the glass the pane of any window looking to sea is all the     apparatus necessary for this experiment and yet it is not long     since this very principle was disputed with me by a man of much     taste and information who supposed turner to be wrong in drawing     the reflection straight down at the side of his picture as in his     lancaster sands and innumerable other instances    63 in the last edition of this work was the following passagei     wish ruysdael had painted one or two rough seas i believe if he had     he might have saved the unhappy public from much grievous     victimizing both in mind and pocket for he would have shown that     vandevelde and backhuysen were not quite seadeities the writer     has to thank the editor of murrays handbook of painting in italy     for pointing out the oversight he had passed many days in the     louvre before the above passage was written but had not been in the     habit of pausing long anywhere except in the last two rooms     containing the pictures of the italian school the conjecture     however shows that he had not illestimated the power of ruysdael     nor does he consider it as in anywise unfitting him for the task he     has undertaken that for every hour passed in galleries he has     passed days on the seashore    64 i am here of course speaking of the treatment of the subject     as a landscape only many mighty examples of its conception occur     where the sea and all other adjuncts are entirely subservient to     the figures as with raffaelle and m angelo                                      chapter ii                       of water as painted by the moderns   § 1 general power of the moderns in painting quiet water the lakes of        fielding  there are few men among modern landscape painters who cannot paint quiet water at least suggestively if not faithfully those who are incapable of doing this would scarcely be considered artists at all and anything like the ripples of canaletto or the black shadows of vandevelde would be looked upon as most unpromising even in the work of a novice among those who most fully appreciate and render the qualities of space and surface in calm water perhaps copley fielding stands first his expanses of windless lake are among the most perfect passages of his works for he can give surface as well as depth and make his lake look not only clear but which is far more difficult lustrous he is less dependent than most of our artists upon reflections and can give substance transparency and extent where another painter would be reduced to paper and he is exquisitely refined in his expression of distant breadth by the delicate line of ripple interrupting the reflection and by aerial qualities of color nothing indeed can be purer or more refined than his general feeling of lake sentiment were it not for a want of simplicitya fondness for pretty rather than impressive color and a consequent want of some of the higher expression of repose   § 2 the calm rivers of de wint j holland etc  § 3 the character of bright and violent falling water  § 4 as given by nesfield  hundreds of men might be named whose works are highly instructive in the management of calm water de wint is singularly powerful and certain exquisitely bright and vigorous in color the late john varley produced some noble passages i have seen some seven years ago works by j holland which were i think as near perfection as watercolor can be carriedfor bona fide truth refined and finished to the highest degree but the power of modern artists is not brought out until they have greater difficulties to struggle with stand for half an hour beside the fall of schaffhausen on the north side where the rapids are long and watch how the vault of water first bends unbroken in pure polished velocity over the arching rocks at the brow of the cataract covering them with a dome of crystal twenty feet thickso swift that its motion is unseen except when a foam globe from above darts over it like a falling star and how the trees are lighted above it under all their leaves at the instant that it breaks into foam and how all the hollows of that foam burn with green fire like so much shattering chrysoprase and how ever and anon startling you with its white flash a jet of spray leaps hissing out of the fall like a rocket bursting in the wind and driven away in dust filling the air with light and how through the curdling wreaths of the restless crashing abyss below the blue of the water paled by the foam in its body shows purer than the sky through white raincloud while the shuddering iris stoops in tremulous stillness over all fading and flushing alternately through the choking spray and shattered sunshine hiding itself at last among the thick golden leaves which toss to and fro in sympathy with the wild water their dripping masses lifted at intervals like sheaves of loaded corn by some stronger gush from the cataract and bowed again upon the mossy rocks as its roar dies away the dew gushing from their thick branches through drooping clusters of emerald herbage and sparkling in white threads along the dark rocks of the shore feeding the lichens which chase and checker them with purple and silver i believe when you have stood by this for half an hour you will have discovered that there is something more in nature than has been given by ruysdael probably you will not be much disposed to think of any mortal work at the time but when you look back to what you have seen and are inclined to compare it with art you will rememberor ought to remembernesfield he is a man of extraordinary feeling both for the color and the spirituality of a great waterfall exquisitely delicate in his management of the changeful veil of spray or mist just in his curves and contours and unequalled in color except by turner none of our watercolor painters can approach him in the management of the variable hues of clear water over weeded rocks but his feeling for it often leads him a little too far and like copley fielding he loses sight of simplicity and dignity for the sake of delicacy or prettiness his waterfalls are however unequalled in their way and if he would remember that in all such scenes there is much gloom as well as much splendor and relieve the lustre of his attractive passages of color with more definite and prevalent grays and give a little more substance to parts of his picture unaffected by spray his work would be nearly perfect his seas are also most instructive a little confused in chiaroscuro but refined in form and admirable in color   § 5 the admirable waterdrawing of j d harding  § 6 his color and painting of sea  j d harding is i think nearly unequalled in the drawing of running water i do not know what stanfield would do i have never seen an important piece of torrent drawn by him but i believe even he could scarcely contend with the magnificent abandon of hardings brush there is perhaps nothing which tells more in the drawing of water than decisive and swift execution for in a rapid touch the hand naturally falls into the very curve of projection which is the absolute truth while in slow finish all precision of curve and character is certain to be lost except under the hand of an unusually powerful master but harding has both knowledge and velocity and the fall of his torrents is beyond praise impatient chafing substantial shattering crystalline and capricious full of various form yet all apparently instantaneous and accidental nothing conventional nothing dependent upon parallel lines or radiating curves all broken up and dashed to pieces over the irregular rock and yet all in unity of motion the color also of his falling and bright water is very perfect but in the dark and level parts of his torrents he has taken up a bad gray which has hurt some of his best pictures his gray in shadows under rocks or dark reflections is admirable but it is when the stream is in full light and unaffected by reflections in distance that he gets wrong we believe that the fault is in a want of expression of darkness in the color making it appear like a positive hue of the water for which it is much too dead and cold  harding seldom paints sea and it is well for stanfield that he does not or the latter would have to look to his crown all that we have seen from his hand is as coast sea quite faultless we only wish he would paint it more frequently always however with a veto upon french fishingboats in the exhibition of 1842 he spoiled one of the most superb pieces of seashore and sunset which modern art has produced with the pestilent square sail of one of these clumsy craft which the eye could not escape from   § 7 the sea of copley fielding its exceeding grace and rapidity  before passing to our great sea painter we must again refer to the works of copley fielding it is with his sea as with his sky he can only paint one and that an easy one but it is for all that an impressive and a true one no man has ever given with the same flashing freedom the race of a running tide under a stiff breeze nor caught with the same grace and precision the curvature of the breaking wave arrested or accelerated by the wind the forward fling of his foam and the impatient run of his surges whose quick redoubling dash we can almost hear as they break in their haste upon their own bosoms are nature itself and his sea gray or green was nine years ago very right as color always a little wanting in transparency but never cold or toneless since that time he seems to have lost the sense of greenness in water and has verged more and more on the purple and black with unhappy results his sea was always dependent for effect on its light or dark relief against the sky even when it possessed color but it now has lost all local color and transparency together and is little more than a study of chiaroscuro in an exceedingly illchosen gray besides the perpetual repetition of the same idea is singularly weakening to the mind fielding in all his life can only be considered as having produced one sea picture the others are duplicates he ought to go to some sea of perfect clearness and brilliant color as that on the coast of cornwall or of the gulf of genoa and study it sternly in broad daylight with no black clouds nor drifting rain to help him out of his difficulties he would then both learn his strength and add to it   § 8 its high aim at character  § 9 but deficiency in the requisite quality of grays  § 10 variety of the grays of nature  but there is one point in all his seas deserving especial praisea marked aim at character he desires especially in his latter works not so much to produce an agreeable picture a scientific piece of arrangement or delightful melody of color as to make us feel the utter desolation the cold withering frozen hopelessness of the continuous storm and merciless sea and this is peculiarly remarkable in his denying himself all color just in the little bits which an artist of inferior mind would paint in sienna and cobalt if a piece of broken wreck is allowed to rise for an instant through the boiling foam though the blue stripe of a sailors jacket or a red rag of a flag would do all our hearts good we are not allowed to have it it would make us too comfortable and prevent us from shivering and shrinking as we look and the artist with admirable intention and most meritorious selfdenial expresses his piece of wreck with a dark cold brown now we think this aim and effort worthy of the highest praise and we only wish the lesson were taken up and acted on by our other artists but mr fielding should remember that nothing of this kind can be done with success unless by the most studied management of the general tones of the picture for the eye deprived of all means of enjoying the gray hues merely as a contrast to bright points becomes painfully fastidious in the quality of the hues themselves and demands for its satisfaction such melodies and richness of gray as may in some degree atone to it for the loss of points of stimulus that gray which would be taken frankly and freely for an expression of gloom if it came behind a yellow sail or a red cap is examined with invidious and merciless intentness when there is nothing to relieve it and if not able to bear the investigation if neither agreeable nor variable in its hue renders the picture weak instead of impressive and unpleasant instead of awful and indeed the management of nature might teach him this for though when using violent contrasts she frequently makes her gloom somewhat monotonous the moment she gives up her vivid color and depends upon her desolation that moment she begins to steal the greens into her seagray and the browns and yellows into her cloudgray and the expression of variously tinted light through all nor is mr fielding without a model in art for the lands end and lowestoffe and snowstorm in the academy 1842 of turner are nothing more than passages of the most hopeless desolate uncontrasted grays and yet are three of the very finest pieces of color that have come from his hand and we sincerely hope that mr fielding will gradually feel the necessity of such studied melodies of quiet color and will neither fall back into the old tricks of contrast nor continue to paint with purple and ink if he will only make a few careful studies of gray from the mixed atmosphere of spray rain and mist of a gale that has been three days hard at work not of a rainy squall but of a persevering and powerful storm and not where the sea is turned into milk and magnesia by a chalk coast but where it breaks pure and green on gray slate or white granite as along the cliffs of cornwall we think his pictures would present some of the finest examples of high intention and feeling to be found in modern art   § 11 works of stanfield his perfect knowledge and power  § 12 but want of feeling general sum of truth presented by modern art  the works of stanfield evidently and at all times proceed from the hand of a man who has both thorough knowledge of his subject and thorough acquaintance with all the means and principles of art we never criticise them because we feel the moment we look carefully at the drawing of any single wave that the knowledge possessed by the master is much greater than our own and therefore believe that if anything offends us in any part of the work it is nearly certain to be our fault and not the painters the local color of stanfields sea is singularly true and powerful and entirely independent of any tricks of chiaroscuro he will carry a mighty wave up against the sky and make its whole body dark and substantial against the distant light using all the while nothing more than chaste and unexaggerated local color to gain the relief his surface is at once lustrous transparent and accurate to a hairbreadth in every curve and he is entirely independent of dark skies deep blues driving spray or any other means of concealing want of form or atoning for it he fears no difficulty desires no assistance takes his sea in open daylight under general sunshine and paints the element in its pure color and complete forms but we wish that he were less powerful and more interesting or that he were a little less diogeneslike and did not scorn all that he does not want now that he has shown us what he can do without such aids we wish he would show us what he can do with them he is as we have already said wanting in what we have just been praising in fieldingimpressiveness we should like him to be less clever and more affectingless wonderful and more terrible and as the very first step towards such an end to learn how to conceal we are however trenching upon matters with which we have at present nothing to do our concern is now only with truth and one work of stanfield alone presents us with as much concentrated knowledge of sea and sky as diluted would have lasted any one of the old masters his life and let it be especially observed how extensive and how varied is the truth of our modern mastershow it comprises a complete history of that nature of which from the ancients you only here and there can catch a stammering descriptive syllablehow fielding has given us every character of the quiet lake robson65 of the mountain tarn de wint of the lowland river nesfield of the radiant cataract harding of the roaring torrent fielding of the desolate sea stanfield of the blue open boundless ocean arrange all this in your mind observe the perfect truth of it in all its parts compare it with the fragmentary falsities of the ancients and then come with me to turner   footnotes    65 i ought before to have alluded to the works of the late g     robson they are a little disagreeable in execution but there is a     feeling of the character of deep calm water in them quite     unequalled and different from the works and thoughts of all other     men                                      chapter iii                         of water as painted by turner   § 1 the difficulty of giving surface to smooth water  § 2 is dependent on the structure of the eye and the focus by which        the reflected rays are perceived  i believe it is a result of the experience of all artists that it is the easiest thing in the world to give a certain degree of depth and transparency to water but that it is next thing to impossible to give a full impression of surface if no reflection be givena ripple being supposedthe water looks like lead if reflection be given it in nine cases out of ten looks morbidly clear and deep so that we always go down into it even when the artist most wishes us to glide over it now this difficulty arises from the very same circumstance which occasions the frequent failure in effect of the best drawn foregrounds noticed in section ii chapter iii the change namely of focus necessary in the eye in order to receive rays of light coming from different distances go to the edge of a pond in a perfectly calm day at some place where there is duckweed floating on the surfacenot thick but a leaf here and there now you may either see in the water the reflection of the sky or you may see the duckweed but you cannot by any effort see both together if you look for the reflection you will be sensible of a sudden change or effort in the eye by which it adapts itself to the reception of the rays which have come all the way from the clouds have struck on the water and so been sent up again to the eye the focus you adopt is one fit for great distance and accordingly you will feel that you are looking down a great way under the water while the leaves of the duckweed though they lie upon the water at the very spot on which you are gazing so intently are felt only as a vague uncertain interruption causing a little confusion in the image below but entirely indistinguishable as leavesand even their color unknown and unperceived unless you think of them you will not even feel that anything interrupts your sight so excessively slight is their effect if on the other hand you make up your mind to look for the leaves of the duckweed you will perceive an instantaneous change in the effort of the eye by which it becomes adapted to receive near raysthose which have only come from the surface of the pond you will then see the delicate leaves of the duckweed with perfect clearness and in vivid green but while you do so you will be able to perceive nothing of the reflections in the very water on which they floatnothing but a vague flashing and melting of light and dark hues without form or meaning which to investigate or find out what they mean or are you must quit your hold of the duckweed and plunge down   § 3 morbid clearness occasioned in painting of water by distinctness of        reflections  § 4 how avoided by turner  § 5 all reflections on distant water are distinct  hence it appears that whenever we see plain reflections of comparatively distant objects in near water we cannot possibly see the surface and vice versa so that when in a painting we give the reflections with the same clearness with which they are visible in nature we presuppose the effort of the eye to look under the surface and of course destroy the surface and induce an effect of clearness which perhaps the artist has not particularly wished to attain but which he has found himself forced into by his reflections in spite of himself and the reason of this effect of clearness appearing preternatural is that people are not in the habit of looking at water with the distant focus adapted to the reflections unless by particular effort we invariably under ordinary circumstances use the surface focus and in consequence receive nothing more than a vague and confused impression of the reflected colors and lines however clearly calmly and vigorously all may be defined underneath if we choose to look for them we do not look for them but glide along over the surface catching only playing light and capricious color for evidence of reflection except where we come to images of objects close to the surface which the surface focus is of course adapted to receive and these we see clearly as of the weeds on the shore or of sticks rising out of the water etc hence the ordinary effect of water is only to be rendered by giving the reflections of the margin clear and distinct so clear they usually are in nature that it is impossible to tell where the water begins but the moment we touch the reflection of distant objects as of high trees or clouds that instant we must become vague and uncertain in drawing and though vivid in color and light as the object itself quite indistinct in form and feature if we take such a piece of water as that in the foreground of turners chateau of prince albert the first impression from it iswhat a wide surface we glide over it a quarter of a mile into the picture before we know where we are and yet the water is as calm and crystalline as a mirror but we are not allowed to tumble into it and gasp for breath as we go downwe are kept upon the surface though that surface is flashing and radiant with every hue of cloud and sun and sky and foliage but the secret is in the drawing of these reflections66 we cannot tell when we look at them and for them what they mean they have all character and are evidently reflections of something definite and determined but yet they are all uncertain and inexplicable playing color and palpitating shade which though we recognize in an instant for images of something and feel that the water is bright and lovely and calm we cannot penetrate nor interpret we are not allowed to go down to them and we repose as we should in nature upon the lustre of the level surface it is in this power of saying everything and yet saying nothing too plainly that the perfection of art here as in all other cases consists but as it was before shown in sect ii chap iii that the focus of the eye required little alteration after the first half mile of distance it is evident that on the distant surface of water all reflections will be seen plainly for the same focus adapted to a moderate distance of surface will receive with distinctness rays coming from the sky or from any other distance however great thus we always see the reflection of mont blanc on the lake of geneva whether we take pains to look for it or not because the water upon which it is cast is itself a mile off but if we would see the reflection of mont blanc in the lac de chede which is close to us we must take some trouble about the matter leave the green snakes swimming upon the surface and plunge for it hence reflections if viewed collectively are always clear in proportion to the distance of the water on which they are cast and now look at turners ulleswater or any of his distant lake expanses and you will find every crag and line of the hills rendered in them with absolute fidelity while the near surface shows nothing but a vague confusion of exquisite and lustrous tint the reflections even of the clouds will be given far off while those of near boats and figures will be confused and mixed among each other except just at the waterline   § 6 the error of vandevelde  and now we see what vandevelde ought to have done with the shadow of his ship spoken of in the first chapter of this section in such a calm we should in nature if we had looked for the reflection have seen it clear from the waterline to the flag on the mainmast but in so doing we should have appeared to ourselves to be looking under the water and should have lost all feeling of surface when we looked at the surface of the seaas we naturally shouldwe should have seen the image of the hull absolutely clear and perfect because that image is cast on distant water but we should have seen the image of the masts and sails gradually more confused as they descended and the water close to us would have borne only upon its surface a maze of flashing color and indefinite hue had vandevelde therefore given the perfect image of his ship he would have represented a truth dependent on a particular effort of the eye and destroyed his surface but his business was to give not a distinct reflection but the colors of the reflection in mystery and disorder upon his near water all perfectly vivid but none intelligible and had he done so the eye would not have troubled itself to search them out it would not have cared whence or how the colors came but it would have felt them to be true and right and rested satisfied upon the polished surface of the clear sea of the perfect truth the best examples i can give are turners saltash and castle upnor   § 7 difference in arrangement of parts between the reflected object and        its image  be it next observed that the reflection of all near objects is by our fifth rule not an exact copy of the parts of them which we see above the water but a totally different view and arrangement of them that which we should get if we were looking at them from beneath hence we see the dark sides of leaves hanging over a stream in their reflection though we see the light sides above and all objects and groups of objects are thus seen in the reflection under different lights and in different positions with respect to each other from those which they assume above some which we see on the bank being entirely lost in their reflection and others which we cannot see on the bank brought into view hence nature contrives never to repeat herself and the surface of water is not a mockery but a new view of what is above it and this difference in what is represented as well as the obscurity of the representation is one of the chief sources by which the sensation of surface is kept up in the reality the reflection is not so remarkable it does not attract the eye in the same degree when it is entirely different from the images above as when it mocks them and repeats them and we feel that the space and surface have color and character of their own and that the bank is one thing and the water another it is by not making this change manifest and giving underneath a mere duplicate of what is seen above that artists are apt to destroy the essence and substance of water and to drop us through it   § 8 illustrated from the works of turner  § 9 the boldness and judgment shown in the observance of it  now one instance will be sufficient to show the exquisite care of turner in this respect on the lefthand side of his nottingham the water a smooth canal is terminated by a bank fenced up with wood on which just at the edge of the water stands a white signpost a quarter of a mile back the hill on which nottingham castle stands rises steeply nearly to the top of the picture the upper part of this hill is in bright golden light and the lower in very deep gray shadow against which the white board of the signpost is seen entirely in light relief though being turned from the light it is itself in delicate middle tint illumined only on the edge but the image of all this in the canal is very different first we have the reflection of the piles of the bank sharp and clear but under this we have not what we see above it the dark base of the hill for this being a quarter of a mile back we could not see over the fence if we were looking from below but the golden summit of the hill the shadow of the under part having no record nor place in the reflection but this summit being very distant cannot be seen clearly by the eye while its focus is adapted to the surface of the water and accordingly its reflection is entirely vague and confused you cannot tell what it is meant for it is mere playing golden light but the signpost being on the bank close to us will be reflected clearly and accordingly its distinct image is seen in the midst of this confusion but it now is relieved not against the dark base but against the illumined summit of the hill and it appears therefore instead of a white space thrown out from blue shade a dark gray space thrown out from golden light i do not know that any more magnificent example could be given of concentrated knowledge or of the daring statement of most difficult truth for who but this consummate artist would have had courage even if he had perceived the laws which required it to undertake in a single small space of water the painting of an entirely new picture with all its tones and arrangements alteredwhat was made above bright by opposition to blue being underneath made cool and dark by opposition to goldor would have dared to contradict so boldly the ordinary expectation of the uncultivated eye to find in the reflection a mockery for the reality but the reward is immediate for not only is the change most grateful to the eye and most exquisite as composition but the surface of the water in consequence of it is felt to be as spacious as it is clear and the eye rests not on the inverted image of the material objects but on the element which receives them and we have a farther instance in this passage of the close study which is required to enjoy the works of turner for another artist might have altered the reflection or confused it but he would not have reasoned upon it so as to find out what the exact alteration must be and if we had tried to account for the reflection we should have found it false or inaccurate but the master mind of turner without effort showers its knowledge into every touch and we have only to trace out even his slightest passages part by part to find in them the universal working of the deepest thought that consistency of every minor truth which admits of and invites the same ceaseless study as the work of nature herself   § 10 the texture of surface in turners painting of calm water  there is however yet another peculiarity in turners painting of smooth water which though less deserving of admiration as being merely a mechanical excellence is not less wonderful than its other qualities nor less uniquea peculiar texture namely given to the most delicate tints of the surface when there is little reflection from anything except sky or atmosphere and which just at the points where other painters are reduced to paper gives to the surface of turner the greatest appearance of substantial liquidity it is impossible to say how it is produced it looks like some modification of body color but it certainly is not body color used as by other men for i have seen this expedient tried over and over again without success and it is often accompanied by crumbling touches of a dry brush which never could have been put upon body color and which could not have shown through underneath it as a piece of mechanical excellence it is one of the most remarkable things in the works of the master and it brings the truth of his waterpainting up to the last degree of perfection often rendering those passages of it the most attractive and delightful which from their delicacy and paleness of tint would have been weak and papery in the hands of any other man the best instance of it i can give is i think the distance of the devonport with the dockyards   § 11 its united qualities  after all however there is more in turners painting of water surface than any philosophy of reflection or any peculiarity of means can account for or accomplish there is a might and wonder about it which will not admit of our whys and hows take for instance the picture of the sun of venice going to sea of 1843 respecting which however there are one or two circumstances which may as well be noted besides its waterpainting the reader if he has not been at venice ought to be made aware that the venetian fishingboats almost without exception carry canvas painted with bright colors the favorite design for the centre being either a cross or a large sun with many rays the favorite colors being red orange and black blue occurring occasionally the radiance of these sails and of the bright and grotesque vanes at the mastheads under sunlight is beyond all painting but it is strange that of constant occurrence as these boats are on all the lagoons turner alone should have availed himself of them nothing could be more faithful than the boat which was the principal object in this picture in the cut of the sail the filling of it the exact height of the boom above the deck the quartering of it with color finally and especially the hanging of the fishbaskets about the bows all these however are comparatively minor merits though not the blaze of color which the artist elicited from the right use of these circumstances but the peculiar power of the picture was the painting of the sea surface where there were no reflections to assist it a stream of splendid color fell from the boat but that occupied the centre only in the distance the city and crowded boats threw down some playing lines but these still left on each side of the boat a large space of water reflecting nothing but the morning sky this was divided by an eddying swell on whose continuous sides the local color of the water was seen pure aquamarine a beautiful occurrence of closelyobserved truth but still there remained a large blank space of pale water to be treated the sky above had no distinct details and was pure faint gray with broken white vestiges of cloud it gave no help therefore but there the water lay no dead gray flat paint but downright clear playing palpable surface full of indefinite hue and retiring as regularly and visibly back and far away as if there had been objects all over it to tell the story by perspective now it is the doing of this which tries the painter and it is his having done this which made me say above that no man had ever painted the surface of calm water but turner the san benedetto looking towards fusina contained a similar passage equally fine in one of the canale della guidecca the specific green color of the water is seen in front with the shadows of the boats thrown on it in purple all as it retires passing into the pure reflective blue   § 12 relation of various circumstances of past agitation etc by the         most trifling incidents as in the cowes  but turner is not satisfied with this he is never altogether content unless he can at the same time that he takes advantage of all the placidity of repose tell us something either about the past commotion of the water or of some present stirring of tide or current which its stillness does not show or give us something or other to think about and reason upon as well as to look at take a few instances his cowes isle of wight is a summer twilight about half an hour or more after sunset intensity of repose is the great aim throughout and the unity of tone of the picture is one of the finest things that turner has ever done but there is not only quietness there is the very deepest solemnity in the whole of the light as well as in the stillness of the vessels and turner wishes to enhance this feeling by representing not only repose but power in repose the emblem in the sea of the quiet ships of war accordingly he takes the greatest possible pains to get his surface polished calm and smooth but he indicates the reflection of a buoy floating a full quarter of a mile off by three black strokes with wide intervals between them the last of which touches the water within twenty yards of the spectator now these three reflections can only indicate the farther sides of three rises of an enormous swell and give by their intervals of separation a space of from twelve to twenty yards for the breadth of each wave including the sweep between them and this swell is farther indicated by the reflection of the new moon falling in a wide zigzag line the exceeding majesty which this single circumstance gives to the whole picture the sublime sensation of power and knowledge of former exertion which we instantly receive from it if we have but acquaintance with nature enough to understand its language render this work not only a piece of the most refined truth as which i have at present named it but to my mind one of the highest pieces of intellectual art existing   § 13 in scenes on the loire and seine  again in the scene on the loire with the square precipice and fiery sunset in the rivers of france repose has been aimed at in the same way and most thoroughly given but the immense width of the river at this spot makes it look like a lake or sea and it was therefore necessary that we should be made thoroughly to understand and feel that this is not the calm of still water but the tranquillity of a majestic current accordingly a boat swings at anchor on the right and the stream dividing at its bow flows towards us in two long dark waves especial attention to which is enforced by the one on the left being brought across the reflected stream of sunshine which it separates and which is broken in the nearer water by the general undulation and agitation caused by the boats wake a wake caused by the waters passing it not by its going through the water   § 14 expression of contrary waves caused by recoil from shore  § 15 various other instances  again in the confluence of the seine and marne we have the repose of the wide river stirred by the paddles of the steamboat whose plashing we can almost hear for we are especially compelled to look at them by their being made the central note of the compositionthe blackest object in it opposed to the strongest light and this disturbance is not merely caused by the two lines of surge from the boats wake for any other painter must have given these but turner never rests satisfied till he has told you all in his power and he has not only given the receding surges but these have gone on to the shore have struck upon it and been beaten back from it in another line of weaker contrary surges whose point of intersection with those of the wake itself is marked by the sudden subdivision and disorder of the waves of the wake on the extreme left and whose reverted direction is exquisitely given where their lines cross the calm water close to the spectator and marked also by the sudden vertical spring of the spray just where they intersect the swell from the boat and in order that we may fully be able to account for these reverted waves we are allowed just at the extreme righthand limit of the picture to see the point where the swell from the boat meets the shore in the chaise de gargantua we have the still water lulled by the dead calm which usually precedes the most violent storms suddenly broken upon by a tremendous burst of wind from the gathered thunderclouds scattering the boats and raising the water into rage except where it is sheltered by the hills in the jumieges and vernon we have farther instances of local agitation caused in the one instance by a steamer in the other by the large waterwheels under the bridge not observe a mere splashing about the wheel itself this is too far off to be noticeable so that we should not have even known that the objects beneath the bridge were waterwheels but for the agitation recorded a quarter of a mile down the river where its current crosses the sunlight and thus there will scarcely ever be found a piece of quiet water by turner without some story in it of one kind or another sometimes a slight but beautiful incidentoftener as in the cowes something on which the whole sentiment and intention of the picture in a great degree depends but invariably presenting some new instance of varied knowledge and observation some fresh appeal to the highest faculties of the mind   § 16 turners painting of distant expanses of water calm interrupted         by ripple  § 17 and ripple crossed by sunshine  of extended surfaces of water as rendered by turner the loch katrine and derwentwater of the illustrations to scott and the loch lomond vignette in rogerss poems are characteristic instances the first of these gives us the most distant part of the lake entirely under the influence of a light breeze and therefore entirely without reflections of the objects on its borders but the whole near half is untouched by the wind and on that is cast the image of the upper part of benvenue and of the islands the second gives us the surface with just so much motion upon it as to prolong but not to destroy the reflections of the dark woodsreflections only interrupted by the ripple of the boats wake and the third gives us an example of the whole surface so much affected by ripple as to bring into exercise all those laws which we have seen so grossly violated by canaletto we see in the nearest boat that though the lines of the gunwale are much blacker and more conspicuous than that of the cutwater yet the gunwale lines being nearly horizontal have no reflection whatsoever while the line of the cutwater being vertical has a distinct reflection of three times its own length but even these tremulous reflections are only visible as far as the islands beyond them as the lake retires into distance we find it receives only the reflection of the gray light from the clouds and runs in one flat white field up between the hills and besides all this we have another phenomenon quite new given to usthe brilliant gleam of light along the centre of the lake this is not caused by ripple for it is cast on a surface rippled all over but it is what we could not have without ripplethe light of a passage of sunshine i have already chap i § 9 explained the cause of this phenomenon which never can by any possibility take place on calm water being the multitudinous reflection of the sun from the sides of the ripples causing an appearance of local light and shadow and being dependent like real light and shadow on the passage of the clouds though the dark parts of the water are the reflections of the clouds not the shadows of them and the bright parts are the reflections of the sun and not the light of it this little vignette then will entirely complete the system of turners universal truth in quiet water we have seen every phenomenon given by himthe clear reflection the prolonged reflection the reflection broken by ripple and finally the ripple broken by light and shade and it is especially to be observed how careful he is in this last case when he uses the apparent light and shade to account for it by showing us in the whiteness of the lake beyond its universal subjection to ripple   § 18 his drawing of distant rivers  § 19 and of surface associated with mist  we have not spoken of turners magnificent drawing of distant rivers which however is dependent only on more complicated application of the same laws with exquisite perspective the sweeps of river in the dryburgh illustrations to scott and melrose are bold and characteristic examples as well as the rouen from st catherines hill and the caudebec in the rivers of france the only thing which in these works requires particular attention is the care with which the height of the observer above the river is indicated by the loss of the reflections of its banks this is perhaps shown most clearly in the caudebec if we had been on a level with the river its whole surface would have been darkened by the reflection of the steep and high banks but being far above it we can see no more of the image than we could of the hill itself if it were actually reversed under the water and therefore we see that turner gives us only a narrow line of dark water immediately under the precipice the broad surface reflecting only the sky this is also finely shown on the lefthand side of the dryburgh  but all these early works of the artist have been eclipsed by some recent drawings of switzerland these latter are not to be described by any words but they must be noted here not only as presenting records of lake effect on grander scale and of more imaginative character than any other of his works but as combining effects of the surface of mist with the surface of water two or three of the lake of lucerne seen from above give the melting of the mountain promontories beneath into the clear depth and above into the clouds one of constance shows the vast lake at evening seen not as water but its surface covered with low white mist lying league beyond league in the twilight like a fallen space of moony cloud one of goldau shows the lake of zug appearing through the chasm of a thundercloud under sunset its whole surface one blaze of fire and the promontories of the hills thrown out against it like spectres another of zurich gives the playing of the green waves of the river among white streams of moonlight two purple sunsets on the lake of zug are distinguished for the glow obtained without positive color the rose and purple tints being in great measure brought by opposition out of browns finally a drawing executed in 1845 of the town of lucerne from the lake is unique for its expression of water surface reflecting the clear green hue of sky at twilight   § 20 his drawing of falling water with peculiar expression of weight  § 21 the abandonment and plunge of great cataracts how given by him  it will be remembered that it was said above that turner was the only painter who had ever represented the surface of calm or the force of agitated water he obtains this expression of force in falling or running water by fearless and full rendering of its forms he never loses himself and his subject in the splash of the fallhis presence of mind never fails as he goes down he does not blind us with the spray or veil the countenance of his fall with its own drapery a little crumbling white or lightly rubbed paper will soon give the effect of indiscriminate foam but nature gives more than foamshe shows beneath it and through it a peculiar character of exquisitely studied form bestowed on every wave and line of fall and it is this variety of definite character which turner always aims at rejecting as much as possible everything that conceals or overwhelms it thus in the upper fall of the tees though the whole basin of the fall is blue and dim with the rising vapor yet the whole attention of the spectator is directed to that which it was peculiarly difficult to render the concentric zones and delicate curves of the falling water itself and it is impossible to express with what exquisite accuracy these are given they are the characteristic of a powerful stream descending without impediment or break but from a narrow channel so as to expand as it falls they are the constant form which such a stream assumes as it descends and yet i think it would be difficult to point to another instance of their being rendered in art you will find nothing in the waterfalls even of our best painters but springing lines of parabolic descent and splashing shapeless foam and in consequence though they may make you understand the swiftness of the water they never let you feel the weight of it the stream in their hands looks active not supine as if it leaped not as if it fell now water will leap a little way it will leap down a weir or over a stone but it tumbles over a high fall like this and it is when we have lost the parabolic line and arrived at the catenarywhen we have lost the spring of the fall and arrived at the plunge of it that we begin really to feel its weight and wildness where water takes its first leap from the top it is cool and collected and uninteresting and mathematical but it is when it finds that it has got into a scrape and has farther to go than it thought for that its character comes out it is then that it begins to writhe and twist and sweep out zone after zone in wilder stretching as it falls and to send down the rocketlike lancepointed whizzing shafts at its sides sounding for the bottom and it is this prostration this hopeless abandonment of its ponderous power to the air which is always peculiarly expressed by turner and especially in the case before us while our other artists keeping to the parabolic line where they do not lose themselves in smoke and foam make their cataract look muscular and wiry and may consider themselves fortunate if they can keep it from stopping i believe the majesty of motion which turner has given by these concentric catenary lines must be felt even by those who have never seen a high waterfall and therefore cannot appreciate their exquisite fidelity to nature  in the chain bridge over the tees this passiveness and swinging of the water to and fro are yet more remarkable while we have another characteristic of a great waterfall given to us that the wind in this instance coming up the valley against the current takes the spray up off the edges and carries it back in little torn reverted rags and threads seen in delicate form against the darkness on the left but we must understand a little more about the nature of running water before we can appreciate the drawing either of this or any other of turners torrents   § 22 difference in the action of water when continuous and when         interrupted the interrupted stream fills the hollows of its bed  § 23 but the continuous stream takes the shape of its bed  § 24 its exquisite curved lines  when water not in very great body runs in a rocky bed much interrupted by hollows so that it can rest every now and then in a pool as it goes along it does not acquire a continuous velocity of motion it pauses after every leap and curdles about and rests a little and then goes on again and if in this comparatively tranquil and rational state of mind it meets with an obstacle as a rock or stone it parts on each side of it with a little bubbling foam and goes round if it comes to a step in its bed it leaps it lightly and then after a little plashing at the bottom stops again to take breath but if its bed be on a continuous slope not much interrupted by hollows so that it cannot rest or if its own mass be so increased by flood that its usual restingplaces are not sufficient for it but that it is perpetually pushed out of them by the following current before it has had time to tranquillize itself it of course gains velocity with every yard that it runs the impetus got at one leap is carried to the credit of the next until the whole stream becomes one mass of unchecked accelerating motion now when water in this state comes to an obstacle it does not part at it but clears it like a racehorse and when it comes to a hollow it does not fill it up and run out leisurely at the other side but it rushes down into it and comes up again on the other side as a ship into the hollow of the sea hence the whole appearance of the bed of the stream is changed and all the lines of the water altered in their nature the quiet stream is a succession of leaps and pools the leaps are light and springy and parabolic and make a great deal of splashing when they tumble into the pool then we have a space of quiet curdling water and another similar leap below but the stream when it has gained an impetus takes the shape of its bed never stops is equally deep and equally swift everywhere goes down into every hollow not with a leap but with a swing not foaming nor splashing but in the bending line of a strong seawave and comes up again on the other side over rock and ridge with the ease of a bounding leopard if it meet a rock three or four feet above the level of its bed it will neither part nor foam nor express any concern about the matter but clear it in a smooth dome of water without apparent exertion coming down again as smoothly on the other side the whole surface of the surge being drawn into parallel lines by its extreme velocity but foamless except in places where the form of the bed opposes itself at some direct angle to such a line of fall and causes a breaker so that the whole river has the appearance of a deep and raging sea with this only difference that the torrentwaves always break backwards and seawaves forwards thus then in the water which has gained an impetus we have the most exquisite arrangements of curved lines perpetually changing from convex to concave and vice versa following every swell and hollow of the bed with their modulating grace and all in unison of motion presenting perhaps the most beautiful series of inorganic forms which nature can possibly produce for the sea runs too much into similar and concave curves with sharp edges but every motion of the torrent is united and all its curves are modifications of beautiful line   § 25 turners careful choice of the historical truth  § 26 his exquisite drawing of the continuous torrent in the llanthony         abbey  we see therefore why turner seizes on these curved lines of the torrent not only as being among the most beautiful forms of nature but because they are an instant expression of the utmost power and velocity and tell us how the torrent has been flowing before we see it for the leap and splash might be seen in the sudden freakishness of a quiet stream or the fall of a rivulet over a milldam but the undulating line is the exclusive attribute of the mountaintorrent67 whose fall and fury have made the valleys echo for miles and thus the moment we see one of its curves over a stone in the foreground we know how far it has come and how fiercely and in the drawing we have been speaking of the lower fall of the tees in the foreground of the killiecrankie and rhymers glen and of the st maurice in rogerss italy we shall find the most exquisite instances of the use of such lines but the most perfect of all in the llanthony abbey which may be considered as the standard of torrentdrawing the chief light of the picture here falls upon the surface of the stream swelled by recent rain and its mighty waves come rolling down close to the spectator green and clear but pale with anger in gigantic unbroken oceanic curves bending into each other without break or foam though jets of fiery spray are cast into the air along the rocky shore and rise in the sunshine in dusty vapor the whole surface is one united race of mad motion all the waves dragged as i have described into lines and furrows by their swiftness and every one of these fine forms is drawn with the most studied chiaroscuro of delicate color grays and greens as silvery and pure as the finest passages of paul veronese and with a refinement of execution which the eye strains itself in looking into the rapidity and gigantic force of this torrent the exquisite refinement of its color and the vividness of foam which is obtained through a general middle tint render it about the most perfect piece of painting of running water in existence   § 27 and of the interrupted torrent in the mercury and argus  now this picture is as was noticed in our former reference to it full of expression of every kind of motion the clouds are in wild haste the sun is gleaming fast and fitfully through the leaves the rain drifting away along the hillside and the torrent the principal object to complete the impression is made the wildest thing of all and not only wild before us and with us but bearing with it in its every motion from its long course the record of its rage observe how differently turner uses his torrent when the spirit of the picture is repose in the mercury and argus we have also a stream in the foreground but in coming down to us we see it stopping twice in two quiet and glassy pools upon which the drinking cattle cast an unstirred image from the nearest of these the water leaps in three cascades into another basin close to us it trickles in silver threads through the leaves at its edge and falls tinkling and splashing though in considerable body into the pool stirring its quiet surface at which a bird is stooping to drink with concentric and curdling ripples which divide round the stone at its farthest border and descend in sparkling foam over the lip of the basin thus we find in every case the system of turners truth entirely unbroken each phase and phenomenon of nature being recorded exactly where it is most valuable and impressive   § 28 various cases  we have not however space to follow out the variety of his torrentdrawing the above two examples are characteristic of the two great divisions or classes of torrentsthat whose motion is continuous and whose motion is interrupted all drawing of running water will resolve itself into the representation of one or other of these the descent of the distant stream in the vignette to the boy of egremond is slight but very striking and the junction of the greta and tees a singular instance of the bold drawing of the complicated forms of a shallow stream among multitudinous rocks a still finer example occurs in a recent drawing of dazio grande on the st gothard the waves of the toccia clear and blue fretting among the granite débris which were brought down by the storm that destroyed the whole road in the ivy bridge the subject is the rest of the torrent in a pool among fallen rocks the forms of the stones are seen through the clear brown water and their reflections mingle with those of the foliage   § 29 sea painting impossibility of truly representing foam  more determined efforts have at all periods been made in sea painting than in torrent painting yet less successful as above stated it is easy to obtain a resemblance of broken running water by tricks and dexterities but the sea must be legitimately drawn it cannot be given as utterly disorganized and confused its weight and mass must be expressed and the efforts at expression of it end in failure with all but the most powerful men even with these few a partial success must be considered worthy of the highest praise  as the right rendering of the alps depends on power of drawing snow so the right painting of the sea must depend at least in all coast scenery in no small measure on the power of drawing foam yet there are two conditions of foam of invariable occurrence on breaking waves of which i have never seen the slightest record attempted first the thick creamy curdling overlapping massy form which remains for a moment only after the fall of the wave and is seen in perfection in its running up the beach and secondly the thin white coating into which this subsides which opens into oval gaps and clefts marbling the waves over their whole surface and connecting the breakers on a flat shore by long dragging streams of white  it is evident that the difficulty of expressing either of these two conditions must be immense the lapping and curdling form is difficult enough to catch even when the lines of its undulation alone are considered but the lips so to speak which lie along these lines are full projecting and marked by beautiful light and shade each has its high light a gradation into shadow of indescribable delicacy a bright reflected light and a dark cast shadow to draw all this requires labor and care and firmness of work which as i imagine must always however skilfully bestowed destroy all impression of wildness accidentalism and evanescence and so kill the sea again the openings in the thin subsided foam in their irregular modifications of circular and oval shapes dragged hither and thither would be hard enough to draw even if they could be seen on a flat surface instead of which every one of the openings is seen in undulation on a tossing surface broken up over small surges and ripples and so thrown into perspectives of the most hopeless intricacy now it is not easy to express the lie of a pattern with oval openings on the folds of drapery i do not know that any one under the mark of veronese or titian could even do this as it ought to be done yet in drapery much stiffness and error may be overlooked not so in seathe slightest inaccuracy the slightest want of flow and freedom in the line is attached by the eye in a moment of high treason and i believe success to be impossible  yet there is not a wave or any violently agitated sea on which both these forms do not appear the latter especially after some time of storm extends over their whole surfaces the reader sees therefore why i said that sea could only be painted by means of more or less dexterous conventionalisms since two of its most enduring phenomena cannot be represented at all   § 30 character of shorebreakers also inexpressible  again as respects the form of breakers on an even shore there is difficulty of no less formidable kind there is in them an irreconcilable mixture of fury and formalism their hollow surface is marked by parallel lines like those of a smooth millweir and graduated by reflected and transmitted lights of the most wonderful intricacy its curve being at the same time necessarily of mathematical purity and precision yet at the top of this curve when it nods over there is a sudden laxity and giving way the water swings and jumps along the ridge like a shaken chain and the motion runs from part to part as it does through a serpents body then the wind is at work on the extreme edge and instead of letting it fling itself off naturally it supports it and drives it back or scrapes it off and carries it bodily away so that the spray at the top is in a continual transition between forms projected by their own weight and forms blown and carried off with their weight overcome then at last when it has come down who shall say what shape that may be called which shape has none of the great crash where it touches the beach  i think it is that last crash which is the great taskmaster nobody can do anything with it i have seen copley fielding come very close to the jerk and nod of the lifted threatening edge curl it very successfully and without any look of its having been in papers down nearly to the beach but the final fall has no thunder in it turner has tried hard for it once or twice but it will not do the moment is given in the sidon of the bible illustrations and more elaborately in a painting of bamborough in both these cases there is little foam at the bottom and the fallen breaker looks like a wall yet grand always and in the latter picture very beautifully assisted in expression by the tossing of a piece of cable which some figures are dragging ashore and which the breaker flings into the air as it falls perhaps the most successful rendering of the forms was in the hero and leander but there the drawing was rendered easier by the powerful effect of light which disguised the foam   § 31 their effect how injured when seen from the shore  it is not however from the shore that turner usually studies his sea seen from the land the curl of the breakers even in nature is somewhat uniform and monotonous the size of the waves out at sea is uncomprehended and those nearer the eye seem to succeed and resemble each other to move slowly to the beach and to break in the same lines and forms  afloat even twenty yards from the shore we receive a totally different impression every wave around us appears vastevery one different from all the restand the breakers present now that we see them with their backs towards us the grand extended and varied lines of long curvature which are peculiarly expressive both of velocity and power recklessness before unfelt is manifested in the mad perpetual changeful undirected motion not of wave after wave as it appears from the shore but of the very same water rising and falling of waves that successively approach and break each appears to the mind a separate individual whose part being performed it perishes and is succeeded by another and there is nothing in this to impress us with the idea of restlessness any more than in any successive and continuous functions of life and death but it is when we perceive that it is no succession of wave but the same water constantly rising and crashing and recoiling and rolling in again in new forms and with fresh fury that we perceive the perturbed spirit and feel the intensity of its unwearied rage the sensation of power is also trebled for not only is the vastness of apparent size much increased but the whole action is different it is not a passive wave rolling sleepily forward until it tumbles heavily prostrated upon the beach but a sweeping exertion of tremendous and living strength which does not now appear to fall but to burst upon the shore which never perishes but recoils and recovers   § 32 turners expression of heavy rolling sea  § 33 with peculiar expression of weight  aiming at these grand characters of the sea turner almost always places the spectator not on the shore but twenty or thirty yards from it beyond the first range of the breakers as in the lands end fowey dunbar and laugharne the latter has been well engraved and may be taken as a standard of the expression of fitfulness and power the grand division of the whole space of the sea by a few dark continuous furrows of tremendous swell the breaking of one of which alone has strewed the rocks in front with ruin furnishes us with an estimate of space and strength which at once reduces the men upon the shore to insects and yet through this terrific simplicity there is indicated a fitfulness and fury in the tossing of the individual lines which give to the whole sea a wild unwearied reckless incoherency like that of an enraged multitude whose masses act together in frenzy while not one individual feels as another especial attention is to be directed to the flatness of all the lines for the same principle holds in sea which we have seen in mountains all the size and sublimity of nature are given not by the height but by the breadth of her masses and turner by following her in her sweeping lines while he does not lose the elevation of its surges adds in a tenfold degree to their power farther observe the peculiar expression of weight which there is in turners waves precisely of the same kind which we saw in his waterfall we have not a cutting springing elastic lineno jumping or leaping in the waves that is the characteristic of chelsea reach or hampstead ponds in a storm but the surges roll and plunge with such prostration and hurling of their mass against the shore that we feel the rocks are shaking under them and to add yet more to this impression observe how little comparatively they are broken by the wind above the floating wood and along the shore we have indication of a line of torn spray but it is a mere fringe along the ridge of the surgeno interference with its gigantic body the wind has no power over its tremendous unity of force and weight finally observe how on the rocks on the left the violence and swiftness of the rising wave are indicated by precisely the same lines which we saw were indicative of fury in the torrent the water on these rocks is the body of the wave which has just broken rushing up over them and in doing so like the torrent it does not break nor foam nor part upon the rock but accommodates itself to every one of its swells and hollows with undulating lines whose grace and variety might alone serve us for a days study and it is only where two streams of this rushing water meet in the hollow of the rock that their force is shown by the vertical bound of the spray  illustration port ruysdael                  from a painting by turner   § 34 peculiar action of recoiling waves  § 35 and of the stroke of a breaker on the shore  § 36 general character of sea on a rocky coast given by turner in the         lands end  in the distance of this grand picture there are two waves which entirely depart from the principle observed by all the rest and spring high into the air they have a message for us which it is important that we should understand their leap is not a preparation for breaking neither is it caused by their meeting with a rock it is caused by their encounter with the recoil of the preceding wave when a large surge in the act of breaking just as it curls over is hurled against the face either of a wall or of a vertical rock the sound of the blow is not a crash nor a roar it is a report as loud as and in every respect similar to that of a great gun and the wave is dashed back from the rock with force scarcely diminished but reversed in directionit now recedes from the shore and at the instant that it encounters the following breaker the result is the vertical bound of both which is here rendered by turner such a recoiling wave will proceed out to sea through ten or twelve ranges of following breakers before it is overpowered the effect of the encounter is more completely and palpably given in the quilleboeuf in the rivers of france it is peculiarly instructive here as informing us of the nature of the coast and the force of the waves far more clearly than any spray about the rocks themselves could have done but the effect of the blow at the shore itself is given in the lands end and vignette to lycidas under favorable circumstances with an advancing tide under a heavy gale where the breakers feel the shore underneath them a moment before they touch the rock so as to nod over when they strike the effect is nearly incredible except to an eyewitness i have seen the whole body of the wave rise in one white vertical broad fountain eighty feet above the sea half of it beaten so fine as to be borne away by the wind the rest turning in the air when exhausted and falling back with a weight and crash like that of an enormous waterfall this is given most completely in the lycidas and the blow of a less violent wave among broken rocks not meeting it with an absolute wall along the shore of the lands end this last picture is a study of sea whose whole organization has been broken up by constant recoils from a rocky coast the laugharne gives the surge and weight of the ocean in a gale on a comparatively level shore but the lands end the entire disorder of the surges when every one of them divided and entangled among promontories as it rolls in and beaten back part by part from walls of rock on this side and that side recoils like the defeated division of a great army throwing all behind it into disorder breaking up the succeeding waves into vertical ridges which in their turn yet more totally shattered upon the shore retire in more hopeless confusion until the whole surface of the sea becomes one dizzy whirl of rushing writhing tortured undirected rage bounding and crashing and coiling in an anarchy of enormous power subdivided into myriads of waves of which every one is not be it remembered a separate surge but part and portion of a vast one actuated by internal power and giving in every direction the mighty undulation of impetuous line which glides over the rocks and writhes in the wind overwhelming the one and piercing the other with the form fury and swiftness of a sheet of lambent fire and throughout the rendering of all this there is not one false curve given not one which is not the perfect expression of visible motion and the forms of the infinite sea are drawn throughout with that utmost mastery of art which through the deepest study of every line makes every line appear the wildest child of chance while yet each is in itself a subject and a picture different from all else around of the color of this magnificent sea i have before spoken it is a solemn green gray with its foam seen dimly through the darkness of twilight modulated with the fulness changefulness and sadness of a deep wild melody   § 37 open seas of turners earlier times  the greater number of turners paintings of open sea belong to a somewhat earlier period than these drawings nor generally speaking are they of equal value it appears to me that the artist had at that time either less knowledge of or less delight in the characteristics of deep water than of coast sea and that in consequence he suffered himself to be influenced by some of the qualities of the dutch seapainters in particular he borrowed from them the habit of casting a dark shadow on the near waves so as to bring out a stream of light behind and though he did this in a more legitimate way than they that is to say expressing the light by touches on the foam and indicating the shadow as cast on foamy surface still the habit has induced much feebleness and conventionality in the pictures of the period his drawing of the waves was also somewhat petty and divided small forms covered with white flat spray a condition which i doubt not the artist has seen on some of the shallow dutch seas but which i have never met with myself and of the rendering of which therefore i cannot speak yet even in these which i think among the poorest works of the painter the expressions of breeze motion and light are very marvellous and it is instructive to compare them either with the lifeless works of the dutch themselves or with any modern imitations of them as for instance with the seas of callcott where all the light is white and all the shadows gray where no distinction is made between water and foam or between real and reflective shadow and which are generally without evidence of the artists having ever seen the sea  some pictures however belonging to this period of turner are free from the dutch infection and show the real power of the artist a very important one is in the possession of lord francis egerton somewhat heavy in its forms but remarkable for the grandeur of distance obtained at the horizon a much smaller but more powerful example is the port ruysdael in the possession of e bicknell esq with which i know of no work at all comparable for the expression of the white wild cold comfortless waves of northern sea even though the sea is almost subordinate to the awful rolling clouds both these pictures are very gray the pas de calais has more color and shows more art than either yet is less impressive recently two marines of the same subdued color have appeared 1843 among his more radiant works one ostend somewhat forced and affected but the other also called port ruysdael is among the most perfect sea pictures he has produced and especially remarkable as being painted without one marked opposition either of color or of shade all quiet and simple even to an extreme so that the picture was exceedingly unattractive at first sight the shadow of the pierhead on the near waves is marked solely by touches indicative of reflected light and so mysteriously that when the picture is seen near it is quite untraceable and comes into existence as the spectator retires it is thus of peculiar truth and value and instructive as a contrast to the dark shadows of his earlier time   § 38 effect of sea after prolonged storm  few people comparatively have ever seen the effect on the sea of a powerful gale continued without intermission for three or four days and nights and to those who have not i believe it must be unimaginable not from the mere force or size of surge but from the complete annihilation of the limit between sea and air the water from its prolonged agitation is beaten not into mere creaming foam but into masses of accumulated yeast68 which hang in ropes and wreaths from wave to wave and where one curls over to break form a festoon like a drapery from its edge these are taken up by the wind not in dissipating dust but bodily in writhing hanging coiling masses which make the air white and thick as with snow only the flakes are a foot or two long each the surges themselves are full of foam in their very bodies underneath making them white all through as the water is under a great cataract and their masses being thus half water and half air are torn to pieces by the wind whenever they rise and carried away in roaring smoke which chokes and strangles like actual water add to this that when the air has been exhausted of its moisture by long rain the spray of the sea is caught by it as described above section iii chapter vi § 13 and covers its surface not merely with the smoke of finely divided water but with boiling mist imagine also the low rainclouds brought down to the very level of the sea as i have often seen them whirling and flying in rags and fragments from wave to wave and finally conceive the surges themselves in their utmost pitch of power velocity vastness and madness lifting themselves in precipices and peaks furrowed with their whirl of ascent through all this chaos and you will understand that there is indeed no distinction left between the sea and air that no object nor horizon nor any landmark or natural evidence of position is left that the heaven is all spray and the ocean all cloud and that you can see no farther in any direction than you could see through a cataract suppose the effect of the first sunbeam sent from above to show this annihilation to itself and you have the sea picture of the academy 1842the snowstorm one of the very grandest statements of seamotion mist and light that has ever been put on canvas even by turner of course it was not understood his finest works never are but there was some apology for the publics not comprehending this for few people have had the opportunity of seeing the sea at such a time and when they have cannot face it to hold by a mast or a rock and watch it is a prolonged endurance of drowning which few people have courage to go through to those who have it is one of the noblest lessons of nature   § 39 turners noblest work the deep open sea in the slave ship  but i think the noblest sea that turner has ever painted and if so the noblest certainly ever painted by man is that of the slave ship the chief academy picture of the exhibition of 1840 it is a sunset on the atlantic after prolonged storm but the storm is partially lulled and the torn and streaming rainclouds are moving in scarlet lines to lose themselves in the hollow of the night the whole surface of sea included in the picture is divided into two ridges of enormous swell not high nor local but a low broad heaving of the whole ocean like the lifting of its bosom by deepdrawn breath after the torture of the storm between these two ridges the fire of the sunset falls along the trough of the sea dyeing it with an awful but glorious light the intense and lurid splendor which burns like gold and bathes like blood along this fiery path and valley the tossing waves by which the swell of the sea is restlessly divided lift themselves in dark indefinite fantastic forms each casting a faint and ghastly shadow behind it along the illumined foam they do not rise everywhere but three or four together in wild groups fitfully and furiously as the under strength of the swell compels or permits them leaving between them treacherous spaces of level and whirling water now lighted with green and lamplike fire now flashing back the gold of the declining sun now fearfully dyed from above with the indistinguishable images of the burning clouds which fall upon them in flakes of crimson and scarlet and give to the reckless waves the added motion of their own fiery flying purple and blue the lurid shadows of the hollow breakers are cast upon the mist of the night which gathers cold and low advancing like the shadow of death upon the guilty69 ship as it labors amidst the lightning of the sea its thin masts written upon the sky in lines of blood girded with condemnation in that fearful hue which signs the sky with horror and mixes its flaming flood with the sunlightand cast far along the desolate heave of the sepulchral waves incarnadines the multitudinous sea   § 40 its united excellences and perfection as a whole  i believe if i were reduced to rest turners immortality upon any single work i should choose this its daring conceptionideal in the highest sense of the wordis based on the purest truth and wrought out with the concentrated knowledge of a life its color is absolutely perfect not one false or morbid hue in any part or line and so modulated that every square inch of canvas is a perfect composition its drawing as accurate as fearless the ship buoyant bending and full of motion its tones as true as they are wonderful70 and the whole picture dedicated to the most sublime of subjects and impressionscompleting thus the perfect system of all truth which we have shown to be formed by turners worksthe power majesty and deathfulness of the open deep illimitable sea   footnotes    66 not altogether i believe here as in a former case i have     attributed far too much influence to this change of focus in     turners earlier works the principle is not found in the rivers of     the yorkshire drawings every reflection is given clearly even to     the farthest depth and yet the surface is not lost and it would     deprive the painter of much power if he were not sometimes so to     represent them especially when his object is repose it being of     course as lawful for him to choose one adaptation of the sight as     another i have however left the above paragraphs as first     written because they are true although i think they make too much     of an unimportant matter the reader may attribute to them such     weight as he thinks fit he is referred to § 11 of this chapter and     to § 4 of the first chapter of this section    67 on a large scale it is so but the same lines are to be seen     for the moment whenever water becomes exceedingly rapid and yet     feels the bottom as it passes being not thrown up or cast clear of     it in general the drawing of water fails from being too     interrupted the forms flung hither and thither and broken up and     covered with bright touches instead of being wrought out in their     real unities of curvature it is difficult enough to draw a curved     surface even when it is rough and has texture but to indicate the     varied and sweeping forms of a crystalline and polished substance     requires far more skill and patience than most artists possess in     some respects it is impossible i do not suppose any means of art     are capable of rightly expressing the smooth multitudinous rippling     of a rapid rivulet of shallow water giving its transparency lustre     and fullydeveloped forms and the greater number of the lines and     actions of torrentwaves are equally inexpressible the effort     should nevertheless always be made and whatever is sacrificed in     color freedom or brightness the real contours ought always in     some measure to be drawn as a careful draughtsman secures those of     flesh or any other finelymodelled surface it is better in many     respects the drawing should miss of being like water than that     it should miss in this one respect the grandeur of water many     tricks of scratching and dashing will bring out a deceptive     resemblance the determined and laborious rendering of contour alone     secures sublimity    68 the yesty waves of shakspeare have made the likeness     familiar and probably most readers take the expression as merely     equivalent to foamy but shakspeare knew better seafoam does     not under ordinary circumstances last a moment after it is formed     but disappears as above described in a mere white film but the     foam of a prolonged tempest is altogether different it is whipped     foamthick permanent and in a foul or discolored sea very     ugly especially in the way it hangs about the tops of the waves     and gathers into clotted concretions before the driving wind the     sea looks truly working or fermenting the following passage from     fenimore cooper is an interesting confirmation of the rest of the     above description which may be depended upon as entirely free from     exaggerationfor the first time i now witnessed a tempest at sea     gales and pretty hard ones i had often seen but the force of the     wind on this occasion as much exceeded that in ordinary gales of     wind as the force of these had exceeded that of a wholesail     breeze the seas seemed crushed the pressure of the swooping     atmosphere as the currents of the air went howling over the surface     of the ocean fairly preventing them from rising or where a mound     of water did appear it was scooped up and borne off in spray as     the axe dubs inequalities from the log when the day returned a     species of lurid sombre light was diffused over the watery waste     though nothing was visible but the ocean and the ship even the     seabirds seemed to have taken refuge in the caverns of the adjacent     coast none reappearing with the dawn the air was full of spray     and it was with difficulty that the eye could penetrate as far into     the humid atmosphere as half a milemiles wattingford half a     mile is an overestimate in coast    69 she is a slaver throwing her slaves overboard the near sea is     encumbered with corpses    70 there is a piece of tone of the same kind equal in one part     but not so united with the rest of the picture in the storm scene     illustrative of the antiquarya sunset light on polished sea i     ought to have particularly mentioned the sea in the lowestoffe as a     piece of the cutting motion of shallow water under storm     altogether in gray which should be especially contrasted as a     piece of color with the grays of vandevelde and the sea in the     great yarmouth should have been noticed for its expression of water     in violent agitation seen in enormous extent from a great     elevation there is almost every form of sea in itrolling waves     dashing on the piersuccessive breakers rolling

views of the southern     coast which does not give some new condition or circumstance of sea                                      section vi                      of truth of vegetationconclusion                                      chapter i                            of truth of vegetation   § 1 frequent occurrence of foliage in the works of the old masters  we have now arrived at the consideration of what was with the old masters the subject of most serious and perpetual study if they do not give us truth here they cannot have the faculty of truth in them for foliage is the chief component part of all their pictures and is finished by them with a care and labor which if bestowed without attaining truth must prove either their total bluntness of perception or total powerlessness of hand with the italian school i can scarcely recollect a single instance in which foliage does not form the greater part of the picture in fact they are rather painters of treeportrait than landscape painters for rocks and sky and architecture are usually mere accessories and backgrounds to the dark masses of laborious foliage of which the composition principally consists yet we shall be less detained by the examination of foliage than by our former subjects since where specific form is organized and complete and the occurrence of the object universal it is easy without requiring any laborious attention in the reader to demonstrate to him quite as much of the truth or falsehood of various representations of it as may serve to determine the character and rank of the painter   § 2 laws common to all forest trees their branches do not taper but        only divide  it will be best to begin as nature does with the stems and branches and then to put the leaves on and in speaking of trees generally be it observed when i say all trees i mean only those ordinary forest or copse trees of europe which are the chief subjects of the landscape painter i do not mean to include every kind of foliage which by any accident can find its way into a picture but the ordinary trees of europeoak elm ash hazel willow birch beech poplar chestnut pine mulberry olive ilex carubbe and such others i do not purpose to examine the characteristics of each tree it will be enough to observe the laws common to all first then neither the stems nor the boughs of any of the above trees taper except where they fork wherever a stem sends off a branch or a branch a lesser bough or a lesser bough a bud the stem or the branch is on the instant less in diameter by the exact quantity of the branch or the bough they have sent off and they remain of the same diameter or if there be any change rather increase than diminish until they send off another branch or bough this law is imperative and without exception no bough nor stem nor twig ever tapering or becoming narrower towards its extremity by a hairbreadth save where it parts with some portion of its substance at a fork or bud so that if all the twigs and sprays at the top and sides of the tree which are and have been could be united without loss of space they would form a round log of the diameter of the trunk from which they spring   § 3 appearance of tapering caused by frequent buds  but as the trunks of most trees send off twigs and sprays of light under foliage of which every individual fibre takes precisely its own thickness of wood from the parent stem and as many of these drop off leaving nothing but a small excrescence to record their existence there is frequently a slight and delicate appearance of tapering bestowed on the trunk itself while the same operation takes place much more extensively in the branches it being natural to almost all trees to send out from their young limbs more wood than they can support which as the stem increases gets contracted at the point of insertion so as to check the flow of the sap and then dies and drops off leaving all along the bough first on one side then on another a series of small excrescences sufficient to account for a degree of tapering which is yet so very slight that if we select a portion of a branch with no real fork or living bough to divide it or diminish it the tapering is scarcely to be detected by the eye and if we select a portion without such evidences of past ramification there will be found none whatsoever   § 4 and care of nature to conceal the parallelism  but nature takes great care and pains to conceal this uniformity in her boughs they are perpetually parting with little sprays here and there which steal away their substance cautiously and where the eye does not perceive the theft until a little way above it feels the loss and in the upper parts of the tree the ramifications take place so constantly and delicately that the effect upon the eye is precisely the same as if the boughs actually tapered except here and there where some avaricious one greedy of substance runs on for two or three yards without parting with anything and becomes ungraceful in so doing   § 5 the degree of tapering which may be represented as continuous  hence we see that although boughs may and must be represented as actually tapering they must only be so when they are sending off foliage and sprays and when they are at such a distance that the particular forks and divisions cannot be evident to the eye and farther even in such circumstances the tapering never can be sudden or rapid no bough ever with appearance of smooth tapering loses more than one tenth of its diameter in a length of ten diameters any greater diminution than this must be accounted for by visible ramification and must take place by steps at each fork   § 6 the trees of gaspar poussin  and therefore we see at once that the stem of gaspar poussins tall tree on the right of the la riccia in the national gallery is a painting of a carrot or a parsnip not of the trunk of a tree for being so near that every individual leaf is visible we should not have seen in nature one branch or stem actually tapering we should have received an impression of graceful diminution but we should have been able on examination to trace it joint by joint fork by fork into the thousand minor supports of the leaves gaspar poussins stem on the contrary only sends off four or five minor branches altogether and both it and they taper violently and without showing why or whereforewithout parting with a single twigwithout showing one vestige of roughness or excrescenceand leaving therefore their unfortunate leaves to hold on as best they may the latter however are clever leaves and support themselves as swarming bees do hanging on by each other   § 7 and of the italian school generally defy this law  but even this piece of work is a jest to the perpetration of the bough at the lefthand upper corner of the picture opposite to itthe view near albano this latter is a representation of an ornamental group of elephants tusks with feathers tied to the ends of them not the wildest imagination could ever conjure up in it the remotest resemblance to the bough of a tree it might be the claws of a witchthe talons of an eaglethe horns of a fiend but it is a full assemblage of every conceivable falsehood which can be told respecting foliagea piece of work so barbarous in every way that one glance at it ought to prove the complete charlatanism and trickery of the whole system of the old landscape painters for i will depart for once from my usual plan of abstaining from all assertion of a things being beautiful or otherwise i will say here at once that such drawing as this is as ugly as it is childish and as painful as it is false and that the man who could tolerate much more who could deliberately set down such a thing on his canvas had neither eye nor feeling for one single attribute or excellence of gods works he might have drawn the other stem in excusable ignorance or under some false impression of being able to improve upon nature but this is conclusive and unpardonable again take the stem of the chief tree in claudes narcissus it is a very faithful portrait of a large boaconstrictor with a handsome tail the kind of trunk which young ladies at fashionable boardingschools represent with nosegays at the top of them by way of forest scenery   § 8 the truth as it is given by j d harding  let us refresh ourselves for a moment by looking at the truth we need not go to turner we will go to the man who next to him is unquestionably the greatest master of foliage in europej d harding take the trunk of the largest stonepine plate 25 in the park and the forest for the first nine or ten feet from the ground it does not lose one hairbreadth of its diameter but the shoot broken off just under the crossing part of the distant tree is followed by an instant diminution of the trunk perfectly appreciable both by the eye and the compasses again the stem maintains undiminished thickness up to the two shoots on the left from the loss of which it suffers again perceptibly on the right immediately above is the stump of a very large bough whose loss reduces the trunk suddenly to about twothirds of what it was at the root diminished again less considerably by the minor branch close to this stump it now retains its diameter up to the three branches broken off just under the head where it once more loses in diameter and finally branches into the multitude of headboughs of which not one will be found tapering in any part but losing themselves gradually by division among their offshoots and spray this is nature and beauty too   § 9 boughs in consequence of this law must diminish where they        divide those of the old masters often do not  but the old masters are not satisfied with drawing carrots for boughs nature can be violated in more ways than one and the industry with which they seek out and adopt every conceivable mode of contradicting her is matter of no small interest it is evident from what we have above stated of the structure of all trees that as no boughs diminish where they do not fork so they cannot fork without diminishing it is impossible that the smallest shoot can be sent out of a bough without a diminution of the diameter above it and wherever a branch goes off it must not only be less in diameter than the bough from which it springs but the bough beyond the fork must be less by precisely the quantity of the branch it has sent off71 now observe the bough underneath the first bend of the great stem in claudes narcissus it sends off four branches like the ribs of a leaf the two lowest of these are both quite as thick as the parent stem and the stem itself is much thicker after it has sent off the first one than it was before the top boughs of the central tree in the marriage of isaac and rebecca ramify in the same scientific way   § 10 boughs must multiply as they diminish those of the old masters         do not  § 11 boughdrawing of salvator  but there are further conclusions to be drawn from this great principle in trees as they only diminish where they divide their increase of number is in precise proportion to their diminution of size so that whenever we come to the extremities of boughs we must have a multitude of sprays sufficient to make up if they were united the bulk of that from which they spring where a bough divides into two equal ramifications the diameter of each of the two is about twothirds that of the single one and the sum of their diameters therefore onefourth greater than the diameter of the single one hence if no boughs died or were lost the quantity of wood in the sprays would appear onefourth greater than would be necessary to make up the thickness of the trunk but the lost boughs remove the excess and therefore speaking broadly the diameters of the outer boughs put together would generally just make up the diameter of the trunk precision in representing this is neither desirable nor possible all that is required is just so much observance of the general principle as may make the eye feel satisfied that there is something like the same quantity of wood in the sprays which there is in the stem but to do this there must be what there always is in nature an exceeding complexity of the outer sprays this complexity gradually increases towards their extremities of course exactly in proportion to the slenderness of the twigs the slenderer they become the more there are of them until at last at the extremities of the tree they form a mass of intricacy which in winter when it can be seen is scarcely distinguishable from fine herbage and is beyond all power of definite representation it can only be expressed by a mass of involved strokes also as they shoot out in every direction some are nearer some more distant some distinct some faint and their intersections and relations of distance are marked with the most exquisite gradations of aerial perspective now it will be found universally in the works of claude gaspar and salvator that the boughs do not get in the least complex or multiplied towards the extremitiesthat each large limb forks only into two or three smaller ones each of which vanishes into the air without any cause or reason for such unaccountable conductunless that the mass of leaves transfixed upon it or tied to it entirely dependent on its single strength have been too much as well they may be for its powers of solitary endurance this total ignorance of tree structure is shown throughout their works the sinon before priam is an instance of it in a really fine work of claudes but the most gross examples are in the works of salvator it appears that this latter artist was hardly in the habit of studying from nature at all after his boyish ramble among the calabrian hills and i do not recollect any instance of a piece of his boughdrawing which is not palpably and demonstrably a madeup phantasm of the studio the proof derivable from this illegitimate tapering being one of the most convincing the painter is always visibly embarrassed to reduce the thick boughs to spray and feeling for salvator naturally had acute feeling for truth that the bough was wrong when it tapered suddenly he accomplishes its diminution by an impossible protraction throwing out shoot after shoot until his branches straggle all across the picture and at last disappear unwillingly where there is no room for them to stretch any farther the consequence is that whatever leaves are put upon such boughs have evidently no adequate support their power of leverage is enough to uproot the tree or if the boughs are left bare they have the look of the long tentacula of some complicated marine monster or of the waving endless threads of bunchy seaweed instead of the firm upholding braced and bending grace of natural boughs i grant that this is in a measure done by salvator from a love of ghastliness and that in certain scenes it is in a sort allowable but it is in a far greater degree done from pure ignorance of tree structure as is sufficiently proved by the landscape of the pitti palace peace burning the arms of war where the spirit of the scene is intended to be quite other than ghastly and yet the tree branches show the usual errors in an extraordinary degree every one of their arrangements is impossible and the trunk of the tree could not for a moment support the foliage it is loaded with so also in the pictures of the guadagni palace and even where the skeleton look of branches is justifiable or desirable there is no occasion for any violation of natural laws i have seen more spectral character in the real limbs of a blasted oak than ever in salvators best monstrosities more horror is to be obtained by right combination of inventive line than by drawing tree branches as if they were wingbones of a pterodactyle all departure from natural forms to give fearfulness is mere germanism it is the work of fancy not of imagination72 and instantly degrades whatever it affects to thirdrate level there is nothing more marked in truly great men than their power of being dreadful without being false or licentious in tintorets murder of abel the head of the sacrificed firstling lies in the corner of the foreground obscurely sketched in and with the light gleaming upon its glazed eyes there is nothing exaggerated about the head but there is more horror got out of it and more of death suggested by its treatment than if he had turned all the trees of his picture into skeletons and raised a host of demons to drive the club   § 12 all these errors especially shown in claudes sketches and         concentrated in a work of g poussins  § 13 impossibility of the angles of boughs being taken out of them by         wind  it is curious that in salvators sketches or etchings there is less that is wrong than in his paintingsthere seems a fresher remembrance of nature about them not so with claude it is only by looking over his sketches in the british museum that a complete and just idea is to be formed of his capacities of error for the feeling and arrangement of many of them are those of an advanced age so that we can scarcely set them down for what they resemblethe work of a boy ten years old and the drawing being seen without any aids of tone or color to set it off shows in its naked falsehood the windy landscape of poussin opposite the dido and Æneas in the national gallery presents us in the foreground tree with a piece of atrocity which i think to any person who candidly considers it may save me all farther trouble of demonstrating the errors of ancient art i do not in the least suspect the picture the tones of it and much of the handling are masterly yet that foreground tree comprises every conceivable violation of truth which the human hand can commit or head invent in drawing a treeexcept only that it is not drawn root uppermost it has no bark no roughness nor character of stem its boughs do not grow out of each other but are stuck into each other they ramify without diminishing diminish without ramifying are terminated by no complicated sprays have their leaves tied to their ends like the heads of dutch brooms and finally and chiefly they are evidently not made of wood but of some soft elastic substance which the wind can stretch out as it pleases for there is not a vestige of an angle in any one of them now the fiercest wind that ever blew upon the earth could not take the angles out of the bough of a tree an inch thick the whole bough bends together retaining its elbows and angles and natural form but affected throughout with curvature in each of its parts and joints that part of it which was before perpendicular being bent aside and that which was before sloping being bent into still greater inclination the angle at which the two parts meet remains the same or if the strain be put in the opposite direction the bough will break long before it loses its angle you will find it difficult to bend the angles out of the youngest sapling if they be marked and absolutely impossible with a strong bough you may break it but you will not destroy its angles and if you watch a tree in the wildest storm you will find that though all its boughs are bending none lose their character but the utmost shoots and sapling spray hence gaspar poussin by his bad drawing does not make his storm strong but his tree weak he does not make his gust violent but his boughs of indiarubber   § 14 boughdrawing of titian  these laws respecting vegetation are so far more imperative than those which were stated respecting water that the greatest artist cannot violate them without danger because they are laws resulting from organic structure which it is always painful to see interrupted on the other hand they have this in common with all laws that they may be observed with mathematical precision yet with no grateful result the disciplined eye and the life in the woods are worth more than all botanical knowledge for there is that about the growing of the tree trunk and that grace in its upper ramification which cannot be taught and which cannot even be seen but by eager watchfulness there is not an exhibition passes but there appear in it hundreds of elaborate paintings of trees many of them executed from nature for three hundred years back trees have been drawn with affection by all the civilized nations of europe and yet i repeat boldly what i before asserted that no men but titian and turner ever drew the stem of a tree  generally i think the perception of the muscular qualities of the tree trunk incomplete except in men who have studied the human figure and in loose expression of those characters the painter who can draw the living muscle seldom fails but the thoroughly peculiar lines belonging to woody fibre can only be learned by patient forest study and hence in all the trees of the merely historical painters there is fault of some kind or another commonly exaggeration of the muscular swellings or insipidity and want of spring in curvature or fantasticism and unnaturalness of arrangement and especially a want of the peculiar characters of bark which express the growth and age of the tree for bark is no mere excrescence lifeless and externalit is a skin of especial significance in its indications of the organic form beneath in places under the arms of the tree it wrinkles up and forms fine lines round the trunk inestimable in their indication of the direction of its surface in others it bursts or peels longitudinally and the rending and bursting of it are influenced in direction and degree by the undergrowth and swelling of the woody fibre and are not a mere roughness and granulated pattern of the hide where there are so many points to be observed some are almost always exaggerated and others missed according to the predilections of the painter rembrandt and albert durer have given some splendid examples of woody texture but both miss the grace of the great lines titian took a larger view and reached a higher truth yet as before noticed from the habit of drawing the figure he admits too much flaccidity and bend and sometimes makes his tree trunks look flexible like seaweed there is a peculiar stiffness and spring about the curves of the wood which separates them completely from animal curves and which especially defies recollection or invention it is so subtile that it escapes but too often even in the most patient study from nature it lies within the thickness of a pencil line farther the modes of ramification of the upper branches are so varied inventive and graceful that the least alteration of them even in the measure of a hairbreadth spoils them and though it is sometimes possible to get rid of a troublesome bough accidentally awkward or in some minor respects to assist the arrangement yet so far as the real branches are copied the hand libels their lovely curvatures even in its best attempts to follow them   § 15 boughdrawing of turner  these two characters the woody stiffness hinted through muscular line and the inventive grace of the upper boughs have never been rendered except by turner he does not merely draw them better than others but he is the only man who has ever drawn them at all of the woody character the tree subjects of the liber studiorum afford marked examples the cephalus and procris scenes near the grand chartreuse and blair athol juvenile tricks and hedging and ditching may be particularized in the england series the bolton abbey is perhaps a more characteristic and thoroughly turneresque example than any  of the arrangement of the upper boughs the Æsacus and hesperie is perhaps the most consummate example the absolute truth and simplicity and freedom from anything like fantasticism or animal form being as marked on the one hand as the exquisite imaginativeness of the lines on the other among the yorkshire subjects the aske hall kirby lonsdale churchyard and brignall church are most characteristic among the england subjects the warwick dartmouth cove durham and chain bridge over the tees where the piece of thicket on the right has been well rendered by the engraver and is peculiarly expressive of the aerial relations and play of light among complex boughs the vignette at the opening of rogerss pleasures of memory that of chiefswood cottage in the illustrations to scotts works and the chateau de la belle gabrielle engraved for the keepsake are among the most graceful examples accessible to every one the crossing the brook will occur at once to those acquainted with the artists gallery the drawing of the stems in all these instances and indeed in all the various and frequent minor occurrences of such subject throughout the painters works is entirely unique there is nothing of the same kind in art   § 16 leafage its variety and symmetry  § 17 perfect regularity of poussin  let us however pass to the leafage of the elder landscape painters and see if it atones for the deficiencies of the stems one of the most remarkable characters of natural leafage is the constancy with which while the leaves are arranged on the spray with exquisite regularity that regularity is modified in their actual effect for as in every group of leaves some are seen sideways forming merely long lines some foreshortened some crossing each other every one differently turned and placed from all the others the forms of the leaves though in themselves similar give rise to a thousand strange and differing forms in the group and the shadows of some passing over the others still farther disguise and confuse the mass until the eye can distinguish nothing but a graceful and flexible disorder of innumerable forms with here and there a perfect leaf on the extremity or a symmetrical association of one or two just enough to mark the specific character and to give unity and grace but never enough to repeat in one group what was done in anothernever enough to prevent the eye from feeling that however regular and mathematical may be the structure of parts what is composed out of them is as various and infinite as any other part of nature nor does this take place in general effect only break off an elm bough three feet long in full leaf and lay it on the table before you and try to draw it leaf for leaf it is ten to one if in the whole bough provided you do not twist it about as you work you find one form of a leaf exactly like another perhaps you will not even have one complete every leaf will be oblique or foreshortened or curled or crossed by another or shaded by another or have something or other the matter with it and though the whole bough will look graceful and symmetrical you will scarcely be able to tell how or why it does so since there is not one line of it like another now go to gaspar poussin and take one of his sprays where they come against the sky you may count it all round one two three four one bunch five six seven eight two bunches nine ten eleven twelve three bunches with four leaves eachand such leaves every one precisely the same as its neighbor blunt and round at the end where every forest leaf is sharp except that of the figtree tied together by the roots and so fastened on to the demoniacal claws above described one bunch to each claw   § 18 exceeding intricacy of natures foliage  but if nature is so various when you have a bough on the table before you what must she be when she retires from you and gives you her whole mass and multitude the leaves then at the extremities become as fine as dust a mere confusion of points and lines between you and the sky a confusion which you might as well hope to draw seasand particle by particle as to imitate leaf for leaf this as it comes down into the body of the tree gets closer but never opaque it is always transparent with crumbling lights in it letting you through to the sky then out of this come heavier and heavier the masses of illumined foliage all dazzling and inextricable save here and there a single leaf on the extremities then under these you get deep passages of broken irregular gloom passing into transparent greenlighted misty hollows the twisted stems glancing through them in their pale and entangled infinity and the shafted sunbeams rained from above running along the lustrous leaves for an instant then lost then caught again on some emerald bank or knotted root to be sent up again with a faint reflex on the white undersides of dim groups of drooping foliage the shadows of the upper boughs running in gray network down the glossy stems and resting in quiet checkers upon the glittering earth but all penetrable and transparent and in proportion inextricable and incomprehensible except where across the labyrinth and the mystery of the dazzling light and dreamlike shadow falls close to us some solitary spray some wreath of two or three motionless large leaves the type and embodying of all that in the rest we feel and imagine but can never see   § 19 how contradicted by the treepatterns of g poussin  now with thus much of nature in your mind go to gaspar poussins view near albano in the national gallery it is the very subject to unite all these effectsa sloping bank shaded with intertwined forestand what has gaspar given us a mass of smooth opaque varnished brown without one interstice one change of hue or any vestige of leafy structure in its interior or in those parts of it i should say which are intended to represent interior but out of it over it rather at regular intervals we have circular groups of greenish touches always the same in size shape and distance from each other containing so exactly the same number of touches each that you cannot tell one from another there are eight or nine and thirty of them laid over each other like fishscales the shade being most carefully made darker and darker as it recedes from each until it comes to the edge of the next against which it cuts in the same sharp circular line and then begins to decline again until the canvas is covered with about as much intelligence or feeling of art as a housepainter has in marbling a wainscot or a weaver in repeating an ornamental pattern what is there in this which the most determined prejudice in favor of the old masters can for a moment suppose to resemble trees it is exactly what the most ignorant beginner trying to make a complete drawing would lay downexactly the conception of trees which we have in the works of our worst drawingmasters where the shade is laid on with the blacklead and stump and every human power exerted to make it look like a kitchengrate well polished   § 20 how followed by creswick  oppose to this the drawing even of our somewhat inferior treepainters i will not insult harding by mentioning his work after it but take creswick for instance and match one of his sparkling bits of green leafage with this treepattern of poussins i do not say there is not a dignity and impressiveness about the old landscape owing to its simplicity and i am very far from calling creswicks good treepainting it is false in color and deficient in mass and freedom and has many other defects but it is the work of a man who has sought earnestly for truth and who with one thought or memory of nature in his heart could look at the two landscapes and receive poussins with ordinary patience take creswick in black and white where he is unembarrassed by his fondness for peagreen the illustrations for instance to the nutbrown maid in the book of english ballads look at the intricacy and fulness of the dark oak foliage where it bends over the brook see how you can go through it and into it and come out behind it to the quiet bit of sky observe the gray aerial transparency of the stunted copse on the left and the entangling of the boughs where the light near foliage detaches itself above all note the forms of the masses of light not things like scales or shells sharp at the edge and flat in the middle but irregular and rounded stealing in and out accidentally from the shadow and presenting as the masses of all trees do in general outline a resemblance to the specific forms of the leaves of which they are composed turn over the page and look into the weaving of the foliage and sprays against the dark nightsky how near they are yet how untraceable see how the moonlight creeps up underneath them trembling and shivering on the silver boughs above note also the descending bit of ivy on the left of which only two leaves are made out and the rest is confusion or tells only in the moonlight like faint flakes of snow   § 21 perfect unity in natures foliage  but nature observes another principle in her foliage more important even than its intricacy she always secures an exceeding harmony and repose she is so intricate that her minuteness of parts becomes to the eye at a little distance one united veil or cloud of leaves to destroy the evenness of which is perhaps a greater fault than to destroy its transparency look at creswicks oak again in its dark parts intricate as it is all is blended into a cloudlike harmony of shade which becomes fainter and fainter as it retires with the most delicate flatness and unity of tone and it is by this kind of vaporescence so to speak by this flat misty unison of parts that nature and her faithful followers are enabled to keep the eye in perfect repose in the midst of profusion and to display beauty of form wherever they choose to the greatest possible advantage by throwing it across some quiet visionary passage of dimness and rest   § 22 total want of it in both and hobbima  it is here that hobbima and both fail they can paint oak leafage faithfully but do not know where to stop and by doing too much lose the truth of alllose the very truth of detail at which they aim for all their minute work only gives two leaves to natures twenty they are evidently incapable of even thinking of a tree much more of drawing it except leaf by leaf they have no notion nor sense of simplicity mass or obscurity and when they come to distance where it is totally impossible that leaves should be separately seen yet being incapable of conceiving or rendering the grand and quiet forms of truth they are reduced to paint their bushes with dots and touches expressive of leaves three feet broad each nevertheless there is a genuine aim in their works and their failure is rather to be attributed to ignorance of art than to such want of sense for nature as we find in claude or poussin and when they come close home we sometimes receive from them fine passages of mechanical truth   § 23 how rendered by turner  but let us oppose to their works the group of trees on the left in turners marly73 we have there perfect and ceaseless intricacy to oppose to poussinperfect and unbroken repose to oppose to hobbima and in the unity of these the perfection of truth this group may be taken as a fair standard of turners treepainting we have in it the admirably drawn stems instead of the claws or the serpents full transparent boundless intricacy instead of the shell pattern and misty depth of intermingled light and leafage instead of perpetual repetition of one mechanical touch   § 24 the near leafage of claude his middle distances are good  i have already spoken section ii chapter iv § 15 of the way in which mystery and intricacy are carried even into the nearest leaves of the foreground and noticed the want of such intricacy even in the best works of the old masters claudes are particularly deficient for by representing every particular leaf of them or trying to do so he makes nature finite and even his nearest bits of leafage are utterly false for they have neither shadows modifying their form compare section ii chapter iii § 7 nor sparkling lights nor confused intersections of their own forms and lines and the perpetual repetition of the same shape of leaves and the same arrangement relieved from a black ground is more like an ornamental pattern for dress than the painting of a foreground nevertheless the foliage of claude in his middle distances is the finest and truest part of his pictures and on the whole affords the best example of good drawing to be found in ancient art it is always false in color and has not boughs enough amongst it and the stems commonly look a great deal nearer than any part of it but it is still graceful flexible abundant intricate and in all but color and connection with stems very nearly right of the perfect painting of thick leafy foreground turners mercury and argus and oakhampton are the standards74   § 25 universal termination of trees in symmetrical curves  § 26 altogether unobserved by the old masters always given by turner  the last and most important truth to be observed respecting trees is that their boughs always in finely grown individuals bear among themselves such a ratio of length as to describe with their extremities a symmetrical curve constant for each species and within this curve all the irregularities segments and divisions of the tree are included each bough reaching the limit with its extremity but not passing it when a tree is perfectly grown each bough starts from the trunk with just so much wood as allowing for constant ramification will enable it to reach the terminal line or if by mistake it start with too little it will proceed without ramifying till within a distance where it may safely divide if on the contrary it start with too much it will ramify quickly and constantly or to express the real operation more accurately each bough growing on so as to keep even with its neighbors takes so much wood from the trunk as is sufficient to enable it to do so more or less in proportion as it ramifies fast or slowly in badly grown trees the boughs are apt to fall short of the curve or at least there are so many jags and openings that its symmetry is interrupted and in young trees the impatience of the upper shoots frequently breaks the line but in perfect and mature trees every bough does its duty completely and the line of curve is quite filled up and the mass within it unbroken so that the tree assumes the shape of a dome as in the oak or in tall trees of a pear with the stalk downmost the old masters paid no attention whatsoever to this great principle they swing their boughs about anywhere and everywhere each stops or goes on just as it likes nor will it be possible in any of their works to find a single example in which any symmetrical curve is indicated by the extremities75  but i need scarcely tell any one in the slightest degree acquainted with the works of turner how rigidly and constantly he adheres to this principle of nature taking in his highest compositions the perfect ideal form every spray being graceful and varied in itself but inevitably terminating at the assigned limit and filling up the curve without break or gap in his lower works taking less perfect form but invariably hinting the constant tendency in all and thus in spite of his abundant complexity he arranges his trees under simpler and grander forms than any other artist even among the moderns   § 27 foliage painting on the continent  it was above asserted that j d harding is after turner the greatest master of foliage in europe i ought however to state that my knowledge of the modern landscape of germany is very limited and that even with respect to france and italy i judge rather from the general tendency of study and character of mind visible in the annual exhibition of the louvre and in some galleries of modern paintings at milan venice and florence than from any detailed acquaintance with the works of their celebrated painters yet i think i can hardly be mistaken i have seen nothing to induce me to take a closer survey no life knowledge or emotion in any quarter nothing but the meanest and most ignorant copyism of vulgar details coupled with a style of conception resembling that of the various lithographic ideals on the first leaves of the music of pastoral ballads an exception ought however to be made in favor of french etching some studies in black and white may be seen in the narrow passages of the louvre of very high merit showing great skill and delicacy of execution and most determined industry in fact i think when the french artist fails it is never through fear of labor nay more than this some of them exhibit acute perception of landscape character and great power of reaching simple impressions of gloom wildness sound and motion some of their illustrated works also exhibit these powers in a high degree there is a spirit fire and sense of reality about some of the woodcuts to the large edition of paul and virginia and a determined rendering of separate feeling in each such as we look for in vain in our own ornamental works76 but the french appear to have no teaching such as might carry them beyond this their entire ignorance of color renders the assumption of the brush instantly fatal and the false forced and impious sentiment of the nation renders anything like grand composition altogether impossible   § 28 foliage of j d harding its deficiencies  it is therefore only among good artists of our own school that i think any fair comparison can be instituted and i wish to assert hardings knowledge of foliage more distinctly because he neither does justice to himself nor is i think rightly estimated by his fellowartists i shall not make any invidious remarks respecting individuals but i think it necessary to state generally that the style of foliage painting chiefly characteristic of the pictures on the line of the royal academy is of the most degraded kind77 and that except turner and mulready we have as far as i know no royal academician capable of painting even the smallest portion of foliage in a dignified or correct manner all is lost in green shadows with glittering yellow lights white trunks with black patches on them and leaves of no species in particular much laborious and clever foliage drawing is to be found in the rooms of the new watercolor society but we have no one in any wise comparable to harding for thorough knowledge of the subject for power of expression in a sketch from nature or for natural and unaffected conception in the study  maintaining for him this high position it is necessary that i should also state those deficiencies which appear to me to conceal his real power and in no small degree to prevent his progress   § 29 his brilliancy of execution too manifest  his overfondness for brilliant execution i have already noticed he is fonder of seeing something tolerably like a tree produced with few touches than something very like a tree produced with many now it is quite allowable that occasionally and in portions of his picture a great artist should indulge himself in this luxury of sketching yet it is a perilous luxury it blunts the feeling and weakens the hand i have said enough in various places respecting the virtues of negligence and of finish compare above the chapter on ideas of power in part i sect ii and part iii sect i ch x § 4 and i need only say here therefore that hardings foliage is never sufficiently finished and has at its best the look of a rapid sketch from nature touched upon at home in 1843 i think there was a pretty drawing in the rooms of the watercolor societythe clear green water of a torrent resting among stones with copselike wood on each side a bridge in the distance a white flower waterlily catching the eye in front the tops of the trees on the left of this picture were mere broad blots of color dashed upon the sky and connected by stems i allow the power necessary to attain any look of foliage by such means but it is power abused by no such means can any of the higher virtue and impressiveness of foliage be rendered in the use of body color for near leaves his execution is also too hasty often the touches are mere square or round dots which can be understood only for foliage by their arrangement this fault was especially marked in the trees of his picture painted for the academy two years ago they were very nearly shapeless and could not stand even in courtesy for walnut leaves for which judging by the make of the tree they must have been intended   § 30 his boughdrawing and choice of form  his drawing of boughs is in all points of demonstrable law right and very frequently easy and graceful also yet it has two eminent faults the first that the flow of the bough is sacrificed to its texture the pencil checking itself and hesitating at dots and stripes and knots instead of following the grand and unbroken tendency of growth the second that however good the arrangement may be as far as regards merely flexibility intricacy and freedom there are none of those composed groups of line which are unfailing in nature hardings work is not grand enough to be natural the drawings in the park and the forest are i believe almost facsimiles of sketches made from nature yet it is evident at once that in all of them nothing but the general lie and disposition of the boughs has been taken from the tree and that no single branch or spray has been faithfully copied or patiently studied  this want of close study necessarily causes several deficiencies of feeling respecting general form hardings choice is always of tree forms comparatively imperfect leaning this way and that and unequal in the lateral arrangements of foliage such forms are often graceful always picturesque but rarely grand and when systematically adopted untrue it requires more patient study to attain just feeling of the dignity and character of a purely formed tree with all its symmetries perfect   § 31 local color how far expressible in black and white and with what         advantage  one more cause of incorrectness i may note though it is not peculiar to the artists treedrawing but attaches to his general system of sketching in hardings valuable work on the use of the lead pencil there is one principle advanced which i believe to be false and dangerous that the local color of objects is not thereby to be rendered i think the instance given is that of some baskets whose darkness is occasioned solely by the touches indicating the wickerwork now i believe that an essential difference between the sketch of a great and of a comparatively inferior master is that the former is conceived entirely in shade and color and its masses are blocked out with reference to both while the inferior draughtsman checks at textures and petty characters of object if rembrandt had had to sketch such baskets he would have troubled himself very little about the wickerwork but he would have looked to see where they came dark or light on the sand and where there were any sparkling points of light on the wet osiers these darks and lights he would have scratched in with the fastest lines he could leaving no white paper but at the wet points of lustre if he had had time the wickerwork would have come afterwards78 and i think that the first thing to be taught to any pupil is neither how to manage the pencil nor how to attain character of outline but rather to see where things are light and where they are dark and to draw them as he sees them never caring whether his lines be dexterous or slovenly the result of such study is the immediate substitution of downright drawing for symbolism and afterwards a judicious moderation in the use of extreme lights and darks for where local colors are really drawn so much of what seems violently dark is found to come light against something else and so much of what seems high light to come dark against the sky that the draughtsman trembles at finding himself plunged either into blackness or whiteness and seeks as he should for means of obtaining force without either  it is in consequence of his evident habit of sketching more with a view to detail and character than to the great masses that hardings chiaroscuro is frequently crude scattered and petty black shadows occur under his distant trees white high lights on his foreground rocks the foliage and trunks are divided by violent oppositions into separate masses and the branches lose in spots of moss and furrowings of bark their soft roundings of delicate form and their grand relations to each other and the sky   § 32 opposition between great manner and great knowledge  it is owing to my respect for the artist and my belief in his power and conscientious desire to do what is best that i have thus extended these somewhat unkind remarks on the other hand it is to be remembered that his knowledge of nature is most extended and his dexterity of drawing most instructive especially considering his range of subject for whether in water rock or foliage he is equally skilful in attaining whatever he desires though he does not always desire all that he ought and artists should keep in mind that neither grandeur of manner nor truth of system can atone for the want of this knowledge and this skill constables manner is good and great but being unable to draw even a log of wood much more a trunk of a tree or a stone he left his works destitute of substance mere studies of effect without any expression of specific knowledge and thus even what is great in them has been productive i believe of very great injury in its encouragement of the most superficial qualities of the english school   § 33 foliage of cox fielding and cattermole  the foliage of david cox has been already noticed preface to second edition it is altogether exquisite in color and in its impressions of coolness shade and mass of its drawing i cannot say anything but that i should be sorry to see it better copley fieldings is remarkable for its intricacy and elegance it is however not free from affectation and as has been before remarked is always evidently composed in the study the execution is too rough and woolly it is wanting in simplicity sharpness and freshnessabove all in specific character not however in his middle distances where the rounded masses of forest and detached blasted trunks of fir are usually very admirable cattermole has very grand conceptions of general form but wild and without substance and therefore incapable of long maintaining their attractiveness especially lately the execution having become in the last degree coarse and affected this is bitterly to be regretted for few of our artists would paint foliage better if he would paint it from nature and with reverence   § 34 hunt and creswick green how to be rendered expressive of light         and offensive if otherwise  hunt i think fails and fails only in foliage fails as the daguerreotype does from overfidelity for foliage will not be imitated it must be reasoned out and suggested yet hunt is the only man we have who can paint the real leaf green under sunlight and in this respect his trees are delicioussummer itself creswick has sweet feeling and tries for the real green too but from want of science in his shadows ends in green paint instead of green light in mere local color instead of color raised by sunshine one example is enough to show where the fault lies in his picture of the weald of kent in the british institution this year there was a cottage in the middle distance with white walls and a red roof the dark sides of the white walls and of the roof were of the same color a dark purplewrong for both repeated inaccuracies of this kind necessarily deprive even the most brilliant color of all appearance of sunshine and they are much to be deprecated in creswick as he is one of the very few artists who do draw from nature and try for nature some of his thickets and torrentbeds are most painfully studied and yet he cannot draw a bough nor a stone i suspect he is too much in the habit of studying only large views on the spot and not of drawing small portions thoroughly i trust it will be seen that these as all other remarks that i have made throughout this volume on particular works are not in depreciation of or unthankfulness for what the artist has done but in the desire that he should do himself more justice and more honor i have much pleasure in creswicks works and i am glad always to see them admired by others   § 35 conclusion works of j linnell and s palmer  i shall conclude this sketch of the foliage art of england by mention of two artists whom i believe to be representative of a considerable class admirable in their reverence and patience of study yet unappreciated by the public because what they do is unrecommended by dexterities of handling the forest studies of j linnell are peculiarly elaborate and in many points most skilful they fail perhaps of interest owing to overfulness of detail and a want of generalization in the effect but even a little more of the harding sharpness of touch would set off their sterling qualities and make them felt a less known artist s palmer lately admitted a member of the old watercolor society is deserving of the very highest place among faithful followers of nature his studies of foreign foliage especially are beyond all praise for care and fulness i have never seen a stone pine or a cypress drawn except by him and his feeling is as pure and grand as his fidelity is exemplary he has not however yet i think discovered what is necessary and unnecessary in a great picture and his works sent to the societys rooms have been most unfavorable examples of his power and have been generally as yet in places where all that is best in them is out of sight i look to him nevertheless unless he lose himself in overreverence for certain conventionalisms of the elder schools as one of the probable renovators and correctors of whatever is failing or erroneous in the practice of english art   footnotes    71 it sometimes happens that a morbid direction of growth will     cause an exception here and there to this rule the bough swelling     beyond its legitimate size knots and excrescences of course     sometimes interfere with the effect of diminution i believe that in     the laurel when it grows large and old singular instances may be     found of thick upper boughs and over quantity of wood at the     extremities all these accidents or exceptions are felt as such by     the eye they may occasionally be used by the painter in savage or     grotesque scenery or as points of contrast but are no excuse for     his ever losing sight of the general law    72 compare part iii sect ii chap iv § 6 7    73 this group i have before noticed as singularly but i doubt     not accidentally and in consequence of the love of the two great     painters for the same grand forms resembling that introduced by     tintoret in the background of his cain and abel    74 the above paragraphs i have left as originally written because     they are quite true as far as they reach but like many other     portions of this essay they take in a very small portion of the     truth i shall not add to them at present because i can explain my     meaning better in our consideration of the laws of beauty but the     reader must bear in mind that what is above stated refers     throughout to large masses of foliage seen under broad     sunshineand it has especial reference to turners enormous scale     of scene and intense desire of light in twilight when treeforms     are seen against sky other laws come into operation as well as in     subject of narrow limits and near foreground it is i think to be     regretted that turner does not in his academy pictures sometimes     take more confined and gloomy subjects like that grand one near     the chartreuse of the liber studiorum wherein his magnificent     power of elaborating close foliage might be developed but for the     present let the reader with respect to what has been here said of     close foliage note the drawing of the leaves in that plate in the     Æsacus and hesperie and the cephalus and the elaboration of the     foregrounds in the yorkshire drawings let him compare what is said     of turners foliage painting above in part ii sect i chap vii §     40 § 41 and of titians previously as well as part iii sect i     chap viii and sect ii chap iv § 21 i shall hereafter     endeavor to arrange the subject in a more systematic manner but     what additional observations i may have to make will none of them be     in any wise more favorable to gaspar salvator or hobbima than the     above paragraphs    75 perhaps in some instances this may be the case with the trees     of nicholas poussin but even with him the boughs only touch the     line of limit with their central points of extremity and are not     sectors of the great curveforming a part of it with expanded     extremities as in nature draw a few straight lines from the     centre to the circumference of a circle the forms included between     them are the forms of the individual boughs of a fine tree with all     their ramifications only the external curve is not a circle but     more frequently two parabolaswhich i believe it is in the     oakor an ellipse but each bough of the old masters is     clubshaped and broadest not at the outside of the tree but a     little way towards its centre    76 on the other hand nothing can be more exquisitely ridiculous     than the french illustrations of a second or thirdrate order as     those to the harmonies of lamartine    77 of stanfields foliage i remember too little to enable me to     form any definite judgment it is a pity that he so much neglects     this noble element of landscape    78 it is true that many of rembrandts etchings are merely in     line but it may be observed that the subject is universally     conceived in light and shade and that the lines are either merely     guides in the arrangement or an exquisite indication of the     keynotes of shade on which the aftersystem of it is to be     basedportions of fragmentary finish showing the completeness of     the conception                                      chapter ii                 general remarks respecting the truth of turner   § 1 no necessity of entering into discussion of architectural truth  we have now arrived at some general conception of the extent of turners knowledge and the truth of his practice by the deliberate examination of the characteristics of the four great elements of landscapesky earth water and vegetation i have not thought it necessary to devote a chapter to architecture because enough has been said on this subject in part ii sect i chap vii and its general truths which are those with which the landscape painter as such is chiefly concerned require only a simple and straightforward application of those rules of which every other material object of a landscape has required a most difficult and complicated application turners knowledge of perspective probably adds to his power in the arrangement of every order of subject but ignorance on this head is rather disgraceful than knowledge meritorious it is disgraceful for instance that any man should commit such palpable and atrocious errors in ordinary perspective as are seen in the quay in claudes seapiece no 14 national gallery or in the curved portico of no 30 but still these are not points to be taken into consideration as having anything to do with artistical rank just as though we should say it was disgraceful if a great poet could not spell we should not consider such a defect as in any way taking from his poetical rank neither is there anything particularly belonging to architecture as such which it is any credit to an artist to observe or represent it is only a simple and clear field for the manifestation of his knowledge of general laws any surveyor or engineer could have drawn the steps and balustrade in the hero and leander as well as turner has but there is no man living but himself who could have thrown the accidental shadows upon them i may however refer for general illustration of turners power as an architectural draughtsman to the front of rouen cathedral engraved in the rivers of france and to the ely in the england i know nothing in art which can be set beside the former of these for overwhelming grandeur and simplicity of effect and inexhaustible intricacy of parts i have then only a few remarks farther to offer respecting the general character of all those truths which we have been hitherto endeavoring to explain and illustrate   § 2 extreme difficulty of illustrating or explaining the highest truth  § 3 the positive rank of turner is in no degree shown in the        foregoing pages but only his relative rank  § 4 the exceeding refinement of his truth  § 5 there is nothing in his works which can be enjoyed without        knowledge  § 6 and nothing which knowledge will not enable us to enjoy  the difference in the accuracy of the lines of the torso of the vatican the maestro of m angelo from those in one of m angelos finest works could perhaps scarcely be appreciated by any eye or feeling undisciplined by the most perfect and practical anatomical knowledge it rests on points of such traceless and refined delicacy that though we feel them in the result we cannot follow them in the details yet they are such and so great as to place the torso alone in art solitary and supreme while the finest of m angelos works considered with respect to truth alone are said to be only on a level with antiques of the second class under the apollo and venus that is two classes or grades below the torso but suppose the best sculptor in the world possessing the most entire appreciation of the excellence of the torso were to sit down pen in hand to try and tell us wherein the peculiar truth of each line consisted could any words that he could use make us feel the hairbreadth of depth and distance on which all depends or end in anything more than bare assertions of the inferiority of this line to that which if we did not perceive for ourselves no explanation could ever illustrate to us he might as well endeavor to explain to us by words some taste or other subject of sense of which we had no experience and so it is with all truths of the highest order they are separated from those of average precision by points of extreme delicacy which none but the cultivated eye can in the least feel and to express which all words are absolutely meaningless and useless consequently in all that i have been saying of the truth of artists i have been able to point out only coarse broad and explicable matters i have been perfectly unable to express and indeed i have made no endeavor to express the finely drawn and distinguished truth in which all the real excellence of art consists all those truths which i have been able to explain and demonstrate in turner are such as any artist of ordinary powers of observation ought to be capable of rendering it is disgraceful to omit them but it is no very great credit to observe them i have indeed proved that they have been neglected and disgracefully so by those men who are commonly considered the fathers of art but in showing that they have been observed by turner i have only proved him to be above other men in knowledge of truth i have not given any conception of his own positive rank as a painter of nature but it stands to reason that the men who in broad simple and demonstrable matters are perpetually violating truth will not be particularly accurate or careful in carrying out delicate and refined and undemonstrable matters and it stands equally to reason that the man who as far as argument or demonstration can go is found invariably truthful will in all probability be truthful to the last line and shadow of a line and such is indeed the case with every touch of this consummate artist the essential excellenceall that constitutes the real and exceeding value of his worksis beyond and above expression it is a truth inherent in every line and breathing in every hue too delicate and exquisite to admit of any kind of proof nor to be ascertained except by the highest of teststhe keen feeling attained by extended knowledge and long study two lines are laid on canvas one is right and another wrong there is no difference between them appreciable by the compassesnone appreciable by the ordinary eyenone which can be pointed out if it is not seen one person feels itanother does not but the feeling or sight of the one can by no words be communicated to the other it would be unjust if it could for that feeling and sight have been the reward of years of labor and there is indeed nothing in turnernot one dot nor linewhose meaning can be understood without knowledge because he never aims at sensual impressions but at the deep final truth which only meditation can discover and only experience recognize there is nothing done or omitted by him which does not imply such a comparison of ends such rejection of the least worthy as far as they are incompatible with the rest such careful selection and arrangement of all that can be united as can only be enjoyed by minds capable of going through the same process and discovering the reasons for the choice and as there is nothing in his works which can be enjoyed without knowledge so there is nothing in them which knowledge will not enable us to enjoy there is no test of our acquaintance with nature so absolute and unfailing as the degree of admiration we feel for turners painting precisely as we are shallow in our knowledge vulgar in our feeling and contracted in our views of principles will the works of this artist be stumblingblocks or foolishness to usprecisely in the degree in which we are familiar with nature constant in our observation of her and enlarged in our understanding of her will they expand before our eyes into glory and beauty in every new insight which we obtain into the works of god in every new idea which we receive from his creation we shall find ourselves possessed of an interpretation and a guide to something in turners works which we had not before understood we may range over europe from shore to shore and from every rock that we tread upon every sky that passes over our heads every local form of vegetation or of soil we shall receive fresh illustration of his principlesfresh confirmation of his facts we shall feel wherever we go that he has been there before uswhatever we see that he has seen and seized before us and we shall at last cease the investigation with a wellgrounded trust that whatever we have been unable to account for and what we still dislike in his works has reason for it and foundation like the rest and that even where he has failed or erred there is a beauty in the failure which none are able to equal and a dignity in the error which none are worthy to reprove   § 7 his former rank and progress  § 8 standing of his present works their mystery is the consequence of        their fullness  there has been marked and constant progress in his mind he has not like some few artists been without childhood his course of study has been as evidently as it has been swiftly progressive and in different stages of the struggle sometimes one order of truth sometimes another has been aimed at or omitted but from the beginning to the present height of his career he has never sacrificed a greater truth to a less as he advanced the previous knowledge or attainment was absorbed in what succeeded or abandoned only if incompatible and never abandoned without a gain and his present works present the sum and perfection of his accumulated knowledge delivered with the impatience and passion of one who feels too much and knows too much and has too little time to say it in to pause for expression or ponder over his syllables there is in them the obscurity but the truth of prophecy the instinctive and burning language which would express less if it uttered more which is indistinct only by its fulness and dark with its abundant meaning he feels now with longtrained vividness and keenness of sense too bitterly the impotence of the hand and the vainness of the color to catch one shadow or one image of the glory which god has revealed to him he has dwelt and communed with nature all the days of his life he knows her now too well he cannot palter over the material littleness of her outward form he must give her soul or he has done nothing and he cannot do this with the flax and the earth and the oil i cannot gather the sunbeams out of the east or i would make them tell you what i have seen but read this and interpret this and let us remember together i cannot gather the gloom out of the nightsky or i would make that teach you what i have seen but read this and interpret this and let us feel together and if you have not that within you which i can summon to my aid if you have not the sun in your spirit and the passion in your heart which my words may awaken though they be indistinct and swift leave me for i will give you no patient mockery no laborious insult of that glorious nature whose i am and whom i serve let other servants imitate the voice and the gesture of their master while they forget his message hear that message from me but remember that the teaching of divine truth must still be a mystery                                      chapter iii                  conclusionmodern art and modern criticism   we have only in conclusion to offer a few general remarks respecting modern art and modern criticism   § 1 the entire prominence hitherto given to the works of one artist        caused only by our not being able to take cognizance of character  § 2 the feelings of different artists are incapable of full comparison  § 3 but the fidelity and truth of each are capable of real comparison  § 4 especially because they are equally manifested in the treatment of        all subjects  § 5 no man draws one thing well if he can draw nothing else  we wish in the first place to remove the appearance of invidiousness and partiality which the constant prominence given in the present portion of the work to the productions of one artist can scarcely fail of bearing in the minds of most readers when we pass to the examination of what is beautiful and expressive in art we shall frequently find distinctive qualities in the minds even of inferior artists which have led them to the pursuit and embodying of particular trains of thought altogether different from those which direct the compositions of other men and incapable of comparison with them now when this is the case we should consider it in the highest degree both invidious and illogical to say of such different modes of exertion of the intellect that one is in all points greater or nobler than another we shall probably find something in the working of all minds which has an end and a power peculiar to itself and which is deserving of free and full admiration without any reference whatsoever to what has in other fields been accomplished by other modes of thought and directions of aim we shall indeed find a wider range and grasp in one man than in another but yet it will be our own fault if we do not discover something in the most limited range of mind which is different from and in its way better than anything presented to us by the more grasping intellect we all know that the nightingale sings more nobly than the lark but who therefore would wish the lark not to sing or would deny that it had a character of its own which bore a part among the melodies of creation no less essential than that of the more richlygifted bird and thus we shall find and feel that whatever difference may exist between the intellectual powers of one artist and another yet wherever there is any true genius there will be some peculiar lesson which even the humblest will teach us more sweetly and perfectly than those far above them in prouder attributes of mind and we should be as mistaken as we should be unjust and invidious if we refused to receive this their peculiar message with gratitude and veneration merely because it was a sentence and not a volume but the case is different when we examine their relative fidelity to given facts that fidelity depends on no peculiar modes of thought or habits of character it is the result of keen sensibility combined with high powers of memory and association these qualities as such are the same in all men character or feeling may direct their choice to this or that object but the fidelity with which they treat either the one or the other is dependent on those simple powers of sense and intellect which are like and comparable in all and of which we can always say that they are greater in this man or less in that without reference to the character of the individual those feelings which direct cox to the painting of wild weedy banks and cool melting skies and those which directed barret to the painting of glowing foliage and melancholy twilight are both just and beautiful in their way and are both worthy of high praise and gratitude without necessity nay without proper possibility of comparing one with the other but the degree of fidelity with which the leaves of the one and the light of the other are rendered depends upon faculties of sight sense and memory common to both and perfectly comparable and we may say fearlessly and without injustice that one or the other as the case may be is more faithful in that which they have chosen to represent it is also to be remembered that these faculties of sense and memory are not partial in their effect they will not induce fidelity in the rendering of one class of object and fail of doing so in another they act equally and with equal results whatever may be the matter subjected to them the same delicate sense which perceives the utmost grace of the fibres of a tree will be equally unerring in tracing the character of cloud and the quick memory which seizes and retains the circumstances of a flying effect of shadow or color will be equally effectual in fixing the impression of the instantaneous form of a moving figure or a breaking wave there are indeed one or two broad distinctions in the nature of the sensesa sensibility to color for instance being very different from a sensibility to form so that a man may possess one without the other and an artist may succeed in mere imitation of what is before him of air sunlight etc without possessing sensibility at all but wherever we have in the drawing of any one object sufficient evidence of real intellectual power of the sense which perceives the essential qualities of a thing and the judgment which arranges them so as to illustrate each other we may be quite certain that the same sense and judgment will operate equally on whatever is subjected to them and that the artist will be equally great and masterly in his drawing of all that he attempts hence we may be quite sure that wherever an artist appears to be truthful in one branch of art and not in another the apparent truth is either owing to some trickery of imitation or is not so great as we suppose it to be in nine cases out of ten people who are celebrated for drawing only one thing and can only draw one thing draw that one thing worse than anybody else an artist may indeed confine himself to a limited range of subject but if he be really true in his rendering of this his power of doing more will be perpetually showing itself in accessories and minor points there are few men for instance more limited in subject than hunt and yet i do not think there is another man in the old watercolor society with so keen an eye for truth or with power so universal and this is the reason for the exceeding prominence which in the foregoing investigation one or two artists have always assumed over the rest for the habits of accurate observation and delicate powers of hand which they possess have equal effect and maintain the same superiority in their works to whatever class of subject they may be directed and thus we have been compelled however unwillingly to pass hastily by the works of many gifted men because however pure their feeling or original their conceptions they were wanting in those faculties of the hand and mind which insure perfect fidelity to nature it will be only hereafter when we are at liberty to take full cognizance of the thought however feebly it may be clothed in language that we shall be able to do real justice to the disciples either of modern or of ancient art   § 6 general conclusions to be derived from our past investigation  but as far as we have gone at present and with respect only to the material truth which is all that we have been able to investigate the conclusion to which we must be led is as clear as it is inevitable that modern artists as a body are far more just and full in their views of material things than any landscape painters whose works are extantbut that j m w turner is the only man who has ever given an entire transcript of the whole system of nature and is in this point of view the only perfect landscape painter whom the world has ever seen   § 7 truth a standard of all excellence  nor are we disposed to recede from our assertion made in sec i ch i § 10 that this material truth is indeed a perfect test of the relative rank of painters though it does not in itself constitute that rank we shall be able to prove that truth and beauty knowledge and imagination invariably are associated in art and we shall be able to show that not only in truth to nature but in all other points turner is the greatest landscape painter who has ever lived but his superiority is in matters of feeling one of kind not of degree superiority of degree implies a superseding of others superiority of kind only sustaining a more important but not more necessary part than others if truth were all that we required from art all other painters might cast aside their brushes in despair for all that they have done he has done more fully and accurately but when we pass to the higher requirements of art beauty and character their contributions are all equally necessary and desirable because different and however inferior in position or rank are still perfect of their kind their inferiority is only that of the lark to the nightingale or of the violet to the rose   § 8 modern criticism changefulness of public taste  § 9 yet associated with a certain degree of judgment  § 10 duty of the press  such then is the rank and standing of our modern artists we have living with us and painting for us the greatest painter of all time a man with whose supremacy of power no intellect of past ages can be put in comparison for a moment let us next inquire what is the rank of our critics public taste i believe as far as it is the encourager and supporter of art has been the same in all agesa fitful and vacillating current of vague impression perpetually liable to change subject to epidemic desires and agitated by infectious passion the slave of fashion and the fool of fancy but yet always distinguishing with singular clearsightedness between that which is best and that which is worst of the particular class of food which its morbid appetite may call for never failing to distinguish that which is produced by intellect from that which is not though it may be intellect degraded by ministering to its misguided will public taste may thus degrade a race of men capable of the highest efforts in art into the portrait painters of ephemeral fashions but it will yet not fail of discovering who among these portrait painters is the man of most mind it will separate the man who would have become buonaroti from the man who would have become bandinelli though it will employ both in painting curls and feathers and bracelets hence generally speaking there is no comparative injustice done no false elevation of the fool above the man of mind provided only that the man of mind will condescend to supply the particular article which the public chooses to want of course a thousand modifying circumstances interfere with the action of the general rule but taking one case with another we shall very constantly find the price which the picture commands in the market a pretty fair standard of the artists rank of intellect the press therefore and all who pretend to lead the public taste have not so much to direct the multitude whom to go to as what to ask for their business is not to tell us which is our best painter but to tell us whether we are making our best painter do his best   § 11 qualifications necessary for discharging it  § 12 general incapability of modern critics  § 13 and inconsistency with themselves  now none are capable of doing this but those whose principles of judgment are based both on thorough practical knowledge of art and on broad general views of what is true and right without reference to what has been done at one time or another or in one school or another nothing can be more perilous to the cause of art than the constant ringing in our painters ears of the names of great predecessors as their examples or masters i had rather hear a great poet entirely original in his feeling and aim rebuked or maligned for not being like wordsworth or coleridge than a great painter criticised for not putting us in mind of claude or poussin but such references to former excellence are the only refuge and resource of persons endeavoring to be critics without being artists they cannot tell you whether a thing is right or not but they can tell you whether it is like something else or not and the whole tone of modern criticismas far as it is worthy of being called criticismsufficiently shows it to proceed entirely from persons altogether unversed in practice and ignorant of truth but possessing just enough of feeling to enjoy the solemnity of ancient art who not distinguishing that which is really exalted and valuable in the modern school nor having any just idea of the real ends or capabilities of landscape art consider nothing right which is not based on the conventional principles of the ancients and nothing true which has more of nature in it than of claude but it is strange that while the noble and unequalled works of modern landscape painters are thus maligned and misunderstood our historical painterssuch as we haveare permitted to pander more fatally every year to the vicious english taste which can enjoy nothing but what is theatrical entirely unchastised nay encouraged and lauded by the very men who endeavor to hamper our great landscape painters with rules derived from consecrated blunders the very critic who has just passed one of the noblest works of turnerthat is to say a masterpiece of art to which time can show no parallelwith a ribald jest will yet stand gaping in admiration before the next piece of dramatic glitter and grimace suggested by the society and adorned with the appurtenances of the greenroom which he finds hung low upon the wall as a brilliant example of the ideal of english art it is natural enough indeed that the persons who are disgusted by what is pure and noble should be delighted with what is vicious and degraded but it is singular that those who are constantly talking of claude and poussin should never even pretend to a thought of raffaelle we could excuse them for not comprehending turner if they only would apply the same cutanddried criticisms where they might be applied with truth and productive of benefit but we endure not the paltry compound of ignorance false taste and pretension which assumes the dignity of classical feeling that it may be able to abuse whatever is above the level of its understanding but bursts into genuine rapture with all that is meretricious if sufficiently adapted to the calibre of its comprehension   § 14 how the press may really advance the cause of art  to notice such criticisms however is giving them far more importance than they deserve they can lead none astray but those whose opinions are absolutely valueless and we did not begin this chapter with any intent of wasting our time on these small critics but in the hope of pointing out to the periodical press what kind of criticism is now most required by our school of landscape art and how it may be in their power if they will to regulate its impulses without checking its energies and really to advance both the cause of the artist and the taste of the public   § 15 morbid fondness at the present day for unfinished works  § 16 by which the public defraud themselves  § 17 and in pandering to which artists ruin themselves  § 18 necessity of finishing works of art perfectly  one of the most morbid symptoms of the general taste of the present day is a too great fondness for unfinished works brilliancy and rapidity of execution are everywhere sought as the highest good and so that a picture be cleverly handled as far as it is carried little regard is paid to its imperfection as a whole hence some artists are permitted and others compelled to confine themselves to a manner of working altogether destructive of their powers and to tax their energies not to concentrate the greatest quantity of thought on the least possible space of canvas but to produce the greatest quantity of glitter and claptrap in the shortest possible time to the idler and the trickster in art no system can be more advantageous but to the man who is really desirous of doing something worth having lived forto a man of industry energy or feeling we believe it to be the cause of the most bitter discouragement if ever working upon a favorite subject or a beloved idea he is induced to tax his powers to the utmost and to spend as much time upon his picture as he feels necessary for its perfection he will not be able to get so high a price for the result perhaps of a twelvemonths thought as he might have obtained for halfadozen sketches with a forenoons work in each and he is compelled either to fall back upon mechanism or to starve now the press should especially endeavor to convince the public that by this purchase of imperfect pictures they not only prevent all progress and development of high talent and set tricksters and mechanics on a level with men of mind but defraud and injure themselves for there is no doubt whatever that estimated merely by the quantity of pleasure it is capable of conveying a wellfinished picture is worth to its possessor halfadozen incomplete ones and that a perfect drawing is simply as a source of delight better worth a hundred guineas than a drawing half as finished is worth thirty on the other hand the body of our artists should be kept in mind that by indulging the public with rapid and unconsidered work they are not only depriving themselves of the benefit which each picture ought to render to them as a piece of practice and study but they are destroying the refinement of general taste and rendering it impossible for themselves ever to find a market for more careful works supposing that they were inclined to execute them nor need any single artist be afraid of setting the example and producing labored works at advanced prices among the cheap quick drawings of the day the public will soon find the value of the complete work and will be more ready to give a large sum for that which is inexhaustible than a quota of it for that which they are wearied of in a month the artist who never lets the price command the picture will soon find the picture command the price and it ought to be a rule with every painter never to let a picture leave his easel while it is yet capable of improvement or of having more thought put into it the general effect is often perfect and pleasing and not to be improved upon when the details and facts are altogether imperfect and unsatisfactory it may be difficultperhaps the most difficult task of artto complete these details and not to hurt the general effect but until the artist can do this his art is imperfect and his picture unfinished that only is a complete picture which has both the general wholeness and effect of nature and the inexhaustible perfection of natures details and it is only in the effort to unite these that a painter really improves by aiming only at details he becomes a mechanic by aiming only at generals he becomes a trickster his fall in both cases is sure two questions the artist has therefore always to ask himselffirst is my whole right secondly can my details be added to is there a single space in the picture where i can crowd in another thought is there a curve in it which i can modulatea line which i can graduatea vacancy i can fill is there a single spot which the eye by any peering or prying can fathom or exhaust if so my picture is imperfect and if in modulating the line or filling the vacancy i hurt the general effect my art is imperfect   § 19 sketches not sufficiently encouraged  but on the other hand though incomplete pictures ought neither to be produced nor purchased careful and real sketches ought to be valued much more highly than they are studies in chalk of landscape should form a part of every exhibition and a room should be allotted to drawings and designs of figures in the academy we should be heartily glad to see the room which is now devoted to bad drawings of incorporeal and imaginary architectureof things which never were and which thank heaven never will beoccupied instead by careful studies for historical pictures not blots of chiaroscuro but delicate outlines with the pen or crayon   § 20 brilliancy of execution or efforts at invention not to be         tolerated in young artists  § 21 the duty and after privileges of all students  from young artists in landscape nothing ought to be tolerated but simple bona fide imitation of nature they have no business to ape the execution of mastersto utter weak and disjointed repetitions of other mens words and mimic the gestures of the preacher without understanding his meaning or sharing in his emotions we do not want their crude ideas of composition their unformed conceptions of the beautiful their unsystematized experiments upon the sublime we scorn their velocity for it is without direction we reject their decision for it is without grounds we contemn their composition for it is without materials we reprobate their choice for it is without comparison their duty is neither to choose nor compose nor imagine nor experimentalize but to be humble and earnest in following the steps of nature and tracing the finger of god nothing is so bad a symptom in the work of young artists as too much dexterity of handling for it is a sign that they are satisfied with their work and have tried to do nothing more than they were able to do their work should be full of failures for these are the signs of efforts they should keep to quiet colorsgrays and browns and making the early works of turner their example as his latest are to be their object of emulation should go to nature in all singleness of heart and walk with her laboriously and trustingly having no other thoughts but how best to penetrate her meaning and remember her instruction rejecting nothing selecting nothing and scorning nothing believing all things to be right and good and rejoicing always in the truth then when their memories are stored and their imaginations fed and their hands firm let them take up the scarlet and the gold give the reins to their fancy and show us what their heads are made of we will follow them wherever they choose to lead we will check at nothing they are then our masters and are fit to be so they have placed themselves above our criticism and we will listen to their words in all faith and humility but not unless they themselves have before bowed in the same submission to a higher authority and master   § 22 necessity among our greater artists of more singleness of aim  among our greater artists the chief want at the present day is that of solemnity and definite purpose we have too much picturemanufacturing too much making up of lay figures with a certain quantity of foliage and a certain quantity of sky and a certain quantity of watera little bit of all that is pretty a little sun and a little shadea touch of pink and a touch of bluea little sentiment and a little sublimity and a little humor and a little antiquarianismall very neatly associated in a very charming picture but not working together for a definite end or if the aim be higher as was the case with barrett and varley we are generally put off with stale repetitions of eternal composition a great tree and some goats and a bridge and a lake and the temple at tivoli etc now we should like to see our artists working out with all exertion of their concentrated powers such marked pieces of landscape character as might bear upon them the impression of solemn earnest and pervading thought definitely directed and aided by every accessory of detail color and idealized form which the disciplined feeling accumulated knowledge and unspared labor of the painter could supply i have alluded in the second preface to the deficiency of our modern artists in these great points of earnestness and completeness and i revert to it in conclusion as their paramount failing and one fatal in many ways to the interests of art our landscapes are all descriptive not reflective agreeable and conversational but not impressive nor didactic they have no other foundation than                       that vivacious versatility            which many people take for want of heart            they err tis merely what is called mobility            a thing of temperament and not of art            though seeming so from its supposed facility                                                             this makes your actors artists and romancers            little thats greatbut much of what is clever  only it is to be observed thatin paintersthis vivacity is not always versatile it is to be wished that it were but it is no such easy matter to be versatile in painting shallowness of thought insures not its variety nor rapidity of production its originality whatever may be the case in literature facility is in art inconsistent with invention the artist who covers most canvas always shows even in the sum of his works the least expenditure of thought79 i have never seen more than four works of john lewis on the walls of the watercolor exhibition i have counted forty from other hands but have found in the end that the forty were a multiplication of one and the four a concentration of forty and therefore i would earnestly plead with all our artists that they should make it a law never to repeat themselves for he who never repeats himself will not produce an inordinate number of pictures and he who limits himself in number gives himself at least the opportunity of completion besides all repetition is degradation of the art it reduces it from headwork to handwork and indicates something like a persuasion on the part of the artist that nature is exhaustible or art perfectible perhaps even by him exhausted and perfected all copyists are contemptible but the copyist of himself the most so for he has the worst original   § 23 what should be their general aim  let then every picture be painted with earnest intention of impressing on the spectator some elevated emotion and exhibiting to him some one particular but exalted beauty let a real subject be carefully selected in itself suggestive of and replete with this feeling and beauty let an effect of light and color be taken which may harmonize with both and a sky not invented but recollected in fact all socalled invention is in landscape nothing more than appropriate recollectiongood in proportion as it is distinct then let the details of the foreground be separately studied especially those plants which appear peculiar to the place if any one however unimportant occurs there which occurs not elsewhere it should occupy a prominent position for the other details the highest examples of the ideal forms80 or characters which he requires are to be selected by the artist from his former studies or fresh studies made expressly for the purpose leaving as little as possiblenothing in fact beyond their connection and arrangementto mere imagination finally when his picture is thus perfectly realized in all its parts let him dash as much of it out as he likes throw if he will mist around itdarknessor dazzling and confused lightwhatever in fact impetuous feeling or vigorous imagination may dictate or desire the forms once so laboriously realized will come out whenever they do occur with a startling and impressive truth which the uncertainty in which they are veiled will enhance rather than diminish and the imagination strengthened by discipline and fed with truth will achieve the utmost of creation that is possible to finite mind  the artist who thus works will soon find that he cannot repeat himself if he would that new fields of exertion new subjects of contemplation open to him in nature day by day and that while others lament the weakness of their invention he has nothing to lament but the shortness of life   § 24 duty of the press with respect to the works of turner  and now but one word more respecting the great artist whose works have formed the chief subject of this treatise all the greatest qualities of those worksall that is mental in them has not yet been so much as touched upon none but their lightest and least essential excellences have been proved and therefore the enthusiasm with which i speak of them must necessarily appear overcharged and absurd it might perhaps have been more prudent to have withheld the full expression of it till i had shown the full grounds for it but once written such expression must remain till i have justified it and indeed i think there is enough even in the foregoing pages to show that these works are as far as concerns the ordinary critics of the press above all animadversion and above all praise and that by the public they are not to be received as in any way subjects or matters of opinion but of faith we are not to approach them to be pleased but to be taught not to form a judgment but to receive a lesson our periodical writers therefore may save themselves the trouble either of blaming or praising their duty is not to pronounce opinions upon the work of a man who has walked with nature threescore years but to impress upon the public the respect with which they are to be received and to make request to him on the part of the people of england that he would now touch no unimportant workthat he would not spend time on slight or small pictures but give to the nation a series of grand consistent systematic and completed poems we desire that he should follow out his own thoughts and intents of heart without reference to any human authority but we request in all humility that those thoughts may be seriously and loftily given and that the whole power of his unequalled intellect may be exerted in the production of such works as may remain forever for the teaching of the nations in all that he says we believe in all that he does we trust81 it is therefore that we pray him to utter nothing lightlyto do nothing regardlessly he stands upon an eminence from which he looks back over the universe of god and forward over the generations of men let every work of his hand be a history of the one and a lesson to the other let each exertion of his mighty mind be both hymn and prophecyadoration to the deityrevelation to mankind   footnotes    79 of course this assertion does not refer to the differences in     mode of execution which enable one painter to work faster or slower     than another but only to the exertion of mind commonly manifested     by the artist according as he is sparing or prodigal of production    80 talk of improving nature when it is naturenonsensee     v rippingille i have not yet spoken of the differenceeven in     what we commonly call naturebetween imperfect and ideal form the     study of this difficult question must of course be deferred until     we have examined the nature of our impressions of beauty but it may     not be out of place here to hint at the want of care in many of our     artists to distinguish between the real work of nature and the     diseased results of mans interference with her many of the works     of our greatest artists have for their subjects nothing but hacked     and hewn remnants of farmyard vegetation branded root and branch     from their birth by the prong and the pruninghook and the     feelings once accustomed to take pleasure in such abortions can     scarcely become perceptive of forms truly ideal i have just said     423 that young painters should go to nature trustinglyrejecting     nothing and selecting nothing so they should but they must be     careful that it is nature to whom they gonature in her     libertynot as servantofallwork in the hands of the     agriculturist nor stiffened into courtdress by the landscape     gardener it must be the pure wild volition and energy of the     creation which they follownot subdued to the furrow and     cicatrized to the pollardnot persuaded into proprieties nor     pampered into diseases let them work by the torrentside and in     the forest shadows not by purling brooks and under tonsile     shades it is impossible to enter here into discussion of what man     can or cannot do by assisting natural operations it is an     intricate question nor can i without anticipating what i shall     have hereafter to advance show how or why it happens that the     racehorse is not the artists ideal of a horse nor a prize tulip     his ideal of a flower but so it is as far as the painter is     concerned man never touches nature but to spoilhe operates on     her as a barber would on the apollo and if he sometimes increases     some particular power or excellencestrength or agility in the     animaltallness or fruitfulness or solidity in the treehe     invariably loses that balance of good qualities which is the chief     sign of perfect specific form above all he destroys the appearance     of free volition and felicity which as i shall show hereafter     is one of the essential characters of organic beauty until     however i can enter into the discussion of the nature of beauty     the only advice i can safely give the young painter is to keep     clear of cloverfields and parks and to hold to the unpenetrated     forest and the unfurrowed hill there he will find that every     influence is noble even when destructivethat decay itself is     beautifuland that in the elaborate and lovely composition of all     things if at first sight it seems less studied than the works of     men the appearance of art is only prevented by the presence of     power                        nature never did betray              the heart that loved her tis her privilege              through all the years of this our life to lead              from joy to joy for she can so inform              the mind that is within us so impress              with quietness and beauty and so feed              with lofty thoughts that neither evil tongues              rash judgments nor the sneers of selfish men              shall eer prevail against us or disturb              our cheerful faith that all which we behold              is full of blessings                                                wordsworth    81 it has been hinted in some of the reviews of the second volume     of this work that the writers respect for turner has diminished     since the above passage was written he would indeed have been     deserving of little attention if with the boldness manifested on     the preceding pages he had advanced opinions based on so shallow     foundation as that the course of three years could effect     modification of them he was justified by the sudden accession of     power which the great artist exhibited at the period when this     volume was first published as well as by the low standard of the     criticism to which he was subjected in claiming with respect to     his then works a submission of judgment greater indeed than may     generally be accorded to even the highest human intellect yet not     greater than such a master might legitimately claim from such     critics and the cause of the peculiar form of advocacy into which     the preceding chapters necessarily fell has been already stated     more than once in the following sections it became necessary as     they treated a subject of intricate relations and peculiar     difficulty to obtain a more general view of the scope and operation     of art and to avoid all conclusions in any wise referable to the     study of particular painters the reader will therefore find not     that lower rank is attributed to turner but that he is now compared     with the greatest men and occupies his true position among the most     noble of all time                                      postscript  the above passage was written in the year 1843 too late it is true that soon after the publication of this work the abuse of the press which had been directed against turner with unceasing virulence during the production of his noblest works sank into timid animadversion or changed into unintelligent praise but not before illness and in some degree mortification had enfeebled the hand and chilled the heart of the painter  this year 1851 he has no picture on the walls of the academy and the times of may 3d says we miss those works of inspiration  we miss who missesthe populace of england rolls by to weary itself in the great bazaar of kensington little thinking that a day will come when those veiled vestals and prancing amazons and goodly merchandise of precious stones and gold will all be forgotten as though they had not been but that the light which has faded from the walls of the academy is one which a million of kohinoors could not rekindle and that the year 1851 will in the far future be remembered less for what it has displayed than for what it has withdrawn     denmark hill june 1851
