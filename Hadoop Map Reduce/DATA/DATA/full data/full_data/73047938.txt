73047938	a connecticut yankee in king arthurs court  by  mark twain samuel l clemens     preface  the ungentle laws and customs touched upon in this tale are historical and the episodes which are used to illustrate them are also historical  it is not pretended that these laws and customs existed in england in the sixth century no it is only pretended that inasmuch as they existed in the english and other civilizations of far later times it is safe to consider that it is no libel upon the sixth century to suppose them to have been in practice in that day also  one is quite justified in inferring that whatever one of these laws or customs was lacking in that remote time its place was competently filled by a worse one  the question as to whether there is such a thing as divine right of kings is not settled in this book  it was found too difficult that the executive head of a nation should be a person of lofty character and extraordinary ability was manifest and indisputable that none but the deity could select that head unerringly was also manifest and indisputable that the deity ought to make that selection then was likewise manifest and indisputable consequently that he does make it as claimed was an unavoidable deduction i mean until the author of this book encountered the pompadour and lady castlemaine and some other executive heads of that kind these were found so difficult to work into the scheme that it was judged better to take the other tack in this book which must be issued this fall and then go into training and settle the question in another book  it is of course a thing which ought to be settled and i am not going to have anything particular to do next winter anyway  mark twain  hartford july 21 1889       a connecticut yankee in king arthurs court     a word of explanation  it was in warwick castle that i came across the curious stranger whom i am going to talk about  he attracted me by three things his candid simplicity his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor and the restfulness of his companyfor he did all the talking we fell together as modest people will in the tail of the herd that was being shown through and he at once began to say things which interested me  as he talked along softly pleasantly flowingly he seemed to drift away imperceptibly out of this world and time and into some remote era and old forgotten country and so he gradually wove such a spell about me that i seemed to move among the specters and shadows and dust and mold of a gray antiquity holding speech with a relic of it  exactly as i would speak of my nearest personal friends or enemies or my most familiar neighbors he spoke of sir bedivere sir bors de ganis sir launcelot of the lake sir galahad and all the other great names of the table roundand how old old unspeakably old and faded and dry and musty and ancient he came to look as he went on  presently he turned to me and said just as one might speak of the weather or any other common matter  you know about transmigration of souls do you know about transposition of epochsand bodies  i said i had not heard of it  he was so little interestedjust as when people speak of the weatherthat he did not notice whether i made him any answer or not there was half a moment of silence immediately interrupted by the droning voice of the salaried cicerone  ancient hauberk date of the sixth century time of king arthur and the round table said to have belonged to the knight sir sagramor le desirous observe the round hole through the chainmail in the left breast cant be accounted for supposed to have been done with a bullet since invention of firearmsperhaps maliciously by cromwells soldiers  my acquaintance smilednot a modern smile but one that must have gone out of general use many many centuries agoand muttered apparently to himself  wit ye well i saw it done  then after a pause added i did it myself  by the time i had recovered from the electric surprise of this remark he was gone  all that evening i sat by my fire at the warwick arms steeped in a dream of the olden time while the rain beat upon the windows and the wind roared about the eaves and corners  from time to time i dipped into old sir thomas malorys enchanting book and fed at its rich feast of prodigies and adventures breathed in the fragrance of its obsolete names and dreamed again  midnight being come at length i read another tale for a nightcapthis which here follows to wit  how sir launcelot slew two giants and made a castle free     anon withal came there upon him two great giants    well armed all save the heads with two horrible    clubs in their hands  sir launcelot put his shield    afore him and put the stroke away of the one    giant and with his sword he clave his head asunder    when his fellow saw that he ran away as he were    wood demented for fear of the horrible strokes    and sir launcelot after him with all his might    and smote him on the shoulder and clave him to    the middle  then sir launcelot went into the hall    and there came afore him three score ladies and    damsels and all kneeled unto him and thanked    god and him of their deliverance  for sir said    they the most part of us have been here this    seven year their prisoners and we have worked all    manner of silk works for our meat and we are all    great gentlewomen born and blessed be the time    knight that ever thou wert born for thou hast    done the most worship that ever did knight in the    world that will we bear record and we all pray    you to tell us your name that we may tell our    friends who delivered us out of prison  fair    damsels he said my name is sir launcelot du    lake  and so he departed from them and betaught    them unto god  and then he mounted upon his    horse and rode into many strange and wild    countries and through many waters and valleys    and evil was he lodged  and at the last by    fortune him happened against a night to come to    a fair courtilage and therein he found an old    gentlewoman that lodged him with a goodwill    and there he had good cheer for him and his horse    and when time was his host brought him into a    fair garret over the gate to his bed there    sir launcelot unarmed him and set his harness    by him and went to bed and anon he fell on    sleep so soon after there came one on    horseback and knocked at the gate in great    haste  and when sir launcelot heard this he rose    up and looked out at the window and saw by the    moonlight three knights come riding after that    one man and all three lashed on him at once    with swords and that one knight turned on them    knightly again and defended him truly said    sir launcelot yonder one knight shall i help    for it were shame for me to see three knights    on one and if he be slain i am partner of his    death  and therewith he took his harness and    went out at a window by a sheet down to the four    knights and then sir launcelot said on high    turn you knights unto me and leave your    fighting with that knight and then they all    three left sir kay and turned unto sir launcelot    and there began great battle for they alight    all three and strake many strokes at sir    launcelot and assailed him on every side then    sir kay dressed him for to have holpen sir    launcelot  nay sir said he i will none of    your help therefore as ye will have my help    let me alone with them  sir kay for the pleasure    of the knight suffered him for to do his will    and so stood aside and then anon within six    strokes sir launcelot had stricken them to the earth     and then they all three cried sir knight we    yield us unto you as man of might matchless  as    to that said sir launcelot i will not take    your yielding unto me but so that ye yield    you unto sir kay the seneschal on that covenant    i will save your lives and else not  fair knight    said they that were we loath to do for as for    sir kay we chased him hither and had overcome    him had ye not been therefore to yield us unto    him it were no reason  well as to that said    sir launcelot advise you well for ye may    choose whether ye will die or live for an ye be    yielden it shall be unto sir kay  fair knight    then they said in saving our lives we will do    as thou commandest us  then shall ye said sir    launcelot on whitsunday next coming go unto the    court of king arthur and there shall ye yield    you unto queen guenever and put you all three    in her grace and mercy and say that sir kay    sent you thither to be her prisoners  on the morn    sir launcelot arose early and left sir kay    sleeping and sir launcelot took sir kays armor    and his shield and armed him and so he went to    the stable and took his horse and took his leave    of his host and so he departed  then soon after    arose sir kay and missed sir launcelot and    then he espied that he had his armor and his    horse now by my faith i know well that he will    grieve some of the court of king arthur for on    him knights will be bold and deem that it is i    and that will beguile them and because of his    armor and shield i am sure i shall ride in peace    and then soon after departed sir kay and    thanked his host   as i laid the book down there was a knock at the door and my stranger came in  i gave him a pipe and a chair and made him welcome  i also comforted him with a hot scotch whisky gave him another one then still anotherhoping always for his story after a fourth persuader he drifted into it himself in a quite simple and natural way    the strangers history  i am an american  i was born and reared in hartford in the state of connecticutanyway just over the river in the country  so i am a yankee of the yankeesand practical yes and nearly barren of sentiment i supposeor poetry in other words  my father was a blacksmith my uncle was a horse doctor and i was both along at first  then i went over to the great arms factory and learned my real trade learned all there was to it learned to make everything guns revolvers cannon boilers engines all sorts of laborsaving machinery  why i could make anything a body wantedanything in the world it didnt make any difference what and if there wasnt any quick newfangled way to make a thing i could invent oneand do it as easy as rolling off a log  i became head superintendent had a couple of thousand men under me  well a man like that is a man that is full of fightthat goes without saying  with a couple of thousand rough men under one one has plenty of that sort of amusement  i had anyway  at last i met my match and i got my dose  it was during a misunderstanding conducted with crowbars with a fellow we used to call hercules he laid me out with a crusher alongside the head that made everything crack and seemed to spring every joint in my skull and made it overlap its neighbor  then the world went out in darkness and i didnt feel anything more and didnt know anything at all at least for a while  when i came to again i was sitting under an oak tree on the grass with a whole beautiful and broad country landscape all to myselfnearly  not entirely for there was a fellow on a horse looking down at mea fellow fresh out of a picturebook  he was in oldtime iron armor from head to heel with a helmet on his head the shape of a nailkeg with slits in it and he had a shield and a sword and a prodigious spear and his horse had armor on too and a steel horn projecting from his forehead and gorgeous red and green silk trappings that hung down all around him like a bedquilt nearly to the ground  fair sir will ye just said this fellow  will i which  will ye try a passage of arms for land or lady or for  what are you giving me i said  get along back to your circus or ill report you  now what does this man do but fall back a couple of hundred yards and then come rushing at me as hard as he could tear with his nailkeg bent down nearly to his horses neck and his long spear pointed straight ahead  i saw he meant business so i was up the tree when he arrived  he allowed that i was his property the captive of his spear there was argument on his sideand the bulk of the advantage so i judged it best to humor him  we fixed up an agreement whereby i was to go with him and he was not to hurt me  i came down and we started away i walking by the side of his horse we marched comfortably along through glades and over brooks which i could not remember to have seen beforewhich puzzled me and made me wonderand yet we did not come to any circus or sign of a circus  so i gave up the idea of a circus and concluded he was from an asylum  but we never came to an asylumso i was up a stump as you may say  i asked him how far we were from hartford he said he had never heard of the place which i took to be a lie but allowed it to go at that  at the end of an hour we saw a faraway town sleeping in a valley by a winding river and beyond it on a hill a vast gray fortress with towers and turrets the first i had ever seen out of a picture  bridgeport said i pointing  camelot said he   my stranger had been showing signs of sleepiness  he caught himself nodding now and smiled one of those pathetic obsolete smiles of his and said  i find i cant go on but come with me ive got it all written out and you can read it if you like  in his chamber he said first i kept a journal then by and by after years i took the journal and turned it into a book how long ago that was  he handed me his manuscript and pointed out the place where i should begin  begin hereive already told you what goes before  he was steeped in drowsiness by this time  as i went out at his door i heard him murmur sleepily give you good den fair sir  i sat down by my fire and examined my treasure  the first part of itthe great bulk of itwas parchment and yellow with age i scanned a leaf particularly and saw that it was a palimpsest under the old dim writing of the yankee historian appeared traces of a penmanship which was older and dimmer stilllatin words and sentences fragments from old monkish legends evidently i turned to the place indicated by my stranger and began to read as follows     the tale of the lost land     chapter i  camelot  camelotcamelot said i to myself  i dont seem to remember hearing of it before  name of the asylum likely  it was a soft reposeful summer landscape as lovely as a dream and as lonesome as sunday  the air was full of the smell of flowers and the buzzing of insects and the twittering of birds and there were no people no wagons there was no stir of life nothing going on  the road was mainly a winding path with hoofprints in it and now and then a faint trace of wheels on either side in the grasswheels that apparently had a tire as broad as ones hand  presently a fair slip of a girl about ten years old with a cataract of golden hair streaming down over her shoulders came along around her head she wore a hoop of flamered poppies it was as sweet an outfit as ever i saw what there was of it  she walked indolently along with a mind at rest its peace reflected in her innocent face  the circus man paid no attention to her didnt even seem to see her  and sheshe was no more startled at his fantastic makeup than if she was used to his like every day of her life  she was going by as indifferently as she might have gone by a couple of cows but when she happened to notice me then there was a change  up went her hands and she was turned to stone her mouth dropped open her eyes stared wide and timorously she was the picture of astonished curiosity touched with fear  and there she stood gazing in a sort of stupefied fascination till we turned a corner of the wood and were lost to her view  that she should be startled at me instead of at the other man was too many for me i couldnt make head or tail of it  and that she should seem to consider me a spectacle and totally overlook her own merits in that respect was another puzzling thing and a display of magnanimity too that was surprising in one so young there was food for thought here  i moved along as one in a dream  as we approached the town signs of life began to appear  at intervals we passed a wretched cabin with a thatched roof and about it small fields and garden patches in an indifferent state of cultivation  there were people too brawny men with long coarse uncombed hair that hung down over their faces and made them look like animals  they and the women as a rule wore a coarse towlinen robe that came well below the knee and a rude sort of sandal and many wore an iron collar  the small boys and girls were always naked but nobody seemed to know it  all of these people stared at me talked about me ran into the huts and fetched out their families to gape at me but nobody ever noticed that other fellow except to make him humble salutation and get no response for their pains  in the town were some substantial windowless houses of stone scattered among a wilderness of thatched cabins the streets were mere crooked alleys and unpaved troops of dogs and nude children played in the sun and made life and noise hogs roamed and rooted contentedly about and one of them lay in a reeking wallow in the middle of the main thoroughfare and suckled her family presently there was a distant blare of military music it came nearer still nearer and soon a noble cavalcade wound into view glorious with plumed helmets and flashing mail and flaunting banners and rich doublets and horsecloths and gilded spearheads and through the muck and swine and naked brats and joyous dogs and shabby huts it took its gallant way and in its wake we followed followed through one winding alley and then anotherand climbing always climbingtill at last we gained the breezy height where the huge castle stood  there was an exchange of bugle blasts then a parley from the walls where menatarms in hauberk and morion marched back and forth with halberd at shoulder under flapping banners with the rude figure of a dragon displayed upon them and then the great gates were flung open the drawbridge was lowered and the head of the cavalcade swept forward under the frowning arches and we following soon found ourselves in a great paved court with towers and turrets stretching up into the blue air on all the four sides and all about us the dismount was going on and much greeting and ceremony and running to and fro and a gay display of moving and intermingling colors and an altogether pleasant stir and noise and confusion    chapter ii  king arthurs court  the moment i got a chance i slipped aside privately and touched an ancient common looking man on the shoulder and said in an insinuating confidential way  friend do me a kindness  do you belong to the asylum or are you just on a visit or something like that  he looked me over stupidly and said  marry fair sir me seemeth  that will do i said i reckon you are a patient  i moved away cogitating and at the same time keeping an eye out for any chance passenger in his right mind that might come along and give me some light  i judged i had found one presently so i drew him aside and said in his ear  if i could see the head keeper a minuteonly just a minute  prithee do not let me  let you what  hinder me then if the word please thee better  then he went on to say he was an undercook and could not stop to gossip though he would like it another time for it would comfort his very liver to know where i got my clothes  as he started away he pointed and said yonder was one who was idle enough for my purpose and was seeking me besides no doubt  this was an airy slim boy in shrimpcolored tights that made him look like a forked carrot the rest of his gear was blue silk and dainty laces and ruffles and he had long yellow curls and wore a plumed pink satin cap tilted complacently over his ear  by his look he was goodnatured by his gait he was satisfied with himself  he was pretty enough to frame  he arrived looked me over with a smiling and impudent curiosity said he had come for me and informed me that he was a page  go long i said you aint more than a paragraph  it was pretty severe but i was nettled  however it never phazed him he didnt appear to know he was hurt  he began to talk and laugh in happy thoughtless boyish fashion as we walked along and made himself old friends with me at once asked me all sorts of questions about myself and about my clothes but never waited for an answeralways chattered straight ahead as if he didnt know he had asked a question and wasnt expecting any reply until at last he happened to mention that he was born in the beginning of the year 513  it made the cold chills creep over me  i stopped and said a little faintly  maybe i didnt hear you just right  say it againand say it slow  what year was it  513  513  you dont look it  come my boy i am a stranger and friendless be honest and honorable with me  are you in your right mind  he said he was  are these other people in their right minds  he said they were  and this isnt an asylum  i mean it isnt a place where they cure crazy people  he said it wasnt  well then i said either i am a lunatic or something just as awful has happened  now tell me honest and true where am i  in king arthurs court  i waited a minute to let that idea shudder its way home and then said  and according to your notions what year is it now  528nineteenth of june  i felt a mournful sinking at the heart and muttered i shall never see my friends againnever never again  they will not be born for more than thirteen hundred years yet  i seemed to believe the boy i didnt know why  something in me seemed to believe himmy consciousness as you may say but my reason didnt  my reason straightway began to clamor that was natural  i didnt know how to go about satisfying it because i knew that the testimony of men wouldnt servemy reason would say they were lunatics and throw out their evidence  but all of a sudden i stumbled on the very thing just by luck  i knew that the only total eclipse of the sun in the first half of the sixth century occurred on the 21st of june ad 528 os and began at 3 minutes after 12 noon  i also knew that no total eclipse of the sun was due in what to me was the present yearie 1879 so if i could keep my anxiety and curiosity from eating the heart out of me for fortyeight hours i should then find out for certain whether this boy was telling me the truth or not  wherefore being a practical connecticut man i now shoved this whole problem clear out of my mind till its appointed day and hour should come in order that i might turn all my attention to the circumstances of the present moment and be alert and ready to make the most out of them that could be made  one thing at a time is my mottoand just play that thing for all it is worth even if its only two pair and a jack  i made up my mind to two things if it was still the nineteenth century and i was among lunatics and couldnt get away i would presently boss that asylum or know the reason why and if on the other hand it was really the sixth century all right i didnt want any softer thing i would boss the whole country inside of three months for i judged i would have the start of the besteducated man in the kingdom by a matter of thirteen hundred years and upward  im not a man to waste time after my minds made up and theres work on hand so i said to the page  now clarence my boyif that might happen to be your name ill get you to post me up a little if you dont mind  what is the name of that apparition that brought me here  my master and thine  that is the good knight and great lord sir kay the seneschal foster brother to our liege the king  very good go on tell me everything  he made a long story of it but the part that had immediate interest for me was this he said i was sir kays prisoner and that in the due course of custom i would be flung into a dungeon and left there on scant commons until my friends ransomed meunless i chanced to rot first  i saw that the last chance had the best show but i didnt waste any bother about that time was too precious  the page said further that dinner was about ended in the great hall by this time and that as soon as the sociability and the heavy drinking should begin sir kay would have me in and exhibit me before king arthur and his illustrious knights seated at the table round and would brag about his exploit in capturing me and would probably exaggerate the facts a little but it wouldnt be good form for me to correct him and not over safe either and when i was done being exhibited then ho for the dungeon but he clarence would find a way to come and see me every now and then and cheer me up and help me get word to my friends  get word to my friends  i thanked him i couldnt do less and about this time a lackey came to say i was wanted so clarence led me in and took me off to one side and sat down by me  well it was a curious kind of spectacle and interesting it was an immense place and rather nakedyes and full of loud contrasts it was very very lofty so lofty that the banners depending from the arched beams and girders away up there floated in a sort of twilight there was a stonerailed gallery at each end high up with musicians in the one and women clothed in stunning colors in the other  the floor was of big stone flags laid in black and white squares rather battered by age and use and needing repair as to ornament there wasnt any strictly speaking though on the walls hung some huge tapestries which were probably taxed as works of art battlepieces they were with horses shaped like those which children cut out of paper or create in gingerbread with men on them in scale armor whose scales are represented by round holesso that the mans coat looks as if it had been done with a biscuitpunch  there was a fireplace big enough to camp in and its projecting sides and hood of carved and pillared stonework had the look of a cathedral door  along the walls stood menatarms in breastplate and morion with halberds for their only weapon rigid as statues and that is what they looked like  in the middle of this groined and vaulted public square was an oaken table which they called the table round  it was as large as a circus ring and around it sat a great company of men dressed in such various and splendid colors that it hurt ones eyes to look at them  they wore their plumed hats right along except that whenever one addressed himself directly to the king he lifted his hat a trifle just as he was beginning his remark  mainly they were drinkingfrom entire ox horns but a few were still munching bread or gnawing beef bones  there was about an average of two dogs to one man and these sat in expectant attitudes till a spent bone was flung to them and then they went for it by brigades and divisions with a rush and there ensued a fight which filled the prospect with a tumultuous chaos of plunging heads and bodies and flashing tails and the storm of howlings and barkings deafened all speech for the time but that was no matter for the dogfight was always a bigger interest anyway the men rose sometimes to observe it the better and bet on it and the ladies and the musicians stretched themselves out over their balusters with the same object and all broke into delighted ejaculations from time to time in the end the winning dog stretched himself out comfortably with his bone between his paws and proceeded to growl over it and gnaw it and grease the floor with it just as fifty others were already doing and the rest of the court resumed their previous industries and entertainments  as a rule the speech and behavior of these people were gracious and courtly and i noticed that they were good and serious listeners when anybody was telling anythingi mean in a dogfightless interval  and plainly too they were a childlike and innocent lot telling lies of the stateliest pattern with a most gentle and winning naivety and ready and willing to listen to anybody elses lie and believe it too  it was hard to associate them with anything cruel or dreadful and yet they dealt in tales of blood and suffering with a guileless relish that made me almost forget to shudder  i was not the only prisoner present  there were twenty or more poor devils many of them were maimed hacked carved in a frightful way and their hair their faces their clothing were caked with black and stiffened drenchings of blood  they were suffering sharp physical pain of course and weariness and hunger and thirst no doubt and at least none had given them the comfort of a wash or even the poor charity of a lotion for their wounds yet you never heard them utter a moan or a groan or saw them show any sign of restlessness or any disposition to complain  the thought was forced upon me the rascalsthey have served other people so in their day it being their own turn now they were not expecting any better treatment than this so their philosophical bearing is not an outcome of mental training intellectual fortitude reasoning it is mere animal training they are white indians    chapter iii  knights of the table round  mainly the round table talk was monologuesnarrative accounts of the adventures in which these prisoners were captured and their friends and backers killed and stripped of their steeds and armor as a general thingas far as i could make outthese murderous adventures were not forays undertaken to avenge injuries nor to settle old disputes or sudden fallings out no as a rule they were simply duels between strangersduels between people who had never even been introduced to each other and between whom existed no cause of offense whatever  many a time i had seen a couple of boys strangers meet by chance and say simultaneously i can lick you and go at it on the spot but i had always imagined until now that that sort of thing belonged to children only and was a sign and mark of childhood but here were these big boobies sticking to it and taking pride in it clear up into full age and beyond  yet there was something very engaging about these great simplehearted creatures something attractive and lovable  there did not seem to be brains enough in the entire nursery so to speak to bait a fishhook with but you didnt seem to mind that after a little because you soon saw that brains were not needed in a society like that and indeed would have marred it hindered it spoiled its symmetryperhaps rendered its existence impossible  there was a fine manliness observable in almost every face and in some a certain loftiness and sweetness that rebuked your belittling criticisms and stilled them  a most noble benignity and purity reposed in the countenance of him they called sir galahad and likewise in the kings also and there was majesty and greatness in the giant frame and high bearing of sir launcelot of the lake  there was presently an incident which centered the general interest upon this sir launcelot  at a sign from a sort of master of ceremonies six or eight of the prisoners rose and came forward in a body and knelt on the floor and lifted up their hands toward the ladies gallery and begged the grace of a word with the queen the most conspicuously situated lady in that massed flowerbed of feminine show and finery inclined her head by way of assent and then the spokesman of the prisoners delivered himself and his fellows into her hands for free pardon ransom captivity or death as she in her good pleasure might elect and this as he said he was doing by command of sir kay the seneschal whose prisoners they were he having vanquished them by his single might and prowess in sturdy conflict in the field  surprise and astonishment flashed from face to face all over the house the queens gratified smile faded out at the name of sir kay and she looked disappointed and the page whispered in my ear with an accent and manner expressive of extravagant derision  sir kay forsooth  oh call me pet names dearest call me a marine  in twice a thousand years shall the unholy invention of man labor at odds to beget the fellow to this majestic lie  every eye was fastened with severe inquiry upon sir kay but he was equal to the occasion  he got up and played his hand like a majorand took every trick  he said he would state the case exactly according to the facts he would tell the simple straightforward tale without comment of his own and then said he if ye find glory and honor due ye will give it unto him who is the mightiest man of his hands that ever bare shield or strake with sword in the ranks of christian battleeven him that sitteth there and he pointed to sir launcelot  ah he fetched them it was a rattling good stroke  then he went on and told how sir launcelot seeking adventures some brief time gone by killed seven giants at one sweep of his sword and set a hundred and fortytwo captive maidens free and then went further still seeking adventures and found him sir kay fighting a desperate fight against nine foreign knights and straightway took the battle solely into his own hands and conquered the nine and that night sir launcelot rose quietly and dressed him in sir kays armor and took sir kays horse and gat him away into distant lands and vanquished sixteen knights in one pitched battle and thirtyfour in another and all these and the former nine he made to swear that about whitsuntide they would ride to arthurs court and yield them to queen guenevers hands as captives of sir kay the seneschal spoil of his knightly prowess and now here were these half dozen and the rest would be along as soon as they might be healed of their desperate wounds  well it was touching to see the queen blush and smile and look embarrassed and happy and fling furtive glances at sir launcelot that would have got him shot in arkansas to a dead certainty  everybody praised the valor and magnanimity of sir launcelot and as for me i was perfectly amazed that one man all by himself should have been able to beat down and capture such battalions of practiced fighters  i said as much to clarence but this mocking featherhead only said  an sir kay had had time to get another skin of sour wine into him ye had seen the accompt doubled  i looked at the boy in sorrow and as i looked i saw the cloud of a deep despondency settle upon his countenance  i followed the direction of his eye and saw that a very old and whitebearded man clothed in a flowing black gown had risen and was standing at the table upon unsteady legs and feebly swaying his ancient head and surveying the company with his watery and wandering eye the same suffering look that was in the pages face was observable in all the faces aroundthe look of dumb creatures who know that they must endure and make no moan  marry we shall have it again sighed the boy that same old weary tale that he hath told a thousand times in the same words and that he will tell till he dieth every time he hath gotten his barrel full and feeleth his exaggerationmill aworking  would god i had died or i saw this day  who is it  merlin the mighty liar and magician perdition singe him for the weariness he worketh with his one tale  but that men fear him for that he hath the storms and the lightnings and all the devils that be in hell at his beck and call they would have dug his entrails out these many years ago to get at that tale and squelch it  he telleth it always in the third person making believe he is too modest to glorify himselfmaledictions light upon him misfortune be his dole  good friend prithee call me for evensong  the boy nestled himself upon my shoulder and pretended to go to sleep  the old man began his tale and presently the lad was asleep in reality so also were the dogs and the court the lackeys and the files of menatarms  the droning voice droned on a soft snoring arose on all sides and supported it like a deep and subdued accompaniment of wind instruments  some heads were bowed upon folded arms some lay back with open mouths that issued unconscious music the flies buzzed and bit unmolested the rats swarmed softly out from a hundred holes and pattered about and made themselves at home everywhere and one of them sat up like a squirrel on the kings head and held a bit of cheese in its hands and nibbled it and dribbled the crumbs in the kings face with naive and impudent irreverence  it was a tranquil scene and restful to the weary eye and the jaded spirit  this was the old mans tale  he said  right so the king and merlin departed and went until an hermit that was a good man and a great leech  so the hermit searched all his wounds and gave him good salves so the king was there three days and then were his wounds well amended that he might ride and go and so departed  and as they rode arthur said i have no sword  no force footnote from mt no matter said merlin hereby is a sword that shall be yours and i may so they rode till they came to a lake the which was a fair water and broad and in the midst of the lake arthur was ware of an arm clothed in white samite that held a fair sword in that hand lo said merlin yonder is that sword that i spake of  with that they saw a damsel going upon the lake  what damsel is that said arthur  that is the lady of the lake said merlin and within that lake is a rock and therein is as fair a place as any on earth and richly beseen and this damsel will come to you anon and then speak ye fair to her that she will give you that sword  anon withal came the damsel unto arthur and saluted him and he her again  damsel said arthur what sword is that that yonder the arm holdeth above the water  i would it were mine for i have no sword  sir arthur king said the damsel that sword is mine and if ye will give me a gift when i ask it you ye shall have it by my faith said arthur i will give you what gift ye will ask well said the damsel go ye into yonder barge and row yourself to the sword and take it and the scabbard with you and i will ask my gift when i see my time  so sir arthur and merlin alight and tied their horses to two trees and so they went into the ship and when they came to the sword that the hand held sir arthur took it up by the handles and took it with him  and the arm and the hand went under the water and so they came unto the land and rode forth  and then sir arthur saw a rich pavilion  what signifieth yonder pavilion  it is the knights pavilion said merlin that ye fought with last sir pellinore but he is out he is not there he hath ado with a knight of yours that hight egglame and they have fought together but at the last egglame fled and else he had been dead and he hath chased him even to carlion and we shall meet with him anon in the highway  that is well said said arthur now have i a sword now will i wage battle with him and be avenged on him  sir ye shall not so said merlin for the knight is weary of fighting and chasing so that ye shall have no worship to have ado with him also he will not lightly be matched of one knight living and therefore it is my counsel let him pass for he shall do you good service in short time and his sons after his days  also ye shall see that day in short space ye shall be right glad to give him your sister to wed  when i see him i will do as ye advise me said arthur then sir arthur looked on the sword and liked it passing well whether liketh you better said merlin the sword or the scabbard me liketh better the sword said arthur  ye are more unwise said merlin for the scabbard is worth ten of the sword for while ye have the scabbard upon you ye shall never lose no blood be ye never so sore wounded therefore keep well the scabbard always with you  so they rode into carlion and by the way they met with sir pellinore but merlin had done such a craft that pellinore saw not arthur and he passed by without any words  i marvel said arthur that the knight would not speak  sir said merlin he saw you not for and he had seen you ye had not lightly departed  so they came unto carlion whereof his knights were passing glad and when they heard of his adventures they marveled that he would jeopard his person so alone  but all men of worship said it was merry to be under such a chieftain that would put his person in adventure as other poor knights did    chapter iv  sir dinadan the humorist  it seemed to me that this quaint lie was most simply and beautifully told but then i had heard it only once and that makes a difference it was pleasant to the others when it was fresh no doubt  sir dinadan the humorist was the first to awake and he soon roused the rest with a practical joke of a sufficiently poor quality he tied some metal mugs to a dogs tail and turned him loose and he tore around and around the place in a frenzy of fright with all the other dogs bellowing after him and battering and crashing against everything that came in their way and making altogether a chaos of confusion and a most deafening din and turmoil at which every man and woman of the multitude laughed till the tears flowed and some fell out of their chairs and wallowed on the floor in ecstasy  it was just like so many children sir dinadan was so proud of his exploit that he could not keep from telling over and over again to weariness how the immortal idea happened to occur to him and as is the way with humorists of his breed he was still laughing at it after everybody else had got through  he was so set up that he concluded to make a speech of course a humorous speech  i think i never heard so many old playedout jokes strung together in my life  he was worse than the minstrels worse than the clown in the circus  it seemed peculiarly sad to sit here thirteen hundred years before i was born and listen again to poor flat wormeaten jokes that had given me the dry gripes when i was a boy thirteen hundred years afterwards  it about convinced me that there isnt any such thing as a new joke possible  everybody laughed at these antiquities but then they always do i had noticed that centuries later however of course the scoffer didnt laughi mean the boy  no he scoffed there wasnt anything he wouldnt scoff at he said the most of sir dinadans jokes were rotten and the rest were petrified  i said petrified was good as i believed myself that the only right way to classify the majestic ages of some of those jokes was by geologic periods  but that neat idea hit the boy in a blank place for geology hadnt been invented yet however i made a note of the remark and calculated to educate the commonwealth up to it if i pulled through  it is no use to throw a good thing away merely because the market isnt ripe yet  now sir kay arose and began to fire up on his historymill with me for fuel  it was time for me to feel serious and i did  sir kay told how he had encountered me in a far land of barbarians who all wore the same ridiculous garb that i dida garb that was a work of enchantment and intended to make the wearer secure from hurt by human hands  however he had nullified the force of the enchantment by prayer and had killed my thirteen knights in a three hours battle and taken me prisoner sparing my life in order that so strange a curiosity as i was might be exhibited to the wonder and admiration of the king and the court  he spoke of me all the time in the blandest way as this prodigious giant and this horrible skytowering monster and this tusked and taloned mandevouring ogre and everybody took in all this bosh in the naivest way and never smiled or seemed to notice that there was any discrepancy between these watered statistics and me he said that in trying to escape from him i sprang into the top of a tree two hundred cubits high at a single bound but he dislodged me with a stone the size of a cow which allto brast the most of my bones and then swore me to appear at arthurs court for sentence  he ended by condemning me to die at noon on the 21st and was so little concerned about it that he stopped to yawn before he named the date  i was in a dismal state by this time indeed i was hardly enough in my right mind to keep the run of a dispute that sprung up as to how i had better be killed the possibility of the killing being doubted by some because of the enchantment in my clothes and yet it was nothing but an ordinary suit of fifteendollar slopshops still i was sane enough to notice this detail to wit many of the terms used in the most matteroffact way by this great assemblage of the first ladies and gentlemen in the land would have made a comanche blush  indelicacy is too mild a term to convey the idea  however i had read tom jones and roderick random and other books of that kind and knew that the highest and first ladies and gentlemen in england had remained little or no cleaner in their talk and in the morals and conduct which such talk implies clear up to a hundred years ago in fact clear into our own nineteenth centuryin which century broadly speaking the earliest samples of the real lady and real gentleman discoverable in english historyor in european history for that mattermay be said to have made their appearance  suppose sir walter instead of putting the conversations into the mouths of his characters had allowed the characters to speak for themselves  we should have had talk from rebecca and ivanhoe and the soft lady rowena which would embarrass a tramp in our day  however to the unconsciously indelicate all things are delicate  king arthurs people were not aware that they were indecent and i had presence of mind enough not to mention it  they were so troubled about my enchanted clothes that they were mightily relieved at last when old merlin swept the difficulty away for them with a commonsense hint  he asked them why they were so dullwhy didnt it occur to them to strip me  in half a minute i was as naked as a pair of tongs  and dear dear to think of it i was the only embarrassed person there  everybody discussed me and did it as unconcernedly as if i had been a cabbage queen guenever was as naively interested as the rest and said she had never seen anybody with legs just like mine before  it was the only compliment i gotif it was a compliment  finally i was carried off in one direction and my perilous clothes in another  i was shoved into a dark and narrow cell in a dungeon with some scant remnants for dinner some moldy straw for a bed and no end of rats for company    chapter v  an inspiration  i was so tired that even my fears were not able to keep me awake long  when i next came to myself i seemed to have been asleep a very long time  my first thought was well what an astonishing dream ive had  i reckon ive waked only just in time to keep from being hanged or drowned or burned or something  ill nap again till the whistle blows and then ill go down to the arms factory and have it out with hercules  but just then i heard the harsh music of rusty chains and bolts a light flashed in my eyes and that butterfly clarence stood before me  i gasped with surprise my breath almost got away from me  what i said you here yet  go along with the rest of the dream scatter  but he only laughed in his lighthearted way and fell to making fun of my sorry plight  all right i said resignedly let the dream go on im in no hurry  prithee what dream  what dream  why the dream that i am in arthurs courta person who never existed and that i am talking to you who are nothing but a work of the imagination  oh la indeed and is it a dream that youre to be burned tomorrow  hohoanswer me that  the shock that went through me was distressing  i now began to reason that my situation was in the last degree serious dream or no dream for i knew by past experience of the lifelike intensity of dreams that to be burned to death even in a dream would be very far from being a jest and was a thing to be avoided by any means fair or foul that i could contrive  so i said beseechingly  ah clarence good boy only friend ive gotfor you are my friend arent youdont fail me help me to devise some way of escaping from this place  now do but hear thyself  escape  why man the corridors are in guard and keep of menatarms  no doubt no doubt  but how many clarence  not many i hope  full a score  one may not hope to escape  after a pause hesitatingly and there be other reasonsand weightier  other ones what are they  well they sayoh but i darent indeed darent  why poor lad what is the matter  why do you blench  why do you tremble so  oh in sooth there is need  i do want to tell you but  come come be brave be a manspeak out theres a good lad  he hesitated pulled one way by desire the other way by fear then he stole to the door and peeped out listening and finally crept close to me and put his mouth to my ear and told me his fearful news in a whisper and with all the cowering apprehension of one who was venturing upon awful ground and speaking of things whose very mention might be freighted with death  merlin in his malice has woven a spell about this dungeon and there bides not the man in these kingdoms that would be desperate enough to essay to cross its lines with you  now god pity me i have told it  ah be kind to me be merciful to a poor boy who means thee well for an thou betray me i am lost  i laughed the only really refreshing laugh i had had for some time and shouted  merlin has wrought a spell  merlin forsooth  that cheap old humbug that maundering old ass  bosh pure bosh the silliest bosh in the world  why it does seem to me that of all the childish idiotic chuckleheaded chickenlivered superstitions that ev oh damn merlin  but clarence had slumped to his knees before i had half finished and he was like to go out of his mind with fright  oh beware  these are awful words  any moment these walls may crumble upon us if you say such things  oh call them back before it is too late  now this strange exhibition gave me a good idea and set me to thinking  if everybody about here was so honestly and sincerely afraid of merlins pretended magic as clarence was certainly a superior man like me ought to be shrewd enough to contrive some way to take advantage of such a state of things  i went on thinking and worked out a plan then i said  get up  pull yourself together look me in the eye  do you know why i laughed  nobut for our blessed ladys sake do it no more  well ill tell you why i laughed  because im a magician myself  thou  the boy recoiled a step and caught his breath for the thing hit him rather sudden but the aspect which he took on was very very respectful  i took quick note of that it indicated that a humbug didnt need to have a reputation in this asylum people stood ready to take him at his word without that i resumed  ive known merlin seven hundred years and he  seven hun  dont interrupt me  he has died and come alive again thirteen times and traveled under a new name every time smith jones robinson jackson peters haskins merlina new alias every time he turns up  i knew him in egypt three hundred years ago i knew him in india five hundred years agohe is always blethering around in my way everywhere i go he makes me tired  he dont amount to shucks as a magician knows some of the old common tricks but has never got beyond the rudiments and never will he is well enough for the provincesonenight stands and that sort of thing you knowbut dear me he oughtnt to set up for an expertanyway not where theres a real artist  now look here clarence i am going to stand your friend right along and in return you must be mine  i want you to do me a favor  i want you to get word to the king that i am a magician myselfand the supreme grand highyumuckamuck and head of the tribe at that and i want him to be made to understand that i am just quietly arranging a little calamity here that will make the fur fly in these realms if sir kays project is carried out and any harm comes to me  will you get that to the king for me  the poor boy was in such a state that he could hardly answer me it was pitiful to see a creature so terrified so unnerved so demoralized  but he promised everything and on my side he made me promise over and over again that i would remain his friend and never turn against him or cast any enchantments upon him then he worked his way out staying himself with his hand along the wall like a sick person  presently this thought occurred to me how heedless i have been when the boy gets calm he will wonder why a great magician like me should have begged a boy like him to help me get out of this place he will put this and that together and will see that i am a humbug  i worried over that heedless blunder for an hour and called myself a great many hard names meantime  but finally it occurred to me all of a sudden that these animals didnt reason that they never put this and that together that all their talk showed that they didnt know a discrepancy when they saw it  i was at rest then  but as soon as one is at rest in this world off he goes on something else to worry about  it occurred to me that i had made another blunder i had sent the boy off to alarm his betters with a threati intending to invent a calamity at my leisure now the people who are the readiest and eagerest and willingest to swallow miracles are the very ones who are hungriest to see you perform them suppose i should be called on for a sample  suppose i should be asked to name my calamity  yes i had made a blunder i ought to have invented my calamity first  what shall i do what can i say to gain a little time  i was in trouble again in the deepest kind of trouble  theres a footsteptheyre coming  if i had only just a moment to think  good ive got it  im all right  you see it was the eclipse  it came into my mind in the nick of time how columbus or cortez or one of those people played an eclipse as a saving trump once on some savages and i saw my chance  i could play it myself now and it wouldnt be any plagiarism either because i should get it in nearly a thousand years ahead of those parties  clarence came in subdued distressed and said  i hasted the message to our liege the king and straightway he had me to his presence  he was frighted even to the marrow and was minded to give order for your instant enlargement and that you be clothed in fine raiment and lodged as befitted one so great but then came merlin and spoiled all for he persuaded the king that you are mad and know not whereof you speak and said your threat is but foolishness and idle vaporing  they disputed long but in the end merlin scoffing said wherefore hath he not named his brave calamity  verily it is because he cannot  this thrust did in a most sudden sort close the kings mouth and he could offer naught to turn the argument and so reluctant and full loth to do you the discourtesy he yet prayeth you to consider his perplexed case as noting how the matter stands and name the calamityif so be you have determined the nature of it and the time of its coming  oh prithee delay not to delay at such a time were to double and treble the perils that already compass thee about  oh be thou wisename the calamity  i allowed silence to accumulate while i got my impressiveness together and then said  how long have i been shut up in this hole  ye were shut up when yesterday was well spent  it is 9 of the morning now  no  then i have slept well sure enough  nine in the morning now  and yet it is the very complexion of midnight to a shade this is the 20th then  the 20thyes  and i am to be burned alive tomorrow  the boy shuddered  at what hour  at high noon  now then i will tell you what to say  i paused and stood over that cowering lad a whole minute in awful silence then in a voice deep measured charged with doom i began and rose by dramatically graded stages to my colossal climax which i delivered in as sublime and noble a way as ever i did such a thing in my life go back and tell the king that at that hour i will smother the whole world in the dead blackness of midnight i will blot out the sun and he shall never shine again the fruits of the earth shall rot for lack of light and warmth and the peoples of the earth shall famish and die to the last man  i had to carry the boy out myself he sunk into such a collapse i handed him over to the soldiers and went back    chapter vi  the eclipse  in the stillness and the darkness realization soon began to supplement knowledge  the mere knowledge of a fact is pale but when you come to realize your fact it takes on color it is all the difference between hearing of a man being stabbed to the heart and seeing it done  in the stillness and the darkness the knowledge that i was in deadly danger took to itself deeper and deeper meaning all the time a something which was realization crept inch by inch through my veins and turned me cold  but it is a blessed provision of nature that at times like these as soon as a mans mercury has got down to a certain point there comes a revulsion and he rallies  hope springs up and cheerfulness along with it and then he is in good shape to do something for himself if anything can be done  when my rally came it came with a bound  i said to myself that my eclipse would be sure to save me and make me the greatest man in the kingdom besides and straightway my mercury went up to the top of the tube and my solicitudes all vanished  i was as happy a man as there was in the world i was even impatient for tomorrow to come i so wanted to gather in that great triumph and be the center of all the nations wonder and reverence  besides in a business way it would be the making of me i knew that  meantime there was one thing which had got pushed into the background of my mind  that was the halfconviction that when the nature of my proposed calamity should be reported to those superstitious people it would have such an effect that they would want to compromise  so by and by when i heard footsteps coming that thought was recalled to me and i said to myself as sure as anything its the compromise  well if it is good all right i will accept but if it isnt i mean to stand my ground and play my hand for all it is worth  the door opened and some menatarms appeared  the leader said  the stake is ready come  the stake  the strength went out of me and i almost fell down it is hard to get ones breath at such a time such lumps come into ones throat and such gaspings but as soon as i could speak i said  but this is a mistakethe execution is tomorrow  order changed been set forward a day  haste thee  i was lost  there was no help for me  i was dazed stupefied i had no command over myself i only wandered purposely about like one out of his mind so the soldiers took hold of me and pulled me along with them out of the cell and along the maze of underground corridors and finally into the fierce glare of daylight and the upper world  as we stepped into the vast enclosed court of the castle i got a shock for the first thing i saw was the stake standing in the center and near it the piled fagots and a monk on all four sides of the court the seated multitudes rose rank above rank forming sloping terraces that were rich with color the king and the queen sat in their thrones the most conspicuous figures there of course  to note all this occupied but a second  the next second clarence had slipped from some place of concealment and was pouring news into my ear his eyes beaming with triumph and gladness  he said  tis through me the change was wrought  and main hard have i worked to do it too  but when i revealed to them the calamity in store and saw how mighty was the terror it did engender then saw i also that this was the time to strike  wherefore i diligently pretended unto this and that and the other one that your power against the sun could not reach its full until the morrow and so if any would save the sun and the world you must be slain today while your enchantments are but in the weaving and lack potency  odsbodikins it was but a dull lie a most indifferent invention but you should have seen them seize it and swallow it in the frenzy of their fright as it were salvation sent from heaven and all the while was i laughing in my sleeve the one moment to see them so cheaply deceived and glorifying god the next that he was content to let the meanest of his creatures be his instrument to the saving of thy life  ah how happy has the matter sped  you will not need to do the sun a real hurtah forget not that on your soul forget it not  only make a little darknessonly the littlest little darkness mind and cease with that  it will be sufficient  they will see that i spoke falselybeing ignorant as they will fancy and with the falling of the first shadow of that darkness you shall see them go mad with fear and they will set you free and make you great  go to thy triumph now  but rememberah good friend i implore thee remember my supplication and do the blessed sun no hurt  for my sake thy true friend  i choked out some words through my grief and misery as much as to say i would spare the sun for which the lads eyes paid me back with such deep and loving gratitude that i had not the heart to tell him his goodhearted foolishness had ruined me and sent me to my death  as the soldiers assisted me across the court the stillness was so profound that if i had been blindfold i should have supposed i was in a solitude instead of walled in by four thousand people there was not a movement perceptible in those masses of humanity they were as rigid as stone images and as pale and dread sat upon every countenance  this hush continued while i was being chained to the stake it still continued while the fagots were carefully and tediously piled about my ankles my knees my thighs my body  then there was a pause and a deeper hush if possible and a man knelt down at my feet with a blazing torch the multitude strained forward gazing and parting slightly from their seats without knowing it the monk raised his hands above my head and his eyes toward the blue sky and began some words in latin in this attitude he droned on and on a little while and then stopped i waited two or three moments then looked up he was standing there petrified  with a common impulse the multitude rose slowly up and stared into the sky  i followed their eyes as sure as guns there was my eclipse beginning  the life went boiling through my veins i was a new man  the rim of black spread slowly into the suns disk my heart beat higher and higher and still the assemblage and the priest stared into the sky motionless  i knew that this gaze would be turned upon me next  when it was i was ready  i was in one of the most grand attitudes i ever struck with my arm stretched up pointing to the sun  it was a noble effect  you could see the shudder sweep the mass like a wave two shouts rang out one close upon the heels of the other  apply the torch  i forbid it  the one was from merlin the other from the king  merlin started from his placeto apply the torch himself i judged  i said  stay where you are  if any man moveseven the kingbefore i give him leave i will blast him with thunder i will consume him with lightnings  the multitude sank meekly into their seats and i was just expecting they would  merlin hesitated a moment or two and i was on pins and needles during that little while  then he sat down and i took a good breath for i knew i was master of the situation now the king said  be merciful fair sir and essay no further in this perilous matter lest disaster follow  it was reported to us that your powers could not attain unto their full strength until the morrow but  your majesty thinks the report may have been a lie  it was a lie  that made an immense effect up went appealing hands everywhere and the king was assailed with a storm of supplications that i might be bought off at any price and the calamity stayed the king was eager to comply he said  name any terms reverend sir even to the halving of my kingdom but banish this calamity spare the sun  my fortune was made  i would have taken him up in a minute but i couldnt stop an eclipse the thing was out of the question  so i asked time to consider  the king said  how longah how long good sir  be merciful look it groweth darker moment by moment  prithee how long  not long  half an hourmaybe an hour  there were a thousand pathetic protests but i couldnt shorten up any for i couldnt remember how long a total eclipse lasts  i was in a puzzled condition anyway and wanted to think  something was wrong about that eclipse and the fact was very unsettling if this wasnt the one i was after how was i to tell whether this was the sixth century or nothing but a dream  dear me if i could only prove it was the latter  here was a glad new hope  if the boy was right about the date and this was surely the 20th it wasnt the sixth century  i reached for the monks sleeve in considerable excitement and asked him what day of the month it was  hang him he said it was the twentyfirst  it made me turn cold to hear him  i begged him not to make any mistake about it but he was sure he knew it was the 21st  so that featherheaded boy had botched things again  the time of the day was right for the eclipse i had seen that for myself in the beginning by the dial that was near by  yes i was in king arthurs court and i might as well make the most out of it i could  the darkness was steadily growing the people becoming more and more distressed  i now said  i have reflected sir king  for a lesson i will let this darkness proceed and spread night in the world but whether i blot out the sun for good or restore it shall rest with you  these are the terms to wit you shall remain king over all your dominions and receive all the glories and honors that belong to the kingship but you shall appoint me your perpetual minister and executive and give me for my services one per cent of such actual increase of revenue over and above its present amount as i may succeed in creating for the state  if i cant live on that i shant ask anybody to give me a lift  is it satisfactory  there was a prodigious roar of applause and out of the midst of it the kings voice rose saying  away with his bonds and set him free and do him homage high and low rich and poor for he is become the kings right hand is clothed with power and authority and his seat is upon the highest step of the throne  now sweep away this creeping night and bring the light and cheer again that all the world may bless thee  but i said  that a common man should be shamed before the world is nothing but it were dishonor to the king if any that saw his minister naked should not also see him delivered from his shame  if i might ask that my clothes be brought again  they are not meet the king broke in  fetch raiment of another sort clothe him like a prince  my idea worked  i wanted to keep things as they were till the eclipse was total otherwise they would be trying again to get me to dismiss the darkness and of course i couldnt do it  sending for the clothes gained some delay but not enough  so i had to make another excuse  i said it would be but natural if the king should change his mind and repent to some extent of what he had done under excitement therefore i would let the darkness grow a while and if at the end of a reasonable time the king had kept his mind the same the darkness should be dismissed  neither the king nor anybody else was satisfied with that arrangement but i had to stick to my point  it grew darker and darker and blacker and blacker while i struggled with those awkward sixthcentury clothes  it got to be pitch dark at last and the multitude groaned with horror to feel the cold uncanny night breezes fan through the place and see the stars come out and twinkle in the sky  at last the eclipse was total and i was very glad of it but everybody else was in misery which was quite natural i said  the king by his silence still stands to the terms  then i lifted up my handsstood just so a momentthen i said with the most awful solemnity let the enchantment dissolve and pass harmless away  there was no response for a moment in that deep darkness and that graveyard hush  but when the silver rim of the sun pushed itself out a moment or two later the assemblage broke loose with a vast shout and came pouring down like a deluge to smother me with blessings and gratitude and clarence was not the last of the wash to be sure    chapter vii  merlins tower  inasmuch as i was now the second personage in the kingdom as far as political power and authority were concerned much was made of me  my raiment was of silks and velvets and cloth of gold and by consequence was very showy also uncomfortable  but habit would soon reconcile me to my clothes i was aware of that  i was given the choicest suite of apartments in the castle after the kings  they were aglow with loudcolored silken hangings but the stone floors had nothing but rushes on them for a carpet and they were misfit rushes at that being not all of one breed as for conveniences properly speaking there werent any  i mean little conveniences it is the little conveniences that make the real comfort of life  the big oaken chairs graced with rude carvings were well enough but that was the stopping place there was no soap no matches no lookingglassexcept a metal one about as powerful as a pail of water  and not a chromo i had been used to chromos for years and i saw now that without my suspecting it a passion for art had got worked into the fabric of my being and was become a part of me  it made me homesick to look around over this proud and gaudy but heartless barrenness and remember that in our house in east hartford all unpretending as it was you couldnt go into a room but you would find an insurancechromo or at least a threecolor godblessourhome over the door and in the parlor we had nine  but here even in my grand room of state there wasnt anything in the nature of a picture except a thing the size of a bedquilt which was either woven or knitted it had darned places in it and nothing in it was the right color or the right shape and as for proportions even raphael himself couldnt have botched them more formidably after all his practice on those nightmares they call his celebrated hampton court cartoons  raphael was a bird  we had several of his chromos one was his miraculous draught of fishes where he puts in a miracle of his ownputs three men into a canoe which wouldnt have held a dog without upsetting  i always admired to study rs art it was so fresh and unconventional  there wasnt even a bell or a speakingtube in the castle  i had a great many servants and those that were on duty lolled in the anteroom and when i wanted one of them i had to go and call for him there was no gas there were no candles a bronze dish half full of boardinghouse butter with a blazing rag floating in it was the thing that produced what was regarded as light  a lot of these hung along the walls and modified the dark just toned it down enough to make it dismal  if you went out at night your servants carried torches  there were no books pens paper or ink and no glass in the openings they believed to be windows it is a little thingglass isuntil it is absent then it becomes a big thing  but perhaps the worst of all was that there wasnt any sugar coffee tea or tobacco  i saw that i was just another robinson crusoe cast away on an uninhabited island with no society but some more or less tame animals and if i wanted to make life bearable i must do as he didinvent contrive create reorganize things set brain and hand to work and keep them busy  well that was in my line  one thing troubled me along at firstthe immense interest which people took in me  apparently the whole nation wanted a look at me  it soon transpired that the eclipse had scared the british world almost to death that while it lasted the whole country from one end to the other was in a pitiable state of panic and the churches hermitages and monkeries overflowed with praying and weeping poor creatures who thought the end of the world was come  then had followed the news that the producer of this awful event was a stranger a mighty magician at arthurs court that he could have blown out the sun like a candle and was just going to do it when his mercy was purchased and he then dissolved his enchantments and was now recognized and honored as the man who had by his unaided might saved the globe from destruction and its peoples from extinction  now if you consider that everybody believed that and not only believed it but never even dreamed of doubting it you will easily understand that there was not a person in all britain that would not have walked fifty miles to get a sight of me  of course i was all the talkall other subjects were dropped even the king became suddenly a person of minor interest and notoriety  within twentyfour hours the delegations began to arrive and from that time onward for a fortnight they kept coming  the village was crowded and all the countryside i had to go out a dozen times a day and show myself to these reverent and awestricken multitudes  it came to be a great burden as to time and trouble but of course it was at the same time compensatingly agreeable to be so celebrated and such a center of homage  it turned brer merlin green with envy and spite which was a great satisfaction to me  but there was one thing i couldnt understandnobody had asked for an autograph  i spoke to clarence about it  by george  i had to explain to him what it was  then he said nobody in the country could read or write but a few dozen priests  land think of that  there was another thing that troubled me a little  those multitudes presently began to agitate for another miracle  that was natural to be able to carry back to their far homes the boast that they had seen the man who could command the sun riding in the heavens and be obeyed would make them great in the eyes of their neighbors and envied by them all but to be able to also say they had seen him work a miracle themselveswhy people would come a distance to see them  the pressure got to be pretty strong  there was going to be an eclipse of the moon and i knew the date and hour but it was too far away  two years  i would have given a good deal for license to hurry it up and use it now when there was a big market for it  it seemed a great pity to have it wasted so and come lagging along at a time when a body wouldnt have any use for it as like as not  if it had been booked for only a month away i could have sold it short but as matters stood i couldnt seem to cipher out any way to make it do me any good so i gave up trying  next clarence found that old merlin was making himself busy on the sly among those people  he was spreading a report that i was a humbug and that the reason i didnt accommodate the people with a miracle was because i couldnt  i saw that i must do something  i presently thought out a plan  by my authority as executive i threw merlin into prisonthe same cell i had occupied myself  then i gave public notice by herald and trumpet that i should be busy with affairs of state for a fortnight but about the end of that time i would take a moments leisure and blow up merlins stone tower by fires from heaven in the meantime whoso listened to evil reports about me let him beware  furthermore i would perform but this one miracle at this time and no more if it failed to satisfy and any murmured i would turn the murmurers into horses and make them useful quiet ensued  i took clarence into my confidence to a certain degree and we went to work privately  i told him that this was a sort of miracle that required a trifle of preparation and that it would be sudden death to ever talk about these preparations to anybody  that made his mouth safe enough  clandestinely we made a few bushels of firstrate blasting powder and i superintended my armorers while they constructed a lightningrod and some wires  this old stone tower was very massiveand rather ruinous too for it was roman and four hundred years old  yes and handsome after a rude fashion and clothed with ivy from base to summit as with a shirt of scale mail  it stood on a lonely eminence in good view from the castle and about half a mile away  working by night we stowed the powder in the towerdug stones out on the inside and buried the powder in the walls themselves which were fifteen feet thick at the base  we put in a peck at a time in a dozen places  we could have blown up the tower of london with these charges  when the thirteenth night was come we put up our lightningrod bedded it in one of the batches of powder and ran wires from it to the other batches  everybody had shunned that locality from the day of my proclamation but on the morning of the fourteenth i thought best to warn the people through the heralds to keep clear awaya quarter of a mile away then added by command that at some time during the twentyfour hours i would consummate the miracle but would first give a brief notice by flags on the castle towers if in the daytime by torchbaskets in the same places if at night  thundershowers had been tolerably frequent of late and i was not much afraid of a failure still i shouldnt have cared for a delay of a day or two i should have explained that i was busy with affairs of state yet and the people must wait  of course we had a blazing sunny dayalmost the first one without a cloud for three weeks things always happen so  i kept secluded and watched the weather  clarence dropped in from time to time and said the public excitement was growing and growing all the time and the whole country filling up with human masses as far as one could see from the battlements  at last the wind sprang up and a cloud appearedin the right quarter too and just at nightfall  for a little while i watched that distant cloud spread and blacken then i judged it was time for me to appear  i ordered the torchbaskets to be lit and merlin liberated and sent to me a quarter of an hour later i ascended the parapet and there found the king and the court assembled and gazing off in the darkness toward merlins tower  already the darkness was so heavy that one could not see far these people and the old turrets being partly in deep shadow and partly in the red glow from the great torchbaskets overhead made a good deal of a picture  merlin arrived in a gloomy mood  i said  you wanted to burn me alive when i had not done you any harm and latterly you have been trying to injure my professional reputation  therefore i am going to call down fire and blow up your tower but it is only fair to give you a chance now if you think you can break my enchantments and ward off the fires step to the bat its your innings  i can fair sir and i will doubt it not  he drew an imaginary circle on the stones of the roof and burnt a pinch of powder in it which sent up a small cloud of aromatic smoke whereat everybody fell back and began to cross themselves and get uncomfortable  then he began to mutter and make passes in the air with his hands  he worked himself up slowly and gradually into a sort of frenzy and got to thrashing around with his arms like the sails of a windmill  by this time the storm had about reached us the gusts of wind were flaring the torches and making the shadows swash about the first heavy drops of rain were falling the world abroad was black as pitch the lightning began to wink fitfully  of course my rod would be loading itself now  in fact things were imminent so i said  you have had time enough  i have given you every advantage and not interfered  it is plain your magic is weak it is only fair that i begin now  i made about three passes in the air and then there was an awful crash and that old tower leaped into the sky in chunks along with a vast volcanic fountain of fire that turned night to noonday and showed a thousand acres of human beings groveling on the ground in a general collapse of consternation  well it rained mortar and masonry the rest of the week  this was the report but probably the facts would have modified it  it was an effective miracle  the great bothersome temporary population vanished  there were a good many thousand tracks in the mud the next morning but they were all outward bound if i had advertised another miracle i couldnt have raised an audience with a sheriff  merlins stock was flat  the king wanted to stop his wages he even wanted to banish him but i interfered  i said he would be useful to work the weather and attend to small matters like that and i would give him a lift now and then when his poor little parlormagic soured on him  there wasnt a rag of his tower left but i had the government rebuild it for him and advised him to take boarders but he was too hightoned for that  and as for being grateful he never even said thank you  he was a rather hard lot take him how you might but then you couldnt fairly expect a man to be sweet that had been set back so    chapter viii  the boss  to be vested with enormous authority is a fine thing but to have the onlooking world consent to it is a finer  the tower episode solidified my power and made it impregnable  if any were perchance disposed to be jealous and critical before that they experienced a change of heart now  there was not any one in the kingdom who would have considered it good judgment to meddle with my matters  i was fast getting adjusted to my situation and circumstances for a time i used to wake up mornings and smile at my dream and listen for the colts factory whistle but that sort of thing played itself out gradually and at last i was fully able to realize that i was actually living in the sixth century and in arthurs court not a lunatic asylum  after that i was just as much at home in that century as i could have been in any other and as for preference i wouldnt have traded it for the twentieth look at the opportunities here for a man of knowledge brains pluck and enterprise to sail in and grow up with the country the grandest field that ever was and all my own not a competitor not a man who wasnt a baby to me in acquirements and capacities whereas what would i amount to in the twentieth century  i should be foreman of a factory that is about all and could drag a seine down street any day and catch a hundred better men than myself  what a jump i had made  i couldnt keep from thinking about it and contemplating it just as one does who has struck oil  there was nothing back of me that could approach it unless it might be josephs case and josephs only approached it it didnt equal it quite  for it stands to reason that as josephs splendid financial ingenuities advantaged nobody but the king the general public must have regarded him with a good deal of disfavor whereas i had done my entire public a kindness in sparing the sun and was popular by reason of it  i was no shadow of a king i was the substance the king himself was the shadow  my power was colossal and it was not a mere name as such things have generally been it was the genuine article  i stood here at the very spring and source of the second great period of the worlds history and could see the trickling stream of that history gather and deepen and broaden and roll its mighty tides down the far centuries and i could note the upspringing of adventurers like myself in the shelter of its long array of thrones de montforts gavestons mortimers villierses the warmaking campaigndirecting wantons of france and charles the seconds scepterwielding drabs but nowhere in the procession was my fullsized fellow visible  i was a unique and glad to know that that fact could not be dislodged or challenged for thirteen centuries and a half for sure  yes in power i was equal to the king  at the same time there was another power that was a trifle stronger than both of us put together  that was the church i do not wish to disguise that fact  i couldnt if i wanted to but never mind about that now it will show up in its proper place later on  it didnt cause me any trouble in the beginning at least any of consequence  well it was a curious country and full of interest  and the people  they were the quaintest and simplest and trustingest race why they were nothing but rabbits  it was pitiful for a person born in a wholesome free atmosphere to listen to their humble and hearty outpourings of loyalty toward their king and church and nobility as if they had any more occasion to love and honor king and church and noble than a slave has to love and honor the lash or a dog has to love and honor the stranger that kicks him why dear me any kind of royalty howsoever modified any kind of aristocracy howsoever pruned is rightly an insult but if you are born and brought up under that sort of arrangement you probably never find it out for yourself and dont believe it when somebody else tells you  it is enough to make a body ashamed of his race to think of the sort of froth that has always occupied its thrones without shadow of right or reason and the seventhrate people that have always figured as its aristocraciesa company of monarchs and nobles who as a rule would have achieved only poverty and obscurity if left like their betters to their own exertions  the most of king arthurs british nation were slaves pure and simple and bore that name and wore the iron collar on their necks and the rest were slaves in fact but without the name they imagined themselves men and freemen and called themselves so  the truth was the nation as a body was in the world for one object and one only to grovel before king and church and noble to slave for them sweat blood for them starve that they might be fed work that they might play drink misery to the dregs that they might be happy go naked that they might wear silks and jewels pay taxes that they might be spared from paying them be familiar all their lives with the degrading language and postures of adulation that they might walk in pride and think themselves the gods of this world  and for all this the thanks they got were cuffs and contempt and so poorspirited were they that they took even this sort of attention as an honor  inherited ideas are a curious thing and interesting to observe and examine  i had mine the king and his people had theirs in both cases they flowed in ruts worn deep by time and habit and the man who should have proposed to divert them by reason and argument would have had a long contract on his hands  for instance those people had inherited the idea that all men without title and a long pedigree whether they had great natural gifts and acquirements or hadnt were creatures of no more consideration than so many animals bugs insects whereas i had inherited the idea that human daws who can consent to masquerade in the peacockshams of inherited dignities and unearned titles are of no good but to be laughed at  the way i was looked upon was odd but it was natural  you know how the keeper and the public regard the elephant in the menagerie well that is the idea  they are full of admiration of his vast bulk and his prodigious strength they speak with pride of the fact that he can do a hundred marvels which are far and away beyond their own powers and they speak with the same pride of the fact that in his wrath he is able to drive a thousand men before him  but does that make him one of them  no the raggedest tramp in the pit would smile at the idea  he couldnt comprehend it couldnt take it in couldnt in any remote way conceive of it  well to the king the nobles and all the nation down to the very slaves and tramps i was just that kind of an elephant and nothing more  i was admired also feared but it was as an animal is admired and feared the animal is not reverenced neither was i i was not even respected  i had no pedigree no inherited title so in the kings and nobles eyes i was mere dirt the people regarded me with wonder and awe but there was no reverence mixed with it through the force of inherited ideas they were not able to conceive of anything being entitled to that except pedigree and lordship there you see the hand of that awful power the roman catholic church  in two or three little centuries it had converted a nation of men to a nation of worms  before the day of the churchs supremacy in the world men were men and held their heads up and had a mans pride and spirit and independence and what of greatness and position a person got he got mainly by achievement not by birth  but then the church came to the front with an axe to grind and she was wise subtle and knew more than one way to skin a cator a nation she invented divine right of kings and propped it all around brick by brick with the beatitudes wrenching them from their good purpose to make them fortify an evil one she preached to the commoner humility obedience to superiors the beauty of selfsacrifice she preached to the commoner meekness under insult preached still to the commoner always to the commoner patience meanness of spirit nonresistance under oppression and she introduced heritable ranks and aristocracies and taught all the christian populations of the earth to bow down to them and worship them  even down to my birthcentury that poison was still in the blood of christendom and the best of english commoners was still content to see his inferiors impudently continuing to hold a number of positions such as lordships and the throne to which the grotesque laws of his country did not allow him to aspire in fact he was not merely contented with this strange condition of things he was even able to persuade himself that he was proud of it  it seems to show that there isnt anything you cant stand if you are only born and bred to it of course that taint that reverence for rank and title had been in our american blood tooi know that but when i left america it had disappearedat least to all intents and purposes  the remnant of it was restricted to the dudes and dudesses  when a disease has worked its way down to that level it may fairly be said to be out of the system  but to return to my anomalous position in king arthurs kingdom here i was a giant among pigmies a man among children a master intelligence among intellectual moles by all rational measurement the one and only actually great man in that whole british world and yet there and then just as in the remote england of my birthtime the sheepwitted earl who could claim long descent from a kings leman acquired at secondhand from the slums of london was a better man than i was  such a personage was fawned upon in arthurs realm and reverently looked up to by everybody even though his dispositions were as mean as his intelligence and his morals as base as his lineage  there were times when he could sit down in the kings presence but i couldnt  i could have got a title easily enough and that would have raised me a large step in everybodys eyes even in the kings the giver of it  but i didnt ask for it and i declined it when it was offered  i couldnt have enjoyed such a thing with my notions and it wouldnt have been fair anyway because as far back as i could go our tribe had always been short of the bar sinister i couldnt have felt really and satisfactorily fine and proud and setup over any title except one that should come from the nation itself the only legitimate source and such an one i hoped to win and in the course of years of honest and honorable endeavor i did win it and did wear it with a high and clean pride  this title fell casually from the lips of a blacksmith one day in a village was caught up as a happy thought and tossed from mouth to mouth with a laugh and an affirmative vote in ten days it had swept the kingdom and was become as familiar as the kings name  i was never known by any other designation afterward whether in the nations talk or in grave debate upon matters of state at the councilboard of the sovereign  this title translated into modern speech would be the boss  elected by the nation  that suited me and it was a pretty high title  there were very few thes and i was one of them  if you spoke of the duke or the earl or the bishop how could anybody tell which one you meant  but if you spoke of the king or the queen or the boss it was different  well i liked the king and as king i respected himrespected the office at least respected it as much as i was capable of respecting any unearned supremacy but as men i looked down upon him and his noblesprivately  and he and they liked me and respected my office but as an animal without birth or sham title they looked down upon meand were not particularly private about it either  i didnt charge for my opinion about them and they didnt charge for their opinion about me the account was square the books balanced everybody was satisfied    chapter ix  the tournament  they were always having grand tournaments there at camelot and very stirring and picturesque and ridiculous human bullfights they were too but just a little wearisome to the practical mind however i was generally on handfor two reasons a man must not hold himself aloof from the things which his friends and his community have at heart if he would be likedespecially as a statesman and both as business man and statesman i wanted to study the tournament and see if i couldnt invent an improvement on it  that reminds me to remark in passing that the very first official thing i did in my administrationand it was on the very first day of it toowas to start a patent office for i knew that a country without a patent office and good patent laws was just a crab and couldnt travel any way but sideways or backways  things ran along a tournament nearly every week and now and then the boys used to want me to take a handi mean sir launcelot and the restbut i said i would by and by no hurry yet and too much government machinery to oil up and set to rights and start agoing  we had one tournament which was continued from day to day during more than a week and as many as five hundred knights took part in it from first to last  they were weeks gathering  they came on horseback from everywhere from the very ends of the country and even from beyond the sea and many brought ladies and all brought squires and troops of servants  it was a most gaudy and gorgeous crowd as to costumery and very characteristic of the country and the time in the way of high animal spirits innocent indecencies of language and happyhearted indifference to morals it was fight or look on all day and every day and sing gamble dance carouse half the night every night  they had a most noble good time  you never saw such people  those banks of beautiful ladies shining in their barbaric splendors would see a knight sprawl from his horse in the lists with a lanceshaft the thickness of your ankle clean through him and the blood spouting and instead of fainting they would clap their hands and crowd each other for a better view only sometimes one would dive into her handkerchief and look ostentatiously brokenhearted and then you could lay two to one that there was a scandal there somewhere and she was afraid the public hadnt found it out  the noise at night would have been annoying to me ordinarily but i didnt mind it in the present circumstances because it kept me from hearing the quacks detaching legs and arms from the days cripples  they ruined an uncommon good old crosscut saw for me and broke the sawbuck too but i let it pass  and as for my axewell i made up my mind that the next time i lent an axe to a surgeon i would pick my century  i not only watched this tournament from day to day but detailed an intelligent priest from my department of public morals and agriculture and ordered him to report it for it was my purpose by and by when i should have gotten the people along far enough to start a newspaper  the first thing you want in a new country is a patent office then work up your school system and after that out with your paper  a newspaper has its faults and plenty of them but no matter its hark from the tomb for a dead nation and dont you forget it  you cant resurrect a dead nation without it there isnt any way  so i wanted to sample things and be finding out what sort of reportermaterial i might be able to rake together out of the sixth century when i should come to need it  well the priest did very well considering  he got in all the details and that is a good thing in a local item you see he had kept books for the undertakerdepartment of his church when he was younger and there you know the moneys in the details the more details the more swag bearers mutes candles prayers everything counts and if the bereaved dont buy prayers enough you mark up your candles with a forked pencil and your bill shows up all right  and he had a good knack at getting in the complimentary thing here and there about a knight that was likely to advertiseno i mean a knight that had influence and he also had a neat gift of exaggeration for in his time he had kept door for a pious hermit who lived in a sty and worked miracles  of course this novices report lacked whoop and crash and lurid description and therefore wanted the true ring but its antique wording was quaint and sweet and simple and full of the fragrances and flavors of the time and these little merits made up in a measure for its more important lacks  here is an extract from it    then sir brian de les isles and grummore grummorsum   knights of the castle encountered with sir aglovale and   sir tor and sir tor smote down sir grummore grummorsum   to the earth  then came sir carados of the dolorous   tower and sir turquine knights of the castle and   there encountered with them sir percivale de galis   and sir lamorak de galis that were two brethren and   there encountered sir percivale with sir carados and   either brake their spears unto their hands and then   sir turquine with sir lamorak and either of them smote   down other horse and all to the earth and either   parties rescued other and horsed them again  and sir   arnold and sir gauter knights of the castle   encountered with sir brandiles and sir kay and these   four knights encountered mightily and brake their   spears to their hands  then came sir pertolope from   the castle and there encountered with him sir lionel   and there sir pertolope the green knight smote down sir   lionel brother to sir launcelot  all this was marked   by noble heralds who bare him best and their names   then sir bleobaris brake his spear upon sir gareth   but of that stroke sir bleobaris fell to the earth   when sir galihodin saw that he bad sir gareth keep him   and sir gareth smote him to the earth  then sir galihud   gat a spear to avenge his brother and in the same wise   sir gareth served him and sir dinadan and his brother   la cote male taile and sir sagramore le disirous and   sir dodinas le savage all these he bare down with one   spear  when king aswisance of ireland saw sir gareth   fare so he marvelled what he might be that one time   seemed green and another time at his again coming   he seemed blue  and thus at every course that he rode   to and fro he changed his color so that there might   neither king nor knight have ready cognizance of him   then sir agwisance the king of ireland encountered   with sir gareth and there sir gareth smote him from   his horse saddle and all  and then came king carados   of scotland and sir gareth smote him down horse and   man  and in the same wise he served king uriens of the   land of gore  and then there came in sir bagdemagus   and sir gareth smote him down horse and man to the   earth  and bagdemaguss son meliganus brake a spear   upon sir gareth mightily and knightly  and then sir   galahault the noble prince cried on high knight with   the many colors well hast thou justed now make thee   ready that i may just with thee  sir gareth heard him   and he gat a great spear and so they encountered   together and there the prince brake his spear but sir   gareth smote him upon the left side of the helm that   he reeled here and there and he had fallen down had not   his men recovered him  truly said king arthur that   knight with the many colors is a good knight  wherefore   the king called unto him sir launcelot and prayed him   to encounter with that knight  sir said launcelot i   may as well find in my heart for to forbear him at   this time for he hath had travail enough this day and   when a good knight doth so well upon some day it is   no good knights part to let him of his worship and   namely when he seeth a knight hath done so great   labour for peradventure said sir launcelot his   quarrel is here this day and peradventure he is best   beloved with this lady of all that be here for i see   well he paineth himself and enforceth him to do great   deeds and therefore said sir launcelot as for me   this day he shall have the honour though it lay in my   power to put him from it i would not  there was an unpleasant little episode that day which for reasons of state i struck out of my priests report  you will have noticed that garry was doing some great fighting in the engagement  when i say garry i mean sir gareth  garry was my private pet name for him it suggests that i had a deep affection for him and that was the case  but it was a private pet name only and never spoken aloud to any one much less to him being a noble he would not have endured a familiarity like that from me  well to proceed i sat in the private box set apart for me as the kings minister while sir dinadan was waiting for his turn to enter the lists he came in there and sat down and began to talk for he was always making up to me because i was a stranger and he liked to have a fresh market for his jokes the most of them having reached that stage of wear where the teller has to do the laughing himself while the other person looks sick  i had always responded to his efforts as well as i could and felt a very deep and real kindness for him too for the reason that if by malice of fate he knew the one particular anecdote which i had heard oftenest and had most hated and most loathed all my life he had at least spared it me  it was one which i had heard attributed to every humorous person who had ever stood on american soil from columbus down to artemus ward it was about a humorous lecturer who flooded an ignorant audience with the killingest jokes for an hour and never got a laugh and then when he was leaving some gray simpletons wrung him gratefully by the hand and said it had been the funniest thing they had ever heard and it was all they could do to keep from laughin right out in meetin  that anecdote never saw the day that it was worth the telling and yet i had sat under the telling of it hundreds and thousands and millions and billions of times and cried and cursed all the way through  then who can hope to know what my feelings were to hear this armorplated ass start in on it again in the murky twilight of tradition before the dawn of history while even lactantius might be referred to as the late lactantius and the crusades wouldnt be born for five hundred years yet  just as he finished the callboy came so hawhawing like a demon he went rattling and clanking out like a crate of loose castings and i knew nothing more  it was some minutes before i came to and then i opened my eyes just in time to see sir gareth fetch him an awful welt and i unconsciously out with the prayer i hope to gracious hes killed  but by illluck before i had got half through with the words sir gareth crashed into sir sagramor le desirous and sent him thundering over his horses crupper and sir sagramor caught my remark and thought i meant it for him  well whenever one of those people got a thing into his head there was no getting it out again  i knew that so i saved my breath and offered no explanations  as soon as sir sagramor got well he notified me that there was a little account to settle between us and he named a day three or four years in the future place of settlement the lists where the offense had been given i said i would be ready when he got back  you see he was going for the holy grail  the boys all took a flier at the holy grail now and then  it was a several years cruise  they always put in the long absence snooping around in the most conscientious way though none of them had any idea where the holy grail really was and i dont think any of them actually expected to find it or would have known what to do with it if he had run across it you see it was just the northwest passage of that day as you may say that was all  every year expeditions went out holy grailing and next year relief expeditions went out to hunt for them  there was worlds of reputation in it but no money  why they actually wanted me to put in  well i should smile    chapter x  beginnings of civilization  the round table soon heard of the challenge and of course it was a good deal discussed for such things interested the boys the king thought i ought now to set forth in quest of adventures so that i might gain renown and be the more worthy to meet sir sagramor when the several years should have rolled away i excused myself for the present i said it would take me three or four years yet to get things well fixed up and going smoothly then i should be ready all the chances were that at the end of that time sir sagramor would still be out grailing so no valuable time would be lost by the postponement i should then have been in office six or seven years and i believed my system and machinery would be so well developed that i could take a holiday without its working any harm  i was pretty well satisfied with what i had already accomplished in various quiet nooks and corners i had the beginnings of all sorts of industries under waynuclei of future vast factories the iron and steel missionaries of my future civilization  in these were gathered together the brightest young minds i could find and i kept agents out raking the country for more all the time i was training a crowd of ignorant folk into expertsexperts in every sort of handiwork and scientific calling  these nurseries of mine went smoothly and privately along undisturbed in their obscure country retreats for nobody was allowed to come into their precincts without a special permitfor i was afraid of the church  i had started a teacherfactory and a lot of sundayschools the first thing as a result i now had an admirable system of graded schools in full blast in those places and also a complete variety of protestant congregations all in a prosperous and growing condition  everybody could be any kind of a christian he wanted to there was perfect freedom in that matter  but i confined public religious teaching to the churches and the sundayschools permitting nothing of it in my other educational buildings  i could have given my own sect the preference and made everybody a presbyterian without any trouble but that would have been to affront a law of human nature spiritual wants and instincts are as various in the human family as are physical appetites complexions and features and a man is only at his best morally when he is equipped with the religious garment whose color and shape and size most nicely accommodate themselves to the spiritual complexion angularities and stature of the individual who wears it and besides i was afraid of a united church it makes a mighty power the mightiest conceivable and then when it by and by gets into selfish hands as it is always bound to do it means death to human liberty and paralysis to human thought  all mines were royal property and there were a good many of them they had formerly been worked as savages always work minesholes grubbed in the earth and the mineral brought up in sacks of hide by hand at the rate of a ton a day but i had begun to put the mining on a scientific basis as early as i could  yes i had made pretty handsome progress when sir sagramors challenge struck me  four years rolled byand then  well you would never imagine it in the world  unlimited power is the ideal thing when it is in safe hands  the despotism of heaven is the one absolutely perfect government  an earthly despotism would be the absolutely perfect earthly government if the conditions were the same namely the despot the perfectest individual of the human race and his lease of life perpetual  but as a perishable perfect man must die and leave his despotism in the hands of an imperfect successor an earthly despotism is not merely a bad form of government it is the worst form that is possible  my works showed what a despot could do with the resources of a kingdom at his command  unsuspected by this dark land i had the civilization of the nineteenth century booming under its very nose  it was fenced away from the public view but there it was a gigantic and unassailable factand to be heard from yet if i lived and had luck  there it was as sure a fact and as substantial a fact as any serene volcano standing innocent with its smokeless summit in the blue sky and giving no sign of the rising hell in its bowels  my schools and churches were children four years before they were grownup now my shops of that day were vast factories now where i had a dozen trained men then i had a thousand now where i had one brilliant expert then i had fifty now  i stood with my hand on the cock so to speak ready to turn it on and flood the midnight world with light at any moment  but i was not going to do the thing in that sudden way  it was not my policy the people could not have stood it and moreover i should have had the established roman catholic church on my back in a minute  no i had been going cautiously all the while  i had had confidential agents trickling through the country some time whose office was to undermine knighthood by imperceptible degrees and to gnaw a little at this and that and the other superstition and so prepare the way gradually for a better order of things  i was turning on my light onecandlepower at a time and meant to continue to do so  i had scattered some branch schools secretly about the kingdom and they were doing very well  i meant to work this racket more and more as time wore on if nothing occurred to frighten me one of my deepest secrets was my west pointmy military academy i kept that most jealously out of sight and i did the same with my naval academy which i had established at a remote seaport  both were prospering to my satisfaction  clarence was twentytwo now and was my head executive my right hand  he was a darling he was equal to anything there wasnt anything he couldnt turn his hand to  of late i had been training him for journalism for the time seemed about right for a start in the newspaper line nothing big but just a small weekly for experimental circulation in my civilizationnurseries  he took to it like a duck there was an editor concealed in him sure already he had doubled himself in one way he talked sixth century and wrote nineteenth  his journalistic style was climbing steadily it was already up to the back settlement alabama mark and couldnt be told from the editorial output of that region either by matter or flavor  we had another large departure on hand too  this was a telegraph and a telephone our first venture in this line  these wires were for private service only as yet and must be kept private until a riper day should come  we had a gang of men on the road working mainly by night  they were stringing ground wires we were afraid to put up poles for they would attract too much inquiry  ground wires were good enough in both instances for my wires were protected by an insulation of my own invention which was perfect my men had orders to strike across country avoiding roads and establishing connection with any considerable towns whose lights betrayed their presence and leaving experts in charge nobody could tell you how to find any place in the kingdom for nobody ever went intentionally to any place but only struck it by accident in his wanderings and then generally left it without thinking to inquire what its name was  at one time and another we had sent out topographical expeditions to survey and map the kingdom but the priests had always interfered and raised trouble so we had given the thing up for the present it would be poor wisdom to antagonize the church  as for the general condition of the country it was as it had been when i arrived in it to all intents and purposes  i had made changes but they were necessarily slight and they were not noticeable  thus far i had not even meddled with taxation outside of the taxes which provided the royal revenues  i had systematized those and put the service on an effective and righteous basis  as a result these revenues were already quadrupled and yet the burden was so much more equably distributed than before that all the kingdom felt a sense of relief and the praises of my administration were hearty and general  personally i struck an interruption now but i did not mind it it could not have happened at a better time  earlier it could have annoyed me but now everything was in good hands and swimming right along  the king had reminded me several times of late that the postponement i had asked for four years before had about run out now  it was a hint that i ought to be starting out to seek adventures and get up a reputation of a size to make me worthy of the honor of breaking a lance with sir sagramor who was still out grailing but was being hunted for by various relief expeditions and might be found any year now  so you see i was expecting this interruption it did not take me by surprise    chapter xi  the yankee in search of adventures  there never was such a country for wandering liars and they were of both sexes  hardly a month went by without one of these tramps arriving and generally loaded with a tale about some princess or other wanting help to get her out of some faraway castle where she was held in captivity by a lawless scoundrel usually a giant now you would think that the first thing the king would do after listening to such a novelette from an entire stranger would be to ask for credentialsyes and a pointer or two as to locality of castle best route to it and so on  but nobody ever thought of so simple and commonsense a thing at that  no everybody swallowed these peoples lies whole and never asked a question of any sort or about anything  well one day when i was not around one of these people came alongit was a she one this timeand told a tale of the usual pattern  her mistress was a captive in a vast and gloomy castle along with fortyfour other young and beautiful girls pretty much all of them princesses they had been languishing in that cruel captivity for twentysix years the masters of the castle were three stupendous brothers each with four arms and one eyethe eye in the center of the forehead and as big as a fruit  sort of fruit not mentioned their usual slovenliness in statistics  would you believe it  the king and the whole round table were in raptures over this preposterous opportunity for adventure every knight of the table jumped for the chance and begged for it but to their vexation and chagrin the king conferred it upon me who had not asked for it at all  by an effort i contained my joy when clarence brought me the news but hehe could not contain his  his mouth gushed delight and gratitude in a steady dischargedelight in my good fortune gratitude to the king for this splendid mark of his favor for me he could keep neither his legs nor his body still but pirouetted about the place in an airy ecstasy of happiness  on my side i could have cursed the kindness that conferred upon me this benefaction but i kept my vexation under the surface for policys sake and did what i could to let on to be glad indeed i said i was glad  and in a way it was true i was as glad as a person is when he is scalped  well one must make the best of things and not waste time with useless fretting but get down to business and see what can be done  in all lies there is wheat among the chaff i must get at the wheat in this case so i sent for the girl and she came  she was a comely enough creature and soft and modest but if signs went for anything she didnt know as much as a ladys watch  i said  my dear have you been questioned as to particulars  she said she hadnt  well i didnt expect you had but i thought i would ask to make sure its the way ive been raised  now you mustnt take it unkindly if i remind you that as we dont know you we must go a little slow  you may be all right of course and well hope that you are but to take it for granted isnt business  you understand that  im obliged to ask you a few questions just answer up fair and square and dont be afraid  where do you live when you are at home  in the land of moder fair sir  land of moder  i dont remember hearing of it before parents living  as to that i know not if they be yet on live sith it is many years that i have lain shut up in the castle  your name please  i hight the demoiselle alisande la carteloise an it please you  do you know anybody here who can identify you  that were not likely fair lord i being come hither now for the first time  have you brought any lettersany documentsany proofs that you are trustworthy and truthful  of a surety no and wherefore should i  have i not a tongue and cannot i say all that myself  but your saying it you know and somebody elses saying it is different  different  how might that be  i fear me i do not understand  dont understand  land ofwhy you seeyou seewhy great scott cant you understand a little thing like that  cant you understand the difference between yourwhy do you look so innocent and idiotic  i  in truth i know not but an it were the will of god  yes yes i reckon thats about the size of it  dont mind my seeming excited im not  let us change the subject  now as to this castle with fortyfive princesses in it and three ogres at the head of it tell mewhere is this harem  harem  the castle you understand where is the castle  oh as to that it is great and strong and well beseen and lieth in a far country  yes it is many leagues  how many  ah fair sir it were woundily hard to tell they are so many and do so lap the one upon the other and being made all in the same image and tincted with the same color one may not know the one league from its fellow nor how to count them except they be taken apart and ye wit well it were gods work to do that being not within mans capacity for ye will note  hold on hold on never mind about the distance whereabouts does the castle lie  whats the direction from here  ah please you sir it hath no direction from here by reason that the road lieth not straight but turneth evermore wherefore the direction of its place abideth not but is some time under the one sky and anon under another whereso if ye be minded that it is in the east and wend thitherward ye shall observe that the way of the road doth yet again turn upon itself by the space of half a circle and this marvel happing again and yet again and still again it will grieve you that you had thought by vanities of the mind to thwart and bring to naught the will of him that giveth not a castle a direction from a place except it pleaseth him and if it please him not will the rather that even all castles and all directions thereunto vanish out of the earth leaving the places wherein they tarried desolate and vacant so warning his creatures that where he will he will and where he will not he  oh thats all right thats all right give us a rest never mind about the direction hang the directioni beg pardon i beg a thousand pardons i am not well today pay no attention when i soliloquize it is an old habit an old bad habit and hard to get rid of when ones digestion is all disordered with eating food that was raised forever and ever before he was born good land a man cant keep his functions regular on spring chickens thirteen hundred years old  but comenever mind about that letshave you got such a thing as a map of that region about you  now a good map  is it peradventure that manner of thing which of late the unbelievers have brought from over the great seas which being boiled in oil and an onion and salt added thereto doth  what a map  what are you talking about  dont you know what a map is  there there never mind dont explain i hate explanations they fog a thing up so that you cant tell anything about it  run along dear goodday show her the way clarence  oh well it was reasonably plain now why these donkeys didnt prospect these liars for details  it may be that this girl had a fact in her somewhere but i dont believe you could have sluiced it out with a hydraulic nor got it with the earlier forms of blasting even it was a case for dynamite  why she was a perfect ass and yet the king and his knights had listened to her as if she had been a leaf out of the gospel  it kind of sizes up the whole party  and think of the simple ways of this court this wandering wench hadnt any more trouble to get access to the king in his palace than she would have had to get into the poorhouse in my day and country  in fact he was glad to see her glad to hear her tale with that adventure of hers to offer she was as welcome as a corpse is to a coroner  just as i was endingup these reflections clarence came back i remarked upon the barren result of my efforts with the girl hadnt got hold of a single point that could help me to find the castle  the youth looked a little surprised or puzzled or something and intimated that he had been wondering to himself what i had wanted to ask the girl all those questions for  why great guns i said dont i want to find the castle  and how else would i go about it  la sweet your worship one may lightly answer that i ween she will go with thee  they always do  she will ride with thee  ride with me  nonsense  but of a truth she will  she will ride with thee  thou shalt see  what  she browse around the hills and scour the woods with me aloneand i as good as engaged to be married  why its scandalous think how it would look  my the dear face that rose before me  the boy was eager to know all about this tender matter  i swore him to secrecy and then whispered her namepuss flanagan  he looked disappointed and said he didnt remember the countess  how natural it was for the little courtier to give her a rank  he asked me where she lived  in east har i came to myself and stopped a little confused then i said never mind now ill tell you some time  and might he see her  would i let him see her some day  it was but a little thing to promisethirteen hundred years or soand he so eager so i said yes  but i sighed i couldnt help it  and yet there was no sense in sighing for she wasnt born yet  but that is the way we are made we dont reason where we feel we just feel  my expedition was all the talk that day and that night and the boys were very good to me and made much of me and seemed to have forgotten their vexation and disappointment and come to be as anxious for me to hive those ogres and set those ripe old virgins loose as if it were themselves that had the contract  well they were good childrenbut just children that is all  and they gave me no end of points about how to scout for giants and how to scoop them in and they told me all sorts of charms against enchantments and gave me salves and other rubbish to put on my wounds  but it never occurred to one of them to reflect that if i was such a wonderful necromancer as i was pretending to be i ought not to need salves or instructions or charms against enchantments and least of all arms and armor on a foray of any kindeven against firespouting dragons and devils hot from perdition let alone such poor adversaries as these i was after these commonplace ogres of the back settlements  i was to have an early breakfast and start at dawn for that was the usual way but i had the demons own time with my armor and this delayed me a little  it is troublesome to get into and there is so much detail  first you wrap a layer or two of blanket around your body for a sort of cushion and to keep off the cold iron then you put on your sleeves and shirt of chain mailthese are made of small steel links woven together and they form a fabric so flexible that if you toss your shirt onto the floor it slumps into a pile like a peck of wet fishnet it is very heavy and is nearly the uncomfortablest material in the world for a night shirt yet plenty used it for thattax collectors and reformers and onehorse kings with a defective title and those sorts of people then you put on your shoesflatboats roofed over with interleaving bands of steeland screw your clumsy spurs into the heels  next you buckle your greaves on your legs and your cuisses on your thighs then come your backplate and your breastplate and you begin to feel crowded then you hitch onto the breastplate the halfpetticoat of broad overlapping bands of steel which hangs down in front but is scolloped out behind so you can sit down and isnt any real improvement on an inverted coal scuttle either for looks or for wear or to wipe your hands on next you belt on your sword then you put your stovepipe joints onto your arms your iron gauntlets onto your hands your iron rattrap onto your head with a rag of steel web hitched onto it to hang over the back of your neckand there you are snug as a candle in a candlemould this is no time to dance  well a man that is packed away like that is a nut that isnt worth the cracking there is so little of the meat when you get down to it by comparison with the shell  the boys helped me or i never could have got in  just as we finished sir bedivere happened in and i saw that as like as not i hadnt chosen the most convenient outfit for a long trip  how stately he looked and tall and broad and grand  he had on his head a conical steel casque that only came down to his ears and for visor had only a narrow steel bar that extended down to his upper lip and protected his nose and all the rest of him from neck to heel was flexible chain mail trousers and all  but pretty much all of him was hidden under his outside garment which of course was of chain mail as i said and hung straight from his shoulders to his ankles and from his middle to the bottom both before and behind was divided so that he could ride and let the skirts hang down on each side  he was going grailing and it was just the outfit for it too  i would have given a good deal for that ulster but it was too late now to be fooling around  the sun was just up the king and the court were all on hand to see me off and wish me luck so it wouldnt be etiquette for me to tarry you dont get on your horse yourself no if you tried it you would get disappointed  they carry you out just as they carry a sunstruck man to the drug store and put you on and help get you to rights and fix your feet in the stirrups and all the while you do feel so strange and stuffy and like somebody elselike somebody that has been married on a sudden or struck by lightning or something like that and hasnt quite fetched around yet and is sort of numb and cant just get his bearings  then they stood up the mast they called a spear in its socket by my left foot and i gripped it with my hand lastly they hung my shield around my neck and i was all complete and ready to up anchor and get to sea  everybody was as good to me as they could be and a maid of honor gave me the stirrupcup her own self  there was nothing more to do now but for that damsel to get up behind me on a pillion which she did and put an arm or so around me to hold on  and so we started and everybody gave us a goodbye and waved their handkerchiefs or helmets  and everybody we met going down the hill and through the village was respectful to us except some shabby little boys on the outskirts  they said  oh what a guy  and hove clods at us  in my experience boys are the same in all ages  they dont respect anything they dont care for anything or anybody  they say go up baldhead to the prophet going his unoffending way in the gray of antiquity they sass me in the holy gloom of the middle ages and i had seen them act the same way in buchanans administration i remember because i was there and helped  the prophet had his bears and settled with his boys and i wanted to get down and settle with mine but it wouldnt answer because i couldnt have got up again  i hate a country without a derrick    chapter xii  slow torture  straight off we were in the country  it was most lovely and pleasant in those sylvan solitudes in the early cool morning in the first freshness of autumn  from hilltops we saw fair green valleys lying spread out below with streams winding through them and island groves of trees here and there and huge lonely oaks scattered about and casting black blots of shade and beyond the valleys we saw the ranges of hills blue with haze stretching away in billowy perspective to the horizon with at wide intervals a dim fleck of white or gray on a wavesummit which we knew was a castle  we crossed broad natural lawns sparkling with dew and we moved like spirits the cushioned turf giving out no sound of footfall we dreamed along through glades in a mist of green light that got its tint from the sundrenched roof of leaves overhead and by our feet the clearest and coldest of runlets went frisking and gossiping over its reefs and making a sort of whispering music comfortable to hear and at times we left the world behind and entered into the solemn great deeps and rich gloom of the forest where furtive wild things whisked and scurried by and were gone before you could even get your eye on the place where the noise was and where only the earliest birds were turning out and getting to business with a song here and a quarrel yonder and a mysterious faroff hammering and drumming for worms on a tree trunk away somewhere in the impenetrable remotenesses of the woods  and by and by out we would swing again into the glare  about the third or fourth or fifth time that we swung out into the glareit was along there somewhere a couple of hours or so after sunupit wasnt as pleasant as it had been  it was beginning to get hot  this was quite noticeable  we had a very long pull after that without any shade  now it is curious how progressively little frets grow and multiply after they once get a start  things which i didnt mind at all at first i began to mind nowand more and more too all the time  the first ten or fifteen times i wanted my handkerchief i didnt seem to care i got along and said never mind it isnt any matter and dropped it out of my mind  but now it was different i wanted it all the time it was nag nag nag right along and no rest i couldnt get it out of my mind and so at last i lost my temper and said hang a man that would make a suit of armor without any pockets in it  you see i had my handkerchief in my helmet and some other things but it was that kind of a helmet that you cant take off by yourself  that hadnt occurred to me when i put it there and in fact i didnt know it  i supposed it would be particularly convenient there  and so now the thought of its being there so handy and close by and yet not getatable made it all the worse and the harder to bear  yes the thing that you cant get is the thing that you want mainly every one has noticed that well it took my mind off from everything else took it clear off and centered it in my helmet and mile after mile there it stayed imagining the handkerchief picturing the handkerchief and it was bitter and aggravating to have the salt sweat keep trickling down into my eyes and i couldnt get at it  it seems like a little thing on paper but it was not a little thing at all it was the most real kind of misery  i would not say it if it was not so i made up my mind that i would carry along a reticule next time let it look how it might and people say what they would  of course these iron dudes of the round table would think it was scandalous and maybe raise sheol about it but as for me give me comfort first and style afterwards  so we jogged along and now and then we struck a stretch of dust and it would tumble up in clouds and get into my nose and make me sneeze and cry and of course i said things i oughtnt to have said i dont deny that  i am not better than others  we couldnt seem to meet anybody in this lonesome britain not even an ogre and in the mood i was in then it was well for the ogre that is an ogre with a handkerchief  most knights would have thought of nothing but getting his armor but so i got his bandanna he could keep his hardware for all of me  meantime it was getting hotter and hotter in there  you see the sun was beating down and warming up the iron more and more all the time  well when you are hot that way every little thing irritates you  when i trotted i rattled like a crate of dishes and that annoyed me and moreover i couldnt seem to stand that shield slatting and banging now about my breast now around my back and if i dropped into a walk my joints creaked and screeched in that wearisome way that a wheelbarrow does and as we didnt create any breeze at that gait i was like to get fried in that stove and besides the quieter you went the heavier the iron settled down on you and the more and more tons you seemed to weigh every minute  and you had to be always changing hands and passing your spear over to the other foot it got so irksome for one hand to hold it long at a time  well you know when you perspire that way in rivers there comes a time when youwhen youwell when you itch  you are inside your hands are outside so there you are nothing but iron between it is not a light thing let it sound as it may  first it is one place then another then some more and it goes on spreading and spreading and at last the territory is all occupied and nobody can imagine what you feel like nor how unpleasant it is  and when it had got to the worst and it seemed to me that i could not stand anything more a fly got in through the bars and settled on my nose and the bars were stuck and wouldnt work and i couldnt get the visor up and i could only shake my head which was baking hot by this time and the flywell you know how a fly acts when he has got a certaintyhe only minded the shaking enough to change from nose to lip and lip to ear and buzz and buzz all around in there and keep on lighting and biting in a way that a person already so distressed as i was simply could not stand  so i gave in and got alisande to unship the helmet and relieve me of it  then she emptied the conveniences out of it and fetched it full of water and i drank and then stood up and she poured the rest down inside the armor one cannot think how refreshing it was  she continued to fetch and pour until i was well soaked and thoroughly comfortable  it was good to have a restand peace  but nothing is quite perfect in this life at any time  i had made a pipe a while back and also some pretty fair tobacco not the real thing but what some of the indians use the inside bark of the willow dried these comforts had been in the helmet and now i had them again but no matches  gradually as the time wore along one annoying fact was borne in upon my understandingthat we were weatherbound  an armed novice cannot mount his horse without help and plenty of it  sandy was not enough not enough for me anyway  we had to wait until somebody should come along  waiting in silence would have been agreeable enough for i was full of matter for reflection and wanted to give it a chance to work  i wanted to try and think out how it was that rational or even halfrational men could ever have learned to wear armor considering its inconveniences and how they had managed to keep up such a fashion for generations when it was plain that what i had suffered today they had had to suffer all the days of their lives  i wanted to think that out and moreover i wanted to think out some way to reform this evil and persuade the people to let the foolish fashion die out but thinking was out of the question in the circumstances  you couldnt think where sandy was  she was a quite biddable creature and goodhearted but she had a flow of talk that was as steady as a mill and made your head sore like the drays and wagons in a city  if she had had a cork she would have been a comfort  but you cant cork that kind they would die  her clack was going all day and you would think something would surely happen to her works by and by but no they never got out of order and she never had to slack up for words  she could grind and pump and churn and buzz by the week and never stop to oil up or blow out  and yet the result was just nothing but wind  she never had any ideas any more than a fog has  she was a perfect blatherskite i mean for jaw jaw jaw talk talk talk jabber jabber jabber but just as good as she could be  i hadnt minded her mill that morning on account of having that hornets nest of other troubles but more than once in the afternoon i had to say  take a rest child the way you are using up all the domestic air the kingdom will have to go to importing it by tomorrow and its a low enough treasury without that    chapter xiii  freemen  yes it is strange how little a while at a time a person can be contented  only a little while back when i was riding and suffering what a heaven this peace this rest this sweet serenity in this secluded shady nook by this purling stream would have seemed where i could keep perfectly comfortable all the time by pouring a dipper of water into my armor now and then yet already i was getting dissatisfied partly because i could not light my pipefor although i had long ago started a match factory i had forgotten to bring matches with meand partly because we had nothing to eat  here was another illustration of the childlike improvidence of this age and people  a man in armor always trusted to chance for his food on a journey and would have been scandalized at the idea of hanging a basket of sandwiches on his spear  there was probably not a knight of all the round table combination who would not rather have died than been caught carrying such a thing as that on his flagstaff  and yet there could not be anything more sensible  it had been my intention to smuggle a couple of sandwiches into my helmet but i was interrupted in the act and had to make an excuse and lay them aside and a dog got them  night approached and with it a storm  the darkness came on fast we must camp of course  i found a good shelter for the demoiselle under a rock and went off and found another for myself  but i was obliged to remain in my armor because i could not get it off by myself and yet could not allow alisande to help because it would have seemed so like undressing before folk  it would not have amounted to that in reality because i had clothes on underneath but the prejudices of ones breeding are not gotten rid of just at a jump and i knew that when it came to stripping off that bobtailed iron petticoat i should be embarrassed  with the storm came a change of weather and the stronger the wind blew and the wilder the rain lashed around the colder and colder it got  pretty soon various kinds of bugs and ants and worms and things began to flock in out of the wet and crawl down inside my armor to get warm and while some of them behaved well enough and snuggled up amongst my clothes and got quiet the majority were of a restless uncomfortable sort and never stayed still but went on prowling and hunting for they did not know what especially the ants which went tickling along in wearisome procession from one end of me to the other by the hour and are a kind of creatures which i never wish to sleep with again it would be my advice to persons situated in this way to not roll or thrash around because this excites the interest of all the different sorts of animals and makes every last one of them want to turn out and see what is going on and this makes things worse than they were before and of course makes you objurgate harder too if you can  still if one did not roll and thrash around he would die so perhaps it is as well to do one way as the other there is no real choice  even after i was frozen solid i could still distinguish that tickling just as a corpse does when he is taking electric treatment  i said i would never wear armor after this trip  all those trying hours whilst i was frozen and yet was in a living fire as you may say on account of that swarm of crawlers that same unanswerable question kept circling and circling through my tired head how do people stand this miserable armor  how have they managed to stand it all these generations  how can they sleep at night for dreading the tortures of next day  when the morning came at last i was in a bad enough plight seedy drowsy fagged from want of sleep weary from thrashing around famished from long fasting pining for a bath and to get rid of the animals and crippled with rheumatism  and how had it fared with the nobly born the titled aristocrat the demoiselle alisande la carteloise  why she was as fresh as a squirrel she had slept like the dead and as for a bath probably neither she nor any other noble in the land had ever had one and so she was not missing it  measured by modern standards they were merely modified savages those people  this noble lady showed no impatience to get to breakfastand that smacks of the savage too  on their journeys those britons were used to long fasts and knew how to bear them and also how to freight up against probable fasts before starting after the style of the indian and the anaconda  as like as not sandy was loaded for a threeday stretch  we were off before sunrise sandy riding and i limping along behind  in half an hour we came upon a group of ragged poor creatures who had assembled to mend the thing which was regarded as a road  they were as humble as animals to me and when i proposed to breakfast with them they were so flattered so overwhelmed by this extraordinary condescension of mine that at first they were not able to believe that i was in earnest my lady put up her scornful lip and withdrew to one side she said in their hearing that she would as soon think of eating with the other cattlea remark which embarrassed these poor devils merely because it referred to them and not because it insulted or offended them for it didnt  and yet they were not slaves not chattels by a sarcasm of law and phrase they were freemen  seventenths of the free population of the country were of just their class and degree small independent farmers artisans etc which is to say they were the nation the actual nation they were about all of it that was useful or worth saving or really respectworthy and to subtract them would have been to subtract the nation and leave behind some dregs some refuse in the shape of a king nobility and gentry idle unproductive acquainted mainly with the arts of wasting and destroying and of no sort of use or value in any rationally constructed world  and yet by ingenious contrivance this gilded minority instead of being in the tail of the procession where it belonged was marching head up and banners flying at the other end of it had elected itself to be the nation and these innumerable clams had permitted it so long that they had come at last to accept it as a truth and not only that but to believe it right and as it should be  the priests had told their fathers and themselves that this ironical state of things was ordained of god and so not reflecting upon how unlike god it would be to amuse himself with sarcasms and especially such poor transparent ones as this they had dropped the matter there and become respectfully quiet  the talk of these meek people had a strange enough sound in a formerly american ear  they were freemen but they could not leave the estates of their lord or their bishop without his permission they could not prepare their own bread but must have their corn ground and their bread baked at his mill and his bakery and pay roundly for the same they could not sell a piece of their own property without paying him a handsome percentage of the proceeds nor buy a piece of somebody elses without remembering him in cash for the privilege they had to harvest his grain for him gratis and be ready to come at a moments notice leaving their own crop to destruction by the threatened storm they had to let him plant fruit trees in their fields and then keep their indignation to themselves when his heedless fruitgatherers trampled the grain around the trees they had to smother their anger when his hunting parties galloped through their fields laying waste the result of their patient toil they were not allowed to keep doves themselves and when the swarms from my lords dovecote settled on their crops they must not lose their temper and kill a bird for awful would the penalty be when the harvest was at last gathered then came the procession of robbers to levy their blackmail upon it first the church carted off its fat tenth then the kings commissioner took his twentieth then my lords people made a mighty inroad upon the remainder after which the skinned freeman had liberty to bestow the remnant in his barn in case it was worth the trouble there were taxes and taxes and taxes and more taxes and taxes again and yet other taxesupon this free and independent pauper but none upon his lord the baron or the bishop none upon the wasteful nobility or the alldevouring church if the baron would sleep unvexed the freeman must sit up all night after his days work and whip the ponds to keep the frogs quiet if the freemans daughterbut no that last infamy of monarchical government is unprintable and finally if the freeman grown desperate with his tortures found his life unendurable under such conditions and sacrificed it and fled to death for mercy and refuge the gentle church condemned him to eternal fire the gentle law buried him at midnight at the crossroads with a stake through his back and his master the baron or the bishop confiscated all his property and turned his widow and his orphans out of doors  and here were these freemen assembled in the early morning to work on their lord the bishops road three days eachgratis every head of a family and every son of a family three days each gratis and a day or so added for their servants  why it was like reading about france and the french before the ever memorable and blessed revolution which swept a thousand years of such villany away in one swift tidalwave of bloodone a settlement of that hoary debt in the proportion of half a drop of blood for each hogshead of it that had been pressed by slow tortures out of that people in the weary stretch of ten centuries of wrong and shame and misery the like of which was not to be mated but in hell there were two reigns of terror if we would but remember it and consider it the one wrought murder in hot passion the other in heartless cold blood the one lasted mere months the other had lasted a thousand years the one inflicted death upon ten thousand persons the other upon a hundred millions but our shudders are all for the horrors of the minor terror the momentary terror so to speak whereas what is the horror of swift death by the axe compared with lifelong death from hunger cold insult cruelty and heartbreak  what is swift death by lightning compared with death by slow fire at the stake  a city cemetery could contain the coffins filled by that brief terror which we have all been so diligently taught to shiver at and mourn over but all france could hardly contain the coffins filled by that older and real terror that unspeakably bitter and awful terror which none of us has been taught to see in its vastness or pity as it deserves  these poor ostensible freemen who were sharing their breakfast and their talk with me were as full of humble reverence for their king and church and nobility as their worst enemy could desire there was something pitifully ludicrous about it  i asked them if they supposed a nation of people ever existed who with a free vote in every mans hand would elect that a single family and its descendants should reign over it forever whether gifted or boobies to the exclusion of all other familiesincluding the voters and would also elect that a certain hundred families should be raised to dizzy summits of rank and clothed on with offensive transmissible glories and privileges to the exclusion of the rest of the nations familiesincluding his own  they all looked unhit and said they didnt know that they had never thought about it before and it hadnt ever occurred to them that a nation could be so situated that every man could have a say in the government  i said i had seen oneand that it would last until it had an established church  again they were all unhitat first  but presently one man looked up and asked me to state that proposition again and state it slowly so it could soak into his understanding  i did it and after a little he had the idea and he brought his fist down and said he didnt believe a nation where every man had a vote would voluntarily get down in the mud and dirt in any such way and that to steal from a nation its will and preference must be a crime and the first of all crimes i said to myself  this ones a man  if i were backed by enough of his sort i would make a strike for the welfare of this country and try to prove myself its loyalest citizen by making a wholesome change in its system of government  you see my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders  the country is the real thing the substantial thing the eternal thing it is the thing to watch over and care for and be loyal to institutions are extraneous they are its mere clothing and clothing can wear out become ragged cease to be comfortable cease to protect the body from winter disease and death  to be loyal to rags to shout for rags to worship rags to die for ragsthat is a loyalty of unreason it is pure animal it belongs to monarchy was invented by monarchy let monarchy keep it  i was from connecticut whose constitution declares that all political power is inherent in the people and all free governments are founded on their authority and instituted for their benefit and that they have at all times an undeniable and indefeasible right to alter their form of government in such a manner as they may think expedient  under that gospel the citizen who thinks he sees that the commonwealths political clothes are worn out and yet holds his peace and does not agitate for a new suit is disloyal he is a traitor  that he may be the only one who thinks he sees this decay does not excuse him it is his duty to agitate anyway and it is the duty of the others to vote him down if they do not see the matter as he does  and now here i was in a country where a right to say how the country should be governed was restricted to six persons in each thousand of its population  for the nine hundred and ninetyfour to express dissatisfaction with the regnant system and propose to change it would have made the whole six shudder as one man it would have been so disloyal so dishonorable such putrid black treason  so to speak i was become a stockholder in a corporation where nine hundred and ninetyfour of the members furnished all the money and did all the work and the other six elected themselves a permanent board of direction and took all the dividends  it seemed to me that what the nine hundred and ninetyfour dupes needed was a new deal  the thing that would have best suited the circus side of my nature would have been to resign the bossship and get up an insurrection and turn it into a revolution but i knew that the jack cade or the wat tyler who tries such a thing without first educating his materials up to revolution grade is almost absolutely certain to get left  i had never been accustomed to getting left even if i do say it myself  wherefore the deal which had been for some time working into shape in my mind was of a quite different pattern from the cadetyler sort  so i did not talk blood and insurrection to that man there who sat munching black bread with that abused and mistaught herd of human sheep but took him aside and talked matter of another sort to him after i had finished i got him to lend me a little ink from his veins and with this and a sliver i wrote on a piece of bark     put him in the manfactory  and gave it to him and said  take it to the palace at camelot and give it into the hands of amyas le poulet whom i call clarence and he will understand  he is a priest then said the man and some of the enthusiasm went out of his face  howa priest  didnt i tell you that no chattel of the church no bondslave of pope or bishop can enter my manfactory  didnt i tell you that you couldnt enter unless your religion whatever it might be was your own free property  marry it is so and for that i was glad wherefore it liked me not and bred in me a cold doubt to hear of this priest being there  but he isnt a priest i tell you  the man looked far from satisfied  he said  he is not a priest and yet can read  he is not a priest and yet can readyes and write too for that matter  i taught him myself the mans face cleared  and it is the first thing that you yourself will be taught in that factory  i  i would give blood out of my heart to know that art  why i will be your slave your  no you wont you wont be anybodys slave  take your family and go along  your lord the bishop will confiscate your small property but no matter  clarence will fix you all right    chapter xiv  defend thee lord  i paid three pennies for my breakfast and a most extravagant price it was too seeing that one could have breakfasted a dozen persons for that money but i was feeling good by this time and i had always been a kind of spendthrift anyway and then these people had wanted to give me the food for nothing scant as their provision was and so it was a grateful pleasure to emphasize my appreciation and sincere thankfulness with a good big financial lift where the money would do so much more good than it would in my helmet where these pennies being made of iron and not stinted in weight my halfdollars worth was a good deal of a burden to me  i spent money rather too freely in those days it is true but one reason for it was that i hadnt got the proportions of things entirely adjusted even yet after so long a sojourn in britainhadnt got along to where i was able to absolutely realize that a penny in arthurs land and a couple of dollars in connecticut were about one and the same thing just twins as you may say in purchasing power  if my start from camelot could have been delayed a very few days i could have paid these people in beautiful new coins from our own mint and that would have pleased me and them too not less  i had adopted the american values exclusively  in a week or two now cents nickels dimes quarters and halfdollars and also a trifle of gold would be trickling in thin but steady streams all through the commercial veins of the kingdom and i looked to see this new blood freshen up its life  the farmers were bound to throw in something to sort of offset my liberality whether i would or no so i let them give me a flint and steel and as soon as they had comfortably bestowed sandy and me on our horse i lit my pipe  when the first blast of smoke shot out through the bars of my helmet all those people broke for the woods and sandy went over backwards and struck the ground with a dull thud  they thought i was one of those firebelching dragons they had heard so much about from knights and other professional liars  i had infinite trouble to persuade those people to venture back within explaining distance  then i told them that this was only a bit of enchantment which would work harm to none but my enemies  and i promised with my hand on my heart that if all who felt no enmity toward me would come forward and pass before me they should see that only those who remained behind would be struck dead  the procession moved with a good deal of promptness there were no casualties to report for nobody had curiosity enough to remain behind to see what would happen  i lost some time now for these big children their fears gone became so ravished with wonder over my awecompelling fireworks that i had to stay there and smoke a couple of pipes out before they would let me go  still the delay was not wholly unproductive for it took all that time to get sandy thoroughly wonted to the new thing she being so close to it you know  it plugged up her conversation mill too for a considerable while and that was a gain  but above all other benefits accruing i had learned something  i was ready for any giant or any ogre that might come along now  we tarried with a holy hermit that night and my opportunity came about the middle of the next afternoon  we were crossing a vast meadow by way of shortcut and i was musing absently hearing nothing seeing nothing when sandy suddenly interrupted a remark which she had begun that morning with the cry  defend thee lordperil of life is toward  and she slipped down from the horse and ran a little way and stood i looked up and saw far off in the shade of a tree half a dozen armed knights and their squires and straightway there was bustle among them and tightening of saddlegirths for the mount  my pipe was ready and would have been lit if i had not been lost in thinking about how to banish oppression from this land and restore to all its people their stolen rights and manhood without disobliging anybody  i lit up at once and by the time i had got a good head of reserved steam on here they came  all together too none of those chivalrous magnanimities which one reads so much about one courtly rascal at a time and the rest standing by to see fair play  no they came in a body they came with a whirr and a rush they came like a volley from a battery came with heads low down plumes streaming out behind lances advanced at a level  it was a handsome sight a beautiful sightfor a man up a tree  i laid my lance in rest and waited with my heart beating till the iron wave was just ready to break over me then spouted a column of white smoke through the bars of my helmet  you should have seen the wave go to pieces and scatter  this was a finer sight than the other one  but these people stopped two or three hundred yards away and this troubled me  my satisfaction collapsed and fear came i judged i was a lost man  but sandy was radiant and was going to be eloquentbut i stopped her and told her my magic had miscarried somehow or other and she must mount with all despatch and we must ride for life  no she wouldnt  she said that my enchantment had disabled those knights they were not riding on because they couldnt wait they would drop out of their saddles presently and we would get their horses and harness  i could not deceive such trusting simplicity so i said it was a mistake that when my fireworks killed at all they killed instantly no the men would not die there was something wrong about my apparatus i couldnt tell what but we must hurry and get away for those people would attack us again in a minute  sandy laughed and said  lackaday sir they be not of that breed  sir launcelot will give battle to dragons and will abide by them and will assail them again and yet again and still again until he do conquer and destroy them and so likewise will sir pellinore and sir aglovale and sir carados and mayhap others but there be none else that will venture it let the idle say what the idle will  and la as to yonder base rufflers think ye they have not their fill but yet desire more  well then what are they waiting for  why dont they leave nobodys hindering  good land im willing to let bygones be bygones im sure  leave is it  oh give thyself easement as to that  they dream not of it no not they  they wait to yield them  comereally is that soothas you people say  if they want to why dont they  it would like them much but an ye wot how dragons are esteemed ye would not hold them blamable they fear to come  well then suppose i go to them instead and  ah wit ye well they would not abide your coming  i will go  and she did  she was a handy person to have along on a raid i would have considered this a doubtful errand myself  i presently saw the knights riding away and sandy coming back  that was a relief  i judged she had somehow failed to get the first innings i mean in the conversation otherwise the interview wouldnt have been so short  but it turned out that she had managed the business well in fact admirably  she said that when she told those people i was the boss it hit them where they lived smote them sore with fear and dread was her word and then they were ready to put up with anything she might require  so she swore them to appear at arthurs court within two days and yield them with horse and harness and be my knights henceforth and subject to my command how much better she managed that thing than i should have done it myself  she was a daisy    chapter xv  sandys tale  and so im proprietor of some knights said i as we rode off who would ever have supposed that i should live to list up assets of that sort  i shant know what to do with them unless i raffle them off  how many of them are there sandy  seven please you sir and their squires  it is a good haul  who are they  where do they hang out  where do they hang out  yes where do they live  ah i understood thee not  that will i tell eftsoons  then she said musingly and softly turning the words daintily over her tongue hang they outhang they outwhere hangwhere do they hang out eh right so where do they hang out  of a truth the phrase hath a fair and winsome grace and is prettily worded withal  i will repeat it anon and anon in mine idlesse whereby i may peradventure learn it  where do they hang out  even so already it falleth trippingly from my tongue and forasmuch as  dont forget the cowboys sandy  cowboys  yes the knights you know you were going to tell me about them a while back you remember  figuratively speaking games called  game  yes yes yes  go to the bat  i mean get to work on your statistics and dont burn so much kindling getting your fire started  tell me about the knights  i will well and lightly will begin  so they two departed and rode into a great forest  and  great scott  you see i recognized my mistake at once  i had set her works agoing it was my own fault she would be thirty days getting down to those facts  and she generally began without a preface and finished without a result  if you interrupted her she would either go right along without noticing or answer with a couple of words and go back and say the sentence over again  so interruptions only did harm and yet i had to interrupt and interrupt pretty frequently too in order to save my life a person would die if he let her monotony drip on him right along all day  great scott i said in my distress  she went right back and began over again  so they two departed and rode into a great forest  and  which two  sir gawaine and sir uwaine  and so they came to an abbey of monks and there were well lodged  so on the morn they heard their masses in the abbey and so they rode forth till they came to a great forest then was sir gawaine ware in a valley by a turret of twelve fair damsels and two knights armed on great horses and the damsels went to and fro by a tree  and then was sir gawaine ware how there hung a white shield on that tree and ever as the damsels came by it they spit upon it and some threw mire upon the shield  now if i hadnt seen the like myself in this country sandy i wouldnt believe it  but ive seen it and i can just see those creatures now parading before that shield and acting like that the women here do certainly act like all possessed  yes and i mean your best too societys very choicest brands  the humblest hellogirl along ten thousand miles of wire could teach gentleness patience modesty manners to the highest duchess in arthurs land  hellogirl  yes but dont you ask me to explain its a new kind of a girl they dont have them here one often speaks sharply to them when they are not the least in fault and he cant get over feeling sorry for it and ashamed of himself in thirteen hundred years its such shabby mean conduct and so unprovoked the fact is no gentleman ever does itthough iwell i myself if ive got to confess  peradventure she  never mind her never mind her i tell you i couldnt ever explain her so you would understand  even so be it sith ye are so minded  then sir gawaine and sir uwaine went and saluted them and asked them why they did that despite to the shield  sirs said the damsels we shall tell you there is a knight in this country that owneth this white shield and he is a passing good man of his hands but he hateth all ladies and gentlewomen and therefore we do all this despite to the shield  i will say you said sir gawaine it beseemeth evil a good knight to despise all ladies and gentlewomen and peradventure though he hate you he hath some cause and peradventure he loveth in some other places ladies and gentlewomen and to be loved again and he such a man of prowess as ye speak of  man of prowessyes that is the man to please them sandy man of brainsthat is a thing they never think of  tom sayers john heenanjohn l sullivanpity but you could be here  you would have your legs under the round table and a sir in front of your names within the twentyfour hours and you could bring about a new distribution of the married princesses and duchesses of the court in another twentyfour  the fact is it is just a sort of polishedup court of comanches and there isnt a squaw in it who doesnt stand ready at the dropping of a hat to desert to the buck with the biggest string of scalps at his belt  and he be such a man of prowess as ye speak of said sir gawaine now what is his name  sir said they his name is marhaus the kings son of ireland  son of the king of ireland you mean the other form doesnt mean anything  and look out and hold on tight now we must jump this gully  there we are all right now  this horse belongs in the circus he is born before his time  i know him well said sir uwaine he is a passing good knight as any is on live  on live  if youve got a fault in the world sandy it is that you are a shade too archaic  but it isnt any matter  for i saw him once proved at a justs where many knights were gathered and that time there might no man withstand him  ah said sir gawaine damsels methinketh ye are to blame for it is to suppose he that hung that shield there will not be long therefrom and then may those knights match him on horseback and that is more your worship than thus for i will abide no longer to see a knights shield dishonored  and therewith sir uwaine and sir gawaine departed a little from them and then were they ware where sir marhaus came riding on a great horse straight toward them  and when the twelve damsels saw sir marhaus they fled into the turret as they were wild so that some of them fell by the way then the one of the knights of the tower dressed his shield and said on high sir marhaus defend thee  and so they ran together that the knight brake his spear on marhaus and sir marhaus smote him so hard that he brake his neck and the horses back  well that is just the trouble about this state of things it ruins so many horses  that saw the other knight of the turret and dressed him toward marhaus and they went so eagerly together that the knight of the turret was soon smitten down horse and man stark dead  another horse gone i tell you it is a custom that ought to be broken up  i dont see how people with any feeling can applaud and support it                 so these two knights came together with great random  i saw that i had been asleep and missed a chapter but i didnt say anything  i judged that the irish knight was in trouble with the visitors by this time and this turned out to be the case  that sir uwaine smote sir marhaus that his spear brast in pieces on the shield and sir marhaus smote him so sore that horse and man he bare to the earth and hurt sir uwaine on the left side  the truth is alisande these archaics are a little too simple the vocabulary is too limited and so by consequence descriptions suffer in the matter of variety they run too much to level saharas of fact and not enough to picturesque detail this throws about them a certain air of the monotonous in fact the fights are all alike a couple of people come together with great random random is a good word and so is exegesis for that matter and so is holocaust and defalcation and usufruct and a hundred others but land a body ought to discriminatethey come together with great random and a spear is brast and one party brake his shield and the other one goes down horse and man over his horsetail and brake his neck and then the next candidate comes randoming in and brast his spear and the other man brast his shield and down he goes horse and man over his horsetail and brake his neck and then theres another elected and another and another and still another till the material is all used up and when you come to figure up results you cant tell one fight from another nor who whipped and as a picture of living raging roaring battle sho why its pale and noiselessjust ghosts scuffling in a fog dear me what would this barren vocabulary get out of the mightiest spectaclethe burning of rome in neros time for instance why it would merely say town burned down no insurance boy brast a window fireman brake his neck  why that aint a picture  it was a good deal of a lecture i thought but it didnt disturb sandy didnt turn a feather her steam soared steadily up again the minute i took off the lid  then sir marhaus turned his horse and rode toward gawaine with his spear  and when sir gawaine saw that he dressed his shield and they aventred their spears and they came together with all the might of their horses that either knight smote other so hard in the midst of their shields but sir gawaines spear brake  i knew it would  but sir marhauss spear held and therewith sir gawaine and his horse rushed down to the earth  just soand brake his back  and lightly sir gawaine rose upon his feet and pulled out his sword and dressed him toward sir marhaus on foot and therewith either came unto other eagerly and smote together with their swords that their shields flew in cantels and they bruised their helms and their hauberks and wounded either other  but sir gawaine fro it passed nine of the clock waxed by the space of three hours ever stronger and stronger and thrice his might was increased all this espied sir marhaus and had great wonder how his might increased and so they wounded other passing sore and then when it was come noon  the pelting singsong of it carried me forward to scenes and sounds of my boyhood days  neeew haven ten minutes for refreshmentsknductrll strike the gongbell two minutes before train leavespassengers for the shore line please take seats in the rear kyar this kyar dont go no furderahhpls awrnjz bnanners sandches popcorn  and waxed past noon and drew toward evensong  sir gawaines strength feebled and waxed passing faint that unnethes he might dure any longer and sir marhaus was then bigger and bigger  which strained his armor of course and yet little would one of these people mind a small thing like that  and so sir knight said sir marhaus i have well felt that ye are a passing good knight and a marvelous man of might as ever i felt any while it lasteth and our quarrels are not great and therefore it were a pity to do you hurt for i feel you are passing feeble  ah said sir gawaine gentle knight ye say the word that i should say  and therewith they took off their helms and either kissed other and there they swore together either to love other as brethren  but i lost the thread there and dozed off to slumber thinking about what a pity it was that men with such superb strength strength enabling them to stand up cased in cruelly burdensome iron and drenched with perspiration and hack and batter and bang each other for six hours on a stretchshould not have been born at a time when they could put it to some useful purpose  take a jackass for instance a jackass has that kind of strength and puts it to a useful purpose and is valuable to this world because he is a jackass but a nobleman is not valuable because he is a jackass  it is a mixture that is always ineffectual and should never have been attempted in the first place  and yet once you start a mistake the trouble is done and you never know what is going to come of it  when i came to myself again and began to listen i perceived that i had lost another chapter and that alisande had wandered a long way off with her people  and so they rode and came into a deep valley full of stones and thereby they saw a fair stream of water above thereby was the head of the stream a fair fountain and three damsels sitting thereby in this country said sir marhaus came never knight since it was christened but he found strange adventures  this is not good form alisande  sir marhaus the kings son of ireland talks like all the rest you ought to give him a brogue or at least a characteristic expletive by this means one would recognize him as soon as he spoke without his ever being named it is a common literary device with the great authors  you should make him say in this country be jabers came never knight since it was christened but he found strange adventures be jabers you see how much better that sounds  came never knight but he found strange adventures be jabers of a truth it doth indeed fair lord albeit tis passing hard to say though peradventure that will not tarry but better speed with usage  and then they rode to the damsels and either saluted other and the eldest had a garland of gold about her head and she was threescore winter of age or more  the damsel was  even so dear lordand her hair was white under the garland  celluloid teeth nine dollars a set as like as notthe loosefit kind that go up and down like a portcullis when you eat and fall out when you laugh  the second damsel was of thirty winter of age with a circlet of gold about her head  the third damsel was but fifteen year of age  billows of thought came rolling over my soul and the voice faded out of my hearing  fifteen  breakmy heart oh my lost darling  just her age who was so gentle and lovely and all the world to me and whom i shall never see again  how the thought of her carries me back over wide seas of memory to a vague dim time a happy time so many many centuries hence when i used to wake in the soft summer mornings out of sweet dreams of her and say hello central just to hear her dear voice come melting back to me with a hello hank that was music of the spheres to my enchanted ear she got three dollars a week but she was worth it  i could not follow alisandes further explanation of who our captured knights were nowi mean in case she should ever get to explaining who they were  my interest was gone my thoughts were far away and sad  by fitful glimpses of the drifting tale caught here and there and now and then i merely noted in a vague way that each of these three knights took one of these three damsels up behind him on his horse and one rode north another east the other south to seek adventures and meet again and lie after year and day  year and dayand without baggage  it was of a piece with the general simplicity of the country  the sun was now setting  it was about three in the afternoon when alisande had begun to tell me who the cowboys were so she had made pretty good progress with itfor her  she would arrive some time or other no doubt but she was not a person who could be hurried  we were approaching a castle which stood on high ground a huge strong venerable structure whose gray towers and battlements were charmingly draped with ivy and whose whole majestic mass was drenched with splendors flung from the sinking sun  it was the largest castle we had seen and so i thought it might be the one we were after but sandy said no  she did not know who owned it she said she had passed it without calling when she went down to camelot    chapter xvi  morgan le fay  if knights errant were to be believed not all castles were desirable places to seek hospitality in  as a matter of fact knights errant were not persons to be believedthat is measured by modern standards of veracity yet measured by the standards of their own time and scaled accordingly you got the truth  it was very simple you discounted a statement ninetyseven per cent the rest was fact  now after making this allowance the truth remained that if i could find out something about a castle before ringing the doorbelli mean hailing the wardersit was the sensible thing to do  so i was pleased when i saw in the distance a horseman making the bottom turn of the road that wound down from this castle  as we approached each other i saw that he wore a plumed helmet and seemed to be otherwise clothed in steel but bore a curious addition alsoa stiff square garment like a heralds tabard however i had to smile at my own forgetfulness when i got nearer and read this sign on his tabard    persimmons soap  all the primedonna use it  that was a little idea of my own and had several wholesome purposes in view toward the civilizing and uplifting of this nation  in the first place it was a furtive underhand blow at this nonsense of knight errantry though nobody suspected that but me  i had started a number of these people outthe bravest knights i could geteach sandwiched between bulletinboards bearing one device or another and i judged that by and by when they got to be numerous enough they would begin to look ridiculous and then even the steelclad ass that hadnt any board would himself begin to look ridiculous because he was out of the fashion  secondly these missionaries would gradually and without creating suspicion or exciting alarm introduce a rudimentary cleanliness among the nobility and from them it would work down to the people if the priests could be kept quiet  this would undermine the church i mean would be a step toward that  next educationnext freedom and then she would begin to crumble  it being my conviction that any established church is an established crime an established slavepen i had no scruples but was willing to assail it in any way or with any weapon that promised to hurt it  why in my own former dayin remote centuries not yet stirring in the womb of timethere were old englishmen who imagined that they had been born in a free country a free country with the corporation act and the test still in force in ittimbers propped against mens liberties and dishonored consciences to shore up an established anachronism with  my missionaries were taught to spell out the gilt signs on their tabardsthe showy gilding was a neat idea i could have got the king to wear a bulletinboard for the sake of that barbaric splendorthey were to spell out these signs and then explain to the lords and ladies what soap was and if the lords and ladies were afraid of it get them to try it on a dog  the missionarys next move was to get the family together and try it on himself he was to stop at no experiment however desperate that could convince the nobility that soap was harmless if any final doubt remained he must catch a hermitthe woods were full of them saints they called themselves and saints they were believed to be they were unspeakably holy and worked miracles and everybody stood in awe of them  if a hermit could survive a wash and that failed to convince a duke give him up let him alone  whenever my missionaries overcame a knight errant on the road they washed him and when he got well they swore him to go and get a bulletinboard and disseminate soap and civilization the rest of his days  as a consequence the workers in the field were increasing by degrees and the reform was steadily spreading my soap factory felt the strain early  at first i had only two hands but before i had left home i was already employing fifteen and running night and day and the atmospheric result was getting so pronounced that the king went sort of fainting and gasping around and said he did not believe he could stand it much longer and sir launcelot got so that he did hardly anything but walk up and down the roof and swear although i told him it was worse up there than anywhere else but he said he wanted plenty of air and he was always complaining that a palace was no place for a soap factory anyway and said if a man was to start one in his house he would be damned if he wouldnt strangle him  there were ladies present too but much these people ever cared for that they would swear before children if the wind was their way when the factory was going  this missionary knights name was la cote male taile and he said that this castle was the abode of morgan le fay sister of king arthur and wife of king uriens monarch of a realm about as big as the district of columbiayou could stand in the middle of it and throw bricks into the next kingdom  kings and kingdoms were as thick in britain as they had been in little palestine in joshuas time when people had to sleep with their knees pulled up because they couldnt stretch out without a passport  la cote was much depressed for he had scored here the worst failure of his campaign  he had not worked off a cake yet he had tried all the tricks of the trade even to the washing of a hermit but the hermit died  this was indeed a bad failure for this animal would now be dubbed a martyr and would take his place among the saints of the roman calendar  thus made he his moan this poor sir la cote male taile and sorrowed passing sore  and so my heart bled for him and i was moved to comfort and stay him wherefore i said  forbear to grieve fair knight for this is not a defeat  we have brains you and i and for such as have brains there are no defeats but only victories  observe how we will turn this seeming disaster into an advertisement an advertisement for our soap and the biggest one to draw that was ever thought of an advertisement that will transform that mount washington defeat into a matterhorn victory  we will put on your bulletinboard patronized by the elect  how does that strike you  verily it is wonderly bethought  well a body is bound to admit that for just a modest little oneline ad its a corker  so the poor colporteurs griefs vanished away  he was a brave fellow and had done mighty feats of arms in his time  his chief celebrity rested upon the events of an excursion like this one of mine which he had once made with a damsel named maledisant who was as handy with her tongue as was sandy though in a different way for her tongue churned forth only railings and insult whereas sandys music was of a kindlier sort  i knew his story well and so i knew how to interpret the compassion that was in his face when he bade me farewell  he supposed i was having a bitter hard time of it  sandy and i discussed his story as we rode along and she said that la cotes bad luck had begun with the very beginning of that trip for the kings fool had overthrown him on the first day and in such cases it was customary for the girl to desert to the conqueror but maledisant didnt do it and also persisted afterward in sticking to him after all his defeats  but said i suppose the victor should decline to accept his spoil  she said that that wouldnt answerhe must  he couldnt decline it wouldnt be regular  i made a note of that  if sandys music got to be too burdensome some time i would let a knight defeat me on the chance that she would desert to him  in due time we were challenged by the warders from the castle walls and after a parley admitted  i have nothing pleasant to tell about that visit  but it was not a disappointment for i knew mrs le fay by reputation and was not expecting anything pleasant she was held in awe by the whole realm for she had made everybody believe she was a great sorceress  all her ways were wicked all her instincts devilish  she was loaded to the eyelids with cold malice  all her history was black with crime and among her crimes murder was common  i was most curious to see her as curious as i could have been to see satan  to my surprise she was beautiful black thoughts had failed to make her expression repulsive age had failed to wrinkle her satin skin or mar its bloomy freshness she could have passed for old uriens granddaughter she could have been mistaken for sister to her own son  as soon as we were fairly within the castle gates we were ordered into her presence  king uriens was there a kindfaced old man with a subdued look and also the son sir uwaine le blanchemains in whom i was of course interested on account of the tradition that he had once done battle with thirty knights and also on account of his trip with sir gawaine and sir marhaus which sandy had been aging me with  but morgan was the main attraction the conspicuous personality here she was head chief of this household that was plain  she caused us to be seated and then she began with all manner of pretty graces and graciousnesses to ask me questions  dear me it was like a bird or a flute or something talking  i felt persuaded that this woman must have been misrepresented lied about  she trilled along and trilled along and presently a handsome young page clothed like the rainbow and as easy and undulatory of movement as a wave came with something on a golden salver and kneeling to present it to her overdid his graces and lost his balance and so fell lightly against her knee  she slipped a dirk into him in as matterofcourse a way as another person would have harpooned a rat  poor child he slumped to the floor twisted his silken limbs in one great straining contortion of pain and was dead  out of the old king was wrung an involuntary oh of compassion  the look he got made him cut it suddenly short and not put any more hyphens in it  sir uwaine at a sign from his mother went to the anteroom and called some servants and meanwhile madame went rippling sweetly along with her talk  i saw that she was a good housekeeper for while she talked she kept a corner of her eye on the servants to see that they made no balks in handling the body and getting it out when they came with fresh clean towels she sent back for the other kind and when they had finished wiping the floor and were going she indicated a crimson fleck the size of a tear which their duller eyes had overlooked  it was plain to me that la cote male taile had failed to see the mistress of the house  often how louder and clearer than any tongue does dumb circumstantial evidence speak  morgan le fay rippled along as musically as ever  marvelous woman and what a glance she had when it fell in reproof upon those servants they shrunk and quailed as timid people do when the lightning flashes out of a cloud  i could have got the habit myself  it was the same with that poor old brer uriens he was always on the ragged edge of apprehension she could not even turn toward him but he winced  in the midst of the talk i let drop a complimentary word about king arthur forgetting for the moment how this woman hated her brother  that one little compliment was enough  she clouded up like storm she called for her guards and said  hale me these varlets to the dungeons  that struck cold on my ears for her dungeons had a reputation nothing occurred to me to sayor do  but not so with sandy as the guard laid a hand upon me she piped up with the tranquilest confidence and said  gods wounds dost thou covet destruction thou maniac  it is the boss  now what a happy idea that wasand so simple yet it would never have occurred to me  i was born modest not all over but in spots and this was one of the spots  the effect upon madame was electrical  it cleared her countenance and brought back her smiles and all her persuasive graces and blandishments but nevertheless she was not able to entirely cover up with them the fact that she was in a ghastly fright she said  la but do list to thine handmaid as if one gifted with powers like to mine might say the thing which i have said unto one who has vanquished merlin and not be jesting  by mine enchantments i foresaw your coming and by them i knew you when you entered here  i did but play this little jest with hope to surprise you into some display of your art as not doubting you would blast the guards with occult fires consuming them to ashes on the spot a marvel much beyond mine own ability yet one which i have long been childishly curious to see  the guards were less curious and got out as soon as they got permission    chapter xvii  a royal banquet  madame seeing me pacific and unresentful no doubt judged that i was deceived by her excuse for her fright dissolved away and she was soon so importunate to have me give an exhibition and kill somebody that the thing grew to be embarrassing  however to my relief she was presently interrupted by the call to prayers  i will say this much for the nobility that tyrannical murderous rapacious and morally rotten as they were they were deeply and enthusiastically religious  nothing could divert them from the regular and faithful performance of the pieties enjoined by the church  more than once i had seen a noble who had gotten his enemy at a disadvantage stop to pray before cutting his throat more than once i had seen a noble after ambushing and despatching his enemy retire to the nearest wayside shrine and humbly give thanks without even waiting to rob the body  there was to be nothing finer or sweeter in the life of even benvenuto cellini that roughhewn saint ten centuries later  all the nobles of britain with their families attended divine service morning and night daily in their private chapels and even the worst of them had family worship five or six times a day besides  the credit of this belonged entirely to the church  although i was no friend to that catholic church i was obliged to admit this  and often in spite of me i found myself saying what would this country be without the church  after prayers we had dinner in a great banqueting hall which was lighted by hundreds of greasejets and everything was as fine and lavish and rudely splendid as might become the royal degree of the hosts  at the head of the hall on a dais was the table of the king queen and their son prince uwaine  stretching down the hall from this was the general table on the floor  at this above the salt sat the visiting nobles and the grown members of their families of both sexesthe resident court in effectsixtyone persons below the salt sat minor officers of the household with their principal subordinates altogether a hundred and eighteen persons sitting and about as many liveried servants standing behind their chairs or serving in one capacity or another  it was a very fine show  in a gallery a band with cymbals horns harps and other horrors opened the proceedings with what seemed to be the crude firstdraft or original agony of the wail known to later centuries as in the sweet bye and bye  it was new and ought to have been rehearsed a little more  for some reason or other the queen had the composer hanged after dinner  after this music the priest who stood behind the royal table said a noble long grace in ostensible latin  then the battalion of waiters broke away from their posts and darted rushed flew fetched and carried and the mighty feeding began no words anywhere but absorbing attention to business  the rows of chops opened and shut in vast unison and the sound of it was like to the muffled burr of subterranean machinery  the havoc continued an hour and a half and unimaginable was the destruction of substantials  of the chief feature of the feast the huge wild boar that lay stretched out so portly and imposing at the startnothing was left but the semblance of a hoopskirt and he was but the type and symbol of what had happened to all the other dishes  with the pastries and so on the heavy drinking beganand the talk gallon after gallon of wine and mead disappeared and everybody got comfortable then happy then sparklingly joyousboth sexes and by and by pretty noisy  men told anecdotes that were terrific to hear but nobody blushed and when the nub was sprung the assemblage let go with a horselaugh that shook the fortress ladies answered back with historiettes that would almost have made queen margaret of navarre or even the great elizabeth of england hide behind a handkerchief but nobody hid here but only laughed howled you may say  in pretty much all of these dreadful stories ecclesiastics were the hardy heroes but that didnt worry the chaplain any he had his laugh with the rest more than that upon invitation he roared out a song which was of as daring a sort as any that was sung that night  by midnight everybody was fagged out and sore with laughing and as a rule drunk some weepingly some affectionately some hilariously some quarrelsomely some dead and under the table of the ladies the worst spectacle was a lovely young duchess whose weddingeve this was and indeed she was a spectacle sure enough just as she was she could have sat in advance for the portrait of the young daughter of the regent dorleans at the famous dinner whence she was carried foulmouthed intoxicated and helpless to her bed in the lost and lamented days of the ancient regime  suddenly even while the priest was lifting his hands and all conscious heads were bowed in reverent expectation of the coming blessing there appeared under the arch of the faroff door at the bottom of the hall an old and bent and whitehaired lady leaning upon a crutchstick and she lifted the stick and pointed it toward the queen and cried out  the wrath and curse of god fall upon you woman without pity who have slain mine innocent grandchild and made desolate this old heart that had nor chick nor friend nor stay nor comfort in all this world but him  everybody crossed himself in a grisly fright for a curse was an awful thing to those people but the queen rose up majestic with the deathlight in her eye and flung back this ruthless command  lay hands on her  to the stake with her  the guards left their posts to obey  it was a shame it was a cruel thing to see  what could be done  sandy gave me a look i knew she had another inspiration  i said  do what you choose  she was up and facing toward the queen in a moment  she indicated me and said  madame he saith this may not be  recall the commandment or he will dissolve the castle and it shall vanish away like the instable fabric of a dream  confound it what a crazy contract to pledge a person to  what if the queen  but my consternation subsided there and my panic passed off for the queen all in a collapse made no show of resistance but gave a countermanding sign and sunk into her seat  when she reached it she was sober  so were many of the others  the assemblage rose whiffed ceremony to the winds and rushed for the door like a mob overturning chairs smashing crockery tugging struggling shouldering crowdinganything to get out before i should change my mind and puff the castle into the measureless dim vacancies of space  well well well they were a superstitious lot  it is all a body can do to conceive of it  the poor queen was so scared and humbled that she was even afraid to hang the composer without first consulting me  i was very sorry for herindeed any one would have been for she was really suffering so i was willing to do anything that was reasonable and had no desire to carry things to wanton extremities  i therefore considered the matter thoughtfully and ended by having the musicians ordered into our presence to play that sweet bye and bye again which they did  then i saw that she was right and gave her permission to hang the whole band  this little relaxation of sternness had a good effect upon the queen  a statesman gains little by the arbitrary exercise of ironclad authority upon all occasions that offer for this wounds the just pride of his subordinates and thus tends to undermine his strength  a little concession now and then where it can do no harm is the wiser policy  now that the queen was at ease in her mind once more and measurably happy her wine naturally began to assert itself again and it got a little the start of her  i mean it set her music goingher silver bell of a tongue  dear me she was a master talker  it would not become me to suggest that it was pretty late and that i was a tired man and very sleepy  i wished i had gone off to bed when i had the chance  now i must stick it out there was no other way  so she tinkled along and along in the otherwise profound and ghostly hush of the sleeping castle until by and by there came as if from deep down under us a faraway sound as of a muffled shriek with an expression of agony about it that made my flesh crawl the queen stopped and her eyes lighted with pleasure she tilted her graceful head as a bird does when it listens  the sound bored its way up through the stillness again  what is it i said  it is truly a stubborn soul and endureth long  it is many hours now  endureth what  the rack  comeye shall see a blithe sight  an he yield not his secret now ye shall see him torn asunder  what a silky smooth hellion she was and so composed and serene when the cords all down my legs were hurting in sympathy with that mans pain  conducted by mailed guards bearing flaring torches we tramped along echoing corridors and down stone stairways dank and dripping and smelling of mould and ages of imprisoned night a chill uncanny journey and a long one and not made the shorter or the cheerier by the sorceresss talk which was about this sufferer and his crime  he had been accused by an anonymous informer of having killed a stag in the royal preserves  i said  anonymous testimony isnt just the right thing your highness it were fairer to confront the accused with the accuser  i had not thought of that it being but of small consequence but an i would i could not for that the accuser came masked by night and told the forester and straightway got him hence again and so the forester knoweth him not  then is this unknown the only person who saw the stag killed  marry no man saw the killing but this unknown saw this hardy wretch near to the spot where the stag lay and came with right loyal zeal and betrayed him to the forester  so the unknown was near the dead stag too  isnt it just possible that he did the killing himself  his loyal zealin a masklooks just a shade suspicious  but what is your highnesss idea for racking the prisoner  where is the profit  he will not confess else and then were his soul lost  for his crime his life is forfeited by the lawand of a surety will i see that he payeth itbut it were peril to my own soul to let him die unconfessed and unabsolved  nay i were a fool to fling me into hell for his accommodation  but your highness suppose he has nothing to confess  as to that we shall see anon  an i rack him to death and he confess not it will peradventure show that he had indeed naught to confessye will grant that that is sooth  then shall i not be damned for an unconfessed man that had naught to confess wherefore i shall be safe  it was the stubborn unreasoning of the time  it was useless to argue with her  arguments have no chance against petrified training they wear it as little as the waves wear a cliff  and her training was everybodys  the brightest intellect in the land would not have been able to see that her position was defective  as we entered the rackcell i caught a picture that will not go from me i wish it would  a native young giant of thirty or thereabouts lay stretched upon the frame on his back with his wrists and ankles tied to ropes which led over windlasses at either end  there was no color in him his features were contorted and set and sweatdrops stood upon his forehead  a priest bent over him on each side the executioner stood by guards were on duty smoking torches stood in sockets along the walls in a corner crouched a poor young creature her face drawn with anguish a halfwild and hunted look in her eyes and in her lap lay a little child asleep  just as we stepped across the threshold the executioner gave his machine a slight turn which wrung a cry from both the prisoner and the woman but i shouted and the executioner released the strain without waiting to see who spoke i could not let this horror go on it would have killed me to see it  i asked the queen to let me clear the place and speak to the prisoner privately and when she was going to object i spoke in a low voice and said i did not want to make a scene before her servants but i must have my way for i was king arthurs representative and was speaking in his name  she saw she had to yield  i asked her to indorse me to these people and then leave me  it was not pleasant for her but she took the pill and even went further than i was meaning to require  i only wanted the backing of her own authority but she said  ye will do in all things as this lord shall command  it is the boss  it was certainly a good word to conjure with you could see it by the squirming of these rats  the queens guards fell into line and she and they marched away with their torchbearers and woke the echoes of the cavernous tunnels with the measured beat of their retreating footfalls  i had the prisoner taken from the rack and placed upon his bed and medicaments applied to his hurts and wine given him to drink  the woman crept near and looked on eagerly lovingly but timorouslylike one who fears a repulse indeed she tried furtively to touch the mans forehead and jumped back the picture of fright when i turned unconsciously toward her  it was pitiful to see  lord i said stroke him lass if you want to  do anything youre a mind to dont mind me  why her eyes were as grateful as an animals when you do it a kindness that it understands  the baby was out of her way and she had her cheek against the mans in a minute and her hands fondling his hair and her happy tears running down  the man revived and caressed his wife with his eyes which was all he could do  i judged i might clear the den now and i did cleared it of all but the family and myself  then i said  now my friend tell me your side of this matter i know the other side  the man moved his head in sign of refusal  but the woman looked pleasedas it seemed to mepleased with my suggestion  i went on  you know of me  yes  all do in arthurs realms  if my reputation has come to you right and straight you should not be afraid to speak  the woman broke in eagerly  ah fair my lord do thou persuade him  thou canst an thou wilt ah he suffereth so and it is for mefor me  and how can i bear it i would i might see him diea sweet swift death oh my hugo i cannot bear this one  and she fell to sobbing and grovelling about my feet and still imploring  imploring what  the mans death  i could not quite get the bearings of the thing  but hugo interrupted her and said  peace  ye wit not what ye ask  shall i starve whom i love to win a gentle death  i wend thou knewest me better  well i said i cant quite make this out  it is a puzzle  now  ah dear my lord an ye will but persuade him  consider how these his tortures wound me  oh and he will not speakwhereas the healing the solace that lie in a blessed swift death  what are you maundering about  hes going out from here a free man and wholehes not going to die  the mans white face lit up and the woman flung herself at me in a most surprising explosion of joy and cried out  he is savedfor it is the kings word by the mouth of the kings servantarthur the king whose word is gold  well then you do believe i can be trusted after all  why didnt you before  who doubted  not i indeed and not she  well why wouldnt you tell me your story then  ye had made no promise else had it been otherwise  i see i see  and yet i believe i dont quite see after all you stood the torture and refused to confess which shows plain enough to even the dullest understanding that you had nothing to confess  i my lord  how so  it was i that killed the deer  you did  oh dear this is the most mixedup business that ever  dear lord i begged him on my knees to confess but  you did  it gets thicker and thicker  what did you want him to do that for  sith it would bring him a quick death and save him all this cruel pain  wellyes there is reason in that  but he didnt want the quick death  he  why of a surety he did  well then why in the world didnt he confess  ah sweet sir and leave my wife and chick without bread and shelter  oh heart of gold now i see it  the bitter law takes the convicted mans estate and beggars his widow and his orphans  they could torture you to death but without conviction or confession they could not rob your wife and baby  you stood by them like a man and youtrue wife and the woman that you areyou would have bought him release from torture at cost to yourself of slow starvation and deathwell it humbles a body to think what your sex can do when it comes to selfsacrifice  ill book you both for my colony youll like it there its a factory where im going to turn groping and grubbing automata into men    chapter xviii  in the queens dungeons  well i arranged all that and i had the man sent to his home i had a great desire to rack the executioner not because he was a good painstaking and paingiving officialfor surely it was not to his discredit that he performed his functions wellbut to pay him back for wantonly cuffing and otherwise distressing that young woman  the priests told me about this and were generously hot to have him punished  something of this disagreeable sort was turning up every now and then  i mean episodes that showed that not all priests were frauds and selfseekers but that many even the great majority of these that were down on the ground among the common people were sincere and righthearted and devoted to the alleviation of human troubles and sufferings well it was a thing which could not be helped so i seldom fretted about it and never many minutes at a time it has never been my way to bother much about things which you cant cure  but i did not like it for it was just the sort of thing to keep people reconciled to an established church  we must have a religion it goes without sayingbut my idea is to have it cut up into forty free sects so that they will police each other as had been the case in the united states in my time  concentration of power in a political machine is bad and an established church is only a political machine it was invented for that it is nursed cradled preserved for that it is an enemy to human liberty and does no good which it could not better do in a splitup and scattered condition  that wasnt law it wasnt gospel it was only an opinionmy opinion and i was only a man one man so it wasnt worth any more than the popesor any less for that matter  well i couldnt rack the executioner neither would i overlook the just complaint of the priests  the man must be punished somehow or other so i degraded him from his office and made him leader of the bandthe new one that was to be started  he begged hard and said he couldnt playa plausible excuse but too thin there wasnt a musician in the country that could  the queen was a good deal outraged next morning when she found she was going to have neither hugos life nor his property  but i told her she must bear this cross that while by law and custom she certainly was entitled to both the mans life and his property there were extenuating circumstances and so in arthur the kings name i had pardoned him  the deer was ravaging the mans fields and he had killed it in sudden passion and not for gain and he had carried it into the royal forest in the hope that that might make detection of the misdoer impossible  confound her i couldnt make her see that sudden passion is an extenuating circumstance in the killing of venisonor of a personso i gave it up and let her sulk it out  i did think i was going to make her see it by remarking that her own sudden passion in the case of the page modified that crime  crime she exclaimed  how thou talkest  crime forsooth man i am going to pay for him  oh it was no use to waste sense on her  trainingtraining is everything training is all there is to a person  we speak of nature it is folly there is no such thing as nature what we call by that misleading name is merely heredity and training we have no thoughts of our own no opinions of our own they are transmitted to us trained into us  all that is original in us and therefore fairly creditable or discreditable to us can be covered up and hidden by the point of a cambric needle all the rest being atoms contributed by and inherited from a procession of ancestors that stretches back a billion years to the adamclam or grasshopper or monkey from whom our race has been so tediously and ostentatiously and unprofitably developed  and as for me all that i think about in this plodding sad pilgrimage this pathetic drift between the eternities is to look out and humbly live a pure and high and blameless life and save that one microscopic atom in me that is truly me the rest may land in sheol and welcome for all i care  no confound her her intellect was good she had brains enough but her training made her an assthat is from a manycenturieslater point of view  to kill the page was no crimeit was her right and upon her right she stood serenely and unconscious of offense she was a result of generations of training in the unexamined and unassailed belief that the law which permitted her to kill a subject when she chose was a perfectly right and righteous one  well we must give even satan his due  she deserved a compliment for one thing and i tried to pay it but the words stuck in my throat  she had a right to kill the boy but she was in no wise obliged to pay for him  that was law for some other people but not for her  she knew quite well that she was doing a large and generous thing to pay for that lad and that i ought in common fairness to come out with something handsome about it but i couldntmy mouth refused  i couldnt help seeing in my fancy that poor old grandma with the broken heart and that fair young creature lying butchered his little silken pomps and vanities laced with his golden blood  how could she pay for him  whom could she pay  and so well knowing that this woman trained as she had been deserved praise even adulation i was yet not able to utter it trained as i had been  the best i could do was to fish up a compliment from outside so to speakand the pity of it was that it was true  madame your people will adore you for this  quite true but i meant to hang her for it some day if i lived some of those laws were too bad altogether too bad  a master might kill his slave for nothingfor mere spite malice or to pass the timejust as we have seen that the crowned head could do it with his slave that is to say anybody  a gentleman could kill a free commoner and pay for himcash or gardentruck a noble could kill a noble without expense as far as the law was concerned but reprisals in kind were to be expected  anybody could kill somebody except the commoner and the slave these had no privileges  if they killed it was murder and the law wouldnt stand murder  it made short work of the experimenterand of his family too if he murdered somebody who belonged up among the ornamental ranks  if a commoner gave a noble even so much as a damiensscratch which didnt kill or even hurt he got damiens dose for it just the same they pulled him to rags and tatters with horses and all the world came to see the show and crack jokes and have a good time and some of the performances of the best people present were as tough and as properly unprintable as any that have been printed by the pleasant casanova in his chapter about the dismemberment of louis xvs poor awkward enemy  i had had enough of this grisly place by this time and wanted to leave but i couldnt because i had something on my mind that my conscience kept prodding me about and wouldnt let me forget if i had the remaking of man he wouldnt have any conscience it is one of the most disagreeable things connected with a person and although it certainly does a great deal of good it cannot be said to pay in the long run it would be much better to have less good and more comfort  still this is only my opinion and i am only one man others with less experience may think differently  they have a right to their view  i only stand to this i have noticed my conscience for many years and i know it is more trouble and bother to me than anything else i started with  i suppose that in the beginning i prized it because we prize anything that is ours and yet how foolish it was to think so if we look at it in another way we see how absurd it is if i had an anvil in me would i prize it  of course not  and yet when you come to think there is no real difference between a conscience and an anvili mean for comfort  i have noticed it a thousand times  and you could dissolve an anvil with acids when you couldnt stand it any longer but there isnt any way that you can work off a conscienceat least so it will stay worked off not that i know of anyway  there was something i wanted to do before leaving but it was a disagreeable matter and i hated to go at it  well it bothered me all the morning  i could have mentioned it to the old king but what would be the usehe was but an extinct volcano he had been active in his time but his fire was out this good while he was only a stately ashpile now gentle enough and kindly enough for my purpose without doubt but not usable  he was nothing this socalled king the queen was the only power there and she was a vesuvius  as a favor she might consent to warm a flock of sparrows for you but then she might take that very opportunity to turn herself loose and bury a city  however i reflected that as often as any other way when you are expecting the worst you get something that is not so bad after all  so i braced up and placed my matter before her royal highness i said i had been having a general jaildelivery at camelot and among neighboring castles and with her permission i would like to examine her collection her bricabracthat is to say her prisoners  she resisted but i was expecting that  but she finally consented  i was expecting that too but not so soon  that about ended my discomfort  she called her guards and torches and we went down into the dungeons  these were down under the castles foundations and mainly were small cells hollowed out of the living rock  some of these cells had no light at all  in one of them was a woman in foul rags who sat on the ground and would not answer a question or speak a word but only looked up at us once or twice through a cobweb of tangled hair as if to see what casual thing it might be that was disturbing with sound and light the meaningless dull dream that was become her life after that she sat bowed with her dirtcaked fingers idly interlocked in her lap and gave no further sign  this poor rack of bones was a woman of middle age apparently but only apparently she had been there nine years and was eighteen when she entered  she was a commoner and had been sent here on her bridal night by sir breuse sance pite a neighboring lord whose vassal her father was and to which said lord she had refused what has since been called le droit du seigneur and moreover had opposed violence to violence and spilt half a gill of his almost sacred blood  the young husband had interfered at that point believing the brides life in danger and had flung the noble out into the midst of the humble and trembling wedding guests in the parlor and left him there astonished at this strange treatment and implacably embittered against both bride and groom  the said lord being cramped for dungeonroom had asked the queen to accommodate his two criminals and here in her bastile they had been ever since hither indeed they had come before their crime was an hour old and had never seen each other since  here they were kenneled like toads in the same rock they had passed nine pitch dark years within fifty feet of each other yet neither knew whether the other was alive or not all the first years their only question had beenasked with beseechings and tears that might have moved stones in time perhaps but hearts are not stones is he alive  is she alive but they had never got an answer and at last that question was not asked any moreor any other  i wanted to see the man after hearing all this  he was thirtyfour years old and looked sixty  he sat upon a squared block of stone with his head bent down his forearms resting on his knees his long hair hanging like a fringe before his face and he was muttering to himself  he raised his chin and looked us slowly over in a listless dull way blinking with the distress of the torchlight then dropped his head and fell to muttering again and took no further notice of us  there were some pathetically suggestive dumb witnesses present  on his wrists and ankles were cicatrices old smooth scars and fastened to the stone on which he sat was a chain with manacles and fetters attached but this apparatus lay idle on the ground and was thick with rust  chains cease to be needed after the spirit has gone out of a prisoner  i could not rouse the man so i said we would take him to her and seeto the bride who was the fairest thing in the earth to him onceroses pearls and dew made flesh for him a wonderwork the masterwork of nature with eyes like no other eyes and voice like no other voice and a freshness and lithe young grace and beauty that belonged properly to the creatures of dreamsas he thoughtand to no other  the sight of her would set his stagnant blood leaping the sight of her  but it was a disappointment  they sat together on the ground and looked dimly wondering into each others faces a while with a sort of weak animal curiosity then forgot each others presence and dropped their eyes and you saw that they were away again and wandering in some far land of dreams and shadows that we know nothing about  i had them taken out and sent to their friends  the queen did not like it much  not that she felt any personal interest in the matter but she thought it disrespectful to sir breuse sance pite  however i assured her that if he found he couldnt stand it i would fix him so that he could  i set fortyseven prisoners loose out of those awful ratholes and left only one in captivity  he was a lord and had killed another lord a sort of kinsman of the queen  that other lord had ambushed him to assassinate him but this fellow had got the best of him and cut his throat  however it was not for that that i left him jailed but for maliciously destroying the only public well in one of his wretched villages  the queen was bound to hang him for killing her kinsman but i would not allow it it was no crime to kill an assassin  but i said i was willing to let her hang him for destroying the well so she concluded to put up with that as it was better than nothing  dear me for what trifling offenses the most of those fortyseven men and women were shut up there  indeed some were there for no distinct offense at all but only to gratify somebodys spite and not always the queens by any means but a friends  the newest prisoners crime was a mere remark which he had made  he said he believed that men were about all alike and one man as good as another barring clothes  he said he believed that if you were to strip the nation naked and send a stranger through the crowd he couldnt tell the king from a quack doctor nor a duke from a hotel clerk  apparently here was a man whose brains had not been reduced to an ineffectual mush by idiotic training  i set him loose and sent him to the factory  some of the cells carved in the living rock were just behind the face of the precipice and in each of these an arrowslit had been pierced outward to the daylight and so the captive had a thin ray from the blessed sun for his comfort  the case of one of these poor fellows was particularly hard  from his dusky swallows hole high up in that vast wall of native rock he could peer out through the arrowslit and see his own home off yonder in the valley and for twentytwo years he had watched it with heartache and longing through that crack  he could see the lights shine there at night and in the daytime he could see figures go in and come outhis wife and children some of them no doubt though he could not make out at that distance  in the course of years he noted festivities there and tried to rejoice and wondered if they were weddings or what they might be  and he noted funerals and they wrung his heart  he could make out the coffin but he could not determine its size and so could not tell whether it was wife or child  he could see the procession form with priests and mourners and move solemnly away bearing the secret with them  he had left behind him five children and a wife and in nineteen years he had seen five funerals issue and none of them humble enough in pomp to denote a servant  so he had lost five of his treasures there must still be one remainingone now infinitely unspeakably preciousbut which one wife or child that was the question that tortured him by night and by day asleep and awake  well to have an interest of some sort and half a ray of light when you are in a dungeon is a great support to the body and preserver of the intellect  this man was in pretty good condition yet  by the time he had finished telling me his distressful tale i was in the same state of mind that you would have been in yourself if you have got average human curiosity that is to say i was as burning up as he was to find out which member of the family it was that was left  so i took him over home myself and an amazing kind of a surprise party it was too typhoons and cyclones of frantic joy and whole niagaras of happy tears and by george we found the aforetime young matron graying toward the imminent verge of her half century and the babies all men and women and some of them married and experimenting familywise themselvesfor not a soul of the tribe was dead  conceive of the ingenious devilishness of that queen she had a special hatred for this prisoner and she had invented all those funerals herself to scorch his heart with and the sublimest stroke of genius of the whole thing was leaving the familyinvoice a funeral short so as to let him wear his poor old soul out guessing  but for me he never would have got out  morgan le fay hated him with her whole heart and she never would have softened toward him and yet his crime was committed more in thoughtlessness than deliberate depravity  he had said she had red hair  well she had but that was no way to speak of it  when redheaded people are above a certain social grade their hair is auburn  consider it among these fortyseven captives there were five whose names offenses and dates of incarceration were no longer known  one woman and four menall bent and wrinkled and mindextinguished patriarchs  they themselves had long ago forgotten these details at any rate they had mere vague theories about them nothing definite and nothing that they repeated twice in the same way  the succession of priests whose office it had been to pray daily with the captives and remind them that god had put them there for some wise purpose or other and teach them that patience humbleness and submission to oppression was what he loved to see in parties of a subordinate rank had traditions about these poor old human ruins but nothing more  these traditions went but little way for they concerned the length of the incarceration only and not the names of the offenses  and even by the help of tradition the only thing that could be proven was that none of the five had seen daylight for thirtyfive years how much longer this privation has lasted was not guessable  the king and the queen knew nothing about these poor creatures except that they were heirlooms assets inherited along with the throne from the former firm  nothing of their history had been transmitted with their persons and so the inheriting owners had considered them of no value and had felt no interest in them  i said to the queen  then why in the world didnt you set them free  the question was a puzzler  she didnt know why she hadnt the thing had never come up in her mind  so here she was forecasting the veritable history of future prisoners of the castle dif without knowing it  it seemed plain to me now that with her training those inherited prisoners were merely propertynothing more nothing less  well when we inherit property it does not occur to us to throw it away even when we do not value it  when i brought my procession of human bats up into the open world and the glare of the afternoon sunpreviously blindfolding them in charity for eyes so long untortured by lightthey were a spectacle to look at  skeletons scarecrows goblins pathetic frights every one legitimatest possible children of monarchy by the grace of god and the established church  i muttered absently  i wish i could photograph them  you have seen that kind of people who will never let on that they dont know the meaning of a new big word  the more ignorant they are the more pitifully certain they are to pretend you havent shot over their heads  the queen was just one of that sort and was always making the stupidest blunders by reason of it  she hesitated a moment then her face brightened up with sudden comprehension and she said she would do it for me  i thought to myself she why what can she know about photography but it was a poor time to be thinking  when i looked around she was moving on the procession with an axe  well she certainly was a curious one was morgan le fay  i have seen a good many kinds of women in my time but she laid over them all for variety  and how sharply characteristic of her this episode was  she had no more idea than a horse of how to photograph a procession but being in doubt it was just like her to try to do it with an axe    chapter xix  knighterrantry as a trade  sandy and i were on the road again next morning bright and early it was so good to open up ones lungs and take in whole luscious barrelsful of the blessed gods untainted dewfashioned woodlandscented air once more after suffocating body and mind for two days and nights in the moral and physical stenches of that intolerable old buzzardroost  i mean for me of course the place was all right and agreeable enough for sandy for she had been used to high life all her days  poor girl her jaws had had a wearisome rest now for a while and i was expecting to get the consequences  i was right but she had stood by me most helpfully in the castle and had mightily supported and reinforced me with gigantic foolishnesses which were worth more for the occasion than wisdoms double their size so i thought she had earned a right to work her mill for a while if she wanted to and i felt not a pang when she started it up  now turn we unto sir marhaus that rode with the damsel of thirty winter of age southward  are you going to see if you can work up another halfstretch on the trail of the cowboys sandy  even so fair my lord  go ahead then  i wont interrupt this time if i can help it begin over again start fair and shake out all your reefs and i will load my pipe and give good attention  now turn we unto sir marhaus that rode with the damsel of thirty winter of age southward  and so they came into a deep forest and by fortune they were nighted and rode along in a deep way and at the last they came into a courtelage where abode the duke of south marches and there they asked harbour  and on the morn the duke sent unto sir marhaus and bad him make him ready  and so sir marhaus arose and armed him and there was a mass sung afore him and he brake his fast and so mounted on horseback in the court of the castle there they should do the battle  so there was the duke already on horseback clean armed and his six sons by him and every each had a spear in his hand and so they encountered whereas the duke and his two sons brake their spears upon him but sir marhaus held up his spear and touched none of them  then came the four sons by couples and two of them brake their spears and so did the other two  and all this while sir marhaus touched them not  then sir marhaus ran to the duke and smote him with his spear that horse and man fell to the earth and so he served his sons  and then sir marhaus alight down and bad the duke yield him or else he would slay him  and then some of his sons recovered and would have set upon sir marhaus  then sir marhaus said to the duke cease thy sons or else i will do the uttermost to you all  when the duke saw he might not escape the death he cried to his sons and charged them to yield them to sir marhaus  and they kneeled all down and put the pommels of their swords to the knight and so he received them  and then they holp up their father and so by their common assent promised unto sir marhaus never to be foes unto king arthur and thereupon at whitsuntide after to come he and his sons and put them in the kings grace  footnote the story is borrowed language and all from the morte darthurmt  even so standeth the history fair sir boss  now ye shall wit that that very duke and his six sons are they whom but few days past you also did overcome and send to arthurs court  why sandy you cant mean it  an i speak not sooth let it be the worse for me  well well wellnow who would ever have thought it  one whole duke and six dukelets why sandy it was an elegant haul knighterrantry is a most chuckleheaded trade and it is tedious hard work too but i begin to see that there is money in it after all if you have luck  not that i would ever engage in it as a business for i wouldnt  no sound and legitimate business can be established on a basis of speculation  a successful whirl in the knighterrantry linenow what is it when you blow away the nonsense and come down to the cold facts  its just a corner in pork thats all and you cant make anything else out of it youre richyessuddenly richfor about a day maybe a week then somebody corners the market on you and down goes your bucketshop aint that so sandy  whethersoever it be that my mind miscarrieth bewraying simple language in such sort that the words do seem to come endlong and overthwart  theres no use in beating about the bush and trying to get around it that way sandy its so just as i say  i know its so  and moreover when you come right down to the bedrock knighterrantry is worse than pork for whatever happens the porks left and so somebodys benefited anyway but when the market breaks in a knighterrantry whirl and every knight in the pool passes in his checks what have you got for assets  just a rubbishpile of battered corpses and a barrel or two of busted hardware  can you call those assets  give me pork every time  am i right  ah peradventure my head being distraught by the manifold matters whereunto the confusions of these but late adventured haps and fortunings whereby not i alone nor you alone but every each of us meseemeth  no its not your head sandy  your heads all right as far as it goes but you dont know business thats where the trouble is  it unfits you to argue about business and youre wrong to be always trying  however that aside it was a good haul anyway and will breed a handsome crop of reputation in arthurs court  and speaking of the cowboys what a curious country this is for women and men that never get old  now theres morgan le fay as fresh and young as a vassar pullet to all appearances and here is this old duke of the south marches still slashing away with sword and lance at his time of life after raising such a family as he has raised  as i understand it sir gawaine killed seven of his sons and still he had six left for sir marhaus and me to take into camp  and then there was that damsel of sixty winter of age still excursioning around in her frosty bloomhow old are you sandy  it was the first time i ever struck a still place in her  the mill had shut down for repairs or something    chapter xx  the ogres castle  between six and nine we made ten miles which was plenty for a horse carrying tripleman woman and armor then we stopped for a long nooning under some trees by a limpid brook  right so came by and by a knight riding and as he drew near he made dolorous moan and by the words of it i perceived that he was cursing and swearing yet nevertheless was i glad of his coming for that i saw he bore a bulletinboard whereon in letters all of shining gold was writ      use petersons prophylactic toothbrushall the go  i was glad of his coming for even by this token i knew him for knight of mine  it was sir madok de la montaine a burly great fellow whose chief distinction was that he had come within an ace of sending sir launcelot down over his horsetail once  he was never long in a strangers presence without finding some pretext or other to let out that great fact  but there was another fact of nearly the same size which he never pushed upon anybody unasked and yet never withheld when asked that was that the reason he didnt quite succeed was that he was interrupted and sent down over horsetail himself  this innocent vast lubber did not see any particular difference between the two facts  i liked him for he was earnest in his work and very valuable  and he was so fine to look at with his broad mailed shoulders and the grand leonine set of his plumed head and his big shield with its quaint device of a gauntleted hand clutching a prophylactic toothbrush with motto try noyoudont  this was a toothwash that i was introducing  he was aweary he said and indeed he looked it but he would not alight  he said he was after the stovepolish man and with this he broke out cursing and swearing anew  the bulletinboarder referred to was sir ossaise of surluse a brave knight and of considerable celebrity on account of his having tried conclusions in a tournament once with no less a mogul than sir gaheris himselfalthough not successfully  he was of a light and laughing disposition and to him nothing in this world was serious  it was for this reason that i had chosen him to work up a stovepolish sentiment  there were no stoves yet and so there could be nothing serious about stovepolish  all that the agent needed to do was to deftly and by degrees prepare the public for the great change and have them established in predilections toward neatness against the time when the stove should appear upon the stage  sir madok was very bitter and brake out anew with cursings  he said he had cursed his soul to rags and yet he would not get down from his horse neither would he take any rest or listen to any comfort until he should have found sir ossaise and settled this account  it appeared by what i could piece together of the unprofane fragments of his statement that he had chanced upon sir ossaise at dawn of the morning and been told that if he would make a short cut across the fields and swamps and broken hills and glades he could head off a company of travelers who would be rare customers for prophylactics and toothwash  with characteristic zeal sir madok had plunged away at once upon this quest and after three hours of awful crosslot riding had overhauled his game  and behold it was the five patriarchs that had been released from the dungeons the evening before  poor old creatures it was all of twenty years since any one of them had known what it was to be equipped with any remaining snag or remnant of a tooth  blankblankblank him said sir madok an i do not stovepolish him an i may find him leave it to me for never no knight that hight ossaise or aught else may do me this disservice and bide on live an i may find him the which i have thereunto sworn a great oath this day  and with these words and others he lightly took his spear and gat him thence  in the middle of the afternoon we came upon one of those very patriarchs ourselves in the edge of a poor village he was basking in the love of relatives and friends whom he had not seen for fifty years and about him and caressing him were also descendants of his own body whom he had never seen at all till now but to him these were all strangers his memory was gone his mind was stagnant  it seemed incredible that a man could outlast half a century shut up in a dark hole like a rat but here were his old wife and some old comrades to testify to it  they could remember him as he was in the freshness and strength of his young manhood when he kissed his child and delivered it to its mothers hands and went away into that long oblivion  the people at the castle could not tell within half a generation the length of time the man had been shut up there for his unrecorded and forgotten offense but this old wife knew and so did her old child who stood there among her married sons and daughters trying to realize a father who had been to her a name a thought a formless image a tradition all her life and now was suddenly concreted into actual flesh and blood and set before her face  it was a curious situation yet it is not on that account that i have made room for it here but on account of a thing which seemed to me still more curious  to wit that this dreadful matter brought from these downtrodden people no outburst of rage against these oppressors  they had been heritors and subjects of cruelty and outrage so long that nothing could have startled them but a kindness  yes here was a curious revelation indeed of the depth to which this people had been sunk in slavery  their entire being was reduced to a monotonous dead level of patience resignation dumb uncomplaining acceptance of whatever might befall them in this life  their very imagination was dead  when you can say that of a man he has struck bottom i reckon there is no lower deep for him  i rather wished i had gone some other road  this was not the sort of experience for a statesman to encounter who was planning out a peaceful revolution in his mind  for it could not help bringing up the ungetaroundable fact that all gentle cant and philosophizing to the contrary notwithstanding no people in the world ever did achieve their freedom by goodygoody talk and moral suasion it being immutable law that all revolutions that will succeed must begin in blood whatever may answer afterward  if history teaches anything it teaches that  what this folk needed then was a reign of terror and a guillotine and i was the wrong man for them  two days later toward noon sandy began to show signs of excitement and feverish expectancy  she said we were approaching the ogres castle  i was surprised into an uncomfortable shock  the object of our quest had gradually dropped out of my mind this sudden resurrection of it made it seem quite a real and startling thing for a moment and roused up in me a smart interest  sandys excitement increased every moment and so did mine for that sort of thing is catching  my heart got to thumping  you cant reason with your heart it has its own laws and thumps about things which the intellect scorns  presently when sandy slid from the horse motioned me to stop and went creeping stealthily with her head bent nearly to her knees toward a row of bushes that bordered a declivity the thumpings grew stronger and quicker  and they kept it up while she was gaining her ambush and getting her glimpse over the declivity and also while i was creeping to her side on my knees  her eyes were burning now as she pointed with her finger and said in a panting whisper  the castle  the castle  lo where it looms  what a welcome disappointment i experienced  i said  castle  it is nothing but a pigsty a pigsty with a wattled fence around it  she looked surprised and distressed  the animation faded out of her face and during many moments she was lost in thought and silent  then  it was not enchanted aforetime she said in a musing fashion as if to herself  and how strange is this marvel and how awful that to the one perception it is enchanted and dight in a base and shameful aspect yet to the perception of the other it is not enchanted hath suffered no change but stands firm and stately still girt with its moat and waving its banners in the blue air from its towers  and god shield us how it pricks the heart to see again these gracious captives and the sorrow deepened in their sweet faces  we have tarried along and are to blame  i saw my cue  the castle was enchanted to me not to her it would be wasted time to try to argue her out of her delusion it couldnt be done i must just humor it  so i said  this is a common casethe enchanting of a thing to one eye and leaving it in its proper form to another  you have heard of it before sandy though you havent happened to experience it but no harm is done  in fact it is lucky the way it is  if these ladies were hogs to everybody and to themselves it would be necessary to break the enchantment and that might be impossible if one failed to find out the particular process of the enchantment and hazardous too for in attempting a disenchantment without the true key you are liable to err and turn your hogs into dogs and the dogs into cats the cats into rats and so on and end by reducing your materials to nothing finally or to an odorless gas which you cant followwhich of course amounts to the same thing  but here by good luck no ones eyes but mine are under the enchantment and so it is of no consequence to dissolve it these ladies remain ladies to you and to themselves and to everybody else and at the same time they will suffer in no way from my delusion for when i know that an ostensible hog is a lady that is enough for me i know how to treat her  thanks oh sweet my lord thou talkest like an angel  and i know that thou wilt deliver them for that thou art minded to great deeds and art as strong a knight of your hands and as brave to will and to do as any that is on live  i will not leave a princess in the sty sandy  are those three yonder that to my disordered eyes are starveling swineherds  the ogres are they changed also  it is most wonderful  now am i fearful for how canst thou strike with sure aim when five of their nine cubits of stature are to thee invisible  ah go warily fair sir this is a mightier emprise than i wend  you be easy sandy  all i need to know is how much of an ogre is invisible then i know how to locate his vitals  dont you be afraid i will make short work of these buncosteerers  stay where you are  i left sandy kneeling there corpsefaced but plucky and hopeful and rode down to the pigsty and struck up a trade with the swineherds  i won their gratitude by buying out all the hogs at the lump sum of sixteen pennies which was rather above latest quotations  i was just in time for the church the lord of the manor and the rest of the taxgatherers would have been along next day and swept off pretty much all the stock leaving the swineherds very short of hogs and sandy out of princesses  but now the tax people could be paid in cash and there would be a stake left besides  one of the men had ten children and he said that last year when a priest came and of his ten pigs took the fattest one for tithes the wife burst out upon him and offered him a child and said  thou beast without bowels of mercy why leave me my child yet rob me of the wherewithal to feed it  how curious  the same thing had happened in the wales of my day under this same old established church which was supposed by many to have changed its nature when it changed its disguise  i sent the three men away and then opened the sty gate and beckoned sandy to comewhich she did and not leisurely but with the rush of a prairie fire  and when i saw her fling herself upon those hogs with tears of joy running down her cheeks and strain them to her heart and kiss them and caress them and call them reverently by grand princely names i was ashamed of her ashamed of the human race  we had to drive those hogs hometen miles and no ladies were ever more fickleminded or contrary  they would stay in no road no path they broke out through the brush on all sides and flowed away in all directions over rocks and hills and the roughest places they could find  and they must not be struck or roughly accosted sandy could not bear to see them treated in ways unbecoming their rank  the troublesomest old sow of the lot had to be called my lady and your highness like the rest  it is annoying and difficult to scour around after hogs in armor  there was one small countess with an iron ring in her snout and hardly any hair on her back that was the devil for perversity  she gave me a race of an hour over all sorts of country and then we were right where we had started from having made not a rod of real progress i seized her at last by the tail and brought her along squealing when i overtook sandy she was horrified and said it was in the last degree indelicate to drag a countess by her train  we got the hogs home just at darkmost of them  the princess nerovens de morganore was missing and two of her ladies in waiting namely miss angela bohun and the demoiselle elaine courtemains the former of these two being a young black sow with a white star in her forehead and the latter a brown one with thin legs and a slight limp in the forward shank on the starboard sidea couple of the tryingest blisters to drive that i ever saw  also among the missing were several mere baronessesand i wanted them to stay missing but no all that sausagemeat had to be found so servants were sent out with torches to scour the woods and hills to that end  of course the whole drove was housed in the house and great gunswell i never saw anything like it  nor ever heard anything like it  and never smelt anything like it  it was like an insurrection in a gasometer    chapter xxi  the pilgrims  when i did get to bed at last i was unspeakably tired the stretching out and the relaxing of the longtense muscles how luxurious how delicious but that was as far as i could getsleep was out of the question for the present  the ripping and tearing and squealing of the nobility up and down the halls and corridors was pandemonium come again and kept me broad awake  being awake my thoughts were busy of course and mainly they busied themselves with sandys curious delusion  here she was as sane a person as the kingdom could produce and yet from my point of view she was acting like a crazy woman  my land the power of training of influence of education  it can bring a body up to believe anything  i had to put myself in sandys place to realize that she was not a lunatic  yes and put her in mine to demonstrate how easy it is to seem a lunatic to a person who has not been taught as you have been taught  if i had told sandy i had seen a wagon uninfluenced by enchantment spin along fifty miles an hour had seen a man unequipped with magic powers get into a basket and soar out of sight among the clouds and had listened without any necromancers help to the conversation of a person who was several hundred miles away sandy would not merely have supposed me to be crazy she would have thought she knew it  everybody around her believed in enchantments nobody had any doubts to doubt that a castle could be turned into a sty and its occupants into hogs would have been the same as my doubting among connecticut people the actuality of the telephone and its wondersand in both cases would be absolute proof of a diseased mind an unsettled reason  yes sandy was sane that must be admitted  if i also would be saneto sandy i must keep my superstitions about unenchanted and unmiraculous locomotives balloons and telephones to myself  also i believed that the world was not flat and hadnt pillars under it to support it nor a canopy over it to turn off a universe of water that occupied all space above but as i was the only person in the kingdom afflicted with such impious and criminal opinions i recognized that it would be good wisdom to keep quiet about this matter too if i did not wish to be suddenly shunned and forsaken by everybody as a madman  the next morning sandy assembled the swine in the diningroom and gave them their breakfast waiting upon them personally and manifesting in every way the deep reverence which the natives of her island ancient and modern have always felt for rank let its outward casket and the mental and moral contents be what they may i could have eaten with the hogs if i had had birth approaching my lofty official rank but i hadnt and so accepted the unavoidable slight and made no complaint  sandy and i had our breakfast at the second table  the family were not at home  i said  how many are in the family sandy and where do they keep themselves  family  yes  which family good my lord  why this family your own family  sooth to say i understand you not  i have no family  no family  why sandy isnt this your home  now how indeed might that be  i have no home  well then whose house is this  ah wit you well i would tell you an i knew myself  comeyou dont even know these people  then who invited us here  none invited us  we but came that is all  why woman this is a most extraordinary performance  the effrontery of it is beyond admiration  we blandly march into a mans house and cram it full of the only really valuable nobility the sun has yet discovered in the earth and then it turns out that we dont even know the mans name  how did you ever venture to take this extravagant liberty  i supposed of course it was your home  what will the man say  what will he say  forsooth what can he say but give thanks  thanks for what  her face was filled with a puzzled surprise  verily thou troublest mine understanding with strange words do ye dream that one of his estate is like to have the honor twice in his life to entertain company such as we have brought to grace his house withal  well nowhen you come to that  no its an even bet that this is the first time he has had a treat like this  then let him be thankful and manifest the same by grateful speech and due humility he were a dog else and the heir and ancestor of dogs  to my mind the situation was uncomfortable  it might become more so it might be a good idea to muster the hogs and move on  so i said  the day is wasting sandy  it is time to get the nobility together and be moving  wherefore fair sir and boss  we want to take them to their home dont we  la but list to him  they be of all the regions of the earth each must hie to her own home wend you we might do all these journeys in one so brief life as he hath appointed that created life and thereto death likewise with help of adam who by sin done through persuasion of his helpmeet she being wrought upon and bewrayed by the beguilements of the great enemy of man that serpent hight satan aforetime consecrated and set apart unto that evil work by overmastering spite and envy begotten in his heart through fell ambitions that did blight and mildew a nature erst so white and pure whenso it hove with the shining multitudes its brethrenborn in glade and shade of that fair heaven wherein all such as native be to that rich estate and  great scott  my lord  well you know we havent got time for this sort of thing  dont you see we could distribute these people around the earth in less time than it is going to take you to explain that we cant  we mustnt talk now we must act  you want to be careful you mustnt let your mill get the start of you that way at a time like this to business nowand sharps the word  who is to take the aristocracy home  even their friends  these will come for them from the far parts of the earth  this was lightning from a clear sky for unexpectedness and the relief of it was like pardon to a prisoner  she would remain to deliver the goods of course  well then sandy as our enterprise is handsomely and successfully ended i will go home and report and if ever another one  i also am ready i will go with thee  this was recalling the pardon  how  you will go with me  why should you  will i be traitor to my knight dost think  that were dishonor i may not part from thee until in knightly encounter in the field some overmatching champion shall fairly win and fairly wear me i were to blame an i thought that that might ever hap  elected for the long term i sighed to myself  i may as well make the best of it  so then i spoke up and said  all right let us make a start  while she was gone to cry her farewells over the pork i gave that whole peerage away to the servants  and i asked them to take a duster and dust around a little where the nobilities had mainly lodged and promenaded but they considered that that would be hardly worth while and would moreover be a rather grave departure from custom and therefore likely to make talk  a departure from customthat settled it it was a nation capable of committing any crime but that  the servants said they would follow the fashion a fashion grown sacred through immemorial observance they would scatter fresh rushes in all the rooms and halls and then the evidence of the aristocratic visitation would be no longer visible it was a kind of satire on nature it was the scientific method the geologic method it deposited the history of the family in a stratified record and the antiquary could dig through it and tell by the remains of each period what changes of diet the family had introduced successively for a hundred years  the first thing we struck that day was a procession of pilgrims it was not going our way but we joined it nevertheless for it was hourly being borne in upon me now that if i would govern this country wisely i must be posted in the details of its life and not at second hand but by personal observation and scrutiny  this company of pilgrims resembled chaucers in this that it had in it a sample of about all the upper occupations and professions the country could show and a corresponding variety of costume there were young men and old men young women and old women lively folk and grave folk  they rode upon mules and horses and there was not a sidesaddle in the party for this specialty was to remain unknown in england for nine hundred years yet  it was a pleasant friendly sociable herd pious happy merry and full of unconscious coarsenesses and innocent indecencies  what they regarded as the merry tale went the continual round and caused no more embarrassment than it would have caused in the best english society twelve centuries later  practical jokes worthy of the english wits of the first quarter of the faroff nineteenth century were sprung here and there and yonder along the line and compelled the delightedest applause and sometimes when a bright remark was made at one end of the procession and started on its travels toward the other you could note its progress all the way by the sparkling spray of laughter it threw off from its bows as it plowed along and also by the blushes of the mules in its wake  sandy knew the goal and purpose of this pilgrimage and she posted me  she said  they journey to the valley of holiness for to be blessed of the godly hermits and drink of the miraculous waters and be cleansed from sin  where is this watering place  it lieth a twoday journey hence by the borders of the land that hight the cuckoo kingdom  tell me about it  is it a celebrated place  oh of a truth yes  there be none more so  of old time there lived there an abbot and his monks  belike were none in the world more holy than these for they gave themselves to study of pious books and spoke not the one to the other or indeed to any and ate decayed herbs and naught thereto and slept hard and prayed much and washed never also they wore the same garment until it fell from their bodies through age and decay  right so came they to be known of all the world by reason of these holy austerities and visited by rich and poor and reverenced  proceed  but always there was lack of water there  whereas upon a time the holy abbot prayed and for answer a great stream of clear water burst forth by miracle in a desert place  now were the fickle monks tempted of the fiend and they wrought with their abbot unceasingly by beggings and beseechings that he would construct a bath and when he was become aweary and might not resist more he said have ye your will then and granted that they asked now mark thou what tis to forsake the ways of purity the which he loveth and wanton with such as be worldly and an offense these monks did enter into the bath and come thence washed as white as snow and lo in that moment his sign appeared in miraculous rebuke for his insulted waters ceased to flow and utterly vanished away  they fared mildly sandy considering how that kind of crime is regarded in this country  belike but it was their first sin and they had been of perfect life for long and differing in naught from the angels  prayers tears torturings of the flesh all was vain to beguile that water to flow again  even processions even burntofferings even votive candles to the virgin did fail every each of them and all in the land did marvel  how odd to find that even this industry has its financial panics and at times sees its assignats and greenbacks languish to zero and everything come to a standstill  go on sandy  and so upon a time after year and day the good abbot made humble surrender and destroyed the bath  and behold his anger was in that moment appeased and the waters gushed richly forth again and even unto this day they have not ceased to flow in that generous measure  then i take it nobody has washed since  he that would essay it could have his halter free yes and swiftly would he need it too  the community has prospered since  even from that very day  the fame of the miracle went abroad into all lands  from every land came monks to join they came even as the fishes come in shoals and the monastery added building to building and yet others to these and so spread wide its arms and took them in  and nuns came also and more again and yet more and built over against the monastery on the yon side of the vale and added building to building until mighty was that nunnery and these were friendly unto those and they joined their loving labors together and together they built a fair great foundling asylum midway of the valley between  you spoke of some hermits sandy  these have gathered there from the ends of the earth  a hermit thriveth best where there be multitudes of pilgrims  ye shall not find no hermit of no sort wanting  if any shall mention a hermit of a kind he thinketh new and not to be found but in some far strange land let him but scratch among the holes and caves and swamps that line that valley of holiness and whatsoever be his breed it skills not he shall find a sample of it there  i closed up alongside of a burly fellow with a fat goodhumored face purposing to make myself agreeable and pick up some further crumbs of fact but i had hardly more than scraped acquaintance with him when he began eagerly and awkwardly to lead up in the immemorial way to that same old anecdotethe one sir dinadan told me what time i got into trouble with sir sagramor and was challenged of him on account of it  i excused myself and dropped to the rear of the procession sad at heart willing to go hence from this troubled life this vale of tears this brief day of broken rest of cloud and storm of weary struggle and monotonous defeat and yet shrinking from the change as remembering how long eternity is and how many have wended thither who know that anecdote  early in the afternoon we overtook another procession of pilgrims but in this one was no merriment no jokes no laughter no playful ways nor any happy giddiness whether of youth or age  yet both were here both age and youth gray old men and women strong men and women of middle age young husbands young wives little boys and girls and three babies at the breast  even the children were smileless there was not a face among all these half a hundred people but was cast down and bore that set expression of hopelessness which is bred of long and hard trials and old acquaintance with despair  they were slaves  chains led from their fettered feet and their manacled hands to a soleleather belt about their waists and all except the children were also linked together in a file six feet apart by a single chain which led from collar to collar all down the line  they were on foot and had tramped three hundred miles in eighteen days upon the cheapest odds and ends of food and stingy rations of that  they had slept in these chains every night bundled together like swine  they had upon their bodies some poor rags but they could not be said to be clothed  their irons had chafed the skin from their ankles and made sores which were ulcerated and wormy  their naked feet were torn and none walked without a limp  originally there had been a hundred of these unfortunates but about half had been sold on the trip  the trader in charge of them rode a horse and carried a whip with a short handle and a long heavy lash divided into several knotted tails at the end  with this whip he cut the shoulders of any that tottered from weariness and pain and straightened them up  he did not speak the whip conveyed his desire without that  none of these poor creatures looked up as we rode along by they showed no consciousness of our presence and they made no sound but one that was the dull and awful clank of their chains from end to end of the long file as fortythree burdened feet rose and fell in unison  the file moved in a cloud of its own making  all these faces were gray with a coating of dust  one has seen the like of this coating upon furniture in unoccupied houses and has written his idle thought in it with his finger  i was reminded of this when i noticed the faces of some of those women young mothers carrying babes that were near to death and freedom how a something in their hearts was written in the dust upon their faces plain to see and lord how plain to read for it was the track of tears  one of these young mothers was but a girl and it hurt me to the heart to read that writing and reflect that it was come up out of the breast of such a child a breast that ought not to know trouble yet but only the gladness of the morning of life and no doubt  she reeled just then giddy with fatigue and down came the lash and flicked a flake of skin from her naked shoulder  it stung me as if i had been hit instead  the master halted the file and jumped from his horse  he stormed and swore at this girl and said she had made annoyance enough with her laziness and as this was the last chance he should have he would settle the account now she dropped on her knees and put up her hands and began to beg and cry and implore in a passion of terror but the master gave no attention  he snatched the child from her and then made the menslaves who were chained before and behind her throw her on the ground and hold her there and expose her body and then he laid on with his lash like a madman till her back was flayed she shrieking and struggling the while piteously  one of the men who was holding her turned away his face and for this humanity he was reviled and flogged  all our pilgrims looked on and commentedon the expert way in which the whip was handled  they were too much hardened by lifelong everyday familiarity with slavery to notice that there was anything else in the exhibition that invited comment  this was what slavery could do in the way of ossifying what one may call the superior lobe of human feeling for these pilgrims were kindhearted people and they would not have allowed that man to treat a horse like that  i wanted to stop the whole thing and set the slaves free but that would not do  i must not interfere too much and get myself a name for riding over the countrys laws and the citizens rights roughshod  if i lived and prospered i would be the death of slavery that i was resolved upon but i would try to fix it so that when i became its executioner it should be by command of the nation  just here was the wayside shop of a smith and now arrived a landed proprietor who had bought this girl a few miles back deliverable here where her irons could be taken off  they were removed then there was a squabble between the gentleman and the dealer as to which should pay the blacksmith  the moment the girl was delivered from her irons she flung herself all tears and frantic sobbings into the arms of the slave who had turned away his face when she was whipped  he strained her to his breast and smothered her face and the childs with kisses and washed them with the rain of his tears  i suspected  i inquired  yes i was right it was husband and wife  they had to be torn apart by force the girl had to be dragged away and she struggled and fought and shrieked like one gone mad till a turn of the road hid her from sight and even after that we could still make out the fading plaint of those receding shrieks  and the husband and father with his wife and child gone never to be seen by him again in lifewell the look of him one might not bear at all and so i turned away but i knew i should never get his picture out of my mind again and there it is to this day to wring my heartstrings whenever i think of it  we put up at the inn in a village just at nightfall and when i rose next morning and looked abroad i was ware where a knight came riding in the golden glory of the new day and recognized him for knight of minesir ozana le cure hardy  he was in the gentlemens furnishing line and his missionarying specialty was plug hats  he was clothed all in steel in the beautifulest armor of the timeup to where his helmet ought to have been but he hadnt any helmet he wore a shiny stovepipe hat and was ridiculous a spectacle as one might want to see  it was another of my surreptitious schemes for extinguishing knighthood by making it grotesque and absurd  sir ozanas saddle was hung about with leather hat boxes and every time he overcame a wandering knight he swore him into my service and fitted him with a plug and made him wear it  i dressed and ran down to welcome sir ozana and get his news  how is trade i asked  ye will note that i have but these four left yet were they sixteen whenas i got me from camelot  why you have certainly done nobly sir ozana  where have you been foraging of late  i am but now come from the valley of holiness please you sir  i am pointed for that place myself  is there anything stirring in the monkery more than common  by the mass ye may not question it  give him good feed boy and stint it not an thou valuest thy crown so get ye lightly to the stable and do even as i bid  sir it is parlous news i bring andbe these pilgrims  then ye may not do better good folk than gather and hear the tale i have to tell sith it concerneth you forasmuch as ye go to find that ye will not find and seek that ye will seek in vain my life being hostage for my word and my word and message being these namely that a hap has happened whereof the like has not been seen no more but once this two hundred years which was the first and last time that that said misfortune strake the holy valley in that form by commandment of the most high whereto by reasons just and causes thereunto contributing wherein the matter  the miraculous fount hath ceased to flow  this shout burst from twenty pilgrim mouths at once  ye say well good people  i was verging to it even when ye spake  has somebody been washing again  nay it is suspected but none believe it  it is thought to be some other sin but none wit what  how are they feeling about the calamity  none may describe it in words  the fount is these nine days dry the prayers that did begin then and the lamentations in sackcloth and ashes and the holy processions none of these have ceased nor night nor day and so the monks and the nuns and the foundlings be all exhausted and do hang up prayers writ upon parchment sith that no strength is left in man to lift up voice  and at last they sent for thee sir boss to try magic and enchantment and if you could not come then was the messenger to fetch merlin and he is there these three days now and saith he will fetch that water though he burst the globe and wreck its kingdoms to accomplish it and right bravely doth he work his magic and call upon his hellions to hie them hither and help but not a whiff of moisture hath he started yet even so much as might qualify as mist upon a copper mirror an ye count not the barrel of sweat he sweateth betwixt sun and sun over the dire labors of his task and if ye  breakfast was ready  as soon as it was over i showed to sir ozana these words which i had written on the inside of his hat chemical department laboratory extension section g pxxp  send two of first size two of no 3 and six of no 4 together with the proper complementary detailsand two of my trained assistants  and i said  now get you to camelot as fast as you can fly brave knight and show the writing to clarence and tell him to have these required matters in the valley of holiness with all possible dispatch  i will well sir boss and he was off    chapter xxii  the holy fountain  the pilgrims were human beings  otherwise they would have acted differently  they had come a long and difficult journey and now when the journey was nearly finished and they learned that the main thing they had come for had ceased to exist they didnt do as horses or cats or angleworms would probably have doneturn back and get at something profitableno anxious as they had before been to see the miraculous fountain they were as much as forty times as anxious now to see the place where it had used to be there is no accounting for human beings  we made good time and a couple of hours before sunset we stood upon the high confines of the valley of holiness and our eyes swept it from end to end and noted its features  that is its large features  these were the three masses of buildings  they were distant and isolated temporalities shrunken to toy constructions in the lonely waste of what seemed a desertand was  such a scene is always mournful it is so impressively still and looks so steeped in death  but there was a sound here which interrupted the stillness only to add to its mournfulness this was the faint far sound of tolling bells which floated fitfully to us on the passing breeze and so faintly so softly that we hardly knew whether we heard it with our ears or with our spirits  we reached the monastery before dark and there the males were given lodging but the women were sent over to the nunnery  the bells were close at hand now and their solemn booming smote upon the ear like a message of doom  a superstitious despair possessed the heart of every monk and published itself in his ghastly face  everywhere these blackrobed softsandaled tallowvisaged specters appeared flitted about and disappeared noiseless as the creatures of a troubled dream and as uncanny  the old abbots joy to see me was pathetic  even to tears but he did the shedding himself  he said  delay not son but get to thy saving work  an we bring not the water back again and soon we are ruined and the good work of two hundred years must end  and see thou do it with enchantments that be holy for the church will not endure that work in her cause be done by devils magic  when i work father be sure there will be no devils work connected with it  i shall use no arts that come of the devil and no elements not created by the hand of god  but is merlin working strictly on pious lines  ah he said he would my son he said he would and took oath to make his promise good  well in that case let him proceed  but surely you will not sit idle by but help  it will not answer to mix methods father neither would it be professional courtesy  two of a trade must not underbid each other  we might as well cut rates and be done with it it would arrive at that in the end  merlin has the contract no other magician can touch it till he throws it up  but i will take it from him it is a terrible emergency and the act is thereby justified  and if it were not so who will give law to the church  the church giveth law to all and what she wills to do that she may do hurt whom it may  i will take it from him you shall begin upon the moment  it may not be father  no doubt as you say where power is supreme one can do as one likes and suffer no injury but we poor magicians are not so situated  merlin is a very good magician in a small way and has quite a neat provincial reputation  he is struggling along doing the best he can and it would not be etiquette for me to take his job until he himself abandons it  the abbots face lighted  ah that is simple  there are ways to persuade him to abandon it  nono father it skills not as these people say  if he were persuaded against his will he would load that well with a malicious enchantment which would balk me until i found out its secret it might take a month  i could set up a little enchantment of mine which i call the telephone and he could not find out its secret in a hundred years  yes you perceive he might block me for a month  would you like to risk a month in a dry time like this  a month  the mere thought of it maketh me to shudder  have it thy way my son  but my heart is heavy with this disappointment leave me and let me wear my spirit with weariness and waiting even as i have done these ten long days counterfeiting thus the thing that is called rest the prone body making outward sign of repose where inwardly is none  of course it would have been best all round for merlin to waive etiquette and quit and call it half a day since he would never be able to start that water for he was a true magician of the time which is to say the big miracles the ones that gave him his reputation always had the luck to be performed when nobody but merlin was present he couldnt start this well with all this crowd around to see a crowd was as bad for a magicians miracle in that day as it was for a spiritualists miracle in mine there was sure to be some skeptic on hand to turn up the gas at the crucial moment and spoil everything  but i did not want merlin to retire from the job until i was ready to take hold of it effectively myself and i could not do that until i got my things from camelot and that would take two or three days  my presence gave the monks hope and cheered them up a good deal insomuch that they ate a square meal that night for the first time in ten days  as soon as their stomachs had been properly reinforced with food their spirits began to rise fast when the mead began to go round they rose faster  by the time everybody was halfseas over the holy community was in good shape to make a night of it so we stayed by the board and put it through on that line  matters got to be very jolly  good old questionable stories were told that made the tears run down and cavernous mouths stand wide and the round bellies shake with laughter and questionable songs were bellowed out in a mighty chorus that drowned the boom of the tolling bells  at last i ventured a story myself and vast was the success of it not right off of course for the native of those islands does not as a rule dissolve upon the early applications of a humorous thing but the fifth time i told it they began to crack in places the eight time i told it they began to crumble at the twelfth repetition they fell apart in chunks and at the fifteenth they disintegrated and i got a broom and swept them up  this language is figurative  those islanderswell they are slow pay at first in the matter of return for your investment of effort but in the end they make the pay of all other nations poor and small by contrast  i was at the well next day betimes  merlin was there enchanting away like a beaver but not raising the moisture  he was not in a pleasant humor and every time i hinted that perhaps this contract was a shade too hefty for a novice he unlimbered his tongue and cursed like a bishopfrench bishop of the regency days i mean  matters were about as i expected to find them  the fountain was an ordinary well it had been dug in the ordinary way and stoned up in the ordinary way  there was no miracle about it  even the lie that had created its reputation was not miraculous i could have told it myself with one hand tied behind me  the well was in a dark chamber which stood in the center of a cutstone chapel whose walls were hung with pious pictures of a workmanship that would have made a chromo feel good pictures historically commemorative of curative miracles which had been achieved by the waters when nobody was looking  that is nobody but angels they are always on deck when there is a miracle to the foreso as to get put in the picture perhaps  angels are as fond of that as a fire company look at the old masters  the wellchamber was dimly lighted by lamps the water was drawn with a windlass and chain by monks and poured into troughs which delivered it into stone reservoirs outside in the chapelwhen there was water to draw i meanand none but monks could enter the wellchamber  i entered it for i had temporary authority to do so by courtesy of my professional brother and subordinate but he hadnt entered it himself  he did everything by incantations he never worked his intellect  if he had stepped in there and used his eyes instead of his disordered mind he could have cured the well by natural means and then turned it into a miracle in the customary way but no he was an old numskull a magician who believed in his own magic and no magician can thrive who is handicapped with a superstition like that  i had an idea that the well had sprung a leak that some of the wall stones near the bottom had fallen and exposed fissures that allowed the water to escape  i measured the chain98 feet  then i called in a couple of monks locked the door took a candle and made them lower me in the bucket  when the chain was all paid out the candle confirmed my suspicion a considerable section of the wall was gone exposing a good big fissure  i almost regretted that my theory about the wells trouble was correct because i had another one that had a showy point or two about it for a miracle  i remembered that in america many centuries later when an oil well ceased to flow they used to blast it out with a dynamite torpedo  if i should find this well dry and no explanation of it i could astonish these people most nobly by having a person of no especial value drop a dynamite bomb into it  it was my idea to appoint merlin  however it was plain that there was no occasion for the bomb  one cannot have everything the way he would like it  a man has no business to be depressed by a disappointment anyway he ought to make up his mind to get even  that is what i did  i said to myself i am in no hurry i can wait that bomb will come good yet  and it did too  when i was above ground again i turned out the monks and let down a fishline the well was a hundred and fifty feet deep and there was fortyone feet of water in it  i called in a monk and asked  how deep is the well  that sir i wit not having never been told  how does the water usually stand in it  near to the top these two centuries as the testimony goeth brought down to us through our predecessors  it was trueas to recent times at leastfor there was witness to it and better witness than a monk only about twenty or thirty feet of the chain showed wear and use the rest of it was unworn and rusty  what had happened when the well gave out that other time  without doubt some practical person had come along and mended the leak and then had come up and told the abbot he had discovered by divination that if the sinful bath were destroyed the well would flow again  the leak had befallen again now and these children would have prayed and processioned and tolled their bells for heavenly succor till they all dried up and blew away and no innocent of them all would ever have thought to drop a fishline into the well or go down in it and find out what was really the matter  old habit of mind is one of the toughest things to get away from in the world  it transmits itself like physical form and feature and for a man in those days to have had an idea that his ancestors hadnt had would have brought him under suspicion of being illegitimate  i said to the monk  it is a difficult miracle to restore water in a dry well but we will try if my brother merlin fails  brother merlin is a very passable artist but only in the parlormagic line and he may not succeed in fact is not likely to succeed  but that should be nothing to his discredit the man that can do this kind of miracle knows enough to keep hotel  hotel  i mind not to have heard  of hotel  its what you call hostel  the man that can do this miracle can keep hostel  i can do this miracle i shall do this miracle yet i do not try to conceal from you that it is a miracle to tax the occult powers to the last strain  none knoweth that truth better than the brotherhood indeed for it is of record that aforetime it was parlous difficult and took a year  natheless god send you good success and to that end will we pray  as a matter of business it was a good idea to get the notion around that the thing was difficult  many a small thing has been made large by the right kind of advertising  that monk was filled up with the difficulty of this enterprise he would fill up the others in two days the solicitude would be booming  on my way home at noon i met sandy  she had been sampling the hermits  i said  i would like to do that myself  this is wednesday  is there a matinee  a which please you sir  matinee  do they keep open afternoons  who  the hermits of course  keep open  yes keep open  isnt that plain enough  do they knock off at noon  knock off  knock offyes knock off  what is the matter with knock off i never saw such a dunderhead cant you understand anything at all in plain terms do they shut up shop draw the game bank the fires  shut up shop draw  there never mind let it go you make me tired  you cant seem to understand the simplest thing  i would i might please thee sir and it is to me dole and sorrow that i fail albeit sith i am but a simple damsel and taught of none being from the cradle unbaptized in those deep waters of learning that do anoint with a sovereignty him that partaketh of that most noble sacrament investing him with reverend state to the mental eye of the humble mortal who by bar and lack of that great consecration seeth in his own unlearned estate but a symbol of that other sort of lack and loss which men do publish to the pitying eye with sackcloth trappings whereon the ashes of grief do lie bepowdered and bestrewn and so when such shall in the darkness of his mind encounter these golden phrases of high mystery these shutupshops and drawthegame and bankthefires it is but by the grace of god that he burst not for envy of the mind that can beget and tongue that can deliver so great and mellowsounding miracles of speech and if there do ensue confusion in that humbler mind and failure to divine the meanings of these wonders then if so be this miscomprehension is not vain but sooth and true wit ye well it is the very substance of worshipful dear homage and may not lightly be misprized nor had been an ye had noted this complexion of mood and mind and understood that that i would i could not and that i could not i might not nor yet nor might nor could nor mightnot nor couldnot might be by advantage turned to the desired would and so i pray you mercy of my fault and that ye will of your kindness and your charity forgive it good my master and most dear lord  i couldnt make it all outthat is the detailsbut i got the general idea and enough of it too to be ashamed  it was not fair to spring those nineteenth century technicalities upon the untutored infant of the sixth and then rail at her because she couldnt get their drift and when she was making the honest best drive at it she could too and no fault of hers that she couldnt fetch the home plate and so i apologized  then we meandered pleasantly away toward the hermit holes in sociable converse together and better friends than ever  i was gradually coming to have a mysterious and shuddery reverence for this girl nowadays whenever she pulled out from the station and got her train fairly started on one of those horizonless transcontinental sentences of hers it was borne in upon me that i was standing in the awful presence of the mother of the german language  i was so impressed with this that sometimes when she began to empty one of these sentences on me i unconsciously took the very attitude of reverence and stood uncovered and if words had been water i had been drowned sure  she had exactly the german way whatever was in her mind to be delivered whether a mere remark or a sermon or a cyclopedia or the history of a war she would get it into a single sentence or die  whenever the literary german dives into a sentence that is the last you are going to see of him till he emerges on the other side of his atlantic with his verb in his mouth  we drifted from hermit to hermit all the afternoon  it was a most strange menagerie  the chief emulation among them seemed to be to see which could manage to be the uncleanest and most prosperous with vermin  their manner and attitudes were the last expression of complacent selfrighteousness  it was one anchorites pride to lie naked in the mud and let the insects bite him and blister him unmolested it was anothers to lean against a rock all day long conspicuous to the admiration of the throng of pilgrims and pray it was anothers to go naked and crawl around on all fours it was anothers to drag about with him year in and year out eighty pounds of iron it was anothers to never lie down when he slept but to stand among the thornbushes and snore when there were pilgrims around to look a woman who had the white hair of age and no other apparel was black from crown to heel with fortyseven years of holy abstinence from water  groups of gazing pilgrims stood around all and every of these strange objects lost in reverent wonder and envious of the fleckless sanctity which these pious austerities had won for them from an exacting heaven  by and by we went to see one of the supremely great ones  he was a mighty celebrity his fame had penetrated all christendom the noble and the renowned journeyed from the remotest lands on the globe to pay him reverence  his stand was in the center of the widest part of the valley and it took all that space to hold his crowds  his stand was a pillar sixty feet high with a broad platform on the top of it  he was now doing what he had been doing every day for twenty years up therebowing his body ceaselessly and rapidly almost to his feet  it was his way of praying  i timed him with a stop watch and he made 1244 revolutions in 24 minutes and 46 seconds  it seemed a pity to have all this power going to waste it was one of the most useful motions in mechanics the pedal movement so i made a note in my memorandum book purposing some day to apply a system of elastic cords to him and run a sewing machine with it  i afterward carried out that scheme and got five years good service out of him in which time he turned out upward of eighteen thousand firstrate towlinen shirts which was ten a day  i worked him sundays and all he was going sundays the same as week days and it was no use to waste the power these shirts cost me nothing but just the mere trifle for the materialsi furnished those myself it would not have been right to make him do thatand they sold like smoke to pilgrims at a dollar and a half apiece which was the price of fifty cows or a blooded race horse in arthurdom  they were regarded as a perfect protection against sin and advertised as such by my knights everywhere with the paintpot and stencilplate insomuch that there was not a cliff or a bowlder or a dead wall in england but you could read on it at a mile distance  buy the only genuine st stylite patronized by the nobility patent applied for  there was more money in the business than one knew what to do with as it extended i brought out a line of goods suitable for kings and a nobby thing for duchesses and that sort with ruffles down the forehatch and the runninggear clewed up with a featherstitch to leeward and then hauled aft with a backstay and triced up with a halfturn in the standing rigging forward of the weathergaskets yes it was a daisy  but about that time i noticed that the motive power had taken to standing on one leg and i found that there was something the matter with the other one so i stocked the business and unloaded taking sir bors de ganis into camp financially along with certain of his friends for the works stopped within a year and the good saint got him to his rest  but he had earned it  i can say that for him  when i saw him that first timehowever his personal condition will not quite bear description here  you can read it in the lives of the saints  all the details concerning the hermits in this chapter are from leckybut greatly modified  this book not being a history but only a tale the majority of the historians frank details were too strong for reproduction in iteditor    chapter xxiii  restoration of the fountain  saturday noon i went to the well and looked on a while  merlin was still burning smokepowders and pawing the air and muttering gibberish as hard as ever but looking pretty downhearted for of course he had not started even a perspiration in that well yet finally i said  how does the thing promise by this time partner  behold i am even now busied with trial of the powerfulest enchantment known to the princes of the occult arts in the lands of the east an it fail me naught can avail  peace until i finish  he raised a smoke this time that darkened all the region and must have made matters uncomfortable for the hermits for the wind was their way and it rolled down over their dens in a dense and billowy fog  he poured out volumes of speech to match and contorted his body and sawed the air with his hands in a most extraordinary way  at the end of twenty minutes he dropped down panting and about exhausted  now arrived the abbot and several hundred monks and nuns and behind them a multitude of pilgrims and a couple of acres of foundlings all drawn by the prodigious smoke and all in a grand state of excitement  the abbot inquired anxiously for results  merlin said  if any labor of mortal might break the spell that binds these waters this which i have but just essayed had done it  it has failed whereby i do now know that that which i had feared is a truth established the sign of this failure is that the most potent spirit known to the magicians of the east and whose name none may utter and live has laid his spell upon this well  the mortal does not breathe nor ever will who can penetrate the secret of that spell and without that secret none can break it  the water will flow no more forever good father  i have done what man could  suffer me to go  of course this threw the abbot into a good deal of a consternation he turned to me with the signs of it in his face and said  ye have heard him is it true  part of it is  not all then not all  what part is true  that that spirit with the russian name has put his spell upon the well  gods wounds then are we ruined  possibly  but not certainly  ye mean not certainly  that is it  wherefore ye also mean that when he saith none can break the spell  yes when he says that he says what isnt necessarily true there are conditions under which an effort to break it may have some chancethat is some small some trifling chanceof success  the conditions  oh they are nothing difficult  only these i want the well and the surroundings for the space of half a mile entirely to myself from sunset today until i remove the banand nobody allowed to cross the ground but by my authority  are these all  yes  and you have no fear to try  oh none  one may fail of course and one may also succeed one can try and i am ready to chance it  i have my conditions  these and all others ye may name  i will issue commandment to that effect  wait said merlin with an evil smile  ye wit that he that would break this spell must know that spirits name  yes i know his name  and wit you also that to know it skills not of itself but ye must likewise pronounce it  haha  knew ye that  yes i knew that too  you had that knowledge  art a fool  are ye minded to utter that name and die  utter it  why certainly  i would utter it if it was welsh  ye are even a dead man then and i go to tell arthur  thats all right  take your gripsack and get along  the thing for you to do is to go home and work the weather john w merlin  it was a home shot and it made him wince for he was the worst weatherfailure in the kingdom  whenever he ordered up the dangersignals along the coast there was a weeks dead calm sure and every time he prophesied fair weather it rained brickbats but i kept him in the weather bureau right along to undermine his reputation  however that shot raised his bile and instead of starting home to report my death he said he would remain and enjoy it  my two experts arrived in the evening and pretty well fagged for they had traveled double tides  they had packmules along and had brought everything i neededtools pump lead pipe greek fire sheaves of big rockets roman candles colored fire sprays electric apparatus and a lot of sundrieseverything necessary for the stateliest kind of a miracle  they got their supper and a nap and about midnight we sallied out through a solitude so wholly vacant and complete that it quite overpassed the required conditions  we took possession of the well and its surroundings  my boys were experts in all sorts of things from the stoning up of a well to the constructing of a mathematical instrument  an hour before sunrise we had that leak mended in shipshape fashion and the water began to rise  then we stowed our fireworks in the chapel locked up the place and went home to bed  before the noon mass was over we were at the well again for there was a deal to do yet and i was determined to spring the miracle before midnight for business reasons for whereas a miracle worked for the church on a weekday is worth a good deal it is worth six times as much if you get it in on a sunday  in nine hours the water had risen to its customary levelthat is to say it was within twentythree feet of the top  we put in a little iron pump one of the first turned out by my works near the capital we bored into a stone reservoir which stood against the outer wall of the wellchamber and inserted a section of lead pipe that was long enough to reach to the door of the chapel and project beyond the threshold where the gushing water would be visible to the two hundred and fifty acres of people i was intending should be present on the flat plain in front of this little holy hillock at the proper time  we knocked the head out of an empty hogshead and hoisted this hogshead to the flat roof of the chapel where we clamped it down fast poured in gunpowder till it lay loosely an inch deep on the bottom then we stood up rockets in the hogshead as thick as they could loosely stand all the different breeds of rockets there are and they made a portly and imposing sheaf i can tell you  we grounded the wire of a pocket electrical battery in that powder we placed a whole magazine of greek fire on each corner of the roofblue on one corner green on another red on another and purple on the lastand grounded a wire in each  about two hundred yards off in the flat we built a pen of scantlings about four feet high and laid planks on it and so made a platform  we covered it with swell tapestries borrowed for the occasion and topped it off with the abbots own throne when you are going to do a miracle for an ignorant race you want to get in every detail that will count you want to make all the properties impressive to the public eye you want to make matters comfortable for your head guest then you can turn yourself loose and play your effects for all they are worth  i know the value of these things for i know human nature  you cant throw too much style into a miracle  it costs trouble and work and sometimes money but it pays in the end  well we brought the wires to the ground at the chapel and then brought them under the ground to the platform and hid the batteries there  we put a rope fence a hundred feet square around the platform to keep off the common multitude and that finished the work  my idea was doors open at 1030 performance to begin at 1125 sharp  i wished i could charge admission but of course that wouldnt answer  i instructed my boys to be in the chapel as early as 10 before anybody was around and be ready to man the pumps at the proper time and make the fur fly  then we went home to supper  the news of the disaster to the well had traveled far by this time and now for two or three days a steady avalanche of people had been pouring into the valley  the lower end of the valley was become one huge camp we should have a good house no question about that  criers went the rounds early in the evening and announced the coming attempt which put every pulse up to fever heat  they gave notice that the abbot and his official suite would move in state and occupy the platform at 1030 up to which time all the region which was under my ban must be clear the bells would then cease from tolling and this sign should be permission to the multitudes to close in and take their places  i was at the platform and all ready to do the honors when the abbots solemn procession hove in sightwhich it did not do till it was nearly to the rope fence because it was a starless black night and no torches permitted  with it came merlin and took a front seat on the platform he was as good as his word for once one could not see the multitudes banked together beyond the ban but they were there just the same  the moment the bells stopped those banked masses broke and poured over the line like a vast black wave and for as much as a half hour it continued to flow and then it solidified itself and you could have walked upon a pavement of human heads towell miles  we had a solemn stagewait now for about twenty minutesa thing i had counted on for effect it is always good to let your audience have a chance to work up its expectancy  at length out of the silence a noble latin chantmens voicesbroke and swelled up and rolled away into the night a majestic tide of melody  i had put that up too and it was one of the best effects i ever invented when it was finished i stood up on the platform and extended my hands abroad for two minutes with my face upliftedthat always produces a dead hushand then slowly pronounced this ghastly word with a kind of awfulness which caused hundreds to tremble and many women to faint  constantinopolitanischerdudelsackspfeifenmachersgesellschafft  just as i was moaning out the closing hunks of that word i touched off one of my electric connections and all that murky world of people stood revealed in a hideous blue glare  it was immense that effect  lots of people shrieked women curled up and quit in every direction foundlings collapsed by platoons  the abbot and the monks crossed themselves nimbly and their lips fluttered with agitated prayers  merlin held his grip but he was astonished clear down to his corns he had never seen anything to begin with that before  now was the time to pile in the effects  i lifted my hands and groaned out this wordas it were in agony  nihilistendynamittheaterkaestchenssprengungsattentaetsversuchungen  and turned on the red fire  you should have heard that atlantic of people moan and howl when that crimson hell joined the blue after sixty seconds i shouted  transvaaltruppentropentransporttrampelthiertreibertrauungsthraenen tragoedie  and lit up the green fire  after waiting only forty seconds this time i spread my arms abroad and thundered out the devastating syllables of this word of words  mekkamuselmannenmassenmenchenmoerdermohrenmuttermarmormonumentenmacher  and whirled on the purple glare  there they were all going at once red blue green purplefour furious volcanoes pouring vast clouds of radiant smoke aloft and spreading a blinding rainbowed noonday to the furthest confines of that valley  in the distance one could see that fellow on the pillar standing rigid against the background of sky his seesaw stopped for the first time in twenty years  i knew the boys were at the pump now and ready  so i said to the abbot  the time is come father  i am about to pronounce the dread name and command the spell to dissolve  you want to brace up and take hold of something  then i shouted to the people behold in another minute the spell will be broken or no mortal can break it if it break all will know it for you will see the sacred water gush from the chapel door  i stood a few moments to let the hearers have a chance to spread my announcement to those who couldnt hear and so convey it to the furthest ranks then i made a grand exhibition of extra posturing and gesturing and shouted  lo i command the fell spirit that possesses the holy fountain to now disgorge into the skies all the infernal fires that still remain in him and straightway dissolve his spell and flee hence to the pit there to lie bound a thousand years  by his own dread name i command itbgwjjilligkkk  then i touched off the hogshead of rockets and a vast fountain of dazzling lances of fire vomited itself toward the zenith with a hissing rush and burst in midsky into a storm of flashing jewels one mighty groan of terror started up from the massed people then suddenly broke into a wild hosannah of joyfor there fair and plain in the uncanny glare they saw the freed water leaping forth  the old abbot could not speak a word for tears and the chokings in his throat without utterance of any sort he folded me in his arms and mashed me  it was more eloquent than speech and harder to get over too in a country where there were really no doctors that were worth a damaged nickel  you should have seen those acres of people throw themselves down in that water and kiss it kiss it and pet it and fondle it and talk to it as if it were alive and welcome it back with the dear names they gave their darlings just as if it had been a friend who was long gone away and lost and was come home again  yes it was pretty to see and made me think more of them than i had done before  i sent merlin home on a shutter  he had caved in and gone down like a landslide when i pronounced that fearful name and had never come to since  he never had heard that name beforeneither had ibut to him it was the right one  any jumble would have been the right one  he admitted afterward that that spirits own mother could not have pronounced that name better than i did he never could understand how i survived it and i didnt tell him  it is only young magicians that give away a secret like that merlin spent three months working enchantments to try to find out the deep trick of how to pronounce that name and outlive it but he didnt arrive  when i started to the chapel the populace uncovered and fell back reverently to make a wide way for me as if i had been some kind of a superior beingand i was  i was aware of that  i took along a night shift of monks and taught them the mystery of the pump and set them to work for it was plain that a good part of the people out there were going to sit up with the water all night consequently it was but right that they should have all they wanted of it  to those monks that pump was a good deal of a miracle itself and they were full of wonder over it and of admiration too of the exceeding effectiveness of its performance  it was a great night an immense night  there was reputation in it i could hardly get to sleep for glorying over it    chapter xxiv  a rival magician  my influence in the valley of holiness was something prodigious now  it seemed worth while to try to turn it to some valuable account  the thought came to me the next morning and was suggested by my seeing one of my knights who was in the soap line come riding in  according to history the monks of this place two centuries before had been worldly minded enough to want to wash it might be that there was a leaven of this unrighteousness still remaining  so i sounded a brother  wouldnt you like a bath  he shuddered at the thoughtthe thought of the peril of it to the wellbut he said with feeling  one needs not to ask that of a poor body who has not known that blessed refreshment sith that he was a boy  would god i might wash me but it may not be fair sir tempt me not it is forbidden  and then he sighed in such a sorrowful way that i was resolved he should have at least one layer of his real estate removed if it sized up my whole influence and bankrupted the pile  so i went to the abbot and asked for a permit for this brother  he blenched at the ideai dont mean that you could see him blench for of course you couldnt see it without you scraped him and i didnt care enough about it to scrape him but i knew the blench was there just the same and within a bookcovers thickness of the surface tooblenched and trembled  he said  ah son ask aught else thou wilt and it is thine and freely granted out of a grateful heartbut this oh this  would you drive away the blessed water again  no father i will not drive it away  i have mysterious knowledge which teaches me that there was an error that other time when it was thought the institution of the bath banished the fountain a large interest began to show up in the old mans face  my knowledge informs me that the bath was innocent of that misfortune which was caused by quite another sort of sin  these are brave wordsbutbut right welcome if they be true  they are true indeed  let me build the bath again father let me build it again and the fountain shall flow forever  you promise thisyou promise it  say the wordsay you promise it  i do promise it  then will i have the first bath myself  goget ye to your work tarry not tarry not but go  i and my boys were at work straight off  the ruins of the old bath were there yet in the basement of the monastery not a stone missing  they had been left just so all these lifetimes and avoided with a pious fear as things accursed  in two days we had it all done and the water ina spacious pool of clear pure water that a body could swim in  it was running water too it came in and went out through the ancient pipes  the old abbot kept his word and was the first to try it  he went down black and shaky leaving the whole black community above troubled and worried and full of bodings but he came back white and joyful and the game was made another triumph scored  it was a good campaign that we made in that valley of holiness and i was very well satisfied and ready to move on now but i struck a disappointment  i caught a heavy cold and it started up an old lurking rheumatism of mine  of course the rheumatism hunted up my weakest place and located itself there  this was the place where the abbot put his arms about me and mashed me what time he was moved to testify his gratitude to me with an embrace  when at last i got out i was a shadow  but everybody was full of attentions and kindnesses and these brought cheer back into my life and were the right medicine to help a convalescent swiftly up toward health and strength again so i gained fast  sandy was worn out with nursing so i made up my mind to turn out and go a cruise alone leaving her at the nunnery to rest up my idea was to disguise myself as a freeman of peasant degree and wander through the country a week or two on foot  this would give me a chance to eat and lodge with the lowliest and poorest class of free citizens on equal terms  there was no other way to inform myself perfectly of their everyday life and the operation of the laws upon it  if i went among them as a gentleman there would be restraints and conventionalities which would shut me out from their private joys and troubles and i should get no further than the outside shell  one morning i was out on a long walk to get up muscle for my trip and had climbed the ridge which bordered the northern extremity of the valley when i came upon an artificial opening in the face of a low precipice and recognized it by its location as a hermitage which had often been pointed out to me from a distance as the den of a hermit of high renown for dirt and austerity  i knew he had lately been offered a situation in the great sahara where lions and sandflies made the hermitlife peculiarly attractive and difficult and had gone to africa to take possession so i thought i would look in and see how the atmosphere of this den agreed with its reputation  my surprise was great the place was newly swept and scoured then there was another surprise  back in the gloom of the cavern i heard the clink of a little bell and then this exclamation  hello central  is this you camelotbehold thou mayst glad thy heart an thou hast faith to believe the wonderful when that it cometh in unexpected guise and maketh itself manifest in impossible placeshere standeth in the flesh his mightiness the boss and with thine own ears shall ye hear him speak  now what a radical reversal of things this was what a jumbling together of extravagant incongruities what a fantastic conjunction of opposites and irreconcilablesthe home of the bogus miracle become the home of a real one the den of a mediaeval hermit turned into a telephone office  the telephone clerk stepped into the light and i recognized one of my young fellows  i said  how long has this office been established here ulfius  but since midnight fair sir boss an it please you  we saw many lights in the valley and so judged it well to make a station for that where so many lights be needs must they indicate a town of goodly size  quite right  it isnt a town in the customary sense but its a good stand anyway  do you know where you are  of that i have had no time to make inquiry for whenas my comradeship moved hence upon their labors leaving me in charge i got me to needed rest purposing to inquire when i waked and report the places name to camelot for record  well this is the valley of holiness  it didnt take i mean he didnt start at the name as i had supposed he would  he merely said  i will so report it  why the surrounding regions are filled with the noise of late wonders that have happened here  you didnt hear of them  ah ye will remember we move by night and avoid speech with all we learn naught but that we get by the telephone from camelot  why they know all about this thing  havent they told you anything about the great miracle of the restoration of a holy fountain  oh that  indeed yes  but the name of this valley doth woundily differ from the name of that one indeed to differ wider were not pos  what was that name then  the valley of hellishness  that explains it  confound a telephone anyway  it is the very demon for conveying similarities of sound that are miracles of divergence from similarity of sense  but no matter you know the name of the place now  call up camelot  he did it and had clarence sent for  it was good to hear my boys voice again  it was like being home  after some affectionate interchanges and some account of my late illness i said  what is new  the king and queen and many of the court do start even in this hour to go to your valley to pay pious homage to the waters ye have restored and cleanse themselves of sin and see the place where the infernal spirit spouted true hellflames to the clouds an ye listen sharply ye may hear me wink and hear me likewise smile a smile sith twas i that made selection of those flames from out our stock and sent them by your order  does the king know the way to this place  the kingno nor to any other in his realms mayhap but the lads that holp you with your miracle will be his guide and lead the way and appoint the places for rests at noons and sleeps at night  this will bring them herewhen  midafternoon or later the third day  anything else in the way of news  the king hath begun the raising of the standing army ye suggested to him one regiment is complete and officered  the mischief  i wanted a main hand in that myself  there is only one body of men in the kingdom that are fitted to officer a regular army  yesand now ye will marvel to know theres not so much as one west pointer in that regiment  what are you talking about  are you in earnest  it is truly as i have said  why this makes me uneasy  who were chosen and what was the method  competitive examination  indeed i know naught of the method  i but know thisthese officers be all of noble family and are bornwhat is it you call itchuckleheads  theres something wrong clarence  comfort yourself then for two candidates for a lieutenancy do travel hence with the kingyoung nobles bothand if you but wait where you are you will hear them questioned  that is news to the purpose  i will get one west pointer in anyway  mount a man and send him to that school with a message let him kill horses if necessary but he must be there before sunset tonight and say  there is no need  i have laid a ground wire to the school prithee let me connect you with it  it sounded good  in this atmosphere of telephones and lightning communication with distant regions i was breathing the breath of life again after long suffocation  i realized then what a creepy dull inanimate horror this land had been to me all these years and how i had been in such a stifled condition of mind as to have grown used to it almost beyond the power to notice it  i gave my order to the superintendent of the academy personally i also asked him to bring me some paper and a fountain pen and a box or so of safety matches  i was getting tired of doing without these conveniences  i could have them now as i wasnt going to wear armor any more at present and therefore could get at my pockets  when i got back to the monastery i found a thing of interest going on  the abbot and his monks were assembled in the great hall observing with childish wonder and faith the performances of a new magician a fresh arrival  his dress was the extreme of the fantastic as showy and foolish as the sort of thing an indian medicineman wears  he was mowing and mumbling and gesticulating and drawing mystical figures in the air and on the floorthe regular thing you know  he was a celebrity from asiaso he said and that was enough  that sort of evidence was as good as gold and passed current everywhere  how easy and cheap it was to be a great magician on this fellows terms  his specialty was to tell you what any individual on the face of the globe was doing at the moment and what he had done at any time in the past and what he would do at any time in the future  he asked if any would like to know what the emperor of the east was doing now  the sparkling eyes and the delighted rubbing of hands made eloquent answerthis reverend crowd would like to know what that monarch was at just as this moment  the fraud went through some more mummery and then made grave announcement  the high and mighty emperor of the east doth at this moment put money in the palm of a holy begging friarone two three pieces and they be all of silver  a buzz of admiring exclamations broke out all around  it is marvelous  wonderful  what study what labor to have acquired a so amazing power as this  would they like to know what the supreme lord of inde was doing yes  he told them what the supreme lord of inde was doing  then he told them what the sultan of egypt was at also what the king of the remote seas was about  and so on and so on and with each new marvel the astonishment at his accuracy rose higher and higher they thought he must surely strike an uncertain place some time but no he never had to hesitate he always knew and always with unerring precision  i saw that if this thing went on i should lose my supremacy this fellow would capture my following i should be left out in the cold  i must put a cog in his wheel and do it right away too  i said  if i might ask i should very greatly like to know what a certain person is doing  speak and freely  i will tell you  it will be difficultperhaps impossible  my art knoweth not that word  the more difficult it is the more certainly will i reveal it to you  you see i was working up the interest  it was getting pretty high too you could see that by the craning necks all around and the halfsuspended breathing  so now i climaxed it  if you make no mistakeif you tell me truly what i want to knowi will give you two hundred silver pennies  the fortune is mine  i will tell you what you would know  then tell me what i am doing with my right hand  ahh  there was a general gasp of surprise  it had not occurred to anybody in the crowdthat simple trick of inquiring about somebody who wasnt ten thousand miles away  the magician was hit hard it was an emergency that had never happened in his experience before and it corked him he didnt know how to meet it  he looked stunned confused he couldnt say a word  come i said what are you waiting for  is it possible you can answer up right off and tell what anybody on the other side of the earth is doing and yet cant tell what a person is doing who isnt three yards from you  persons behind me know what i am doing with my right handthey will indorse you if you tell correctly  he was still dumb  very well ill tell you why you dont speak up and tell it is because you dont know  you a magician  good friends this tramp is a mere fraud and liar  this distressed the monks and terrified them  they were not used to hearing these awful beings called names and they did not know what might be the consequence  there was a dead silence now superstitious bodings were in every mind  the magician began to pull his wits together and when he presently smiled an easy nonchalant smile it spread a mighty relief around for it indicated that his mood was not destructive  he said  it hath struck me speechless the frivolity of this persons speech  let all know if perchance there be any who know it not that enchanters of my degree deign not to concern themselves with the doings of any but kings princes emperors them that be born in the purple and them only  had ye asked me what arthur the great king is doing it were another matter and i had told ye but the doings of a subject interest me not  oh i misunderstood you  i thought you said anybody and so i supposed anybody includedwell anybody that is everybody  it dothanybody that is of lofty birth and the better if he be royal  that it meseemeth might well be said the abbot who saw his opportunity to smooth things and avert disaster for it were not likely that so wonderful a gift as this would be conferred for the revelation of the concerns of lesser beings than such as be born near to the summits of greatness  our arthur the king  would you know of him broke in the enchanter  most gladly yea and gratefully  everybody was full of awe and interest again right away the incorrigible idiots  they watched the incantations absorbingly and looked at me with a there now what can you say to that air when the announcement came  the king is weary with the chase and lieth in his palace these two hours sleeping a dreamless sleep  gods benison upon him said the abbot and crossed himself may that sleep be to the refreshment of his body and his soul  and so it might be if he were sleeping i said but the king is not sleeping the king rides  here was trouble againa conflict of authority  nobody knew which of us to believe i still had some reputation left  the magicians scorn was stirred and he said  lo i have seen many wonderful soothsayers and prophets and magicians in my life days but none before that could sit idle and see to the heart of things with never an incantation to help  you have lived in the woods and lost much by it  i use incantations myself as this good brotherhood are awarebut only on occasions of moment  when it comes to sarcasming i reckon i know how to keep my end up that jab made this fellow squirm  the abbot inquired after the queen and the court and got this information  they be all on sleep being overcome by fatigue like as to the king  i said  that is merely another lie  half of them are about their amusements the queen and the other half are not sleeping they ride  now perhaps you can spread yourself a little and tell us where the king and queen and all that are this moment riding with them are going  they sleep now as i said but on the morrow they will ride for they go a journey toward the sea  and where will they be the day after tomorrow at vespers  far to the north of camelot and half their journey will be done  that is another lie by the space of a hundred and fifty miles their journey will not be merely half done it will be all done and they will be here in this valley  that was a noble shot  it set the abbot and the monks in a whirl of excitement and it rocked the enchanter to his base  i followed the thing right up  if the king does not arrive i will have myself ridden on a rail if he does i will ride you on a rail instead  next day i went up to the telephone office and found that the king had passed through two towns that were on the line  i spotted his progress on the succeeding day in the same way  i kept these matters to myself  the third days reports showed that if he kept up his gait he would arrive by four in the afternoon  there was still no sign anywhere of interest in his coming there seemed to be no preparations making to receive him in state a strange thing truly  only one thing could explain this that other magician had been cutting under me sure  this was true  i asked a friend of mine a monk about it and he said yes the magician had tried some further enchantments and found out that the court had concluded to make no journey at all but stay at home  think of that  observe how much a reputation was worth in such a country these people had seen me do the very showiest bit of magic in history and the only one within their memory that had a positive value and yet here they were ready to take up with an adventurer who could offer no evidence of his powers but his mere unproven word  however it was not good politics to let the king come without any fuss and feathers at all so i went down and drummed up a procession of pilgrims and smoked out a batch of hermits and started them out at two oclock to meet him  and that was the sort of state he arrived in  the abbot was helpless with rage and humiliation when i brought him out on a balcony and showed him the head of the state marching in and never a monk on hand to offer him welcome and no stir of life or clang of joybell to glad his spirit  he took one look and then flew to rouse out his forces the next minute the bells were dinning furiously and the various buildings were vomiting monks and nuns who went swarming in a rush toward the coming procession and with them went that magician and he was on a rail too by the abbots order and his reputation was in the mud and mine was in the sky again  yes a man can keep his trademark current in such a country but he cant sit around and do it he has got to be on deck and attending to business right along    chapter xxv  a competitive examination  when the king traveled for change of air or made a progress or visited a distant noble whom he wished to bankrupt with the cost of his keep part of the administration moved with him  it was a fashion of the time  the commission charged with the examination of candidates for posts in the army came with the king to the valley whereas they could have transacted their business just as well at home  and although this expedition was strictly a holiday excursion for the king he kept some of his business functions going just the same  he touched for the evil as usual he held court in the gate at sunrise and tried cases for he was himself chief justice of the kings bench  he shone very well in this latter office  he was a wise and humane judge and he clearly did his honest best and fairestaccording to his lights  that is a large reservation  his lightsi mean his rearingoften colored his decisions  whenever there was a dispute between a noble or gentleman and a person of lower degree the kings leanings and sympathies were for the former class always whether he suspected it or not  it was impossible that this should be otherwise  the blunting effects of slavery upon the slaveholders moral perceptions are known and conceded the world over and a privileged class an aristocracy is but a band of slaveholders under another name  this has a harsh sound and yet should not be offensive to anyeven to the noble himselfunless the fact itself be an offense for the statement simply formulates a fact the repulsive feature of slavery is the thing not its name  one needs but to hear an aristocrat speak of the classes that are below him to recognizeand in but indifferently modified measure the very air and tone of the actual slaveholder and behind these are the slaveholders spirit the slaveholders blunted feeling they are the result of the same cause in both cases the possessors old and inbred custom of regarding himself as a superior being the kings judgments wrought frequent injustices but it was merely the fault of his training his natural and unalterable sympathies he was as unfitted for a judgeship as would be the average mother for the position of milkdistributor to starving children in faminetime her own children would fare a shade better than the rest  one very curious case came before the king  a young girl an orphan who had a considerable estate married a fine young fellow who had nothing  the girls property was within a seigniory held by the church  the bishop of the diocese an arrogant scion of the great nobility claimed the girls estate on the ground that she had married privately and thus had cheated the church out of one of its rights as lord of the seigniorythe one heretofore referred to as le droit du seigneur  the penalty of refusal or avoidance was confiscation  the girls defense was that the lordship of the seigniory was vested in the bishop and the particular right here involved was not transferable but must be exercised by the lord himself or stand vacated and that an older law of the church itself strictly barred the bishop from exercising it  it was a very odd case indeed  it reminded me of something i had read in my youth about the ingenious way in which the aldermen of london raised the money that built the mansion house  a person who had not taken the sacrament according to the anglican rite could not stand as a candidate for sheriff of london  thus dissenters were ineligible they could not run if asked they could not serve if elected the aldermen who without any question were yankees in disguise hit upon this neat device they passed a bylaw imposing a fine of l400 upon any one who should refuse to be a candidate for sheriff and a fine of l600 upon any person who after being elected sheriff refused to serve  then they went to work and elected a lot of dissenters one after another and kept it up until they had collected l15000 in fines and there stands the stately mansion house to this day to keep the blushing citizen in mind of a long past and lamented day when a band of yankees slipped into london and played games of the sort that has given their race a unique and shady reputation among all truly good and holy peoples that be in the earth  the girls case seemed strong to me the bishops case was just as strong  i did not see how the king was going to get out of this hole  but he got out  i append his decision  truly i find small difficulty here the matter being even a childs affair for simpleness  an the young bride had conveyed notice as in duty bound to her feudal lord and proper master and protector the bishop she had suffered no loss for the said bishop could have got a dispensation making him for temporary conveniency eligible to the exercise of his said right and thus would she have kept all she had  whereas failing in her first duty she hath by that failure failed in all for whoso clinging to a rope severeth it above his hands must fall it being no defense to claim that the rest of the rope is sound neither any deliverance from his peril as he shall find  pardy the womans case is rotten at the source  it is the decree of the court that she forfeit to the said lord bishop all her goods even to the last farthing that she doth possess and be thereto mulcted in the costs  next  here was a tragic end to a beautiful honeymoon not yet three months old  poor young creatures  they had lived these three months lapped to the lips in worldly comforts  these clothes and trinkets they were wearing were as fine and dainty as the shrewdest stretch of the sumptuary laws allowed to people of their degree and in these pretty clothes she crying on his shoulder and he trying to comfort her with hopeful words set to the music of despair they went from the judgment seat out into the world homeless bedless breadless why the very beggars by the roadsides were not so poor as they  well the king was out of the hole and on terms satisfactory to the church and the rest of the aristocracy no doubt  men write many fine and plausible arguments in support of monarchy but the fact remains that where every man in a state has a vote brutal laws are impossible  arthurs people were of course poor material for a republic because they had been debased so long by monarchy and yet even they would have been intelligent enough to make short work of that law which the king had just been administering if it had been submitted to their full and free vote  there is a phrase which has grown so common in the worlds mouth that it has come to seem to have sense and meaningthe sense and meaning implied when it is used that is the phrase which refers to this or that or the other nation as possibly being capable of selfgovernment and the implied sense of it is that there has been a nation somewhere some time or other which wasnt capable of itwasnt as able to govern itself as some selfappointed specialists were or would be to govern it  the master minds of all nations in all ages have sprung in affluent multitude from the mass of the nation and from the mass of the nation onlynot from its privileged classes and so no matter what the nations intellectual grade was whether high or low the bulk of its ability was in the long ranks of its nameless and its poor and so it never saw the day that it had not the material in abundance whereby to govern itself which is to assert an always selfproven fact that even the best governed and most free and most enlightened monarchy is still behind the best condition attainable by its people and that the same is true of kindred governments of lower grades all the way down to the lowest  king arthur had hurried up the army business altogether beyond my calculations  i had not supposed he would move in the matter while i was away and so i had not mapped out a scheme for determining the merits of officers i had only remarked that it would be wise to submit every candidate to a sharp and searching examination and privately i meant to put together a list of military qualifications that nobody could answer to but my west pointers  that ought to have been attended to before i left for the king was so taken with the idea of a standing army that he couldnt wait but must get about it at once and get up as good a scheme of examination as he could invent out of his own head  i was impatient to see what this was and to show too how much more admirable was the one which i should display to the examining board  i intimated this gently to the king and it fired his curiosity  when the board was assembled i followed him in and behind us came the candidates  one of these candidates was a bright young west pointer of mine and with him were a couple of my west point professors  when i saw the board i did not know whether to cry or to laugh the head of it was the officer known to later centuries as norroy kingatarms  the two other members were chiefs of bureaus in his department and all three were priests of course all officials who had to know how to read and write were priests  my candidate was called first out of courtesy to me and the head of the board opened on him with official solemnity  name  malease  son of  webster  websterwebster  hmimy memory faileth to recall the name  condition  weaver  weavergod keep us  the king was staggered from his summit to his foundations one clerk fainted and the others came near it  the chairman pulled himself together and said indignantly  it is sufficient  get you hence  but i appealed to the king  i begged that my candidate might be examined  the king was willing but the board who were all wellborn folk implored the king to spare them the indignity of examining the weavers son  i knew they didnt know enough to examine him anyway so i joined my prayers to theirs and the king turned the duty over to my professors  i had had a blackboard prepared and it was put up now and the circus began  it was beautiful to hear the lad lay out the science of war and wallow in details of battle and siege of supply transportation mining and countermining grand tactics big strategy and little strategy signal service infantry cavalry artillery and all about siege guns field guns gatling guns rifled guns smooth bores musket practice revolver practiceand not a solitary word of it all could these catfish make head or tail of you understandand it was handsome to see him chalk off mathematical nightmares on the blackboard that would stump the angels themselves and do it like nothing tooall about eclipses and comets and solstices and constellations and mean time and sidereal time and dinner time and bedtime and every other imaginable thing above the clouds or under them that you could harry or bullyrag an enemy with and make him wish he hadnt comeand when the boy made his military salute and stood aside at last i was proud enough to hug him and all those other people were so dazed they looked partly petrified partly drunk and wholly caught out and snowed under  i judged that the cake was ours and by a large majority  education is a great thing  this was the same youth who had come to west point so ignorant that when i asked him if a general officer should have a horse shot under him on the field of battle what ought he to do answered up naively and said  get up and brush himself  one of the young nobles was called up now  i thought i would question him a little myself  i said  can your lordship read  his face flushed indignantly and he fired this at me  takest me for a clerk  i trow i am not of a blood that  answer the question  he crowded his wrath down and made out to answer no  can you write  he wanted to resent this too but i said  you will confine yourself to the questions and make no comments you are not here to air your blood or your graces and nothing of the sort will be permitted  can you write  no  do you know the multiplication table  i wit not what ye refer to  how much is 9 times 6  it is a mystery that is hidden from me by reason that the emergency requiring the fathoming of it hath not in my lifedays occurred and so not having no need to know this thing i abide barren of the knowledge  if a trade a barrel of onions to b worth 2 pence the bushel in exchange for a sheep worth 4 pence and a dog worth a penny and c kill the dog before delivery because bitten by the same who mistook him for d what sum is still due to a from b and which party pays for the dog c or d and who gets the money if a is the penny sufficient or may he claim consequential damages in the form of additional money to represent the possible profit which might have inured from the dog and classifiable as earned increment that is to say usufruct  verily in the allwise and unknowable providence of god who moveth in mysterious ways his wonders to perform have i never heard the fellow to this question for confusion of the mind and congestion of the ducts of thought  wherefore i beseech you let the dog and the onions and these people of the strange and godless names work out their several salvations from their piteous and wonderful difficulties without help of mine for indeed their trouble is sufficient as it is whereas an i tried to help i should but damage their cause the more and yet mayhap not live myself to see the desolation wrought  what do you know of the laws of attraction and gravitation  if there be such mayhap his grace the king did promulgate them whilst that i lay sick about the beginning of the year and thereby failed to hear his proclamation  what do you know of the science of optics  i know of governors of places and seneschals of castles and sheriffs of counties and many like small offices and titles of honor but him you call the science of optics i have not heard of before peradventure it is a new dignity  yes in this country  try to conceive of this mollusk gravely applying for an official position of any kind under the sun  why he had all the earmarks of a typewriter copyist if you leave out the disposition to contribute uninvited emendations of your grammar and punctuation it was unaccountable that he didnt attempt a little help of that sort out of his majestic supply of incapacity for the job  but that didnt prove that he hadnt material in him for the disposition it only proved that he wasnt a typewriter copyist yet  after nagging him a little more i let the professors loose on him and they turned him inside out on the line of scientific war and found him empty of course  he knew somewhat about the warfare of the timebushwhacking around for ogres and bullfights in the tournament ring and such thingsbut otherwise he was empty and useless  then we took the other young noble in hand and he was the first ones twin for ignorance and incapacity  i delivered them into the hands of the chairman of the board with the comfortable consciousness that their cake was dough  they were examined in the previous order of precedence  name so please you  pertipole son of sir pertipole baron of barley mash  grandfather  also sir pertipole baron of barley mash  greatgrandfather  the same name and title  greatgreatgrandfather  we had none worshipful sir the line failing before it had reached so far back  it mattereth not  it is a good four generations and fulfilleth the requirements of the rule  fulfills what rule i asked  the rule requiring four generations of nobility or else the candidate is not eligible  a man not eligible for a lieutenancy in the army unless he can prove four generations of noble descent  even so neither lieutenant nor any other officer may be commissioned without that qualification  oh come this is an astonishing thing  what good is such a qualification as that  what good  it is a hardy question fair sir and boss since it doth go far to impugn the wisdom of even our holy mother church herself  as how  for that she hath established the selfsame rule regarding saints  by her law none may be canonized until he hath lain dead four generations  i see i seeit is the same thing  it is wonderful  in the one case a man lies deadalive four generationsmummified in ignorance and slothand that qualifies him to command live people and take their weal and woe into his impotent hands and in the other case a man lies bedded with death and worms four generations and that qualifies him for office in the celestial camp  does the kings grace approve of this strange law  the king said  why truly i see naught about it that is strange  all places of honor and of profit do belong by natural right to them that be of noble blood and so these dignities in the army are their property and would be so without this or any rule  the rule is but to mark a limit  its purpose is to keep out too recent blood which would bring into contempt these offices and men of lofty lineage would turn their backs and scorn to take them  i were to blame an i permitted this calamity  you can permit it an you are minded so to do for you have the delegated authority but that the king should do it were a most strange madness and not comprehensible to any  i yield  proceed sir chief of the heralds college  the chairman resumed as follows  by what illustrious achievement for the honor of the throne and state did the founder of your great line lift himself to the sacred dignity of the british nobility  he built a brewery  sire the board finds this candidate perfect in all the requirements and qualifications for military command and doth hold his case open for decision after due examination of his competitor  the competitor came forward and proved exactly four generations of nobility himself  so there was a tie in military qualifications that far  he stood aside a moment and sir pertipole was questioned further  of what condition was the wife of the founder of your line  she came of the highest landed gentry yet she was not noble she was gracious and pure and charitable of a blameless life and character insomuch that in these regards was she peer of the best lady in the land  that will do  stand down  he called up the competing lordling again and asked what was the rank and condition of the greatgrandmother who conferred british nobility upon your great house  she was a kings leman and did climb to that splendid eminence by her own unholpen merit from the sewer where she was born  ah this indeed is true nobility this is the right and perfect intermixture  the lieutenancy is yours fair lord  hold it not in contempt it is the humble step which will lead to grandeurs more worthy of the splendor of an origin like to thine  i was down in the bottomless pit of humiliation  i had promised myself an easy and zenithscouring triumph and this was the outcome  i was almost ashamed to look my poor disappointed cadet in the face  i told him to go home and be patient this wasnt the end  i had a private audience with the king and made a proposition i said it was quite right to officer that regiment with nobilities and he couldnt have done a wiser thing  it would also be a good idea to add five hundred officers to it in fact add as many officers as there were nobles and relatives of nobles in the country even if there should finally be five times as many officers as privates in it and thus make it the crack regiment the envied regiment the kings own regiment and entitled to fight on its own hook and in its own way and go whither it would and come when it pleased in time of war and be utterly swell and independent this would make that regiment the hearts desire of all the nobility and they would all be satisfied and happy  then we would make up the rest of the standing army out of commonplace materials and officer it with nobodies as was propernobodies selected on a basis of mere efficiencyand we would make this regiment toe the line allow it no aristocratic freedom from restraint and force it to do all the work and persistent hammering to the end that whenever the kings own was tired and wanted to go off for a change and rummage around amongst ogres and have a good time it could go without uneasiness knowing that matters were in safe hands behind it and business going to be continued at the old stand same as usual  the king was charmed with the idea  when i noticed that it gave me a valuable notion  i thought i saw my way out of an old and stubborn difficulty at last  you see the royalties of the pendragon stock were a longlived race and very fruitful  whenever a child was born to any of these and it was pretty oftenthere was wild joy in the nations mouth and piteous sorrow in the nations heart  the joy was questionable but the grief was honest  because the event meant another call for a royal grant  long was the list of these royalties and they were a heavy and steadily increasing burden upon the treasury and a menace to the crown  yet arthur could not believe this latter fact and he would not listen to any of my various projects for substituting something in the place of the royal grants  if i could have persuaded him to now and then provide a support for one of these outlying scions from his own pocket i could have made a grand todo over it and it would have had a good effect with the nation but no he wouldnt hear of such a thing  he had something like a religious passion for royal grant he seemed to look upon it as a sort of sacred swag and one could not irritate him in any way so quickly and so surely as by an attack upon that venerable institution  if i ventured to cautiously hint that there was not another respectable family in england that would humble itself to hold out the hathowever that is as far as i ever got he always cut me short there and peremptorily too  but i believed i saw my chance at last  i would form this crack regiment out of officers alonenot a single private  half of it should consist of nobles who should fill all the places up to majorgeneral and serve gratis and pay their own expenses and they would be glad to do this when they should learn that the rest of the regiment would consist exclusively of princes of the blood these princes of the blood should range in rank from lieutenantgeneral up to field marshal and be gorgeously salaried and equipped and fed by the state  moreoverand this was the master stroke it should be decreed that these princely grandees should be always addressed by a stunningly gaudy and awecompelling title which i would presently invent and they and they only in all england should be so addressed  finally all princes of the blood should have free choice join that regiment get that great title and renounce the royal grant or stay out and receive a grant  neatest touch of all unborn but imminent princes of the blood could be born into the regiment and start fair with good wages and a permanent situation upon due notice from the parents  all the boys would join i was sure of that so all existing grants would be relinquished that the newly born would always join was equally certain  within sixty days that quaint and bizarre anomaly the royal grant would cease to be a living fact and take its place among the curiosities of the past    chapter xxvi  the first newspaper  when i told the king i was going out disguised as a petty freeman to scour the country and familiarize myself with the humbler life of the people he was all afire with the novelty of the thing in a minute and was bound to take a chance in the adventure himselfnothing should stop himhe would drop everything and go alongit was the prettiest idea he had run across for many a day  he wanted to glide out the back way and start at once but i showed him that that wouldnt answer  you see he was billed for the kingsevilto touch for it i meanand it wouldnt be right to disappoint the house and it wouldnt make a delay worth considering anyway it was only a onenight stand  and i thought he ought to tell the queen he was going away  he clouded up at that and looked sad  i was sorry i had spoken especially when he said mournfully  thou forgettest that launcelot is here and where launcelot is she noteth not the going forth of the king nor what day he returneth  of course i changed the subject  yes guenever was beautiful it is true but take her all around she was pretty slack  i never meddled in these matters they werent my affair but i did hate to see the way things were going on and i dont mind saying that much  manys the time she had asked me sir boss hast seen sir launcelot about but if ever she went fretting around for the king i didnt happen to be around at the time  there was a very good layout for the kingsevil businessvery tidy and creditable  the king sat under a canopy of state about him were clustered a large body of the clergy in full canonicals conspicuous both for location and personal outfit stood marinel a hermit of the quackdoctor species to introduce the sick  all abroad over the spacious floor and clear down to the doors in a thick jumble lay or sat the scrofulous under a strong light it was as good as a tableau in fact it had all the look of being gotten up for that though it wasnt  there were eight hundred sick people present  the work was slow it lacked the interest of novelty for me because i had seen the ceremonies before the thing soon became tedious but the proprieties required me to stick it out  the doctor was there for the reason that in all such crowds there were many people who only imagined something was the matter with them and many who were consciously sound but wanted the immortal honor of fleshly contact with a king and yet others who pretended to illness in order to get the piece of coin that went with the touch  up to this time this coin had been a wee little gold piece worth about a third of a dollar  when you consider how much that amount of money would buy in that age and country and how usual it was to be scrofulous when not dead you would understand that the annual kingsevil appropriation was just the river and harbor bill of that government for the grip it took on the treasury and the chance it afforded for skinning the surplus  so i had privately concluded to touch the treasury itself for the kingsevil  i covered sixsevenths of the appropriation into the treasury a week before starting from camelot on my adventures and ordered that the other seventh be inflated into fivecent nickels and delivered into the hands of the head clerk of the kings evil department a nickel to take the place of each gold coin you see and do its work for it  it might strain the nickel some but i judged it could stand it  as a rule i do not approve of watering stock but i considered it square enough in this case for it was just a gift anyway  of course you can water a gift as much as you want to and i generally do  the old gold and silver coins of the country were of ancient and unknown origin as a rule but some of them were roman they were illshapen and seldom rounder than a moon that is a week past the full they were hammered not minted and they were so worn with use that the devices upon them were as illegible as blisters and looked like them  i judged that a sharp bright new nickel with a firstrate likeness of the king on one side of it and guenever on the other and a blooming pious motto would take the tuck out of scrofula as handy as a nobler coin and please the scrofulous fancy more and i was right  this batch was the first it was tried on and it worked to a charm  the saving in expense was a notable economy  you will see that by these figures we touched a trifle over 700 of the 800 patients at former rates this would have cost the government about 240 at the new rate we pulled through for about 35 thus saving upward of 200 at one swoop to appreciate the full magnitude of this stroke consider these other figures the annual expenses of a national government amount to the equivalent of a contribution of three days average wages of every individual of the population counting every individual as if he were a man  if you take a nation of 60000000 where average wages are 2 per day three days wages taken from each individual will provide 360000000 and pay the governments expenses  in my day in my own country this money was collected from imposts and the citizen imagined that the foreign importer paid it and it made him comfortable to think so whereas in fact it was paid by the american people and was so equally and exactly distributed among them that the annual cost to the 100millionaire and the annual cost to the sucking child of the daylaborer was precisely the sameeach paid 6  nothing could be equaler than that i reckon  well scotland and ireland were tributary to arthur and the united populations of the british islands amounted to something less than 1000000  a mechanics average wage was 3 cents a day when he paid his own keep  by this rule the national governments expenses were 90000 a year or about 250 a day thus by the substitution of nickels for gold on a kingsevil day i not only injured no one dissatisfied no one but pleased all concerned and saved fourfifths of that days national expense into the bargaina saving which would have been the equivalent of 800000 in my day in america  in making this substitution i had drawn upon the wisdom of a very remote sourcethe wisdom of my boyhoodfor the true statesman does not despise any wisdom howsoever lowly may be its origin in my boyhood i had always saved my pennies and contributed buttons to the foreign missionary cause  the buttons would answer the ignorant savage as well as the coin the coin would answer me better than the buttons all hands were happy and nobody hurt  marinel took the patients as they came  he examined the candidate if he couldnt qualify he was warned off if he could he was passed along to the king  a priest pronounced the words they shall lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover  then the king stroked the ulcers while the reading continued finally the patient graduated and got his nickelthe king hanging it around his neck himselfand was dismissed  would you think that that would cure  it certainly did  any mummery will cure if the patients faith is strong in it  up by astolat there was a chapel where the virgin had once appeared to a girl who used to herd geese around therethe girl said so herselfand they built the chapel upon that spot and hung a picture in it representing the occurrencea picture which you would think it dangerous for a sick person to approach whereas on the contrary thousands of the lame and the sick came and prayed before it every year and went away whole and sound and even the well could look upon it and live of course when i was told these things i did not believe them but when i went there and saw them i had to succumb  i saw the cures effected myself and they were real cures and not questionable i saw cripples whom i had seen around camelot for years on crutches arrive and pray before that picture and put down their crutches and walk off without a limp  there were piles of crutches there which had been left by such people as a testimony  in other places people operated on a patients mind without saying a word to him and cured him  in others experts assembled patients in a room and prayed over them and appealed to their faith and those patients went away cured  wherever you find a king who cant cure the kingsevil you can be sure that the most valuable superstition that supports his thronethe subjects belief in the divine appointment of his sovereignhas passed away  in my youth the monarchs of england had ceased to touch for the evil but there was no occasion for this diffidence they could have cured it fortynine times in fifty  well when the priest had been droning for three hours and the good king polishing the evidences and the sick were still pressing forward as plenty as ever i got to feeling intolerably bored i was sitting by an open window not far from the canopy of state for the five hundredth time a patient stood forward to have his repulsivenesses stroked again those words were being droned out they shall lay their hands on the sickwhen outside there rang clear as a clarion a note that

observable here and there but there were not enough of them to amount to anything and it was good enough arkansas proofreading anyhow and better than was needed in arthurs day and realm  as a rule the grammar was leaky and the construction more or less lame but i did not much mind these things  they are common defects of my own and one mustnt criticise other people on grounds where he cant stand perpendicular himself  i was hungry enough for literature to want to take down the whole paper at this one meal but i got only a few bites and then had to postpone because the monks around me besieged me so with eager questions what is this curious thing  what is it for  is it a handkerchiefsaddle blanketpart of a shirt  what is it made of how thin it is and how dainty and frail and how it rattles will it wear do you think and wont the rain injure it  is it writing that appears on it or is it only ornamentation  they suspected it was writing because those among them who knew how to read latin and had a smattering of greek recognized some of the letters but they could make nothing out of the result as a whole  i put my information in the simplest form i could  it is a public journal i will explain what that is another time it is not cloth it is made of paper some time i will explain what paper is  the lines on it are reading matter and not written by hand but printed by and by i will explain what printing is a thousand of these sheets have been made all exactly like this in every minute detailthey cant be told apart  then they all broke out with exclamations of surprise and admiration  a thousand  verily a mighty worka years work for many men  nomerely a days work for a man and a boy  they crossed themselves and whiffed out a protective prayer or two  ahha miracle a wonder  dark work of enchantment  i let it go at that  then i read in a low voice to as many as could crowd their shaven heads within hearing distance part of the account of the miracle of the restoration of the well and was accompanied by astonished and reverent ejaculations all through ahhh  how true  amazing amazing  these be the very haps as they happened in marvelous exactness  and might they take this strange thing in their hands and feel of it and examine itthey would be very careful  yes  so they took it handling it as cautiously and devoutly as if it had been some holy thing come from some supernatural region and gently felt of its texture caressed its pleasant smooth surface with lingering touch and scanned the mysterious characters with fascinated eyes  these grouped bent heads these charmed faces these speaking eyes how beautiful to me  for was not this my darling and was not all this mute wonder and interest and homage a most eloquent tribute and unforced compliment to it  i knew then how a mother feels when women whether strangers or friends take her new baby and close themselves about it with one eager impulse and bend their heads over it in a tranced adoration that makes all the rest of the universe vanish out of their consciousness and be as if it were not for that time  i knew how she feels and that there is no other satisfied ambition whether of king conqueror or poet that ever reaches halfway to that serene far summit or yields half so divine a contentment  during all the rest of the seance my paper traveled from group to group all up and down and about that huge hall and my happy eye was upon it always and i sat motionless steeped in satisfaction drunk with enjoyment  yes this was heaven i was tasting it once if i might never taste it more    chapter xxvii  the yankee and the king travel incognito  about bedtime i took the king to my private quarters to cut his hair and help him get the hang of the lowly raiment he was to wear the high classes wore their hair banged across the forehead but hanging to the shoulders the rest of the way around whereas the lowest ranks of commoners were banged fore and aft both the slaves were bangless and allowed their hair free growth  so i inverted a bowl over his head and cut away all the locks that hung below it i also trimmed his whiskers and mustache until they were only about a halfinch long and tried to do it inartistically and succeeded  it was a villainous disfigurement  when he got his lubberly sandals on and his long robe of coarse brown linen cloth which hung straight from his neck to his anklebones he was no longer the comeliest man in his kingdom but one of the unhandsomest and most commonplace and unattractive  we were dressed and barbered alike and could pass for small farmers or farm bailiffs or shepherds or carters yes or for village artisans if we chose our costume being in effect universal among the poor because of its strength and cheapness  i dont mean that it was really cheap to a very poor person but i do mean that it was the cheapest material there was for male attiremanufactured material you understand  we slipped away an hour before dawn and by broad sunup had made eight or ten miles and were in the midst of a sparsely settled country  i had a pretty heavy knapsack it was laden with provisionsprovisions for the king to taper down on till he could take to the coarse fare of the country without damage  i found a comfortable seat for the king by the roadside and then gave him a morsel or two to stay his stomach with  then i said i would find some water for him and strolled away  part of my project was to get out of sight and sit down and rest a little myself  it had always been my custom to stand when in his presence even at the council board except upon those rare occasions when the sitting was a very long one extending over hours then i had a trifling little backless thing which was like a reversed culvert and was as comfortable as the toothache  i didnt want to break him in suddenly but do it by degrees  we should have to sit together now when in company or people would notice but it would not be good politics for me to be playing equality with him when there was no necessity for it  i found the water some three hundred yards away and had been resting about twenty minutes when i heard voices  that is all right i thoughtpeasants going to work nobody else likely to be stirring this early  but the next moment these comers jingled into sight around a turn of the roadsmartly clad people of quality with luggagemules and servants in their train  i was off like a shot through the bushes by the shortest cut  for a while it did seem that these people would pass the king before i could get to him but desperation gives you wings you know and i canted my body forward inflated my breast and held my breath and flew i arrived  and in plenty good enough time too  pardon my king but its no time for ceremonyjump  jump to your feetsome quality are coming  is that a marvel  let them come  but my liege  you must not be seen sitting  riseand stand in humble posture while they pass  you are a peasant you know  truei had forgot it so lost was i in planning of a huge war with gaulhe was up by this time but a farm could have got up quicker if there was any kind of a boom in real estateand rightso a thought came randoming overthwart this majestic dream the which  a humbler attitude my lord the kingand quick  duck your head morestill moredroop it  he did his honest best but lord it was no great things  he looked as humble as the leaning tower at pisa  it is the most you could say of it  indeed it was such a thundering poor success that it raised wondering scowls all along the line and a gorgeous flunkey at the tail end of it raised his whip but i jumped in time and was under it when it fell and under cover of the volley of coarse laughter which followed i spoke up sharply and warned the king to take no notice  he mastered himself for the moment but it was a sore tax he wanted to eat up the procession  i said  it would end our adventures at the very start and we being without weapons could do nothing with that armed gang  if we are going to succeed in our emprise we must not only look the peasant but act the peasant  it is wisdom none can gainsay it  let us go on sir boss i will take note and learn and do the best i may  he kept his word  he did the best he could but ive seen better if you have ever seen an active heedless enterprising child going diligently out of one mischief and into another all day long and an anxious mother at its heels all the while and just saving it by a hair from drowning itself or breaking its neck with each new experiment youve seen the king and me  if i could have foreseen what the thing was going to be like i should have said no if anybody wants to make his living exhibiting a king as a peasant let him take the layout i can do better with a menagerie and last longer  and yet during the first three days i never allowed him to enter a hut or other dwelling  if he could pass muster anywhere during his early novitiate it would be in small inns and on the road so to these places we confined ourselves  yes he certainly did the best he could but what of that  he didnt improve a bit that i could see  he was always frightening me always breaking out with fresh astonishers in new and unexpected places  toward evening on the second day what does he do but blandly fetch out a dirk from inside his robe  great guns my liege where did you get that  from a smuggler at the inn yester eve  what in the world possessed you to buy it  we have escaped divers dangers by witthy witbut i have bethought me that it were but prudence if i bore a weapon too thine might fail thee in some pinch  but people of our condition are not allowed to carry arms  what would a lord sayyes or any other person of whatever condition if he caught an upstart peasant with a dagger on his person  it was a lucky thing for us that nobody came along just then i persuaded him to throw the dirk away and it was as easy as persuading a child to give up some bright fresh new way of killing itself  we walked along silent and thinking  finally the king said  when ye know that i meditate a thing inconvenient or that hath a peril in it why do you not warn me to cease from that project  it was a startling question and a puzzler  i didnt quite know how to take hold of it or what to say and so of course i ended by saying the natural thing  but sire how can i know what your thoughts are  the king stopped dead in his tracks and stared at me  i believed thou wert greater than merlin and truly in magic thou art  but prophecy is greater than magic  merlin is a prophet  i saw i had made a blunder  i must get back my lost ground after a deep reflection and careful planning i said  sire i have been misunderstood  i will explain  there are two kinds of prophecy  one is the gift to foretell things that are but a little way off the other is the gift to foretell things that are whole ages and centuries away  which is the mightier gift do you think  oh the last most surely  true  does merlin possess it  partly yes  he foretold mysteries about my birth and future kingship that were twenty years away  has he ever gone beyond that  he would not claim more i think  it is probably his limit  all prophets have their limit  the limit of some of the great prophets has been a hundred years  these are few i ween  there have been two still greater ones whose limit was four hundred and six hundred years and one whose limit compassed even seven hundred and twenty  gramercy it is marvelous  but what are these in comparison with me  they are nothing  what  canst thou truly look beyond even so vast a stretch of time as  seven hundred years  my liege as clear as the vision of an eagle does my prophetic eye penetrate and lay bare the future of this world for nearly thirteen centuries and a half  my land you should have seen the kings eyes spread slowly open and lift the earths entire atmosphere as much as an inch  that settled brer merlin  one never had any occasion to prove his facts with these people all he had to do was to state them  it never occurred to anybody to doubt the statement  now then i continued i could work both kinds of prophecy the long and the shortif i chose to take the trouble to keep in practice but i seldom exercise any but the long kind because the other is beneath my dignity  it is properer to merlins sort stumptail prophets as we call them in the profession  of course i whet up now and then and flirt out a minor prophecy but not oftenhardly ever in fact  you will remember that there was great talk when you reached the valley of holiness about my having prophesied your coming and the very hour of your arrival two or three days beforehand  indeed yes i mind it now  well i could have done it as much as forty times easier and piled on a thousand times more detail into the bargain if it had been five hundred years away instead of two or three days  how amazing that it should be so  yes a genuine expert can always foretell a thing that is five hundred years away easier than he can a thing thats only five hundred seconds off  and yet in reason it should clearly be the other way it should be five hundred times as easy to foretell the last as the first for indeed it is so close by that one uninspired might almost see it  in truth the law of prophecy doth contradict the likelihoods most strangely making the difficult easy and the easy difficult  it was a wise head  a peasants cap was no safe disguise for it you could know it for a kings under a divingbell if you could hear it work its intellect  i had a new trade now and plenty of business in it  the king was as hungry to find out everything that was going to happen during the next thirteen centuries as if he were expecting to live in them  from that time out i prophesied myself baldheaded trying to supply the demand  i have done some indiscreet things in my day but this thing of playing myself for a prophet was the worst  still it had its ameliorations  a prophet doesnt have to have any brains  they are good to have of course for the ordinary exigencies of life but they are no use in professional work  it is the restfulest vocation there is  when the spirit of prophecy comes upon you you merely cake your intellect and lay it off in a cool place for a rest and unship your jaw and leave it alone it will work itself the result is prophecy  every day a knighterrant or so came along and the sight of them fired the kings martial spirit every time  he would have forgotten himself sure and said something to them in a style a suspicious shade or so above his ostensible degree and so i always got him well out of the road in time  then he would stand and look with all his eyes and a proud light would flash from them and his nostrils would inflate like a warhorses and i knew he was longing for a brush with them  but about noon of the third day i had stopped in the road to take a precaution which had been suggested by the whipstroke that had fallen to my share two days before a precaution which i had afterward decided to leave untaken i was so loath to institute it but now i had just had a fresh reminder while striding heedlessly along with jaw spread and intellect at rest for i was prophesying i stubbed my toe and fell sprawling  i was so pale i couldnt think for a moment then i got softly and carefully up and unstrapped my knapsack i had that dynamite bomb in it done up in wool in a box  it was a good thing to have along the time would come when i could do a valuable miracle with it maybe but it was a nervous thing to have about me and i didnt like to ask the king to carry it yet i must either throw it away or think up some safe way to get along with its society  i got it out and slipped it into my scrip and just then here came a couple of knights  the king stood stately as a statue gazing toward themhad forgotten himself again of courseand before i could get a word of warning out it was time for him to skip and well that he did it too  he supposed they would turn aside  turn aside to avoid trampling peasant dirt under foot  when had he ever turned aside himselfor ever had the chance to do it if a peasant saw him or any other noble knight in time to judiciously save him the trouble  the knights paid no attention to the king at all it was his place to look out himself and if he hadnt skipped he would have been placidly ridden down and laughed at besides  the king was in a flaming fury and launched out his challenge and epithets with a most royal vigor  the knights were some little distance by now  they halted greatly surprised and turned in their saddles and looked back as if wondering if it might be worth while to bother with such scum as we  then they wheeled and started for us  not a moment must be lost  i started for them i passed them at a rattling gait and as i went by i flung out a hairlifting soulscorching thirteenjointed insult which made the kings effort poor and cheap by comparison  i got it out of the nineteenth century where they know how  they had such headway that they were nearly to the king before they could check up then frantic with rage they stood up their horses on their hind hoofs and whirled them around and the next moment here they came breast to breast  i was seventy yards off then and scrambling up a great bowlder at the roadside  when they were within thirty yards of me they let their long lances droop to a level depressed their mailed heads and so with their horsehair plumes streaming straight out behind most gallant to see this lightning express came tearing for me  when they were within fifteen yards i sent that bomb with a sure aim and it struck the ground just under the horses noses  yes it was a neat thing very neat and pretty to see  it resembled a steamboat explosion on the mississippi and during the next fifteen minutes we stood under a steady drizzle of microscopic fragments of knights and hardware and horseflesh  i say we for the king joined the audience of course as soon as he had got his breath again  there was a hole there which would afford steady work for all the people in that region for some years to come in trying to explain it i mean as for filling it up that service would be comparatively prompt and would fall to the lot of a select fewpeasants of that seignory and they wouldnt get anything for it either  but i explained it to the king myself i said it was done with a dynamite bomb  this information did him no damage because it left him as intelligent as he was before  however it was a noble miracle in his eyes and was another settler for merlin  i thought it well enough to explain that this was a miracle of so rare a sort that it couldnt be done except when the atmospheric conditions were just right  otherwise he would be encoring it every time we had a good subject and that would be inconvenient because i hadnt any more bombs along    chapter xxviii  drilling the king  on the morning of the fourth day when it was just sunrise and we had been tramping an hour in the chill dawn i came to a resolution the king must be drilled things could not go on so he must be taken in hand and deliberately and conscientiously drilled or we couldnt ever venture to enter a dwelling the very cats would know this masquerader for a humbug and no peasant  so i called a halt and said  sire as between clothes and countenance you are all right there is no discrepancy but as between your clothes and your bearing you are all wrong there is a most noticeable discrepancy  your soldierly stride your lordly portthese will not do  you stand too straight your looks are too high too confident  the cares of a kingdom do not stoop the shoulders they do not droop the chin they do not depress the high level of the eyeglance they do not put doubt and fear in the heart and hang out the signs of them in slouching body and unsure step  it is the sordid cares of the lowly born that do these things  you must learn the trick you must imitate the trademarks of poverty misery oppression insult and the other several and common inhumanities that sap the manliness out of a man and make him a loyal and proper and approved subject and a satisfaction to his masters or the very infants will know you for better than your disguise and we shall go to pieces at the first hut we stop at  pray try to walk like this  the king took careful note and then tried an imitation  pretty fairpretty fair  chin a little lower pleasethere very good  eyes too high pray dont look at the horizon look at the ground ten steps in front of you  ahthat is better that is very good  wait please you betray too much vigor too much decision you want more of a shamble  look at me pleasethis is what i mean  now you are getting it that is the ideaat least it sort of approaches it  yes that is pretty fair  but there is a great big something wanting i dont quite know what it is  please walk thirty yards so that i can get a perspective on the thing  now thenyour heads right speeds right shoulders right eyes right chin right gait carriage general style righteverythings right  and yet the fact remains the aggregates wrong  the account dont balance  do it again please  now i think i begin to see what it is  yes ive struck it  you see the genuine spiritlessness is wanting thats whats the trouble  its all amateurmechanical details all right almost to a hair everything about the delusion perfect except that it dont delude  what then must one do to prevail  let me think i cant seem to quite get at it  in fact there isnt anything that can right the matter but practice  this is a good place for it roots and stony ground to break up your stately gait a region not liable to interruption only one field and one hut in sight and they so far away that nobody could see us from there  it will be well to move a little off the road and put in the whole day drilling you sire  after the drill had gone on a little while i said  now sire imagine that we are at the door of the hut yonder and the family are before us  proceed pleaseaccost the head of the house  the king unconsciously straightened up like a monument and said with frozen austerity  varlet bring a seat and serve to me what cheer ye have  ah your grace that is not well done  in what lacketh it  these people do not call each other varlets  nay is that true  yes only those above them call them so  then must i try again  i will call him villein  nono for he may be a freeman  ahso  then peradventure i should call him goodman  that would answer your grace but it would be still better if you said friend or brother  brotherto dirt like that  ah but we are pretending to be dirt like that too  it is even true  i will say it  brother bring a seat and thereto what cheer ye have withal  now tis right  not quite not wholly right  you have asked for one not us for one not both food for one a seat for one  the king looked puzzledhe wasnt a very heavy weight intellectually his head was an hourglass it could stow an idea but it had to do it a grain at a time not the whole idea at once  would you have a seat alsoand sit  if i did not sit the man would perceive that we were only pretending to be equalsand playing the deception pretty poorly too  it is well and truly said  how wonderful is truth come it in whatsoever unexpected form it may  yes he must bring out seats and food for both and in serving us present not ewer and napkin with more show of respect to the one than to the other  and there is even yet a detail that needs correcting  he must bring nothing outside we will go inin among the dirt and possibly other repulsive thingsand take the food with the household and after the fashion of the house and all on equal terms except the man be of the serf class and finally there will be no ewer and no napkin whether he be serf or free  please walk again my liege  thereit is betterit is the best yet but not perfect  the shoulders have known no ignobler burden than iron mail and they will not stoop  give me then the bag  i will learn the spirit that goeth with burdens that have not honor  it is the spirit that stoopeth the shoulders i ween and not the weight for armor is heavy yet it is a proud burden and a man standeth straight in it nay but me no buts offer me no objections  i will have the thing strap it upon my back  he was complete now with that knapsack on and looked as little like a king as any man i had ever seen  but it was an obstinate pair of shoulders they could not seem to learn the trick of stooping with any sort of deceptive naturalness  the drill went on i prompting and correcting  now make believe you are in debt and eaten up by relentless creditors you are out of workwhich is horseshoeing let us sayand can get none and your wife is sick your children are crying because they are hungry  and so on and so on  i drilled him as representing in turn all sorts of people out of luck and suffering dire privations and misfortunes  but lord it was only just words wordsthey meant nothing in the world to him i might just as well have whistled words realize nothing vivify nothing to you unless you have suffered in your own person the thing which the words try to describe  there are wise people who talk ever so knowingly and complacently about the working classes and satisfy themselves that a days hard intellectual work is very much harder than a days hard manual toil and is righteously entitled to much bigger pay  why they really think that you know because they know all about the one but havent tried the other  but i know all about both and so far as i am concerned there isnt money enough in the universe to hire me to swing a pickaxe thirty days but i will do the hardest kind of intellectual work for just as near nothing as you can cipher it downand i will be satisfied too  intellectual work is misnamed it is a pleasure a dissipation and is its own highest reward  the poorest paid architect engineer general author sculptor painter lecturer advocate legislator actor preacher singer is constructively in heaven when he is at work and as for the musician with the fiddlebow in his hand who sits in the midst of a great orchestra with the ebbing and flowing tides of divine sound washing over himwhy certainly he is at work if you wish to call it that but lord its a sarcasm just the same  the law of work does seem utterly unfairbut there it is and nothing can change it the higher the pay in enjoyment the worker gets out of it the higher shall be his pay in cash also  and its also the very law of those transparent swindles transmissible nobility and kingship    chapter xxix  the smallpox hut  when we arrived at that hut at midafternoon we saw no signs of life about it  the field near by had been denuded of its crop some time before and had a skinned look so exhaustively had it been harvested and gleaned  fences sheds everything had a ruined look and were eloquent of poverty  no animal was around anywhere no living thing in sight  the stillness was awful it was like the stillness of death  the cabin was a onestory one whose thatch was black with age and ragged from lack of repair  the door stood a trifle ajar  we approached it stealthilyon tiptoe and at halfbreathfor that is the way ones feeling makes him do at such a time  the king knocked  we waited  no answer  knocked again  no answer  i pushed the door softly open and looked in i made out some dim forms and a woman started up from the ground and stared at me as one does who is wakened from sleep  presently she found her voice  have mercy she pleaded  all is taken nothing is left  i have not come to take anything poor woman  you are not a priest  no  nor come not from the lord of the manor  no i am a stranger  oh then for the fear of god who visits with misery and death such as be harmless tarry not here but fly  this place is under his curseand his churchs  let me come in and help youyou are sick and in trouble  i was better used to the dim light now  i could see her hollow eyes fixed upon me  i could see how emaciated she was  i tell you the place is under the churchs ban  save yourself and go before some straggler see thee here and report it  give yourself no trouble about me i dont care anything for the churchs curse  let me help you  now all good spiritsif there be any suchbless thee for that word  would god i had a sup of waterbut hold hold forget i said it and fly for there is that here that even he that feareth not the church must fear this disease whereof we die leave us thou brave good stranger and take with thee such whole and sincere blessing as them that be accursed can give  but before this i had picked up a wooden bowl and was rushing past the king on my way to the brook  it was ten yards away when i got back and entered the king was within and was opening the shutter that closed the windowhole to let in air and light the place was full of a foul stench  i put the bowl to the womans lips and as she gripped it with her eager talons the shutter came open and a strong light flooded her face  smallpox  i sprang to the king and said in his ear  out of the door on the instant sire the woman is dying of that disease that wasted the skirts of camelot two years ago  he did not budge  of a truth i shall remainand likewise help  i whispered again  king it must not be  you must go  ye mean well and ye speak not unwisely  but it were shame that a king should know fear and shame that belted knight should withhold his hand where be such as need succor  peace i will not go  it is you who must go  the churchs ban is not upon me but it forbiddeth you to be here and she will deal with you with a heavy hand an word come to her of your trespass  it was a desperate place for him to be in and might cost him his life but it was no use to argue with him  if he considered his knightly honor at stake here that was the end of argument he would stay and nothing could prevent it i was aware of that and so i dropped the subject  the woman spoke  fair sir of your kindness will ye climb the ladder there and bring me news of what ye find  be not afraid to report for times can come when even a mothers heart is past breaking being already broke  abide said the king and give the woman to eat  i will go and he put down the knapsack  i turned to start but the king had already started  he halted and looked down upon a man who lay in a dim light and had not noticed us thus far or spoken  is it your husband the king asked  yes  is he asleep  god be thanked for that one charity yesthese three hours where shall i pay to the full my gratitude for my heart is bursting with it for that sleep he sleepeth now  i said  we will be careful  we will not wake him  ah no that ye will not for he is dead  dead  yes what triumph it is to know it  none can harm him none insult him more  he is in heaven now and happy or if not there he bides in hell and is content for in that place he will find neither abbot nor yet bishop  we were boy and girl together we were man and wife these five and twenty years and never separated till this day  think how long that is to love and suffer together this morning was he out of his mind and in his fancy we were boy and girl again and wandering in the happy fields and so in that innocent glad converse wandered he far and farther still lightly gossiping and entered into those other fields we know not of and was shut away from mortal sight  and so there was no parting for in his fancy i went with him he knew not but i went with him my hand in hismy young soft hand not this withered claw  ah yes to go and know it not to separate and know it not how could one go peacefuller than that  it was his reward for a cruel life patiently borne  there was a slight noise from the direction of the dim corner where the ladder was  it was the king descending  i could see that he was bearing something in one arm and assisting himself with the other  he came forward into the light upon his breast lay a slender girl of fifteen  she was but half conscious she was dying of smallpox  here was heroism at its last and loftiest possibility its utmost summit this was challenging death in the open field unarmed with all the odds against the challenger no reward set upon the contest and no admiring world in silks and cloth of gold to gaze and applaud and yet the kings bearing was as serenely brave as it had always been in those cheaper contests where knight meets knight in equal fight and clothed in protecting steel  he was great now sublimely great  the rude statues of his ancestors in his palace should have an additioni would see to that and it would not be a mailed king killing a giant or a dragon like the rest it would be a king in commoners garb bearing death in his arms that a peasant mother might look her last upon her child and be comforted  he laid the girl down by her mother who poured out endearments and caresses from an overflowing heart and one could detect a flickering faint light of response in the childs eyes but that was all  the mother hung over her kissing her petting her and imploring her to speak but the lips only moved and no sound came i snatched my liquor flask from my knapsack but the woman forbade me and said  noshe does not suffer it is better so  it might bring her back to life  none that be so good and kind as ye are would do her that cruel hurt  for look youwhat is left to live for  her brothers are gone her father is gone her mother goeth the churchs curse is upon her and none may shelter or befriend her even though she lay perishing in the road  she is desolate  i have not asked you good heart if her sister be still on live here overhead i had no need ye had gone back else and not left the poor thing forsaken  she lieth at peace interrupted the king in a subdued voice  i would not change it  how rich is this day in happiness  ah my annis thou shalt join thy sister soonthourt on thy way and these be merciful friends that will not hinder  and so she fell to murmuring and cooing over the girl again and softly stroking her face and hair and kissing her and calling her by endearing names but there was scarcely sign of response now in the glazing eyes  i saw tears well from the kings eyes and trickle down his face  the woman noticed them too and said  ah i know that sign thoust a wife at home poor soul and you and she have gone hungry to bed manys the time that the little ones might have your crust you know what poverty is and the daily insults of your betters and the heavy hand of the church and the king  the king winced under this accidental homeshot but kept still he was learning his part and he was playing it well too for a pretty dull beginner  i struck up a diversion  i offered the woman food and liquor but she refused both  she would allow nothing to come between her and the release of death  then i slipped away and brought the dead child from aloft and laid it by her this broke her down again and there was another scene that was full of heartbreak  by and by i made another diversion and beguiled her to sketch her story  ye know it well yourselves having suffered itfor truly none of our condition in britain escape it  it is the old weary tale we fought and struggled and succeeded meaning by success that we lived and did not die more than that is not to be claimed  no troubles came that we could not outlive till this year brought them then came they all at once as one might say and overwhelmed us  years ago the lord of the manor planted certain fruit trees on our farm in the best part of it tooa grievous wrong and shame  but it was his right interrupted the king  none denieth that indeed an the law mean anything what is the lords is his and what is mine is his also  our farm was ours by lease therefore twas likewise his to do with it as he would  some little time ago three of those trees were found hewn down  our three grown sons ran frightened to report the crime well in his lordships dungeon there they lie who saith there shall they lie and rot till they confess  they have naught to confess being innocent wherefore there will they remain until they die  ye know that right well i ween  think how this left us a man a woman and two children to gather a crop that was planted by so much greater force yes and protect it night and day from pigeons and prowling animals that be sacred and must not be hurt by any of our sort  when my lords crop was nearly ready for the harvest so also was ours when his bell rang to call us to his fields to harvest his crop for nothing he would not allow that i and my two girls should count for our three captive sons but for only two of them so for the lacking one were we daily fined all this time our own crop was perishing through neglect and so both the priest and his lordship fined us because their shares of it were suffering through damage  in the end the fines ate up our cropand they took it all they took it all and made us harvest it for them without pay or food and we starving  then the worst came when i being out of my mind with hunger and loss of my boys and grief to see my husband and my little maids in rags and misery and despair uttered a deep blasphemyoh a thousand of them against the church and the churchs ways  it was ten days ago i had fallen sick with this disease and it was to the priest i said the words for he was come to chide me for lack of due humility under the chastening hand of god  he carried my trespass to his betters i was stubborn wherefore presently upon my head and upon all heads that were dear to me fell the curse of rome  since that day we are avoided shunned with horror  none has come near this hut to know whether we live or not  the rest of us were taken down  then i roused me and got up as wife and mother will  it was little they could have eaten in any case it was less than little they had to eat  but there was water and i gave them that  how they craved it and how they blessed it  but the end came yesterday my strength broke down  yesterday was the last time i ever saw my husband and this youngest child alive i have lain here all these hoursthese ages ye may saylistening listening for any sound up there that  she gave a sharp quick glance at her eldest daughter then cried out oh my darling and feebly gathered the stiffening form to her sheltering arms  she had recognized the deathrattle    chapter xxx  the tragedy of the manorhouse  at midnight all was over and we sat in the presence of four corpses  we covered them with such rags as we could find and started away fastening the door behind us  their home must be these peoples grave for they could not have christian burial or be admitted to consecrated ground  they were as dogs wild beasts lepers and no soul that valued its hope of eternal life would throw it away by meddling in any sort with these rebuked and smitten outcasts  we had not moved four steps when i caught a sound as of footsteps upon gravel  my heart flew to my throat  we must not be seen coming from that house  i plucked at the kings robe and we drew back and took shelter behind the corner of the cabin  now we are safe i said but it was a close callso to speak if the night had been lighter he might have seen us no doubt he seemed to be so near  mayhap it is but a beast and not a man at all  true  but man or beast it will be wise to stay here a minute and let it get by and out of the way  hark  it cometh hither  true again  the step was coming toward usstraight toward the hut it must be a beast then and we might as well have saved our trepidation  i was going to step out but the king laid his hand upon my arm  there was a moment of silence then we heard a soft knock on the cabin door  it made me shiver  presently the knock was repeated and then we heard these words in a guarded voice  mother  father  openwe have got free and we bring news to pale your cheeks but glad your hearts and we may not tarry but must fly  andbut they answer not  mother father  i drew the king toward the other end of the hut and whispered  comenow we can get to the road  the king hesitated was going to demur but just then we heard the door give way and knew that those desolate men were in the presence of their dead  come my liege in a moment they will strike a light and then will follow that which it would break your heart to hear  he did not hesitate this time  the moment we were in the road i ran and after a moment he threw dignity aside and followed i did not want to think of what was happening in the huti couldnt bear it i wanted to drive it out of my mind so i struck into the first subject that lay under that one in my mind  i have had the disease those people died of and so have nothing to fear but if you have not had it also  he broke in upon me to say he was in trouble and it was his conscience that was troubling him  these young men have got free they saybut how  it is not likely that their lord hath set them free  oh no i make no doubt they escaped  that is my trouble i have a fear that this is so and your suspicion doth confirm it you having the same fear  i should not call it by that name though  i do suspect that they escaped but if they did i am not sorry certainly  i am not sorry i thinkbut  what is it  what is there for one to be troubled about  if they did escape then are we bound in duty to lay hands upon them and deliver them again to their lord for it is not seemly that one of his quality should suffer a so insolent and highhanded outrage from persons of their base degree  there it was again  he could see only one side of it  he was born so educated so his veins were full of ancestral blood that was rotten with this sort of unconscious brutality brought down by inheritance from a long procession of hearts that had each done its share toward poisoning the stream  to imprison these men without proof and starve their kindred was no harm for they were merely peasants and subject to the will and pleasure of their lord no matter what fearful form it might take but for these men to break out of unjust captivity was insult and outrage and a thing not to be countenanced by any conscientious person who knew his duty to his sacred caste  i worked more than half an hour before i got him to change the subjectand even then an outside matter did it for me  this was a something which caught our eyes as we struck the summit of a small hilla red glow a good way off  thats a fire said i  fires interested me considerably because i was getting a good deal of an insurance business started and was also training some horses and building some steam fireengines with an eye to a paid fire department by and by  the priests opposed both my fire and life insurance on the ground that it was an insolent attempt to hinder the decrees of god and if you pointed out that they did not hinder the decrees in the least but only modified the hard consequences of them if you took out policies and had luck they retorted that that was gambling against the decrees of god and was just as bad  so they managed to damage those industries more or less but i got even on my accident business  as a rule a knight is a lummox and some times even a labrick and hence open to pretty poor arguments when they come glibly from a superstitionmonger but even he could see the practical side of a thing once in a while and so of late you couldnt clean up a tournament and pile the result without finding one of my accidenttickets in every helmet  we stood there awhile in the thick darkness and stillness looking toward the red blur in the distance and trying to make out the meaning of a faraway murmur that rose and fell fitfully on the night  sometimes it swelled up and for a moment seemed less remote but when we were hopefully expecting it to betray its cause and nature it dulled and sank again carrying its mystery with it we started down the hill in its direction and the winding road plunged us at once into almost solid darknessdarkness that was packed and crammed in between two tall forest walls  we groped along down for half a mile perhaps that murmur growing more and more distinct all the time  the coming storm threatening more and more with now and then a little shiver of wind a faint show of lightning and dull grumblings of distant thunder  i was in the lead  i ran against somethinga soft heavy something which gave slightly to the impulse of my weight at the same moment the lightning glared out and within a foot of my face was the writhing face of a man who was hanging from the limb of a tree  that is it seemed to be writhing but it was not  it was a grewsome sight straightway there was an earsplitting explosion of thunder and the bottom of heaven fell out the rain poured down in a deluge no matter we must try to cut this man down on the chance that there might be life in him yet mustnt we  the lightning came quick and sharp now and the place was alternately noonday and midnight  one moment the man would be hanging before me in an intense light and the next he was blotted out again in the darkness i told the king we must cut him down  the king at once objected  if he hanged himself he was willing to lose him property to his lord so let him be  if others hanged him belike they had the rightlet him hang  but  but me no buts but even leave him as he is  and for yet another reason  when the lightning cometh againthere look abroad  two others hanging within fifty yards of us  it is not weather meet for doing useless courtesies unto dead folk they are past thanking you  comeit is unprofitable to tarry here  there was reason in what he said so we moved on  within the next mile we counted six more hanging forms by the blaze of the lightning and altogether it was a grisly excursion  that murmur was a murmur no longer it was a roar a roar of mens voices  a man came flying by now dimly through the darkness and other men chasing him they disappeared  presently another case of the kind occurred and then another and another  then a sudden turn of the road brought us in sight of that fireit was a large manorhouse and little or nothing was left of itand everywhere men were flying and other men raging after them in pursuit  i warned the king that this was not a safe place for strangers we would better get away from the light until matters should improve  we stepped back a little and hid in the edge of the wood  from this hidingplace we saw both men and women hunted by the mob  the fearful work went on until nearly dawn  then the fire being out and the storm spent the voices and flying footsteps presently ceased and darkness and stillness reigned again  we ventured out and hurried cautiously away and although we were worn out and sleepy we kept on until we had put this place some miles behind us  then we asked hospitality at the hut of a charcoal burner and got what was to be had  a woman was up and about but the man was still asleep on a straw shakedown on the clay floor the woman seemed uneasy until i explained that we were travelers and had lost our way and been wandering in the woods all night she became talkative then and asked if we had heard of the terrible goingson at the manorhouse of abblasoure  yes we had heard of them but what we wanted now was rest and sleep  the king broke in  sell us the house and take yourselves away for we be perilous company being late come from people that died of the spotted death  it was good of him but unnecessary  one of the commonest decorations of the nation was the waffleiron face  i had early noticed that the woman and her husband were both so decorated  she made us entirely welcome and had no fears and plainly she was immensely impressed by the kings proposition for of course it was a good deal of an event in her life to run across a person of the kings humble appearance who was ready to buy a mans house for the sake of a nights lodging  it gave her a large respect for us and she strained the lean possibilities of her hovel to the utmost to make us comfortable  we slept till far into the afternoon and then got up hungry enough to make cotter fare quite palatable to the king the more particularly as it was scant in quantity  and also in variety it consisted solely of onions salt and the national black bread made out of horsefeed  the woman told us about the affair of the evening before  at ten or eleven at night when everybody was in bed the manorhouse burst into flames  the countryside swarmed to the rescue and the family were saved with one exception the master  he did not appear  everybody was frantic over this loss and two brave yeomen sacrificed their lives in ransacking the burning house seeking that valuable personage  but after a while he was foundwhat was left of himwhich was his corpse  it was in a copse three hundred yards away bound gagged stabbed in a dozen places  who had done this  suspicion fell upon a humble family in the neighborhood who had been lately treated with peculiar harshness by the baron and from these people the suspicion easily extended itself to their relatives and familiars  a suspicion was enough my lords liveried retainers proclaimed an instant crusade against these people and were promptly joined by the community in general the womans husband had been active with the mob and had not returned home until nearly dawn  he was gone now to find out what the general result had been  while we were still talking he came back from his quest  his report was revolting enough  eighteen persons hanged or butchered and two yeomen and thirteen prisoners lost in the fire  and how many prisoners were there altogether in the vaults  thirteen  then every one of them was lost  yes all  but the people arrived in time to save the family how is it they could save none of the prisoners  the man looked puzzled and said  would one unlock the vaults at such a time  marry some would have escaped  then you mean that nobody did unlock them  none went near them either to lock or unlock  it standeth to reason that the bolts were fast wherefore it was only needful to establish a watch so that if any broke the bonds he might not escape but be taken none were taken  natheless three did escape said the king and ye will do well to publish it and set justice upon their track for these murthered the baron and fired the house  i was just expecting he would come out with that  for a moment the man and his wife showed an eager interest in this news and an impatience to go out and spread it then a sudden something else betrayed itself in their faces and they began to ask questions i answered the questions myself and narrowly watched the effects produced  i was soon satisfied that the knowledge of who these three prisoners were had somehow changed the atmosphere that our hosts continued eagerness to go and spread the news was now only pretended and not real  the king did not notice the change and i was glad of that  i worked the conversation around toward other details of the nights proceedings and noted that these people were relieved to have it take that direction  the painful thing observable about all this business was the alacrity with which this oppressed community had turned their cruel hands against their own class in the interest of the common oppressor  this man and woman seemed to feel that in a quarrel between a person of their own class and his lord it was the natural and proper and rightful thing for that poor devils whole caste to side with the master and fight his battle for him without ever stopping to inquire into the rights or wrongs of the matter  this man had been out helping to hang his neighbors and had done his work with zeal and yet was aware that there was nothing against them but a mere suspicion with nothing back of it describable as evidence still neither he nor his wife seemed to see anything horrible about it  this was depressingto a man with the dream of a republic in his head  it reminded me of a time thirteen centuries away when the poor whites of our south who were always despised and frequently insulted by the slavelords around them and who owed their base condition simply to the presence of slavery in their midst were yet pusillanimously ready to side with the slavelords in all political moves for the upholding and perpetuating of slavery and did also finally shoulder their muskets and pour out their lives in an effort to prevent the destruction of that very institution which degraded them  and there was only one redeeming feature connected with that pitiful piece of history and that was that secretly the poor white did detest the slavelord and did feel his own shame  that feeling was not brought to the surface but the fact that it was there and could have been brought out under favoring circumstances was somethingin fact it was enough for it showed that a man is at bottom a man after all even if it doesnt show on the outside  well as it turned out this charcoal burner was just the twin of the southern poor white of the far future  the king presently showed impatience and said  an ye prattle here all the day justice will miscarry  think ye the criminals will abide in their fathers house  they are fleeing they are not waiting  you should look to it that a party of horse be set upon their track  the woman paled slightly but quite perceptibly and the man looked flustered and irresolute  i said  come friend i will walk a little way with you and explain which direction i think they would try to take  if they were merely resisters of the gabelle or some kindred absurdity i would try to protect them from capture but when men murder a person of high degree and likewise burn his house that is another matter  the last remark was for the kingto quiet him  on the road the man pulled his resolution together and began the march with a steady gait but there was no eagerness in it  by and by i said  what relation were these men to youcousins  he turned as white as his layer of charcoal would let him and stopped trembling  ah my god how know ye that  i didnt know it it was a chance guess  poor lads they are lost  and good lads they were too  were you actually going yonder to tell on them  he didnt quite know how to take that but he said hesitatingly  yes  then i think you are a damned scoundrel  it made him as glad as if i had called him an angel  say the good words again brother for surely ye mean that ye would not betray me an i failed of my duty  duty  there is no duty in the matter except the duty to keep still and let those men get away  theyve done a righteous deed  he looked pleased pleased and touched with apprehension at the same time  he looked up and down the road to see that no one was coming and then said in a cautious voice  from what land come you brother that you speak such perilous words and seem not to be afraid  they are not perilous words when spoken to one of my own caste i take it  you would not tell anybody i said them  i  i would be drawn asunder by wild horses first  well then let me say my say  i have no fears of your repeating it  i think devils work has been done last night upon those innocent poor people  that old baron got only what he deserved if i had my way all his kind should have the same luck  fear and depression vanished from the mans manner and gratefulness and a brave animation took their place  even though you be a spy and your words a trap for my undoing yet are they such refreshment that to hear them again and others like to them i would go to the gallows happy as having had one good feast at least in a starved life  and i will say my say now and ye may report it if ye be so minded  i helped to hang my neighbors for that it were peril to my own life to show lack of zeal in the masters cause the others helped for none other reason all rejoice today that he is dead but all do go about seemingly sorrowing and shedding the hypocrites tear for in that lies safety  i have said the words i have said the words the only ones that have ever tasted good in my mouth and the reward of that taste is sufficient  lead on an ye will be it even to the scaffold for i am ready  there it was you see  a man is a man at bottom  whole ages of abuse and oppression cannot crush the manhood clear out of him whoever thinks it a mistake is himself mistaken  yes there is plenty good enough material for a republic in the most degraded people that ever existedeven the russians plenty of manhood in themeven in the germansif one could but force it out of its timid and suspicious privacy to overthrow and trample in the mud any throne that ever was set up and any nobility that ever supported it  we should see certain things yet let us hope and believe  first a modified monarchy till arthurs days were done then the destruction of the throne nobility abolished every member of it bound out to some useful trade universal suffrage instituted and the whole government placed in the hands of the men and women of the nation there to remain  yes there was no occasion to give up my dream yet a while    chapter xxxi  marco  we strolled along in a sufficiently indolent fashion now and talked  we must dispose of about the amount of time it ought to take to go to the little hamlet of abblasoure and put justice on the track of those murderers and get back home again  and meantime i had an auxiliary interest which had never paled yet never lost its novelty for me since i had been in arthurs kingdom the behaviorborn of nice and exact subdivisions of casteof chance passersby toward each other  toward the shaven monk who trudged along with his cowl tilted back and the sweat washing down his fat jowls the coalburner was deeply reverent to the gentleman he was abject with the small farmer and the free mechanic he was cordial and gossipy and when a slave passed by with a countenance respectfully lowered this chaps nose was in the airhe couldnt even see him  well there are times when one would like to hang the whole human race and finish the farce  presently we struck an incident  a small mob of halfnaked boys and girls came tearing out of the woods scared and shrieking the eldest among them were not more than twelve or fourteen years old  they implored help but they were so beside themselves that we couldnt make out what the matter was  however we plunged into the wood they skurrying in the lead and the trouble was quickly revealed they had hanged a little fellow with a bark rope and he was kicking and struggling in the process of choking to death  we rescued him and fetched him around  it was some more human nature the admiring little folk imitating their elders they were playing mob and had achieved a success which promised to be a good deal more serious than they had bargained for  it was not a dull excursion for me  i managed to put in the time very well  i made various acquaintanceships and in my quality of stranger was able to ask as many questions as i wanted to a thing which naturally interested me as a statesman was the matter of wages  i picked up what i could under that head during the afternoon  a man who hasnt had much experience and doesnt think is apt to measure a nations prosperity or lack of prosperity by the mere size of the prevailing wages if the wages be high the nation is prosperous if low it isnt  which is an error  it isnt what sum you get its how much you can buy with it thats the important thing and its that that tells whether your wages are high in fact or only high in name  i could remember how it was in the time of our great civil war in the nineteenth century in the north a carpenter got three dollars a day gold valuation in the south he got fiftypayable in confederate shinplasters worth a dollar a bushel  in the north a suit of overalls cost three dollarsa days wages in the south it cost seventyfive which was two days wages  other things were in proportion consequently wages were twice as high in the north as they were in the south because the one wage had that much more purchasing power than the other had  yes i made various acquaintances in the hamlet and a thing that gratified me a good deal was to find our new coins in circulation lots of milrays lots of mills lots of cents a good many nickels and some silver all this among the artisans and commonalty generally yes and even some goldbut that was at the bank that is to say the goldsmiths  i dropped in there while marco the son of marco was haggling with a shopkeeper over a quarter of a pound of salt and asked for change for a twentydollar gold piece  they furnished itthat is after they had chewed the piece and rung it on the counter and tried acid on it and asked me where i got it and who i was and where i was from and where i was going to and when i expected to get there and perhaps a couple of hundred more questions and when they got aground i went right on and furnished them a lot of information voluntarily told them i owned a dog and his name was watch and my first wife was a free will baptist and her grandfather was a prohibitionist and i used to know a man who had two thumbs on each hand and a wart on the inside of his upper lip and died in the hope of a glorious resurrection and so on and so on and so on till even that hungry village questioner began to look satisfied and also a shade put out but he had to respect a man of my financial strength and so he didnt give me any lip but i noticed he took it out of his underlings which was a perfectly natural thing to do  yes they changed my twenty but i judged it strained the bank a little which was a thing to be expected for it was the same as walking into a paltry village store in the nineteenth century and requiring the boss of it to change a two thousanddollar bill for you all of a sudden  he could do it maybe but at the same time he would wonder how a small farmer happened to be carrying so much money around in his pocket which was probably this goldsmiths thought too for he followed me to the door and stood there gazing after me with reverent admiration  our new money was not only handsomely circulating but its language was already glibly in use that is to say people had dropped the names of the former moneys and spoke of things as being worth so many dollars or cents or mills or milrays now  it was very gratifying  we were progressing that was sure  i got to know several master mechanics but about the most interesting fellow among them was the blacksmith dowley  he was a live man and a brisk talker and had two journeymen and three apprentices and was doing a raging business  in fact he was getting rich hand over fist and was vastly respected  marco was very proud of having such a man for a friend  he had taken me there ostensibly to let me see the big establishment which bought so much of his charcoal but really to let me see what easy and almost familiar terms he was on with this great man  dowley and i fraternized at once i had had just such picked men splendid fellows under me in the colt arms factory  i was bound to see more of him so i invited him to come out to marcos sunday and dine with us marco was appalled and held his breath and when the grandee accepted he was so grateful that he almost forgot to be astonished at the condescension  marcos joy was exuberantbut only for a moment then he grew thoughtful then sad and when he heard me tell dowley i should have dickon the boss mason and smug the boss wheelwright out there too the coaldust on his face turned to chalk and he lost his grip  but i knew what was the matter with him it was the expense  he saw ruin before him he judged that his financial days were numbered  however on our way to invite the others i said  you must allow me to have these friends come and you must also allow me to pay the costs  his face cleared and he said with spirit  but not all of it not all of it  ye cannot well bear a burden like to this alone  i stopped him and said  now lets understand each other on the spot old friend  i am only a farm bailiff it is true but i am not poor nevertheless i have been very fortunate this yearyou would be astonished to know how i have thriven  i tell you the honest truth when i say i could squander away as many as a dozen feasts like this and never care that for the expense and i snapped my fingers  i could see myself rise a foot at a time in marcos estimation and when i fetched out those last words i was become a very tower for style and altitude  so you see you must let me have my way  you cant contribute a cent to this orgy thats settled  its grand and good of you  no it isnt  youve opened your house to jones and me in the most generous way jones was remarking upon it today just before you came back from the village for although he wouldnt be likely to say such a thing to youbecause jones isnt a talker and is diffident in societyhe has a good heart and a grateful and knows how to appreciate it when he is well treated yes you and your wife have been very hospitable toward us  ah brother tis nothingsuch hospitality  but it is something the best a man has freely given is always something and is as good as a prince can do and ranks right along beside itfor even a prince can but do his best  and so well shop around and get up this layout now and dont you worry about the expense  im one of the worst spendthrifts that ever was born  why do you know sometimes in a single week i spend but never mind about thatyoud never believe it anyway  and so we went gadding along dropping in here and there pricing things and gossiping with the shopkeepers about the riot and now and then running across pathetic reminders of it in the persons of shunned and tearful and houseless remnants of families whose homes had been taken from them and their parents butchered or hanged the raiment of marco and his wife was of coarse towlinen and linseywoolsey respectively and resembled township maps it being made up pretty exclusively of patches which had been added township by township in the course of five or six years until hardly a handsbreadth of the original garments was surviving and present now i wanted to fit these people out with new suits on account of that swell company and i didnt know just how to get at it with delicacy until at last it struck me that as i had already been liberal in inventing wordy gratitude for the king it would be just the thing to back it up with evidence of a substantial sort so i said  and marco theres another thing which you must permitout of kindness for jonesbecause you wouldnt want to offend him he was very anxious to testify his appreciation in some way but he is so diffident he couldnt venture it himself and so he begged me to buy some little things and give them to you and dame phyllis and let him pay for them without your ever knowing they came from himyou know how a delicate person feels about that sort of thing and so i said i would and we would keep mum  well his idea was a new outfit of clothes for you both  oh it is wastefulness  it may not be brother it may not be consider the vastness of the sum  hang the vastness of the sum  try to keep quiet for a moment and see how it would seem a body cant get in a word edgeways you talk so much  you ought to cure that marco it isnt good form you know and it will grow on you if you dont check it yes well step in here now and price this mans stuffand dont forget to remember to not let on to jones that you know he had anything to do with it  you cant think how curiously sensitive and proud he is  hes a farmerpretty fairly welltodo farmer and im his bailiff butthe imagination of that man  why sometimes when he forgets himself and gets to blowing off youd think he was one of the swells of the earth and you might listen to him a hundred years and never take him for a farmerespecially if he talked agriculture  he thinks hes a sheol of a farmer thinks hes old grayback from wayback but between you and me privately he dont know as much about farming as he does about running a kingdomstill whatever he talks about you want to drop your underjaw and listen the same as if you had never heard such incredible wisdom in all your life before and were afraid you might die before you got enough of it  that will please jones  it tickled marco to the marrow to hear about such an odd character but it also prepared him for accidents and in my experience when you travel with a king who is letting on to be something else and cant remember it more than about half the time you cant take too many precautions  this was the best store we had come across yet it had everything in it in small quantities from anvils and drygoods all the way down to fish and pinchbeck jewelry  i concluded i would bunch my whole invoice right here and not go pricing around any more so i got rid of marco by sending him off to invite the mason and the wheelwright which left the field free to me  for i never care to do a thing in a quiet way its got to be theatrical or i dont take any interest in it  i showed up money enough in a careless way to corral the shopkeepers respect and then i wrote down a list of the things i wanted and handed it to him to see if he could read it  he could and was proud to show that he could he said he had been educated by a priest and could both read and write  he ran it through and remarked with satisfaction that it was a pretty heavy bill  well and so it was for a little concern like that  i was not only providing a swell dinner but some odds and ends of extras  i ordered that the things be carted out and delivered at the dwelling of marco the son of marco by saturday evening and send me the bill at dinnertime sunday he said i could depend upon his promptness and exactitude it was the rule of the house  he also observed that he would throw in a couple of millerguns for the marcos gratisthat everybody was using them now  he had a mighty opinion of that clever device  i said  and please fill them up to the middle mark too and add that to the bill  he would with pleasure  he filled them and i took them with me  i couldnt venture to tell him that the millergun was a little invention of my own and that i had officially ordered that every shopkeeper in the kingdom keep them on hand and sell them at government pricewhich was the merest trifle and the shopkeeper got that not the government  we furnished them for nothing  the king had hardly missed us when we got back at nightfall  he had early dropped again into his dream of a grand invasion of gaul with the whole strength of his kingdom at his back and the afternoon had slipped away without his ever coming to himself again    chapter xxxii  dowleys humiliation  well when that cargo arrived toward sunset saturday afternoon i had my hands full to keep the marcos from fainting  they were sure jones and i were ruined past help and they blamed themselves as accessories to this bankruptcy  you see in addition to the dinnermaterials which called for a sufficiently round sum i had bought a lot of extras for the future comfort of the family for instance a big lot of wheat a delicacy as rare to the tables of their class as was icecream to a hermits also a sizeable deal dinnertable also two entire pounds of salt which was another piece of extravagance in those peoples eyes also crockery stools the clothes a small cask of beer and so on  i instructed the marcos to keep quiet about this sumptuousness so as to give me a chance to surprise the guests and show off a little  concerning the new clothes the simple couple were like children they were up and down all night to see if it wasnt nearly daylight so that they could put them on and they were into them at last as much as an hour before dawn was due  then their pleasurenot to say deliriumwas so fresh and novel and inspiring that the sight of it paid me well for the interruptions which my sleep had suffered the king had slept just as usuallike the dead  the marcos could not thank him for their clothes that being forbidden but they tried every way they could think of to make him see how grateful they were  which all went for nothing he didnt notice any change  it turned out to be one of those rich and rare fall days which is just a june day toned down to a degree where it is heaven to be out of doors  toward noon the guests arrived and we assembled under a great tree and were soon as sociable as old acquaintances even the kings reserve melted a little though it was some little trouble to him to adjust himself to the name of jones along at first  i had asked him to try to not forget that he was a farmer but i had also considered it prudent to ask him to let the thing stand at that and not elaborate it any  because he was just the kind of person you could depend on to spoil a little thing like that if you didnt warn him his tongue was so handy and his spirit so willing and his information so uncertain  dowley was in fine feather and i early got him started and then adroitly worked him around onto his own history for a text and himself for a hero and then it was good to sit there and hear him hum  selfmade man you know  they know how to talk  they do deserve more credit than any other breed of men yes that is true and they are among the very first to find it out too  he told how he had begun life an orphan lad without money and without friends able to help him how he had lived as the slaves of the meanest master lived how his days work was from sixteen to eighteen hours long and yielded him only enough black bread to keep him in a halffed condition how his faithful endeavors finally attracted the attention of a good blacksmith who came near knocking him dead with kindness by suddenly offering when he was totally unprepared to take him as his bound apprentice for nine years and give him board and clothes and teach him the tradeor mystery as dowley called it  that was his first great rise his first gorgeous stroke of fortune and you saw that he couldnt yet speak of it without a sort of eloquent wonder and delight that such a gilded promotion should have fallen to the lot of a common human being  he got no new clothing during his apprenticeship but on his graduation day his master tricked him out in spangnew towlinens and made him feel unspeakably rich and fine  i remember me of that day the wheelwright sang out with enthusiasm  and i likewise cried the mason  i would not believe they were thine own in faith i could not  nor other shouted dowley with sparkling eyes  i was like to lose my character the neighbors wending i had mayhap been stealing  it was a great day a great day one forgetteth not days like that  yes and his master was a fine man and prosperous and always had a great feast of meat twice in the year and with it white bread true wheaten bread in fact lived like a lord so to speak and in time dowley succeeded to the business and married the daughter  and now consider what is come to pass said he impressively two times in every month there is fresh meat upon my table he made a pause here to let that fact sink home then added and eight times salt meat  it is even true said the wheelwright with bated breath  i know it of mine own knowledge said the mason in the same reverent fashion  on my table appeareth white bread every sunday in the year added the master smith with solemnity  i leave it to your own consciences friends if this is not also true  by my head yes cried the mason  i can testify itand i do said the wheelwright  and as to furniture ye shall say yourselves what mine equipment is  he waved his hand in fine gesture of granting frank and unhampered freedom of speech and added speak as ye are moved speak as ye would speak an i were not here  ye have five stools and of the sweetest workmanship at that albeit your family is but three said the wheelwright with deep respect  and six wooden goblets and six platters of wood and two of pewter to eat and drink from withal said the mason impressively  and i say it as knowing god is my judge and we tarry not here alway but must answer at the last day for the things said in the body be they false or be they sooth  now ye know what manner of man i am brother jones said the smith with a fine and friendly condescension and doubtless ye would look to find me a man jealous of his due of respect and but sparing of outgo to strangers till their rating and quality be assured but trouble yourself not as concerning that wit ye well ye shall find me a man that regardeth not these matters but is willing to receive any he as his fellow and equal that carrieth a right heart in his body be his worldly estate howsoever modest and in token of it here is my hand and i say with my own mouth we are equalsequalsand he smiled around on the company with the satisfaction of a god who is doing the handsome and gracious thing and is quite well aware of it  the king took the hand with a poorly disguised reluctance and let go of it as willingly as a lady lets go of a fish all of which had a good effect for it was mistaken for an embarrassment natural to one who was being called upon by greatness  the dame brought out the table now and set it under the tree it caused a visible stir of surprise it being brand new and a sumptuous article of deal  but the surprise rose higher still when the dame with a body oozing easy indifference at every pore but eyes that gave it all away by absolutely flaming with vanity slowly unfolded an actual simonpure tablecloth and spread it that was a notch above even the blacksmiths domestic grandeurs and it hit him hard you could see it  but marco was in paradise you could see that too  then the dame brought two fine new stoolswhew that was a sensation it was visible in the eyes of every guest  then she brought two moreas calmly as she could sensation againwith awed murmurs  again she brought two walking on air she was so proud  the guests were petrified and the mason muttered  there is that about earthly pomps which doth ever move to reverence  as the dame turned away marco couldnt help slapping on the climax while the thing was hot so he said with what was meant for a languid composure but was a poor imitation of it  these suffice leave the rest  so there were more yet  it was a fine effect  i couldnt have played the hand better myself  from this out the madam piled up the surprises with a rush that fired the general astonishment up to a hundred and fifty in the shade and at the same time paralyzed expression of it down to gasped ohs and ahs and mute upliftings of hands and eyes she fetched crockerynew and plenty of it new wooden goblets and other table furniture and beer fish chicken a goose eggs roast beef roast mutton a ham a small roast pig and a wealth of genuine white wheaten bread  take it by and large that spread laid everything far and away in the shade that ever that crowd had seen before  and while they sat there just simply stupefied with wonder and awe i sort of waved my hand as if by accident and the storekeepers son emerged from space and said he had come to collect  thats all right i said indifferently  what is the amount give us the items  then he read off this bill while those three amazed men listened and serene waves of satisfaction rolled over my soul and alternate waves of terror and admiration surged over marcos     2 pounds salt                 200    8 dozen pints beer in the wood        800    3 bushels wheat              2700    2 pounds fish                 100    3 hens                     400    1 goose

 various table furniture         10000    1 deal table                3000    8 stools                  4000    2 miller guns loaded           3000  he ceased  there was a pale and awful silence  not a limb stirred not a nostril betrayed the passage of breath  is that all i asked in a voice of the most perfect calmness  all fair sir save that certain matters of light moment are placed together under a head hight sundries  if it would like you i will sepa  it is of no consequence i said accompanying the words with a gesture of the most utter indifference give me the grand total please  the clerk leaned against the tree to stay himself and said  thirtynine thousand one hundred and fifty milrays  the wheelwright fell off his stool the others grabbed the table to save themselves and there was a deep and general ejaculation of  god be with us in the day of disaster  the clerk hastened to say  my father chargeth me to say he cannot honorably require you to pay it all at this time and therefore only prayeth you  i paid no more heed than if it were the idle breeze but with an air of indifference amounting almost to weariness got out my money and tossed four dollars on to the table  ah you should have seen them stare  the clerk was astonished and charmed  he asked me to retain one of the dollars as security until he could go to town and i interrupted  what and fetch back nine cents  nonsense  take the whole keep the change  there was an amazed murmur to this effect  verily this being is made of money  he throweth it away even as if it were dirt  the blacksmith was a crushed man  the clerk took his money and reeled away drunk with fortune  i said to marco and his wife  good folk here is a little trifle for youhanding the millerguns as if it were a matter of no consequence though each of them contained fifteen cents in solid cash and while the poor creatures went to pieces with astonishment and gratitude i turned to the others and said as calmly as one would ask the time of day  well if we are all ready i judge the dinner is  come fall to  ah well it was immense yes it was a daisy  i dont know that i ever put a situation together better or got happier spectacular effects out of the materials available  the blacksmithwell he was simply mashed  land i wouldnt have felt what that man was feeling for anything in the world  here he had been blowing and bragging about his grand meatfeast twice a year and his fresh meat twice a month and his salt meat twice a week and his white bread every sunday the year roundall for a family of three the entire cost for the year not above 6926 sixtynine cents two mills and six milrays and all of a sudden here comes along a man who slashes out nearly four dollars on a single blowout and not only that but acts as if it made him tired to handle such small sums  yes dowley was a good deal wilted and shrunkup and collapsed he had the aspect of a bladderballoon thats been stepped on by a cow    chapter xxxiii  sixth century political economy  however i made a dead set at him and before the first third of the dinner was reached i had him happy again  it was easy to doin a country of ranks and castes  you see in a country where they have ranks and castes a man isnt ever a man he is only part of a man he cant ever get his full growth  you prove your superiority over him in station or rank or fortune and thats the end of ithe knuckles down  you cant insult him after that  no i dont mean quite that of course you can insult him i only mean its difficult and so unless youve got a lot of useless time on your hands it doesnt pay to try  i had the smiths reverence now because i was apparently immensely prosperous and rich i could have had his adoration if i had had some little gimcrack title of nobility  and not only his but any commoners in the land though he were the mightiest production of all the ages in intellect worth and character and i bankrupt in all three this was to remain so as long as england should exist in the earth  with the spirit of prophecy upon me i could look into the future and see her erect statues and monuments to her unspeakable georges and other royal and noble clotheshorses and leave unhonored the creators of this worldafter godgutenburg watt arkwright whitney morse stephenson bell  the king got his cargo aboard and then the talk not turning upon battle conquest or ironclad duel he dulled down to drowsiness and went off to take a nap  mrs marco cleared the table placed the beer keg handy and went away to eat her dinner of leavings in humble privacy and the rest of us soon drifted into matters near and dear to the hearts of our sortbusiness and wages of course  at a first glance things appeared to be exceeding prosperous in this little tributary kingdomwhose lord was king bagdemagusas compared with the state of things in my own region  they had the protection system in full force here whereas we were working along down toward freetrade by easy stages and were now about half way  before long dowley and i were doing all the talking the others hungrily listening  dowley warmed to his work snuffed an advantage in the air and began to put questions which he considered pretty awkward ones for me and they did have something of that look  in your country brother what is the wage of a master bailiff master hind carter shepherd swineherd  twentyfive milrays a day that is to say a quarter of a cent  the smiths face beamed with joy  he said  with us they are allowed the double of it  and what may a mechanic getcarpenter dauber mason painter blacksmith wheelwright and the like  on the average fifty milrays half a cent a day  hoho  with us they are allowed a hundred  with us any good mechanic is allowed a cent a day  i count out the tailor but not the othersthey are all allowed a cent a day and in driving times they get moreyes up to a hundred and ten and even fifteen milrays a day  ive paid a hundred and fifteen myself within the week  rah for protectionto sheol with freetrade  and his face shone upon the company like a sunburst  but i didnt scare at all  i rigged up my piledriver and allowed myself fifteen minutes to drive him into the earthdrive him all in drive him in till not even the curve of his skull should show above ground  here is the way i started in on him  i asked  what do you pay a pound for salt  a hundred milrays  we pay forty  what do you pay for beef and muttonwhen you buy it  that was a neat hit it made the color come  it varieth somewhat but not much one may say seventyfive milrays the pound  we pay thirtythree  what do you pay for eggs  fifty milrays the dozen  we pay twenty  what do you pay for beer  it costeth us eight and onehalf milrays the pint  we get it for four twentyfive bottles for a cent what do you pay for wheat  at the rate of nine hundred milrays the bushel  we pay four hundred  what do you pay for a mans towlinen suit  thirteen cents  we pay six  what do you pay for a stuff gown for the wife of the laborer or the mechanic  we pay eight cents four mills  well observe the difference you pay eight cents and four mills we pay only four cents  i prepared now to sock it to him  i said look here dear friend whats become of your high wages you were bragging so about a few minutes agoand i looked around on the company with placid satisfaction for i had slipped up on him gradually and tied him hand and foot you see without his ever noticing that he was being tied at all  whats become of those noble high wages of yoursi seem to have knocked the stuffing all out of them it appears to me  but if you will believe me he merely looked surprised that is all he didnt grasp the situation at all didnt know he had walked into a trap didnt discover that he was in a trap  i could have shot him from sheer vexation  with cloudy eye and a struggling intellect he fetched this out  marry i seem not to understand  it is proved that our wages be double thine how then may it be that thoust knocked therefrom the stuffingan miscall not the wonderly word this being the first time under grace and providence of god it hath been granted me to hear it  well i was stunned partly with this unlookedfor stupidity on his part and partly because his fellows so manifestly sided with him and were of his mindif you might call it mind  my position was simple enough plain enough how could it ever be simplified more  however i must try  why look here brother dowley dont you see  your wages are merely higher than ours in name not in fact  hear him  they are the doubleye have confessed it yourself  yesyes i dont deny that at all  but thats got nothing to do with it the amount of the wages in mere coins with meaningless names attached to them to know them by has got nothing to do with it  the thing is how much can you buy with your wages thats the idea  while it is true that with you a good mechanic is allowed about three dollars and a half a year and with us only about a dollar and seventyfive  thereyere confessing it again yere confessing it again  confound it ive never denied it i tell you  what i say is this  with us half a dollar buys more than a dollar buys with youand therefore it stands to reason and the commonest kind of commonsense that our wages are higher than yours  he looked dazed and said despairingly  verily i cannot make it out  yeve just said ours are the higher and with the same breath ye take it back  oh great scott isnt it possible to get such a simple thing through your head  now look herelet me illustrate  we pay four cents for a womans stuff gown you pay 840 which is four mills more than double  what do you allow a laboring woman who works on a farm  two mills a day  very good we allow but half as much we pay her only a tenth of a cent a day and  again yere conf  wait  now you see the thing is very simple this time youll understand it  for instance it takes your woman 42 days to earn her gown at 2 mills a day7 weeks work but ours earns hers in forty daystwo days short of 7 weeks  your woman has a gown and her whole seven weeks wages are gone ours has a gown and two days wages left to buy something else with  therenow you understand it  he lookedwell he merely looked dubious its the most i can say so did the others  i waitedto let the thing work  dowley spoke at lastand betrayed the fact that he actually hadnt gotten away from his rooted and grounded superstitions yet  he said with a trifle of hesitancy  butbutye cannot fail to grant that two mills a day is better than one  shucks  well of course i hated to give it up  so i chanced another flyer  let us suppose a case  suppose one of your journeymen goes out and buys the following articles    1 pound of salt    1 dozen eggs    1 dozen pints of beer    1 bushel of wheat    1 towlinen suit    5 pounds of beef    5 pounds of mutton  the lot will cost him 32 cents  it takes him 32 working days to earn the money5 weeks and 2 days  let him come to us and work 32 days at half the wages he can buy all those things for a shade under 14 12 cents they will cost him a shade under 29 days work and he will have about half a weeks wages over  carry it through the year he would save nearly a weeks wages every two months your man nothing thus saving five or six weeks wages in a year your man not a cent  now i reckon you understand that high wages and low wages are phrases that dont mean anything in the world until you find out which of them will buy the most  it was a crusher  but alas it didnt crush  no i had to give it up  what those people valued was high wages it didnt seem to be a matter of any consequence to them whether the high wages would buy anything or not  they stood for protection and swore by it which was reasonable enough because interested parties had gulled them into the notion that it was protection which had created their high wages  i proved to them that in a quarter of a century their wages had advanced but 30 per cent while the cost of living had gone up 100 and that with us in a shorter time wages had advanced 40 per cent while the cost of living had gone steadily down  but it didnt do any good  nothing could unseat their strange beliefs  well i was smarting under a sense of defeat  undeserved defeat but what of that  that didnt soften the smart any  and to think of the circumstances the first statesman of the age the capablest man the bestinformed man in the entire world the loftiest uncrowned head that had moved through the clouds of any political firmament for centuries sitting here apparently defeated in argument by an ignorant country blacksmith  and i could see that those others were sorry for mewhich made me blush till i could smell my whiskers scorching  put yourself in my place feel as mean as i did as ashamed as i feltwouldnt you have struck below the belt to get even  yes you would it is simply human nature well that is what i did  i am not trying to justify it im only saying that i was mad and anybody would have done it  well when i make up my mind to hit a man i dont plan out a lovetap no that isnt my way as long as im going to hit him at all im going to hit him a lifter  and i dont jump at him all of a sudden and risk making a blundering halfway business of it no i get away off yonder to one side and work up on him gradually so that he never suspects that im going to hit him at all and by and by all in a flash hes flat on his back and he cant tell for the life of him how it all happened  that is the way i went for brother dowley  i started to talking lazy and comfortable as if i was just talking to pass the time and the oldest man in the world couldnt have taken the bearings of my starting place and guessed where i was going to fetch up  boys theres a good many curious things about law and custom and usage and all that sort of thing when you come to look at it yes and about the drift and progress of human opinion and movement too  there are written lawsthey perish but there are also unwritten lawsthey are eternal  take the unwritten law of wages it says theyve got to advance little by little straight through the centuries  and notice how it works  we know what wages are now here and there and yonder we strike an average and say thats the wages of today  we know what the wages were a hundred years ago and what they were two hundred years ago thats as far back as we can get but it suffices to give us the law of progress the measure and rate of the periodical augmentation and so without a document to help us we can come pretty close to determining what the wages were three and four and five hundred years ago good so far  do we stop there  no  we stop looking backward we face around and apply the law to the future  my friends i can tell you what peoples wages are going to be at any date in the future you want to know for hundreds and hundreds of years  what goodman what  yes  in seven hundred years wages will have risen to six times what they are now here in your region and farm hands will be allowed 3 cents a day and mechanics 6  i wouldt i might die now and live then interrupted smug the wheelwright with a fine avaricious glow in his eye  and that isnt all theyll get their board besidessuch as it is it wont bloat them  two hundred and fifty years laterpay attention nowa mechanics wages will bemind you this is law not guesswork a mechanics wages will then be twenty cents a day  there was a general gasp of awed astonishment dickon the mason murmured with raised eyes and hands  more than three weeks pay for one days work  richesof a truth yes riches muttered marco his breath coming quick and short with excitement  wages will keep on rising little by little little by little as steadily as a tree grows and at the end of three hundred and forty years more therell be at least one country where the mechanics average wage will be two hundred cents a day  it knocked them absolutely dumb  not a man of them could get his breath for upwards of two minutes  then the coalburner said prayerfully  might i but live to see it  it is the income of an earl said smug  an earl say ye said dowley ye could say more than that and speak no lie theres no earl in the realm of bagdemagus that hath an income like to that  income of an earlmf its the income of an angel  now then that is what is going to happen as regards wages in that remote day that man will earn with one weeks work that bill of goods which it takes you upwards of fifty weeks to earn now  some other pretty surprising things are going to happen too  brother dowley who is it that determines every spring what the particular wage of each kind of mechanic laborer and servant shall be for that year  sometimes the courts sometimes the town council but most of all the magistrate  ye may say in general terms it is the magistrate that fixes the wages  doesnt ask any of those poor devils to help him fix their wages for them does he  hm  that were an idea  the master thats to pay him the money is the one thats rightly concerned in that matter ye will notice  yesbut i thought the other man might have some little trifle at stake in it too and even his wife and children poor creatures the masters are these nobles rich men the prosperous generally these few who do no work determine what pay the vast hive shall have who do work  you see  theyre a combinea trade union to coin a new phrasewho band themselves together to force their lowly brother to take what they choose to give  thirteen hundred years henceso says the unwritten lawthe combine will be the other way and then how these fine peoples posterity will fume and fret and grit their teeth over the insolent tyranny of trade unions  yes indeed the magistrate will tranquilly arrange the wages from now clear away down into the nineteenth century and then all of a sudden the wageearner will consider that a couple of thousand years or so is enough of this onesided sort of thing and he will rise up and take a hand in fixing his wages himself ah he will have a long and bitter account of wrong and humiliation to settle  do ye believe  that he actually will help to fix his own wages  yes indeed and he will be strong and able then  brave times brave times of a truth sneered the prosperous smith  ohand theres another detail  in that day a master may hire a man for only just one day or one week or one month at a time if he wants to  what  its true  moreover a magistrate wont be able to force a man to work for a master a whole year on a stretch whether the man wants to or not  will there be no law or sense in that day  both of them dowley  in that day a man will be his own property not the property of magistrate and master  and he can leave town whenever he wants to if the wages dont suit himand they cant put him in the pillory for it  perdition catch such an age shouted dowley in strong indignation an age of dogs an age barren of reverence for superiors and respect for authority  the pillory  oh wait brother say no good word for that institution  i think the pillory ought to be abolished  a most strange idea  why  well ill tell you why  is a man ever put in the pillory for a capital crime  no  is it right to condemn a man to a slight punishment for a small offense and then kill him  there was no answer  i had scored my first point  for the first time the smith wasnt up and ready  the company noticed it good effect  you dont answer brother  you were about to glorify the pillory a while ago and shed some pity on a future age that isnt going to use it  i think the pillory ought to be abolished  what usually happens when a poor fellow is put in the pillory for some little offense that didnt amount to anything in the world  the mob try to have some fun with him dont they  yes  they begin by clodding him and they laugh themselves to pieces to see him try to dodge one clod and get hit with another  yes  then they throw dead cats at him dont they  yes  well then suppose he has a few personal enemies in that mob and here and there a man or a woman with a secret grudge against himand suppose especially that he is unpopular in the community for his pride or his prosperity or one thing or anotherstones and bricks take the place of clods and cats presently dont they  there is no doubt of it  as a rule he is crippled for life isnt hejaws broken teeth smashed outor legs mutilated gangrened presently cut off or an eye knocked out maybe both eyes  it is true god knoweth it  and if he is unpopular he can depend on dying right there in the stocks cant he  he surely can  one may not deny it  i take it none of you are unpopularby reason of pride or insolence or conspicuous prosperity or any of those things that excite envy and malice among the base scum of a village  you wouldnt think it much of a risk to take a chance in the stocks  dowley winced visibly  i judged he was hit  but he didnt betray it by any spoken word  as for the others they spoke out plainly and with strong feeling  they said they had seen enough of the stocks to know what a mans chance in them was and they would never consent to enter them if they could compromise on a quick death by hanging  well to change the subjectfor i think ive established my point that the stocks ought to be abolished  i think some of our laws are pretty unfair  for instance if i do a thing which ought to deliver me to the stocks and you know i did it and yet keep still and dont report me you will get the stocks if anybody informs on you  ah but that would serve you but right said dowley for you must inform  so saith the law  the others coincided  well all right let it go since you vote me down  but theres one thing which certainly isnt fair  the magistrate fixes a mechanics wage at one cent a day for instance  the law says that if any master shall venture even under utmost press of business to pay anything over that cent a day even for a single day he shall be both fined and pilloried for it and whoever knows he did it and doesnt inform they also shall be fined and pilloried  now it seems to me unfair dowley and a deadly peril to all of us that because you thoughtlessly confessed a while ago that within a week you have paid a cent and fifteen mil  oh i tell you it was a smasher  you ought to have seen them to go to pieces the whole gang  i had just slipped up on poor smiling and complacent dowley so nice and easy and softly that he never suspected anything was going to happen till the blow came crashing down and knocked him all to rags  a fine effect  in fact as fine as any i ever produced with so little time to work it up in  but i saw in a moment that i had overdone the thing a little i was expecting to scare them but i wasnt expecting to scare them to death  they were mighty near it though  you see they had been a whole lifetime learning to appreciate the pillory and to have that thing staring them in the face and every one of them distinctly at the mercy of me a stranger if i chose to go and reportwell it was awful and they couldnt seem to recover from the shock they couldnt seem to pull themselves together pale shaky dumb pitiful  why they werent any better than so many dead men  it was very uncomfortable  of course i thought they would appeal to me to keep mum and then we would shake hands and take a drink all round and laugh it off and there an end but no you see i was an unknown person among a cruelly oppressed and suspicious people a people always accustomed to having advantage taken of their helplessness and never expecting just or kind treatment from any but their own families and very closest intimates appeal to me to be gentle to be fair to be generous  of course they wanted to but they couldnt dare    chapter xxxiv  the yankee and the king sold as slaves  well what had i better do  nothing in a hurry sure  i must get up a diversion anything to employ me while i could think and while these poor fellows could have a chance to come to life again  there sat marco petrified in the act of trying to get the hang of his millergunturned to stone just in the attitude he was in when my piledriver fell the toy still gripped in his unconscious fingers  so i took it from him and proposed to explain its mystery  mystery a simple little thing like that and yet it was mysterious enough for that race and that age  i never saw such an awkward people with machinery you see they were totally unused to it  the millergun was a little doublebarreled tube of toughened glass with a neat little trick of a spring to it which upon pressure would let a shot escape  but the shot wouldnt hurt anybody it would only drop into your hand  in the gun were two sizeswee mustardseed shot and another sort that were several times larger  they were money  the mustardseed shot represented milrays the larger ones mills  so the gun was a purse and very handy too you could pay out money in the dark with it with accuracy and you could carry it in your mouth or in your vest pocket if you had one  i made them of several sizes one size so large that it would carry the equivalent of a dollar using shot for money was a good thing for the government the metal cost nothing and the money couldnt be counterfeited for i was the only person in the kingdom who knew how to manage a shot tower paying the shot soon came to be a common phrase  yes and i knew it would still be passing mens lips away down in the nineteenth century yet none would suspect how and when it originated  the king joined us about this time mightily refreshed by his nap and feeling good  anything could make me nervous now i was so uneasyfor our lives were in danger and so it worried me to detect a complacent something in the kings eye which seemed to indicate that he had been loading himself up for a performance of some kind or other confound it why must he go and choose such a time as this  i was right  he began straight off in the most innocently artful and transparent and lubberly way to lead up to the subject of agriculture  the cold sweat broke out all over me i wanted to whisper in his ear man we are in awful danger every moment is worth a principality till we get back these mens confidence dont waste any of this golden time  but of course i couldnt do it  whisper to him  it would look as if we were conspiring  so i had to sit there and look calm and pleasant while the king stood over that dynamite mine and mooned along about his damned onions and things  at first the tumult of my own thoughts summoned by the dangersignal and swarming to the rescue from every quarter of my skull kept up such a hurrah and confusion and fifing and drumming that i couldnt take in a word but presently when my mob of gathering plans began to crystallize and fall into position and form line of battle a sort of order and quiet ensued and i caught the boom of the kings batteries as if out of remote distance  were not the best way methinks albeit it is not to be denied that authorities differ as concerning this point some contending that the onion is but an unwholesome berry when stricken early from the tree  the audience showed signs of life and sought each others eyes in a surprised and troubled way  whileas others do yet maintain with much show of reason that this is not of necessity the case instancing that plums and other like cereals do be always dug in the unripe state  the audience exhibited distinct distress yes and also fear  yet are they clearly wholesome the more especially when one doth assuage the asperities of their nature by admixture of the tranquilizing juice of the wayward cabbage  the wild light of terror began to glow in these mens eyes and one of them muttered these be errors every onegod hath surely smitten the mind of this farmer  i was in miserable apprehension i sat upon thorns  and further instancing the known truth that in the case of animals the young which may be called the green fruit of the creature is the better all confessing that when a goat is ripe his fur doth heat and sore engame his flesh the which defect taken in connection with his several rancid habits and fulsome appetites and godless attitudes of mind and bilious quality of morals  they rose and went for him  with a fierce shout the one would betray us the other is mad  kill them  kill them they flung themselves upon us  what joy flamed up in the kings eye  he might be lame in agriculture but this kind of thing was just in his line  he had been fasting long he was hungry for a fight he hit the blacksmith a crack under the jaw that lifted him clear off his feet and stretched him flat on his back  st george for britain and he downed the wheelwright  the mason was big but i laid him out like nothing  the three gathered themselves up and came again went down again came again and kept on repeating this with native british pluck until they were battered to jelly reeling with exhaustion and so blind that they couldnt tell us from each other and yet they kept right on hammering away with what might was left in them  hammering each otherfor we stepped aside and looked on while they rolled and struggled and gouged and pounded and bit with the strict and wordless attention to business of so many bulldogs  we looked on without apprehension for they were fast getting past ability to go for help against us and the arena was far enough from the public road to be safe from intrusion  well while they were gradually playing out it suddenly occurred to me to wonder what had become of marco  i looked around he was nowhere to be seen  oh but this was ominous  i pulled the kings sleeve and we glided away and rushed for the hut  no marco there no phyllis there  they had gone to the road for help sure i told the king to give his heels wings and i would explain later we made good time across the open ground and as we darted into the shelter of the wood i glanced back and saw a mob of excited peasants swarm into view with marco and his wife at their head they were making a world of noise but that couldnt hurt anybody the wood was dense and as soon as we were well into its depths we would take to a tree and let them whistle  ah but then came another sounddogs  yes that was quite another matter  it magnified our contractwe must find running water  we tore along at a good gait and soon left the sounds far behind and modified to a murmur  we struck a stream and darted into it we waded swiftly down it in the dim forest light for as much as three hundred yards and then came across an oak with a great bough sticking out over the water  we climbed up on this bough and began to work our way along it to the body of the tree now we began to hear those sounds more plainly so the mob had struck our trail  for a while the sounds approached pretty fast  and then for another while they didnt  no doubt the dogs had found the place where we had entered the stream and were now waltzing up and down the shores trying to pick up the trail again  when we were snugly lodged in the tree and curtained with foliage the king was satisfied but i was doubtful  i believed we could crawl along a branch and get into the next tree and i judged it worth while to try  we tried it and made a success of it though the king slipped at the junction and came near failing to connect we got comfortable lodgment and satisfactory concealment among the foliage and then we had nothing to do but listen to the hunt  presently we heard it comingand coming on the jump too yes and down both sides of the stream  louderloudernext minute it swelled swiftly up into a roar of shoutings barkings tramplings and swept by like a cyclone  i was afraid that the overhanging branch would suggest something to them said i but i dont mind the disappointment  come my liege it were well that we make good use of our time  weve flanked them  dark is coming on presently  if we can cross the stream and get a good start and borrow a couple of horses from somebodys pasture to use for a few hours we shall be safe enough  we started down and got nearly to the lowest limb when we seemed to hear the hunt returning  we stopped to listen  yes said i theyre baffled theyve given it up theyre on their way home  we will climb back to our roost again and let them go by  so we climbed back  the king listened a moment and said  they still searchi wit the sign  we did best to abide  he was right  he knew more about hunting than i did  the noise approached steadily but not with a rush  the king said  they reason that we were advantaged by no parlous start of them and being on foot are as yet no mighty way from where we took the water  yes sire that is about it i am afraid though i was hoping better things  the noise drew nearer and nearer and soon the van was drifting under us on both sides of the water  a voice called a halt from the other bank and said  an they were so minded they could get to yon tree by this branch that overhangs and yet not touch ground  ye will do well to send a man up it  marry that we will do  i was obliged to admire my cuteness in foreseeing this very thing and swapping trees to beat it  but dont you know there are some things that can beat smartness and foresight  awkwardness and stupidity can  the best swordsman in the world doesnt need to fear the second best swordsman in the world no the person for him to be afraid of is some ignorant antagonist who has never had a sword in his hand before he doesnt do the thing he ought to do and so the expert isnt prepared for him he does the thing he ought not to do and often it catches the expert out and ends him on the spot  well how could i with all my gifts make any valuable preparation against a nearsighted crosseyed puddingheaded clown who would aim himself at the wrong tree and hit the right one  and that is what he did  he went for the wrong tree which was of course the right one by mistake and up he started  matters were serious now  we remained still and awaited developments the peasant toiled his difficult way up  the king raised himself up and stood he made a leg ready and when the comers head arrived in reach of it there was a dull thud and down went the man floundering to the ground  there was a wild outbreak of anger below and the mob swarmed in from all around and there we were treed and prisoners  another man started up the bridging bough was detected and a volunteer started up the tree that furnished the bridge  the king ordered me to play horatius and keep the bridge  for a while the enemy came thick and fast but no matter the head man of each procession always got a buffet that dislodged him as soon as he came in reach  the kings spirits rose his joy was limitless  he said that if nothing occurred to mar the prospect we should have a beautiful night for on this line of tactics we could hold the tree against the whole countryside  however the mob soon came to that conclusion themselves wherefore they called off the assault and began to debate other plans they had no weapons but there were plenty of stones and stones might answer  we had no objections  a stone might possibly penetrate to us once in a while but it wasnt very likely we were well protected by boughs and foliage and were not visible from any good aiming point  if they would but waste half an hour in stonethrowing the dark would come to our help  we were feeling very well satisfied  we could smile almost laugh  but we didnt which was just as well for we should have been interrupted  before the stones had been raging through the leaves and bouncing from the boughs fifteen minutes we began to notice a smell  a couple of sniffs of it was enough of an explanation it was smoke  our game was up at last  we recognized that  when smoke invites you you have to come  they raised their pile of dry brush and damp weeds higher and higher and when they saw the thick cloud begin to roll up and smother the tree they broke out in a storm of joyclamors  i got enough breath to say  proceed my liege after you is manners  the king gasped  follow me down and then back thyself against one side of the trunk and leave me the other  then will we fight  let each pile his dead according to his own fashion and taste  then he descended barking and coughing and i followed  i struck the ground an instant after him we sprang to our appointed places and began to give and take with all our might  the powwow and racket were prodigious it was a tempest of riot and confusion and thickfalling blows  suddenly some horsemen tore into the midst of the crowd and a voice shouted  holdor ye are dead men  how good it sounded  the owner of the voice bore all the marks of a gentleman picturesque and costly raiment the aspect of command a hard countenance with complexion and features marred by dissipation the mob fell humbly back like so many spaniels  the gentleman inspected us critically then said sharply to the peasants  what are ye doing to these people  they be madmen worshipful sir that have come wandering we know not whence and  ye know not whence  do ye pretend ye know them not  most honored sir we speak but the truth  they are strangers and unknown to any in this region and they be the most violent and bloodthirsty madmen that ever  peace  ye know not what ye say  they are not mad  who are ye and whence are ye  explain  we are but peaceful strangers sir i said and traveling upon our own concerns  we are from a far country and unacquainted here  we have purposed no harm and yet but for your brave interference and protection these people would have killed us as you have divined sir we are not mad neither are we violent or bloodthirsty  the gentleman turned to his retinue and said calmly lash me these animals to their kennels  the mob vanished in an instant and after them plunged the horsemen laying about them with their whips and pitilessly riding down such as were witless enough to keep the road instead of taking to the bush  the shrieks and supplications presently died away in the distance and soon the horsemen began to straggle back  meantime the gentleman had been questioning us more closely but had dug no particulars out of us  we were lavish of recognition of the service he was doing us but we revealed nothing more than that we were friendless strangers from a far country  when the escort were all returned the gentleman said to one of his servants  bring the ledhorses and mount these people  yes my lord  we were placed toward the rear among the servants  we traveled pretty fast and finally drew rein some time after dark at a roadside inn some ten or twelve miles from the scene of our troubles  my lord went immediately to his room after ordering his supper and we saw no more of him  at dawn in the morning we breakfasted and made ready to start  my lords chief attendant sauntered forward at that moment with indolent grace and said  ye have said ye should continue upon this road which is our direction likewise wherefore my lord the earl grip hath given commandment that ye retain the horses and ride and that certain of us ride with ye a twenty mile to a fair town that hight cambenet whenso ye shall be out of peril  we could do nothing less than express our thanks and accept the offer  we jogged along six in the party at a moderate and comfortable gait and in conversation learned that my lord grip was a very great personage in his own region which lay a days journey beyond cambenet  we loitered to such a degree that it was near the middle of the forenoon when we entered the market square of the town  we dismounted and left our thanks once more for my lord and then approached a crowd assembled in the center of the square to see what might be the object of interest  it was the remnant of that old peregrinating band of slaves  so they had been dragging their chains about all this weary time  that poor husband was gone and also many others and some few purchases had been added to the gang  the king was not interested and wanted to move along but i was absorbed and full of pity  i could not take my eyes away from these worn and wasted wrecks of humanity there they sat grounded upon the ground silent uncomplaining with bowed heads a pathetic sight  and by hideous contrast a redundant orator was making a speech to another gathering not thirty steps away in fulsome laudation of our glorious british liberties  i was boiling  i had forgotten i was a plebeian i was remembering i was a man  cost what it might i would mount that rostrum and  click the king and i were handcuffed together  our companions those servants had done it my lord grip stood looking on  the king burst out in a fury and said  what meaneth this illmannered jest  my lord merely said to his head miscreant coolly  put up the slaves and sell them  slaves  the word had a new soundand how unspeakably awful  the king lifted his manacles and brought them down with a deadly force but my lord was out of the way when they arrived  a dozen of the rascals servants sprang forward and in a moment we were helpless with our hands bound behind us  we so loudly and so earnestly proclaimed ourselves freemen that we got the interested attention of that libertymouthing orator and his patriotic crowd and they gathered about us and assumed a very determined attitude the orator said  if indeed ye are freemen ye have nought to fearthe godgiven liberties of britain are about ye for your shield and shelter applause  ye shall soon see bring forth your proofs  what proofs  proof that ye are freemen  ahi remembered  i came to myself i said nothing  but the king stormed out  thourt insane man  it were better and more in reason that this thief and scoundrel here prove that we are not freemen  you see he knew his own laws just as other people so often know the laws by words not by effects  they take a meaning and get to be very vivid when you come to apply them to yourself  all hands shook their heads and looked disappointed some turned away no longer interested  the orator saidand this time in the tones of business not of sentiment  an ye do not know your countrys laws it were time ye learned them  ye are strangers to us ye will not deny that ye may be freemen we do not deny that but also ye may be slaves  the law is clear it doth not require the claimant to prove ye are slaves it requireth you to prove ye are not  i said  dear sir give us only time to send to astolat or give us only time to send to the valley of holiness  peace good man these are extraordinary requests and you may not hope to have them granted  it would cost much time and would unwarrantably inconvenience your master  master idiot stormed the king  i have no master i myself am the m  silence for gods sake  i got the words out in time to stop the king  we were in trouble enough already it could not help us any to give these people the notion that we were lunatics  there is no use in stringing out the details  the earl put us up and sold us at auction  this same infernal law had existed in our own south in my own time more than thirteen hundred years later and under it hundreds of freemen who could not prove that they were freemen had been sold into lifelong slavery without the circumstance making any particular impression upon me but the minute law and the auction block came into my personal experience a thing which had been merely improper before became suddenly hellish  well thats the way we are made  yes we were sold at auction like swine  in a big town and an active market we should have brought a good price but this place was utterly stagnant and so we sold at a figure which makes me ashamed every time i think of it  the king of england brought seven dollars and his prime minister nine whereas the king was easily worth twelve dollars and i as easily worth fifteen  but that is the way things always go if you force a sale on a dull market i dont care what the property is you are going to make a poor business of it and you can make up your mind to it  if the earl had had wit enough to  however there is no occasion for my working my sympathies up on his account  let him go for the present i took his number so to speak  the slavedealer bought us both and hitched us onto that long chain of his and we constituted the rear of his procession  we took up our line of march and passed out of cambenet at noon and it seemed to me unaccountably strange and odd that the king of england and his chief minister marching manacled and fettered and yoked in a slave convoy could move by all manner of idle men and women and under windows where sat the sweet and the lovely and yet never attract a curious eye never provoke a single remark dear dear it only shows that there is nothing diviner about a king than there is about a tramp after all  he is just a cheap and hollow artificiality when you dont know he is a king  but reveal his quality and dear me it takes your very breath away to look at him  i reckon we are all fools born so no doubt    chapter xxxv  a pitiful incident  its a world of surprises  the king brooded this was natural what would he brood about should you say  why about the prodigious nature of his fall of coursefrom the loftiest place in the world to the lowest from the most illustrious station in the world to the obscurest from the grandest vocation among men to the basest no i take my oath that the thing that graveled him most to start with was not this but the price he had fetched  he couldnt seem to get over that seven dollars  well it stunned me so when i first found it out that i couldnt believe it it didnt seem natural  but as soon as my mental sight cleared and i got a right focus on it i saw i was mistaken it was natural  for this reason a king is a mere artificiality and so a kings feelings like the impulses of an automatic doll are mere artificialities but as a man he is a reality and his feelings as a man are real not phantoms  it shames the average man to be valued below his own estimate of his worth and the king certainly wasnt anything more than an average man if he was up that high  confound him he wearied me with arguments to show that in anything like a fair market he would have fetched twentyfive dollars surea thing which was plainly nonsense and full or the baldest conceit i wasnt worth it myself  but it was tender ground for me to argue on  in fact i had to simply shirk argument and do the diplomatic instead  i had to throw conscience aside and brazenly concede that he ought to have brought twentyfive dollars whereas i was quite well aware that in all the ages the world had never seen a king that was worth half the money and during the next thirteen centuries wouldnt see one that was worth the fourth of it  yes he tired me  if he began to talk about the crops or about the recent weather or about the condition of politics or about dogs or cats or morals or theologyno matter what i sighed for i knew what was coming he was going to get out of it a palliation of that tiresome sevendollar sale  wherever we halted where there was a crowd he would give me a look which said plainly if that thing could be tried over again now with this kind of folk you would see a different result  well when he was first sold it secretly tickled me to see him go for seven dollars but before he was done with his sweating and worrying i wished he had fetched a hundred  the thing never got a chance to die for every day at one place or another possible purchasers looked us over and as often as any other way their comment on the king was something like this  heres a twodollarandahalf chump with a thirtydollar style pity but style was marketable  at last this sort of remark produced an evil result  our owner was a practical person and he perceived that this defect must be mended if he hoped to find a purchaser for the king  so he went to work to take the style out of his sacred majesty  i could have given the man some valuable advice but i didnt you mustnt volunteer advice to a slavedriver unless you want to damage the cause you are arguing for  i had found it a sufficiently difficult job to reduce the kings style to a peasants style even when he was a willing and anxious pupil now then to undertake to reduce the kings style to a slaves styleand by forcego to it was a stately contract  never mind the detailsit will save me trouble to let you imagine them  i will only remark that at the end of a week there was plenty of evidence that lash and club and fist had done their work well the kings body was a sight to seeand to weep over but his spiritwhy it wasnt even phased  even that dull clod of a slavedriver was able to see that there can be such a thing as a slave who will remain a man till he dies whose bones you can break but whose manhood you cant  this man found that from his first effort down to his latest he couldnt ever come within reach of the king but the king was ready to plunge for him and did it  so he gave up at last and left the king in possession of his style unimpaired the fact is the king was a good deal more than a king he was a man and when a man is a man you cant knock it out of him  we had a rough time for a month tramping to and fro in the earth and suffering  and what englishman was the most interested in the slavery question by that time  his grace the king  yes from being the most indifferent he was become the most interested he was become the bitterest hater of the institution i had ever heard talk  and so i ventured to ask once more a question which i had asked years before and had gotten such a sharp answer that i had not thought it prudent to meddle in the matter further would he abolish slavery  his answer was as sharp as before but it was music this time i shouldnt ever wish to hear pleasanter though the profanity was not good being awkwardly put together and with the crashword almost in the middle instead of at the end where of course it ought to have been  i was ready and willing to get free now i hadnt wanted to get free any sooner  no i cannot quite say that  i had wanted to but i had not been willing to take desperate chances and had always dissuaded the king from them  but nowah it was a new atmosphere  liberty would be worth any cost that might be put upon it now  i set about a plan and was straightway charmed with it  it would require time yes and patience too a great deal of both  one could invent quicker ways and fully as sure ones but none that would be as picturesque as this none that could be made so dramatic  and so i was not going to give this one up  it might delay us months but no matter i would carry it out or break something  now and then we had an adventure  one night we were overtaken by a snowstorm while still a mile from the village we were making for  almost instantly we were shut up as in a fog the driving snow was so thick  you couldnt see a thing and we were soon lost  the slavedriver lashed us desperately for he saw ruin before him but his lashings only made matters worse for they drove us further from the road and from likelihood of succor so we had to stop at last and slump down in the snow where we were  the storm continued until toward midnight then ceased by this time two of our feebler men and three of our women were dead and others past moving and threatened with death  our master was nearly beside himself  he stirred up the living and made us stand jump slap ourselves to restore our circulation and he helped as well as he could with his whip  now came a diversion  we heard shrieks and yells and soon a woman came running and crying and seeing our group she flung herself into our midst and begged for protection  a mob of people came tearing after her some with torches and they said she was a witch who had caused several cows to die by a strange disease and practiced her arts by help of a devil in the form of a black cat  this poor woman had been stoned until she hardly looked human she was so battered and bloody  the mob wanted to burn her  well now what do you suppose our master did  when we closed around this poor creature to shelter her he saw his chance  he said burn her here or they shouldnt have her at all  imagine that  they were willing  they fastened her to a post they brought wood and piled it about her they applied the torch while she shrieked and pleaded and strained her two young daughters to her breast and our brute with a heart solely for business lashed us into position about the stake and warmed us into life and commercial value by the same fire which took away the innocent life of that poor harmless mother  that was the sort of master we had  i took his number  that snowstorm cost him nine of his flock and he was more brutal to us than ever after that for many days together he was so enraged over his loss  we had adventures all along  one day we ran into a procession and such a procession  all the riffraff of the kingdom seemed to be comprehended in it and all drunk at that  in the van was a cart with a coffin in it and on the coffin sat a comely young girl of about eighteen suckling a baby which she squeezed to her breast in a passion of love every little while and every little while wiped from its face the tears which her eyes rained down upon it and always the foolish little thing smiled up at her happy and content kneading her breast with its dimpled fat hand which she patted and fondled right over her breaking heart  men and women boys and girls trotted along beside or after the cart hooting shouting profane and ribald remarks singing snatches of foul song skipping dancinga very holiday of hellions a sickening sight  we had struck a suburb of london outside the walls and this was a sample of one sort of london society  our master secured a good place for us near the gallows a priest was in attendance and he helped the girl climb up and said comforting words to her and made the undersheriff provide a stool for her  then he stood there by her on the gallows and for a moment looked down upon the mass of upturned faces at his feet then out over the solid pavement of heads that stretched away on every side occupying the vacancies far and near and then began to tell the story of the case  and there was pity in his voice how seldom a sound that was in that ignorant and savage land i remember every detail of what he said except the words he said it in and so i change it into my own words  law is intended to mete out justice  sometimes it fails this cannot be helped  we can only grieve and be resigned and pray for the soul of him who falls unfairly by the arm of the law and that his fellows may be few  a law sends this poor young thing to deathand it is right  but another law had placed her where she must commit her crime or starve with her childand before god that law is responsible for both her crime and her ignominious death  a little while ago this young thing this child of eighteen years was as happy a wife and mother as any in england and her lips were blithe with song which is the native speech of glad and innocent hearts  her young husband was as happy as she for he was doing his whole duty he worked early and late at his handicraft his bread was honest bread well and fairly earned he was prospering he was furnishing shelter and sustenance to his family he was adding his mite to the wealth of the nation  by consent of a treacherous law instant destruction fell upon this holy home and swept it away  that young husband was waylaid and impressed and sent to sea  the wife knew nothing of it  she sought him everywhere she moved the hardest hearts with the supplications of her tears the broken eloquence of her despair  weeks dragged by she watching waiting hoping her mind going slowly to wreck under the burden of her misery  little by little all her small possessions went for food  when she could no longer pay her rent they turned her out of doors  she begged while she had strength when she was starving at last and her milk failing she stole a piece of linen cloth of the value of a fourth part of a cent thinking to sell it and save her child  but she was seen by the owner of the cloth  she was put in jail and brought to trial the man testified to the facts  a plea was made for her and her sorrowful story was told in her behalf  she spoke too by permission and said she did steal the cloth but that her mind was so disordered of late by trouble that when she was overborne with hunger all acts criminal or other swam meaningless through her brain and she knew nothing rightly except that she was so hungry  for a moment all were touched and there was disposition to deal mercifully with her seeing that she was so young and friendless and her case so piteous and the law that robbed her of her support to blame as being the first and only cause of her transgression but the prosecuting officer replied that whereas these things were all true and most pitiful as well still there was much small theft in these days and mistimed mercy here would be a danger to propertyoh my god is there no property in ruined homes and orphaned babes and broken hearts that british law holds preciousand so he must require sentence  when the judge put on his black cap the owner of the stolen linen rose trembling up his lip quivering his face as gray as ashes and when the awful words came he cried out oh poor child poor child i did not know it was death and fell as a tree falls  when they lifted him up his reason was gone before the sun was set he had taken his own life  a kindly man a man whose heart was right at bottom add his murder to this that is to be now done here and charge them both where they belong to the rulers and the bitter laws of britain  the time is come my child let me pray over theenot for thee dear abused poor heart and innocent but for them that be guilty of thy ruin and death who need it more  after his prayer they put the noose around the young girls neck and they had great trouble to adjust the knot under her ear because she was devouring the baby all the time wildly kissing it and snatching it to her face and her breast and drenching it with tears and half moaning half shrieking all the while and the baby crowing and laughing and kicking its feet with delight over what it took for romp and play  even the hangman couldnt stand it but turned away  when all was ready the priest gently pulled and tugged and forced the child out of the mothers arms and stepped quickly out of her reach but she clasped her hands and made a wild spring toward him with a shriek but the ropeand the undersheriffheld her short  then she went on her knees and stretched out her hands and cried  one more kissoh my god one more one moreit is the dying that begs it  she got it she almost smothered the little thing  and when they got it away again she cried out  oh my child my darling it will die  it has no home it has no father no friend no mother  it has them all said that good priest  all these will i be to it till i die  you should have seen her face then  gratitude  lord what do you want with words to express that  words are only painted fire a look is the fire itself  she gave that look and carried it away to the treasury of heaven where all things that are divine belong    chapter xxxvi  an encounter in the dark  londonto a slavewas a sufficiently interesting place  it was merely a great big village and mainly mud and thatch  the streets were muddy crooked unpaved  the populace was an ever flocking and drifting swarm of rags and splendors of nodding plumes and shining armor  the king had a palace there he saw the outside of it  it made him sigh yes and swear a little in a poor juvenile sixth century way  we saw knights and grandees whom we knew but they didnt know us in our rags and dirt and raw welts and bruises and wouldnt have recognized us if we had hailed them nor stopped to answer either it being unlawful to speak with slaves on a chain  sandy passed within ten yards of me on a mulehunting for me i imagined  but the thing which clean broke my heart was something which happened in front of our old barrack in a square while we were enduring the spectacle of a man being boiled to death in oil for counterfeiting pennies  it was the sight of a newsboyand i couldnt get at him  still i had one comforthere was proof that clarence was still alive and banging away  i meant to be with him before long the thought was full of cheer  i had one little glimpse of another thing one day which gave me a great uplift  it was a wire stretching from housetop to housetop telegraph or telephone sure  i did very much wish i had a little piece of it  it was just what i needed in order to carry out my project of escape  my idea was to get loose some night along with the king then gag and bind our master change clothes with him batter him into the aspect of a stranger hitch him to the slavechain assume possession of the property march to camelot and  but you get my idea you see what a stunning dramatic surprise i would wind up with at the palace  it was all feasible if i could only get hold of a slender piece of iron which i could shape into a lockpick  i could then undo the lumbering padlocks with which our chains were fastened whenever i might choose but i never had any luck no such thing ever happened to fall in my way  however my chance came at last  a gentleman who had come twice before to dicker for me without result or indeed any approach to a result came again  i was far from expecting ever to belong to him for the price asked for me from the time i was first enslaved was exorbitant and always provoked either anger or derision yet my master stuck stubbornly to ittwentytwo dollars  he wouldnt bate a cent  the king was greatly admired because of his grand physique but his kingly style was against him and he wasnt salable nobody wanted that kind of a slave i considered myself safe from parting from him because of my extravagant price  no i was not expecting to ever belong to this gentleman whom i have spoken of but he had something which i expected would belong to me eventually if he would but visit us often enough  it was a steel thing with a long pin to it with which his long cloth outside garment was fastened together in front  there were three of them he had disappointed me twice because he did not come quite close enough to me to make my project entirely safe but this time i succeeded i captured the lower clasp of the three and when he missed it he thought he had lost it on the way  i had a chance to be glad about a minute then straightway a chance to be sad again  for when the purchase was about to fail as usual the master suddenly spoke up and said what would be worded thus in modern english  ill tell you what ill do  im tired supporting these two for no good  give me twentytwo dollars for this one and ill throw the other one in  the king couldnt get his breath he was in such a fury  he began to choke and gag and meantime the master and the gentleman moved away discussing  an ye will keep the offer open  tis open till the morrow at this hour  then i will answer you at that time said the gentleman and disappeared the master following him  i had a time of it to cool the king down but i managed it i whispered in his ear to this effect  your grace will go for nothing but after another fashion  and so shall i  tonight we shall both be free  ah  how is that  with this thing which i have stolen i will unlock these locks and cast off these chains tonight  when he comes about ninethirty to inspect us for the night we will seize him gag him batter him and early in the morning we will march out of this town proprietors of this caravan of slaves  that was as far as i went but the king was charmed and satisfied that evening we waited patiently for our fellowslaves to get to sleep and signify it by the usual sign for you must not take many chances on those poor fellows if you can avoid it  it is best to keep your own secrets  no doubt they fidgeted only about as usual but it didnt seem so to me  it seemed to me that they were going to be forever getting down to their regular snoring as the time dragged on i got nervously afraid we shouldnt have enough of it left for our needs so i made several premature attempts and merely delayed things by it for i couldnt seem to touch a padlock there in the dark without starting a rattle out of it which interrupted somebodys sleep and made him turn over and wake some more of the gang  but finally i did get my last iron off and was a free man once more  i took a good breath of relief and reached for the kings irons  too late in comes the master with a light in one hand and his heavy walkingstaff in the other  i snuggled close among the wallow of snorers to conceal as nearly as possible that i was naked of irons and i kept a sharp lookout and prepared to spring for my man the moment he should bend over me  but he didnt approach  he stopped gazed absently toward our dusky mass a minute evidently thinking about something else then set down his light moved musingly toward the door and before a body could imagine what he was going to do he was out of the door and had closed it behind him  quick said the king  fetch him back  of course it was the thing to do and i was up and out in a moment  but dear me there were no lamps in those days and it was a dark night  but i glimpsed a dim figure a few steps away  i darted for it threw myself upon it and then there was a state of things and lively  we fought and scuffled and struggled and drew a crowd in no time  they took an immense interest in the fight and encouraged us all they could and in fact couldnt have been pleasanter or more cordial if it had been their own fight  then a tremendous row broke out behind us and as much as half of our audience left us with a rush to invest some sympathy in that  lanterns began to swing in all directions it was the watch gathering from far and near  presently a halberd fell across my back as a reminder and i knew what it meant i was in custody  so was my adversary  we were marched off toward prison one on each side of the watchman  here was disaster here was a fine scheme gone to sudden destruction  i tried to imagine what would happen when the master should discover that it was i who had been fighting him and what would happen if they jailed us together in the general apartment for brawlers and petty lawbreakers as was the custom and what might  just then my antagonist turned his face around in my direction the freckled light from the watchmans tin lantern fell on it and by george he was the wrong man    chapter xxxvii  an awful predicament  sleep  it was impossible  it would naturally have been impossible in that noisome cavern of a jail with its mangy crowd of drunken quarrelsome and songsinging rapscallions  but the thing that made sleep all the more a thing not to be dreamed of was my racking impatience to get out of this place and find out the whole size of what might have happened yonder in the slavequarters in consequence of that intolerable miscarriage of mine  it was a long night but the morning got around at last  i made a full and frank explanation to the court  i said i was a slave the property of the great earl grip who had arrived just after dark at the tabard inn in the village on the other side of the water and had stopped there over night by compulsion he being taken deadly sick with a strange and sudden disorder  i had been ordered to cross to the city in all haste and bring the best physician i was doing my best naturally i was running with all my might the night was dark i ran against this common person here who seized me by the throat and began to pummel me although i told him my errand and implored him for the sake of the great earl my masters mortal peril  the common person interrupted and said it was a lie and was going to explain how i rushed upon him and attacked him without a word  silence sirrah from the court  take him hence and give him a few stripes whereby to teach him how to treat the servant of a nobleman after a different fashion another time  go  then the court begged my pardon and hoped i would not fail to tell his lordship it was in no wise the courts fault that this highhanded thing had happened  i said i would make it all right and so took my leave  took it just in time too he was starting to ask me why i didnt fetch out these facts the moment i was arrested  i said i would if i had thought of itwhich was true but that i was so battered by that man that all my wit was knocked out of meand so forth and so on and got myself away still mumbling  i didnt wait for breakfast  no grass grew under my feet  i was soon at the slave quarters  emptyeverybody gone that is everybody except one bodythe slavemasters  it lay there all battered to pulp and all about were the evidences of a terrific fight  there was a rude board coffin on a cart at the door and workmen assisted by the police were thinning a road through the gaping crowd in order that they might bring it in  i picked out a man humble enough in life to condescend to talk with one so shabby as i and got his account of the matter  there were sixteen slaves here  they rose against their master in the night and thou seest how it ended  yes  how did it begin  there was no witness but the slaves  they said the slave that was most valuable got free of his bonds and escaped in some strange wayby magic arts twas thought by reason that he had no key and the locks were neither broke nor in any wise injured  when the master discovered his loss he was mad with despair and threw himself upon his people with his heavy stick who resisted and brake his back and in other and divers ways did give him hurts that brought him swiftly to his end  this is dreadful  it will go hard with the slaves no doubt upon the trial  marry the trial is over  over  would they be a week think youand the matter so simple  they were not the half of a quarter of an hour at it  why i dont see how they could determine which were the guilty ones in so short a time  which ones  indeed they considered not particulars like to that they condemned them in a body  wit ye not the lawwhich men say the romans left behind them here when they wentthat if one slave killeth his master all the slaves of that man must die for it  true  i had forgotten  and when will these die  belike within a four and twenty hours albeit some say they will wait a pair of days more if peradventure they may find the missing one meantime  the missing one  it made me feel uncomfortable  is it likely they will find him  before the day is spentyes  they seek him everywhere  they stand at the gates of the town with certain of the slaves who will discover him to them if he cometh and none can pass out but he will be first examined  might one see the place where the rest are confined  the outside of ityes  the inside of itbut ye will not want to see that  i took the address of that prison for future reference and then sauntered off  at the first secondhand clothing shop i came to up a back street i got a rough rig suitable for a common seaman who might be going on a cold voyage and bound up my face with a liberal bandage saying i had a toothache  this concealed my worst bruises  it was a transformation  i no longer resembled my former self  then i struck out for that wire found it and followed it to its den  it was a little room over a butchers shopwhich meant that business wasnt very brisk in the telegraphic line  the young chap in charge was drowsing at his table  i locked the door and put the vast key in my bosom  this alarmed the young fellow and he was going to make a noise but i said  save your wind if you open your mouth you are dead sure  tackle your instrument  lively now  call camelot  this doth amaze me  how should such as you know aught of such matters as  call camelot  i am a desperate man  call camelot or get away from the instrument and i will do it myself  whatyou  yescertainly  stop gabbling  call the palace  he made the call  now then call clarence  clarence who  never mind clarence who  say you want clarence youll get an answer  he did so  we waited five nervestraining minutesten minutes how long it did seemand then came a click that was as familiar to me as a human voice for clarence had been my own pupil  now my lad vacate  they would have known my touch maybe and so your call was surest but im all right now  he vacated the place and cocked his ear to listenbut it didnt win  i used a cipher  i didnt waste any time in sociabilities with clarence but squared away for business straightoffthus  the king is here and in danger  we were captured and brought here as slaves  we should not be able to prove our identity and the fact is i am not in a position to try  send a telegram for the palace here which will carry conviction with it  his answer came straight back  they dont know anything about the telegraph they havent had any experience yet the line to london is so new  better not venture that  they might hang you  think up something else  might hang us  little he knew how closely he was crowding the facts  i couldnt think up anything for the moment  then an idea struck me and i started it along  send five hundred picked knights with launcelot in the lead and send them on the jump  let them enter by the southwest gate and look out for the man with a white cloth around his right arm  the answer was prompt  they shall start in half an hour  all right clarence now tell this lad here that im a friend of yours and a deadhead and that he must be discreet and say nothing about this visit of mine  the instrument began to talk to the youth and i hurried away i fell to ciphering  in half an hour it would be nine oclock knights and horses in heavy armor couldnt travel very fast these would make the best time they could and now that the ground was in good condition and no snow or mud they would probably make a sevenmile gait they would have to change horses a couple of times they would arrive about six or a little after it would still be plenty light enough they would see the white cloth which i should tie around my right arm and i would take command  we would surround that prison and have the king out in no time it would be showy and picturesque enough all things considered though i would have preferred noonday on account of the more theatrical aspect the thing would have  now then in order to increase the strings to my bow i thought i would look up some of those people whom i had formerly recognized and make myself known  that would help us out of our scrape without the knights  but i must proceed cautiously for it was a risky business  i must get into sumptuous raiment and it wouldnt do to run and jump into it  no i must work up to it by degrees buying suit after suit of clothes in shops wide apart and getting a little finer article with each change until i should finally reach silk and velvet and be ready for my project  so i started  but the scheme fell through like scat  the first corner i turned i came plump upon one of our slaves snooping around with a watchman i coughed at the moment and he gave me a sudden look that bit right into my marrow  i judge he thought he had heard that cough before i turned immediately into a shop and worked along down the counter pricing things and watching out of the corner of my eye  those people had stopped and were talking together and looking in at the door  i made up my mind to get out the back way if there was a back way and i asked the shopwoman if i could step out there and look for the escaped slave who was believed to be in hiding back there somewhere and said i was an officer in disguise and my pard was yonder at the door with one of the murderers in charge and would she be good enough to step there and tell him he neednt wait but had better go at once to the further end of the back alley and be ready to head him off when i rousted him out  she was blazing with eagerness to see one of those already celebrated murderers and she started on the errand at once  i slipped out the back way locked the door behind me put the key in my pocket and started off chuckling to myself and comfortable  well i had gone and spoiled it again made another mistake a double one in fact  there were plenty of ways to get rid of that officer by some simple and plausible device but no i must pick out a picturesque one it is the crying defect of my character and then i had ordered my procedure upon what the officer being human would naturally do whereas when you are least expecting it a man will now and then go and do the very thing which its not natural for him to do  the natural thing for the officer to do in this case was to follow straight on my heels he would find a stout oaken door securely locked between him and me before he could break it down i should be far away and engaged in slipping into a succession of baffling disguises which would soon get me into a sort of raiment which was a surer protection from meddling lawdogs in britain than any amount of mere innocence and purity of character  but instead of doing the natural thing the officer took me at my word and followed my instructions  and so as i came trotting out of that cul de sac full of satisfaction with my own cleverness he turned the corner and i walked right into his handcuffs  if i had known it was a cul de sachowever there isnt any excusing a blunder like that let it go  charge it up to profit and loss  of course i was indignant and swore i had just come ashore from a long voyage and all that sort of thingjust to see you know if it would deceive that slave  but it didnt  he knew me  then i reproached him for betraying me  he was more surprised than hurt  he stretched his eyes wide and said  what wouldst have me let thee of all men escape and not hang with us when thourt the very cause of our hanging  go to  go to was their way of saying i should smile or i like that queer talkers those people  well there was a sort of bastard justice in his view of the case and so i dropped the matter  when you cant cure a disaster by argument what is the use to argue  it isnt my way  so i only said  youre not going to be hanged  none of us are  both men laughed and the slave said  ye have not ranked as a foolbefore  you might better keep your reputation seeing the strain would not be for long  it will stand it i reckon  before tomorrow we shall be out of prison and free to go where we will besides  the witty officer lifted at his left ear with his thumb made a rasping noise in his throat and said  out of prisonyesye say true  and free likewise to go where ye will so ye wander not out of his grace the devils sultry realm  i kept my temper and said indifferently  now i suppose you really think we are going to hang within a day or two  i thought it not many minutes ago for so the thing was decided and proclaimed  ah then youve changed your mind is that it  even that  i only thought then i know now  i felt sarcastical so i said  oh sapient servant of the law condescend to tell us then what you know  that ye will all be hanged today at midafternoon  oho that shot hit home  lean upon me  the fact is i did need to lean upon somebody  my knights couldnt arrive in time  they would be as much as three hours too late nothing in the world could save the king of england nor me which was more important  more important not merely to me but to the nationthe only nation on earth standing ready to blossom into civilization  i was sick  i said no more there wasnt anything to say  i knew what the man meant that if the missing slave was found the postponement would be revoked the execution take place today  well the missing slave was found    chapter xxxviii  sir launcelot and knights to the rescue  nearing four in the afternoon  the scene was just outside the walls of london  a cool comfortable superb day with a brilliant sun the kind of day to make one want to live not die  the multitude was prodigious and farreaching and yet we fifteen poor devils hadnt a friend in it  there was something painful in that thought look at it how you might  there we sat on our tall scaffold the butt of the hate and mockery of all those enemies  we were being made a holiday spectacle  they had built a sort of grand stand for the nobility and gentry and these were there in full force with their ladies  we recognized a good many of them  the crowd got a brief and unexpected dash of diversion out of the king  the moment we were freed of our bonds he sprang up in his fantastic rags with face bruised out of all recognition and proclaimed himself arthur king of britain and denounced the awful penalties of treason upon every soul there present if hair of his sacred head were touched  it startled and surprised him to hear them break into a vast roar of laughter  it wounded his dignity and he locked himself up in silence  then although the crowd begged him to go on and tried to provoke him to it by catcalls jeers and shouts of  let him speak  the king  the king his humble subjects hunger and thirst for words of wisdom out of the mouth of their master his serene and sacred raggedness  but it went for nothing  he put on all his majesty and sat under this rain of contempt and insult unmoved  he certainly was great in his way  absently i had taken off my white bandage and wound it about my right arm  when the crowd noticed this they began upon me  they said  doubtless this sailorman is his ministerobserve his costly badge of office  i let them go on until they got tired and then i said  yes i am his minister the boss and tomorrow you will hear that from camelot which  i got no further  they drowned me out with joyous derision  but presently there was silence for the sheriffs of london in their official robes with their subordinates began to make a stir which indicated that business was about to begin  in the hush which followed our crime was recited the death warrant read then everybody uncovered while a priest uttered a prayer  then a slave was blindfolded the hangman unslung his rope  there lay the smooth road below us we upon one side of it the banked multitude wailing its other sidea good clear road and kept free by the policehow good it would be to see my five hundred horsemen come tearing down it  but no it was out of the possibilities i followed its receding thread out into the distancenot a horseman on it or sign of one  there was a jerk and the slave hung dangling dangling and hideously squirming for his limbs were not tied  a second rope was unslung in a moment another slave was dangling  in a minute a third slave was struggling in the air  it was dreadful  i turned away my head a moment and when i turned back i missed the king  they were blindfolding him  i was paralyzed i couldnt move i was choking my tongue was petrified  they finished blindfolding him they led him under the rope  i couldnt shake off that clinging impotence  but when i saw them put the noose around his neck then everything let go in me and i made a spring to the rescueand as i made it i shot one more glance abroadby george here they came atiltingfive hundred mailed and belted knights on bicycles  the grandest sight that ever was seen  lord how the plumes streamed how the sun flamed and flashed from the endless procession of webby wheels  i waved my right arm as launcelot swept inhe recognized my rag i tore away noose and bandage and shouted  on your knees every rascal of you and salute the king  who fails shall sup in hell tonight  i always use that high style when im climaxing an effect  well it was noble to see launcelot and the boys swarm up onto that scaffold and heave sheriffs and such overboard  and it was fine to see that astonished multitude go down on their knees and beg their lives of the king they had just been deriding and insulting and as he stood apart there receiving this homage in rags i thought to myself well really there is something peculiarly grand about the gait and bearing of a king after all  i was immensely satisfied  take the whole situation all around it was one of the gaudiest effects i ever instigated  and presently up comes clarence his own self and winks and says very modernly  good deal of a surprise wasnt it  i knew youd like it  ive had the boys practicing this long time privately and just hungry for a chance to show off    chapter xxxix  the yankees fight with the knights  home again at camelot  a morning or two later i found the paper damp from the press by my plate at the breakfast table  i turned to the advertising columns knowing i should find something of personal interest to me there  it was this

first tournament    under the new law whidh allow each    combatant to use any weapon he may pre    fer you may want to make a note of that  up to the day set there was no talk in all britain of anything but this combat  all other topics sank into insignificance and passed out of mens thoughts and interest  it was not because a tournament was a great matter it was not because sir sagramor had found the holy grail for he had not but had failed it was not because the second official personage in the kingdom was one of the duellists no all these features were commonplace yet there was abundant reason for the extraordinary interest which this coming fight was creating  it was born of the fact that all the nation knew that this was not to be a duel between mere men so to speak but a duel between two mighty magicians a duel not of muscle but of mind not of human skill but of superhuman art and craft a final struggle for supremacy between the two master enchanters of the age  it was realized that the most prodigious achievements of the most renowned knights could not be worthy of comparison with a spectacle like this they could be but childs play contrasted with this mysterious and awful battle of the gods yes all the world knew it was going to be in reality a duel between merlin and me a measuring of his magic powers against mine  it was known that merlin had been busy whole days and nights together imbuing sir sagramors arms and armor with supernal powers of offense and defense and that he had procured for him from the spirits of the air a fleecy veil which would render the wearer invisible to his antagonist while still visible to other men  against sir sagramor so weaponed and protected a thousand knights could accomplish nothing against him no known enchantments could prevail  these facts were sure regarding them there was no doubt no reason for doubt  there was but one question might there be still other enchantments unknown to merlin which could render sir sagramors veil transparent to me and make his enchanted mail vulnerable to my weapons  this was the one thing to be decided in the lists  until then the world must remain in suspense  so the world thought there was a vast matter at stake here and the world was right but it was not the one they had in their minds  no a far vaster one was upon the cast of this die the life of knighterrantry  i was a champion it was true but not the champion of the frivolous black arts i was the champion of hard unsentimental commonsense and reason  i was entering the lists to either destroy knighterrantry or be its victim  vast as the showgrounds were there were no vacant spaces in them outside of the lists at ten oclock on the morning of the 16th the mammoth grandstand was clothed in flags streamers and rich tapestries and packed with several acres of smallfry tributary kings their suites and the british aristocracy with our own royal gang in the chief place and each and every individual a flashing prism of gaudy silks and velvetswell i never saw anything to begin with it but a fight between an upper mississippi sunset and the aurora borealis  the huge camp of beflagged and gaycolored tents at one end of the lists with a stiffstanding sentinel at every door and a shining shield hanging by him for challenge was another fine sight  you see every knight was there who had any ambition or any caste feeling for my feeling toward their order was not much of a secret and so here was their chance  if i won my fight with sir sagramor others would have the right to call me out as long as i might be willing to respond  down at our end there were but two tents one for me and another for my servants  at the appointed hour the king made a sign and the heralds in their tabards appeared and made proclamation naming the combatants and stating the cause of quarrel  there was a pause then a ringing bugleblast which was the signal for us to come forth  all the multitude caught their breath and an eager curiosity flashed into every face  out from his tent rode great sir sagramor an imposing tower of iron stately and rigid his huge spear standing upright in its socket and grasped in his strong hand his grand horses face and breast cased in steel his body clothed in rich trappings that almost dragged the groundoh a most noble picture  a great shout went up of welcome and admiration  and then out i came  but i didnt get any shout  there was a wondering and eloquent silence for a moment then a great wave of laughter began to sweep along that human sea but a warning bugleblast cut its career short  i was in the simplest and comfortablest of gymnast costumesfleshcolored tights from neck to heel with blue silk puffings about my loins and bareheaded my horse was not above medium size but he was alert slenderlimbed muscled with watchsprings and just a greyhound to go  he was a beauty glossy as silk and naked as he was when he was born except for bridle and rangersaddle  the iron tower and the gorgeous bedquilt came cumbrously but gracefully pirouetting down the lists and we tripped lightly up to meet them  we halted the tower saluted i responded then we wheeled and rode side by side to the grandstand and faced our king and queen to whom we made obeisance  the queen exclaimed  alack sir boss wilt fight naked and without lance or sword or  but the king checked her and made her understand with a polite phrase or two that this was none of her business  the bugles rang again and we separated and rode to the ends of the lists and took position  now old merlin stepped into view and cast a dainty web of gossamer threads over sir sagramor which turned him into hamlets ghost the king made a sign the bugles blew sir sagramor laid his great lance in rest and the next moment here he came thundering down the course with his veil flying out behind and i went whistling through the air like an arrow to meet him cocking my ear the while as if noting the invisible knights position and progress by hearing not sight  a chorus of encouraging shouts burst out for him and one brave voice flung out a heartening word for mesaid  go it slim jim  it was an even bet that clarence had procured that favor for me and furnished the language too  when that formidable lancepoint was within a yard and a half of my breast i twitched my horse aside without an effort and the big knight swept by scoring a blank i got plenty of applause that time  we turned braced up and down we came again  another blank for the knight a roar of applause for me  this same thing was repeated once more and it fetched such a whirlwind of applause that sir sagramor lost his temper and at once changed his tactics and set himself the task of chasing me down  why he hadnt any show in the world at that it was a game of tag with all the advantage on my side i whirled out of his path with ease whenever i chose and once i slapped him on the back as i went to the rear  finally i took the chase into my own hands and after that turn or twist or do what he would he was never able to get behind me again he found himself always in front at the end of his maneuver  so he gave up that business and retired to his end of the lists  his temper was clear gone now and he forgot himself and flung an insult at me which disposed of mine  i slipped my lasso from the horn of my saddle and grasped the coil in my right hand  this time you should have seen him comeit was a business trip sure by his gait there was blood in his eye  i was sitting my horse at ease and swinging the great loop of my lasso in wide circles about my head the moment he was under way i started for him when the space between us had narrowed to forty feet i sent the snaky spirals of the rope acleaving through the air then darted aside and faced about and brought my trained animal to a halt with all his feet braced under him for a surge  the next moment the rope sprang taut and yanked sir sagramor out of the saddle  great scott but there was a sensation  unquestionably the popular thing in this world is novelty  these people had never seen anything of that cowboy business before and it carried them clear off their feet with delight  from all around and everywhere the shout went up  encore encore  i wondered where they got the word but there was no time to cipher on philological matters because the whole knighterrantry hive was just humming now and my prospect for trade couldnt have been better  the moment my lasso was released and sir sagramor had been assisted to his tent i hauled in the slack took my station and began to swing my loop around my head again  i was sure to have use for it as soon as they could elect a successor for sir sagramor and that couldnt take long where there were so many hungry candidates  indeed they elected one straight off sir hervis de revel  bzz  here he came like a house afire i dodged he passed like a flash with my horsehair coils settling around his neck a second or so later fst his saddle was empty  i got another encore and another and another and still another when i had snaked five men out things began to look serious to the ironclads and they stopped and consulted together  as a result they decided that it was time to waive etiquette and send their greatest and best against me  to the astonishment of that little world i lassoed sir lamorak de galis and after him sir galahad  so you see there was simply nothing to be done now but play their right bowerbring out the superbest of the superb the mightiest of the mighty the great sir launcelot himself  a proud moment for me  i should think so  yonder was arthur king of britain yonder was guenever yes and whole tribes of little provincial kings and kinglets and in the tented camp yonder renowned knights from many lands and likewise the selectest body known to chivalry the knights of the table round the most illustrious in christendom and biggest fact of all the very sun of their shining system was yonder couching his lance the focal point of forty thousand adoring eyes and all by myself here was i laying for him  across my mind flitted the dear image of a certain hellogirl of west hartford and i wished she could see me now  in that moment down came the invincible with the rush of a whirlwindthe courtly world rose to its feet and bent forward the fateful coils went circling through the air and before you could wink i was towing sir launcelot across the field on his back and kissing my hand to the storm of waving kerchiefs and the thundercrash of applause that greeted me  said i to myself as i coiled my lariat and hung it on my saddlehorn and sat there drunk with glory the victory is perfectno other will venture against meknighterrantry is dead  now imagine my astonishmentand everybody elses tooto hear the peculiar buglecall which announces that another competitor is about to enter the lists  there was a mystery here i couldnt account for this thing  next i noticed merlin gliding away from me and then i noticed that my lasso was gone  the old sleightofhand expert had stolen it sure and slipped it under his robe  the bugle blew again  i looked and down came sagramor riding again with his dust brushed off and his veil nicely rearranged i trotted up to meet him and pretended to find him by the sound of his horses hoofs  he said  thourt quick of ear but it will not save thee from this and he touched the hilt of his great sword  an ye are not able to see it because of the influence of the veil know that it is no cumbrous lance but a swordand i ween ye will not be able to avoid it  his visor was up there was death in his smile  i should never be able to dodge his sword that was plain  somebody was going to die this time  if he got the drop on me i could name the corpse  we rode forward together and saluted the royalties this time the king was disturbed  he said  where is thy strange weapon  it is stolen sire  hast another at hand  no sire i brought only the one  then merlin mixed in  he brought but the one because there was but the one to bring there exists none other but that one  it belongeth to the king of the demons of the sea  this man is a pretender and ignorant else he had known that that weapon can be used in but eight bouts only and then it vanisheth away to its home under the sea  then is he weaponless said the king  sir sagramore ye will grant him leave to borrow  and i will lend said sir launcelot limping up  he is as brave a knight of his hands as any that be on live and he shall have mine  he put his hand on his sword to draw it but sir sagramor said  stay it may not be  he shall fight with his own weapons it was his privilege to choose them and bring them  if he has erred on his head be it  knight said the king  thourt overwrought with passion it disorders thy mind  wouldst kill a naked man  an he do it he shall answer it to me said sir launcelot  i will answer it to any he that desireth retorted sir sagramor hotly  merlin broke in rubbing his hands and smiling his lowdownest smile of malicious gratification  tis well said right well said  and tis enough of parleying let my lord the king deliver the battle signal  the king had to yield  the bugle made proclamation and we turned apart and rode to our stations  there we stood a hundred yards apart facing each other rigid and motionless like horsed statues and so we remained in a soundless hush as much as a full minute everybody gazing nobody stirring  it seemed as if the king could not take heart to give the signal  but at last he lifted his hand the clear note of the bugle followed sir sagramors long blade described a flashing curve in the air and it was superb to see him come  i sat still  on he came  i did not move  people got so excited that they shouted to me  fly fly  save thyself  this is murther  i never budged so much as an inch till that thundering apparition had got within fifteen paces of me then i snatched a dragoon revolver out of my holster there was a flash and a roar and the revolver was back in the holster before anybody could tell what had happened  here was a riderless horse plunging by and yonder lay sir sagramor stone dead  the people that ran to him were stricken dumb to find that the life was actually gone out of the man and no reason for it visible no hurt upon his body nothing like a wound  there was a hole through the breast of his chainmail but they attached no importance to a little thing like that and as a bullet wound there produces but little blood none came in sight because of the clothing and swaddlings under the armor  the body was dragged over to let the king and the swells look down upon it  they were stupefied with astonishment naturally  i was requested to come and explain the miracle  but i remained in my tracks like a statue and said  if it is a command i will come but my lord the king knows that i am where the laws of combat require me to remain while any desire to come against me  i waited  nobody challenged  then i said  if there are any who doubt that this field is well and fairly won i do not wait for them to challenge me i challenge them  it is a gallant offer said the king and well beseems you whom will you name first  i name none i challenge all  here i stand and dare the chivalry of england to come against menot by individuals but in mass  what shouted a score of knights  you have heard the challenge  take it or i proclaim you recreant knights and vanquished every one  it was a bluff you know  at such a time it is sound judgment to put on a bold face and play your hand for a hundred times what it is worth fortynine times out of fifty nobody dares to call and you rake in the chips  but just this oncewell things looked squally  in just no time five hundred knights were scrambling into their saddles and before you could wink a widely scattering drove were under way and clattering down upon me  i snatched both revolvers from the holsters and began to measure distances and calculate chances  bang  one saddle empty  bang another one  bangbang and i bagged two  well it was nip and tuck with us and i knew it if i spent the eleventh shot without convincing these people the twelfth man would kill me sure  and so i never did feel so happy as i did when my ninth downed its man and i detected the wavering in the crowd which is premonitory of panic  an instant lost now could knock out my last chance  but i didnt lose it i raised both revolvers and pointed themthe halted host stood their ground just about one good square moment then broke and fled  the day was mine  knighterrantry was a doomed institution  the march of civilization was begun  how did i feel  ah you never could imagine it  and brer merlin  his stock was flat again  somehow every time the magic of folderol tried conclusions with the magic of science the magic of folderol got left    chapter xl  three years later  when i broke the back of knighterrantry that time i no longer felt obliged to work in secret  so the very next day i exposed my hidden schools my mines and my vast system of clandestine factories and workshops to an astonished world  that is to say i exposed the nineteenth century to the inspection of the sixth  well it is always a good plan to follow up an advantage promptly the knights were temporarily down but if i would keep them so i must just simply paralyze themnothing short of that would answer  you see i was bluffing that last time in the field it would be natural for them to work around to that conclusion if i gave them a chance  so i must not give them time and i didnt  i renewed my challenge engraved it on brass posted it up where any priest could read it to them and also kept it standing in the advertising columns of the paper  i not only renewed it but added to its proportions  i said name the day and i would take fifty assistants and stand up against the massed chivalry of the whole earth and destroy it  i was not bluffing this time  i meant what i said i could do what i promised  there wasnt any way to misunderstand the language of that challenge  even the dullest of the chivalry perceived that this was a plain case of put up or shut up  they were wise and did the latter  in all the next three years they gave me no trouble worth mentioning  consider the three years sped  now look around on england  a happy and prosperous country and strangely altered  schools everywhere and several colleges a number of pretty good newspapers  even authorship was taking a start sir dinadan the humorist was first in the field with a volume of grayheaded jokes which i had been familiar with during thirteen centuries  if he had left out that old rancid one about the lecturer i wouldnt have said anything but i couldnt stand that one  i suppressed the book and hanged the author  slavery was dead and gone all men were equal before the law taxation had been equalized  the telegraph the telephone the phonograph the typewriter the sewingmachine and all the thousand willing and handy servants of steam and electricity were working their way into favor  we had a steamboat or two on the thames we had steam warships and the beginnings of a steam commercial marine i was getting ready to send out an expedition to discover america  we were building several lines of railway and our line from camelot to london was already finished and in operation  i was shrewd enough to make all offices connected with the passenger service places of high and distinguished honor  my idea was to attract the chivalry and nobility and make them useful and keep them out of mischief  the plan worked very well the competition for the places was hot  the conductor of the 433 express was a duke there wasnt a passenger conductor on the line below the degree of earl  they were good men every one but they had two defects which i couldnt cure and so had to wink at they wouldnt lay aside their armor and they would knock down fare i mean rob the company  there was hardly a knight in all the land who wasnt in some useful employment  they were going from end to end of the country in all manner of useful missionary capacities their penchant for wandering and their experience in it made them altogether the most effective spreaders of civilization we had  they went clothed in steel and equipped with sword and lance and battleaxe and if they couldnt persuade a person to try a sewingmachine on the installment plan or a melodeon or a barbedwire fence or a prohibition journal or any of the other thousand and one things they canvassed for they removed him and passed on  i was very happy  things were working steadily toward a secretly longedfor point  you see i had two schemes in my head which were the vastest of all my projects  the one was to overthrow the catholic church and set up the protestant faith on its ruins not as an established church but a goasyouplease one and the other project was to get a decree issued by and by commanding that upon arthurs death unlimited suffrage should be introduced and given to men and women alikeat any rate to all men wise or unwise and to all mothers who at middle age should be found to know nearly as much as their sons at twentyone  arthur was good for thirty years yet he being about my own agethat is to say fortyand i believed that in that time i could easily have the active part of the population of that day ready and eager for an event which should be the first of its kind in the history of the worlda rounded and complete governmental revolution without bloodshed  the result to be a republic  well i may as well confess though i do feel ashamed when i think of it i was beginning to have a base hankering to be its first president myself  yes there was more or less human nature in me i found that out  clarence was with me as concerned the revolution but in a modified way  his idea was a republic without privileged orders but with a hereditary royal family at the head of it instead of an elective chief magistrate  he believed that no nation that had ever known the joy of worshiping a royal family could ever be robbed of it and not fade away and die of melancholy  i urged that kings were dangerous  he said then have cats  he was sure that a royal family of cats would answer every purpose  they would be as useful as any other royal family they would know as much they would have the same virtues and the same treacheries the same disposition to get up shindies with other royal cats they would be laughably vain and absurd and never know it they would be wholly inexpensive finally they would have as sound a divine right as any other royal house and tom vii or tom xi or tom xiv by the grace of god king would sound as well as it would when applied to the ordinary royal tomcat with tights on  and as a rule said he in his neat modern english the character of these cats would be considerably above the character of the average king and this would be an immense moral advantage to the nation for the reason that a nation always models its morals after its monarchs  the worship of royalty being founded in unreason these graceful and harmless cats would easily become as sacred as any other royalties and indeed more so because it would presently be noticed that they hanged nobody beheaded nobody imprisoned nobody inflicted no cruelties or injustices of any sort and so must be worthy of a deeper love and reverence than the customary human king and would certainly get it  the eyes of the whole harried world would soon be fixed upon this humane and gentle system and royal butchers would presently begin to disappear their subjects would fill the vacancies with catlings from our own royal house we should become a factory we should supply the thrones of the world within forty years all europe would be governed by cats and we should furnish the cats  the reign of universal peace would begin then to end no more forever  meeeyowowowowfztwow  hang him i supposed he was in earnest and was beginning to be persuaded by him until he exploded that cathowl and startled me almost out of my clothes  but he never could be in earnest  he didnt know what it was  he had pictured a distinct and perfectly rational and feasible improvement upon constitutional monarchy but he was too featherheaded to know it or care anything about it either  i was going to give him a scolding but sandy came flying in at that moment wild with terror and so choked with sobs that for a minute she could not get her voice  i ran and took her in my arms and lavished caresses upon her and said beseechingly  speak darling speak  what is it  her head fell limp upon my bosom and she gasped almost inaudibly  hellocentral  quick i shouted to clarence telephone the kings homeopath to come  in two minutes i was kneeling by the childs crib and sandy was dispatching servants here there and everywhere all over the palace  i took in the situation almost at a glancemembranous croup  i bent down and whispered  wake up sweetheart  hellocentral  she opened her soft eyes languidly and made out to say  papa  that was a comfort  she was far from dead yet  i sent for preparations of sulphur i rousted out the croupkettle myself for i dont sit down and wait for doctors when sandy or the child is sick  i knew how to nurse both of them and had had experience this little chap had lived in my arms a good part of its small life and often i could soothe away its troubles and get it to laugh through the teardews on its eyelashes when even its mother couldnt  sir launcelot in his richest armor came striding along the great hall now on his way to the stockboard he was president of the stockboard and occupied the siege perilous which he had bought of sir galahad for the stockboard consisted of the knights of the round table and they used the round table for business purposes now  seats at it were worthwell you would never believe the figure so it is no use to state it  sir launcelot was a bear and he had put up a corner in one of the new lines and was just getting ready to squeeze the shorts today but what of that  he was the same old launcelot and when he glanced in as he was passing the door and found out that his pet was sick that was enough for him bulls and bears might fight it out their own way for all him he would come right in here and stand by little hellocentral for all he was worth  and that was what he did  he shied his helmet into the corner and in half a minute he had a new wick in the alcohol lamp and was firing up on the croupkettle  by this time sandy had built a blanket canopy over the crib and everything was ready  sir launcelot got up steam he and i loaded up the kettle with unslaked lime and carbolic acid with a touch of lactic acid added thereto then filled the thing up with water and inserted the steamspout under the canopy  everything was shipshape now and we sat down on either side of the crib to stand our watch sandy was so grateful and so comforted that she charged a couple of churchwardens with willowbark and sumachtobacco for us and told us to smoke as much as we pleased it couldnt get under the canopy and she was used to smoke being the first lady in the land who had ever seen a cloud blown  well there couldnt be a more contented or comfortable sight than sir launcelot in his noble armor sitting in gracious serenity at the end of a yard of snowy churchwarden  he was a beautiful man a lovely man and was just intended to make a wife and children happy  but of course gueneverhowever its no use to cry over whats done and cant be helped  well he stood watchandwatch with me right straight through for three days and nights till the child was out of danger then he took her up in his great arms and kissed her with his plumes falling about her golden head then laid her softly in sandys lap again and took his stately way down the vast hall between the ranks of admiring menatarms and menials and so disappeared and no instinct warned me that i should never look upon him again in this world  lord what a world of heartbreak it is  the doctors said we must take the child away if we would coax her back to health and strength again  and she must have seaair so we took a manofwar and a suite of two hundred and sixty persons and went cruising about and after a fortnight of this we stepped ashore on the french coast and the doctors thought it would be a good idea to make something of a stay there  the little king of that region offered us his hospitalities and we were glad to accept  if he had had as many conveniences as he lacked we should have been plenty comfortable enough even as it was we made out very well in his queer old castle by the help of comforts and luxuries from the ship  at the end of a month i sent the vessel home for fresh supplies and for news  we expected her back in three or four days  she would bring me along with other news the result of a certain experiment which i had been starting  it was a project of mine to replace the tournament with something which might furnish an escape for the extra steam of the chivalry keep those bucks entertained and out of mischief and at the same time preserve the best thing in them which was their hardy spirit of emulation i had had a choice band of them in private training for some time and the date was now arriving for their first public effort  this experiment was baseball  in order to give the thing vogue from the start and place it out of the reach of criticism i chose my nines by rank not capacity  there wasnt a knight in either team who wasnt a sceptered sovereign  as for material of this sort there was a glut of it always around arthur  you couldnt throw a brick in any direction and not cripple a king  of course i couldnt get these people to leave off their armor they wouldnt do that when they bathed  they consented to differentiate the armor so that a body could tell one team from the other but that was the most they would do  so one of the teams wore chainmail ulsters and the other wore platearmor made of my new bessemer steel  their practice in the field was the most fantastic thing i ever saw  being ballproof they never skipped out of the way but stood still and took the result when a bessemer was at the bat and a ball hit him it would bound a hundred and fifty yards sometimes  and when a man was running and threw himself on his stomach to slide to his base it was like an ironclad coming into port  at first i appointed men of no rank to act as umpires but i had to discontinue that  these people were no easier to please than other nines  the umpires first decision was usually his last they broke him in two with a bat and his friends toted him home on a shutter  when it was noticed that no umpire ever survived a game umpiring got to be unpopular  so i was obliged to appoint somebody whose rank and lofty position under the government would protect him  here are the names of the nines       bessemers                   ulsters     king arthur                emperor lucius    king lot of lothian        king logris    king of northgalis         king marhalt of ireland    king marsil                king morganore    king of little britain     king mark of cornwall    king labor                 king nentres of garlot    king pellam of listengese  king meliodas of liones    king bagdemagus            king of the lake    king tolleme la feintes    the sowdan of syria                    umpireclarence  the first public game would certainly draw fifty thousand people and for solid fun would be worth going around the world to see everything would be favorable it was balmy and beautiful spring weather now and nature was all tailored out in her new clothes    chapter xli  the interdict  however my attention was suddenly snatched from such matters our child began to lose ground again and we had to go to sitting up with her her case became so serious  we couldnt bear to allow anybody to help in this service so we two stood watchandwatch day in and day out  ah sandy what a right heart she had how simple and genuine and good she was  she was a flawless wife and mother and yet i had married her for no other particular reasons except that by the customs of chivalry she was my property until some knight should win her from me in the field  she had hunted britain over for me had found me at the hangingbout outside of london and had straightway resumed her old place at my side in the placidest way and as of right  i was a new englander and in my opinion this sort of partnership would compromise her sooner or later  she couldnt see how but i cut argument short and we had a wedding  now i didnt know i was drawing a prize yet that was what i did draw  within the twelvemonth i became her worshiper and ours was the dearest and perfectest comradeship that ever was  people talk about beautiful friendships between two persons of the same sex  what is the best of that sort as compared with the friendship of man and wife where the best impulses and highest ideals of both are the same  there is no place for comparison between the two friendships the one is earthly the other divine  in my dreams along at first i still wandered thirteen centuries away and my unsatisfied spirit went calling and harking all up and down the unreplying vacancies of a vanished world  many a time sandy heard that imploring cry come from my lips in my sleep with a grand magnanimity she saddled that cry of mine upon our child conceiving it to be the name of some lost darling of mine it touched me to tears and it also nearly knocked me off my feet too when she smiled up in my face for an earned reward and played her quaint and pretty surprise upon me  the name of one who was dear to thee is here preserved here made holy and the music of it will abide alway in our ears  now thoult kiss me as knowing the name i have given the child  but i didnt know it all the same  i hadnt an idea in the world but it would have been cruel to confess it and spoil her pretty game so i never let on but said  yes i know sweethearthow dear and good it is of you too but i want to hear these lips of yours which are also mine utter it firstthen its music will be perfect  pleased to the marrow she murmured  hellocentral  i didnt laughi am always thankful for thatbut the strain ruptured every cartilage in me and for weeks afterward i could hear my bones clack when i walked  she never found out her mistake the first time she heard that form of salute used at the telephone she was surprised and not pleased but i told her i had given order for it that henceforth and forever the telephone must always be invoked with that reverent formality in perpetual honor and remembrance of my lost friend and her small namesake  this was not true  but it answered  well during two weeks and a half we watched by the crib and in our deep solicitude we were unconscious of any world outside of that sickroom  then our reward came the center of the universe turned the corner and began to mend  grateful  it isnt the term there isnt any term for it  you know that yourself if youve watched your child through the valley of the shadow and seen it come back to life and sweep night out of the earth with one allilluminating smile that you could cover with your hand  why we were back in this world in one instant  then we looked the same startled thought into each others eyes at the same moment more than two weeks gone and that ship not back yet  in another minute i appeared in the presence of my train  they had been steeped in troubled bodings all this timetheir faces showed it  i called an escort and we galloped five miles to a hilltop overlooking the sea  where was my great commerce that so lately had made these glistening expanses populous and beautiful with its whitewinged flocks  vanished every one  not a sail from verge to verge not a smokebankjust a dead and empty solitude in place of all that brisk and breezy life  i went swiftly back saying not a word to anybody  i told sandy this ghastly news  we could imagine no explanation that would begin to explain  had there been an invasion an earthquake a pestilence  had the nation been swept out of existence  but guessing was profitless  i must goat once  i borrowed the kings navya ship no bigger than a steam launchand was soon ready  the partingah yes that was hard  as i was devouring the child with last kisses it brisked up and jabbered out its vocabulary the first time in more than two weeks and it made fools of us for joy  the darling mispronunciations of childhooddear me theres no music that can touch it and how one grieves when it wastes away and dissolves into correctness knowing it will never visit his bereaved ear again  well how good it was to be able to carry that gracious memory away with me  i approached england the next morning with the wide highway of salt water all to myself  there were ships in the harbor at dover but they were naked as to sails and there was no sign of life about them  it was sunday yet at canterbury the streets were empty strangest of all there was not even a priest in sight and no stroke of a bell fell upon my ear  the mournfulness of death was everywhere  i couldnt understand it  at last in the further edge of that town i saw a small funeral procession just a family and a few friends following a coffinno priest a funeral without bell book or candle there was a church there close at hand but they passed it by weeping and did not enter it i glanced up at the belfry and there hung the bell shrouded in black and its tongue tied back  now i knew  now i understood the stupendous calamity that had overtaken england  invasion invasion is a triviality to it  it was the interdict  i asked no questions i didnt need to ask any  the church had struck the thing for me to do was to get into a disguise and go warily  one of my servants gave me a suit of clothes and when we were safe beyond the town i put them on and from that time i traveled alone i could not risk the embarrassment of company  a miserable journey  a desolate silence everywhere  even in london itself  traffic had ceased men did not talk or laugh or go in groups or even in couples they moved aimlessly about each man by himself with his head down and woe and terror at his heart the tower showed recent warscars  verily much had been happening  of course i meant to take the train for camelot  train  why the station was as vacant as a cavern  i moved on  the journey to camelot was a repetition of what i had already seen  the monday and the tuesday differed in no way from the sunday  i arrived far in the night  from being the best electriclighted town in the kingdom and the most like a recumbent sun of anything you ever saw it was become simply a blota blot upon darknessthat is to say it was darker and solider than the rest of the darkness and so you could see it a little better it made me feel as if maybe it was symbolicala sort of sign that the church was going to keep the upper hand now and snuff out all my beautiful civilization just like that  i found no life stirring in the somber streets i groped my way with a heavy heart  the vast castle loomed black upon the hilltop not a spark visible about it  the drawbridge was down the great gate stood wide i entered without challenge my own heels making the only sound i heardand it was sepulchral enough in those huge vacant courts    chapter xlii  war  i found clarence alone in his quarters drowned in melancholy and in place of the electric light he had reinstituted the ancient raglamp and sat there in a grisly twilight with all curtains drawn tight  he sprang up and rushed for me eagerly saying  oh its worth a billion milrays to look upon a live person again  he knew me as easily as if i hadnt been disguised at all  which frightened me one may easily believe that  quick now tell me the meaning of this fearful disaster i said how did it come about  well if there hadnt been any queen guenever it wouldnt have come so early but it would have come anyway  it would have come on your own account by and by by luck it happened to come on the queens  and sir launcelots  just so  give me the details  i reckon you will grant that during some years there has been only one pair of eyes in these kingdoms that has not been looking steadily askance at the queen and sir launcelot  yes king arthurs  and only one heart that was without suspicion  yesthe kings a heart that isnt capable of thinking evil of a friend  well the king might have gone on still happy and unsuspecting to the end of his days but for one of your modern improvements the stockboard  when you left three miles of the london canterbury and dover were ready for the rails and also ready and ripe for manipulation in the stockmarket  it was wildcat and everybody knew it  the stock was for sale at a giveaway  what does sir launcelot do but  yes i know he quietly picked up nearly all of it for a song then he bought about twice as much more deliverable upon call and he was about to call when i left  very well he did call  the boys couldnt deliver  oh he had themand he just settled his grip and squeezed them  they were laughing in their sleeves over their smartness in selling stock to him at 15 and 16 and along there that wasnt worth 10  well when they had laughed long enough on that side of their mouths they restedup that side by shifting the laugh to the other side that was when they compromised with the invincible at 283  good land  he skinned them alive and they deserved itanyway the whole kingdom rejoiced  well among the flayed were sir agravaine and sir mordred nephews to the king  end of the first act  act second scene first an apartment in carlisle castle where the court had gone for a few days hunting  persons present the whole tribe of the kings nephews  mordred and agravaine propose to call the guileless arthurs attention to guenever and sir launcelot  sir gawaine sir gareth and sir gaheris will have nothing to do with it  a dispute ensues with loud talk in the midst of it enter the king  mordred and agravaine spring their devastating tale upon him  tableau  a trap is laid for launcelot by the kings command and sir launcelot walks into it  he made it sufficiently uncomfortable for the ambushed witnessesto wit mordred agravaine and twelve knights of lesser rank for he killed every one of them but mordred but of course that couldnt straighten matters between launcelot and the king and didnt  oh dear only one thing could resulti see that  war and the knights of the realm divided into a kings party and a sir launcelots party  yesthat was the way of it  the king sent the queen to the stake proposing to purify her with fire  launcelot and his knights rescued her and in doing it slew certain good old friends of yours and minein fact some of the best we ever had to wit sir belias le orgulous sir segwarides sir griflet le fils de dieu sir brandiles sir aglovale  oh you tear out my heartstrings  wait im not done yetsir tor sir gauter sir gillimer  the very best man in my subordinate nine  what a handy rightfielder he was  sir reynolds three brothers sir damus sir priamus sir kay the stranger  my peerless shortstop  ive seen him catch a daisycutter in his teeth  come i cant stand this  sir driant sir lambegus sir herminde sir pertilope sir perimones andwhom do you think  rush  go on  sir gaheris and sir garethboth  oh incredible  their love for launcelot was indestructible  well it was an accident  they were simply onlookers they were unarmed and were merely there to witness the queens punishment sir launcelot smote down whoever came in the way of his blind fury and he killed these without noticing who they were  here is an instantaneous photograph one of our boys got of the battle its for sale on every newsstand  therethe figures nearest the queen are sir launcelot with his sword up and sir gareth gasping his latest breath  you can catch the agony in the queens face through the curling smoke  its a rattling battlepicture  indeed it is  we must take good care of it its historical value is incalculable  go on  well the rest of the tale is just war pure and simple  launcelot retreated to his town and castle of joyous gard and gathered there a great following of knights  the king with a great host went there and there was desperate fighting during several days and as a result all the plain around was paved with corpses and castiron  then the church patched up a peace between arthur and launcelot and the queen and everybodyeverybody but sir gawaine he was bitter about the slaying of his brothers gareth and gaheris and would not be appeased  he notified launcelot to get him thence and make swift preparation and look to be soon attacked so launcelot sailed to his duchy of guienne with his following and gawaine soon followed with an army and he beguiled arthur to go with him  arthur left the kingdom in sir mordreds hands until you should return  aha kings customary wisdom  yes  sir mordred set himself at once to work to make his kingship permanent  he was going to marry guenever as a first move but she fled and shut herself up in the tower of london  mordred attacked the bishop of canterbury dropped down on him with the interdict  the king returned mordred fought him at dover at canterbury and again at barham down  then there was talk of peace and a composition  terms mordred to have cornwall and kent during arthurs life and the whole kingdom afterward  well upon my word  my dream of a republic to be a dream and so remain  yes  the two armies lay near salisbury  gawainegawaines head is at dover castle he fell in the fight theregawaine appeared to arthur in a dream at least his ghost did and warned him to refrain from conflict for a month let the delay cost what it might but battle was precipitated by an accident  arthur had given order that if a sword was raised during the consultation over the proposed treaty with mordred sound the trumpet and fall on for he had no confidence in mordred  mordred had given a similar order to his people  well by and by an adder bit a knights heel the knight forgot all about the order and made a slash at the adder with his sword  inside of half a minute those two prodigious hosts came together with a crash  they butchered away all day then the kinghowever we have started something fresh since you leftour paper has  no  what is that  war correspondence  why thats good  yes the paper was booming right along for the interdict made no impression got no grip while the war lasted  i had war correspondents with both armies  i will finish that battle by reading you what one of the boys says     then the king looked about him and then was he    ware of all his host and of all his good knights    were left no more on live but two knights that    was sir lucan de butlere and his brother sir    bedivere and they were full sore wounded  jesu    mercy said the king where are all my noble    knights becomen  alas that ever i should see this    doleful day  for now said arthur i am come to    mine end  but would to god that i wist where were    that traitor sir mordred that hath caused all    this mischief  then was king arthur ware where sir    mordred leaned upon his sword among a great heap    of dead men  now give me my spear said arthur    unto sir lucan for yonder i have espied the    traitor that all this woe hath wrought  sir let    him be said sir lucan for he is unhappy and if    ye pass this unhappy day ye shall be right well    revenged upon him  good lord remember ye of your    nights dream and what the spirit of sir gawaine    told you this night yet god of his great goodness    hath preserved you hitherto  therefore for gods    sake my lord leave off by this for blessed be    god ye have won the field for here we be three    on live and with sir mordred is none on live    and if ye leave off now this wicked day of    destiny is past  tide me death betide me life    saith the king now i see him yonder alone he    shall never escape mine hands for at a better    avail shall i never have him  god speed you well    said sir bedivere  then the king gat his spear    in both his hands and ran toward sir mordred    crying traitor now is thy death day come  and    when sir mordred heard sir arthur he ran until    him with his sword drawn in his hand  and then    king arthur smote sir mordred under the shield    with a foin of his spear throughout the body more    than a fathom  and when sir mordred felt that he    had his deaths wound he thrust himself with    the might that he had up to the butt of king    arthurs spear  and right so he smote his father    arthur with his sword holden in both his hands    on the side of the head that the sword pierced    the helmet and the brainpan and therewithal    sir mordred fell stark dead to the earth  and    the noble arthur fell in a swoon to the earth    and there he swooned ofttimes  that is a good piece of war correspondence clarence you are a firstrate newspaper man  wellis the king all right  did he get well  poor soul no  he is dead  i was utterly stunned it had not seemed to me that any wound could be mortal to him  and the queen clarence  she is a nun in almesbury  what changes and in such a short while  it is inconceivable what next i wonder  i can tell you what next  well  stake our lives and stand by them  what do you mean by that  the church is master now  the interdict included you with mordred it is not to be removed while you remain alive  the clans are gathering  the church has gathered all the knights that are left alive and as soon as you are discovered we shall have business on our hands  stuff  with our deadly scientific warmaterial with our hosts of trained  save your breathwe havent sixty faithful left  what are you saying  our schools our colleges our vast workshops our  when those knights come those establishments will empty themselves and go over to the enemy  did you think you had educated the superstition out of those people  i certainly did think it  well then you may unthink it  they stood every strain easily until the interdict  since then they merely put on a bold outsideat heart they are quaking  make up your mind to it when the armies come the mask will fall  its hard news  we are lost  they will turn our own science against us  no they wont  why  because i and a handful of the faithful have blocked that game ill tell you what ive done and what moved me to it  smart as you are the church was smarter  it was the church that sent you cruisingthrough her servants the doctors  clarence  it is the truth  i know it  every officer of your ship was the churchs picked servant and so was every man of the crew  oh come  it is just as i tell you  i did not find out these things at once but i found them out finally  did you send me verbal information by the commander of the ship to the effect that upon his return to you with supplies you were going to leave cadiz  cadiz  i havent been at cadiz at all  going to leave cadiz and cruise in distant seas indefinitely for the health of your family  did you send me that word  of course not  i would have written wouldnt i  naturally  i was troubled and suspicious  when the commander sailed again i managed to ship a spy with him  i have never heard of vessel or spy since  i gave myself two weeks to hear from you in  then i resolved to send a ship to cadiz  there was a reason why i didnt  what was that  our navy had suddenly and mysteriously disappeared  also as suddenly and as mysteriously the railway and telegraph and telephone service ceased the men all deserted poles were cut down the church laid a ban upon the electric light  i had to be up and doingand straight off  your life was safenobody in these kingdoms but merlin would venture to touch such a magician as you without ten thousand men at his backi had nothing to think of but how to put preparations in the best trim against your coming  i felt safe myselfnobody would be anxious to touch a pet of yours  so this is what i did  from our various works i selected all the menboys i meanwhose faithfulness under whatsoever pressure i could swear to and i called them together secretly and gave them their instructions  there are fiftytwo of them none younger than fourteen and none above seventeen years old  why did you select boys  because all the others were born in an atmosphere of superstition and reared in it  it is in their blood and bones  we imagined we had educated it out of them they thought so too the interdict woke them up like a thunderclap  it revealed them to themselves and it revealed them to me too  with boys it was different  such as have been under our training from seven to ten years have had no acquaintance with the churchs terrors and it was among these that i found my fiftytwo  as a next move i paid a private visit to that old cave of merlinsnot the small onethe big one  yes the one where we secretly established our first great electric plant when i was projecting a miracle  just so  and as that miracle hadnt become necessary then i thought it might be a good idea to utilize the plant now  ive provisioned the cave for a siege  a good idea a firstrate idea  i think so  i placed four of my boys there as a guardinside and out of sight  nobody was to be hurtwhile outside but any attempt to enterwell we said just let anybody try it  then i went out into the hills and uncovered and cut the secret wires which connected your bedroom with the wires that go to the dynamite deposits under all our vast factories mills workshops magazines etc and about midnight i and my boys turned out and connected that wire with the cave and nobody but you and i suspects where the other end of it goes to  we laid it under ground of course and it was all finished in a couple of hours or so  we shant have to leave our fortress now when we want to blow up our civilization  it was the right moveand the natural one military necessity in the changed condition of things  well what changes have come we expected to be besieged in the palace some time or other but however go on  next we built a wire fence  wire fence  yes  you dropped the hint of it yourself two or three years ago  oh i rememberthe time the church tried her strength against us the first time and presently thought it wise to wait for a hopefuler season  well how have you arranged the fence  i start twelve immensely strong wiresnaked not insulated from a big dynamo in the cavedynamo with no brushes except a positive and a negative one  yes thats right  the wires go out from the cave and fence in a circle of level ground a hundred yards in diameter they make twelve independent fences ten feet apartthat is to say twelve circles within circlesand their ends come into the cave again  right go on  the fences are fastened to heavy oaken posts only three feet apart and these posts are sunk five feet in the ground  that is good and strong  yes  the wires have no groundconnection outside of the cave they go out from the positive brush of the dynamo there is a groundconnection through the negative brush the other ends of the wire return to the cave and each is grounded independently  no no that wont do  why  its too expensiveuses up force for nothing  you dont want any groundconnection except the one through the negative brush the other end of every wire must be brought back into the cave and fastened independently and without any groundconnection now then observe the economy of it  a cavalry charge hurls itself against the fence you are using no power you are spending no money for there is only one groundconnection till those horses come against the wire the moment they touch it they form a connection with the negative brush through the ground and drop dead  dont you seeyou are using no energy until it is needed your lightning is there and ready like the load in a gun but it isnt costing you a cent till you touch it off  oh yes the single groundconnection  of course  i dont know how i overlooked that  its not only cheaper but its more effectual than the other way for if wires break or get tangled no harm is done  no especially if we have a telltale in the cave and disconnect the broken wire  well go on  the gatlings  yesthats arranged  in the center of the inner circle on a spacious platform six feet high ive grouped a battery of thirteen gatling guns and provided plenty of ammunition  thats it  they command every approach and when the churchs knights arrive theres going to be music  the brow of the precipice over the cave  ive got a wire fence there and a gatling  they wont drop any rocks down on us  well and the glasscylinder dynamite torpedoes  thats attended to  its the prettiest garden that was ever planted  its a belt forty feet wide and goes around the outer fencedistance between it and the fence one hundred yardskind of neutral ground that space is  there isnt a single square yard of that whole belt but is equipped with a torpedo  we laid them on the surface of the ground and sprinkled a layer of sand over them  its an innocent looking garden but you let a man start in to hoe it once and youll see  you tested the torpedoes  well i was going to but  but what  why its an immense oversight not to apply a  test  yes i know but theyre all right i laid a few in the public road beyond our lines and theyve been tested  oh that alters the case  who did it  a church committee  how kind  yes  they came to command us to make submission  you see they didnt really come to test the torpedoes that was merely an incident  did the committee make a report  yes they made one  you could have heard it a mile  unanimous  that was the nature of it  after that i put up some signs for the protection of future committees and we have had no intruders since  clarence youve done a world of work and done it perfectly  we had plenty of time for it there wasnt any occasion for hurry  we sat silent awhile thinking  then my mind was made up and i said  yes everything is ready everything is shipshape no detail is wanting  i know what to do now  so do i sit down and wait  no sir rise up and strike  do you mean it  yes indeed  the defensive isnt in my line and the offensive is  that is when i hold a fair handtwothirds as good a hand as the enemy  oh yes well rise up and strike thats our game  a hundred to one you are right  when does the performance begin  now  well proclaim the republic  well that will precipitate things sure enough  it will make them buzz i tell you  england will be a hornets nest before noon tomorrow if the churchs hand hasnt lost its cunningand we know it hasnt  now you write and ill dictate thus                        proclamation                                  be it known unto all  whereas the king having died    and left no heir it becomes my duty to continue the    executive authority vested in me until a government    shall have been created and set in motion  the    monarchy has lapsed it no longer exists  by    consequence all political power has reverted to its    original source the people of the nation  with the    monarchy its several adjuncts died also wherefore    there is no longer a nobility no longer a privileged    class no longer an established church all men are    become exactly equal they are upon one common    level and religion is free  a republic is hereby    proclaimed as being the natural estate of a nation    when other authority has ceased  it is the duty of    the british people to meet together immediately    and by their votes elect representatives and deliver    into their hands the government  i signed it the boss and dated it from merlins cave clarence said  why that tells where we are and invites them to call right away  that is the idea  we strikeby the proclamationthen its their innings  now have the thing set up and printed and posted right off that is give the order then if youve got a couple of bicycles handy at the foot of the hill ho for merlins cave  i shall be ready in ten minutes  what a cyclone there is going to be tomorrow when this piece of paper gets to work  its a pleasant old palace this is i wonder if we shall ever again but never mind about that    chapter xliii  the battle of the sand belt  in merlins caveclarence and i and fiftytwo fresh bright welleducated cleanminded young british boys  at dawn i sent an order to the factories and to all our great works to stop operations and remove all life to a safe distance as everything was going to be blown up by secret mines and no telling at what momenttherefore vacate at once  these people knew me and had confidence in my word  they would clear out without waiting to part their hair and i could take my own time about dating the explosion  you couldnt hire one of them to go back during the century if the explosion was still impending  we had a week of waiting  it was not dull for me because i was writing all the time  during the first three days i finished turning my old diary into this narrative form it only required a chapter or so to bring it down to date  the rest of the week i took up in writing letters to my wife  it was always my habit to write to sandy every day whenever we were separate and now i kept up the habit for love of it and of her though i couldnt do anything with the letters of course after i had written them but it put in the time you see and was almost like talking it was almost as if i was saying sandy if you and hellocentral were here in the cave instead of only your photographs what good times we could have  and then you know i could imagine the baby googooing something out in reply with its fists in its mouth and itself stretched across its mothers lap on its back and she alaughing and admiring and worshipping and now and then tickling under the babys chin to set it cackling and then maybe throwing in a word of answer to me herselfand so on and so on well dont you know i could sit there in the cave with my pen and keep it up that way by the hour with them  why it was almost like having us all together again  i had spies out every night of course to get news  every report made things look more and more impressive  the hosts were gathering gathering down all the roads and paths of england the knights were riding and priests rode with them to hearten these original crusaders this being the churchs war  all the nobilities big and little were on their way and all the gentry  this was all as was expected  we should thin out this sort of folk to such a degree that the people would have nothing to do but just step to the front with their republic and  ah what a donkey i was  toward the end of the week i began to get this large and disenchanting fact through my head that the mass of the nation had swung their caps and shouted for the republic for about one day and there an end  the church the nobles and the gentry then turned one grand alldisapproving frown upon them and shriveled them into sheep  from that moment the sheep had begun to gather to the foldthat is to say the campsand offer their valueless lives and their valuable wool to the righteous cause  why even the very men who had lately been slaves were in the righteous cause and glorifying it praying for it sentimentally slabbering over it just like all the other commoners imagine such human muck as this conceive of this folly  yes it was now death to the republic everywherenot a dissenting voice  all england was marching against us  truly this was more than i had bargained for  i watched my fiftytwo boys narrowly watched their faces their walk their unconscious attitudes for all these are a language a language given us purposely that it may betray us in times of emergency when we have secrets which we want to keep  i knew that that thought would keep saying itself over and over again in their minds and hearts all england is marching against us and ever more strenuously imploring attention with each repetition ever more sharply realizing itself to their imaginations until even in their sleep they would find no rest from it but hear the vague and flitting creatures of the dreams say all england all englandis marching against you  i knew all this would happen i knew that ultimately the pressure would become so great that it would compel utterance therefore i must be ready with an answer at that timean answer well chosen and tranquilizing  i was right  the time came  they had to speak  poor lads it was pitiful to see they were so pale so worn so troubled  at first their spokesman could hardly find voice or words but he presently got both  this is what he saidand he put it in the neat modern english taught him in my schools  we have tried to forget what we areenglish boys  we have tried to put reason before sentiment duty before love our minds approve but our hearts reproach us  while apparently it was only the nobility only the gentry only the twentyfive or thirty thousand knights left alive out of the late wars we were of one mind and undisturbed by any troubling doubt each and every one of these fiftytwo lads who stand here before you said they have chosenit is their affair  but thinkthe matter is alteredall england is marching against us  oh sir consider reflectthese people are our people they are bone of our bone flesh of our flesh we love themdo not ask us to destroy our nation  well it shows the value of looking ahead and being ready for a thing when it happens  if i hadnt foreseen this thing and been fixed that boy would have had mei couldnt have said a word but i was fixed  i said  my boys your hearts are in the right place you have thought the worthy thought you have done the worthy thing  you are english boys you will remain english boys and you will keep that name unsmirched  give yourselves no further concern let your minds be at peace  consider this while all england is marching against us who is in the van  who by the commonest rules of war will march in the front  answer me  the mounted host of mailed knights  true  they are thirty thousand strong  acres deep they will march now observe none but they will ever strike the sandbelt  then there will be an episode  immediately after the civilian multitude in the rear will retire to meet business engagements elsewhere none but nobles and gentry are knights and none but these will remain to dance to our music after that episode  it is absolutely true that we shall have to fight nobody but these thirty thousand knights  now speak and it shall be as you decide  shall we avoid the battle retire from the field  no  the shout was unanimous and hearty  are youare youwell afraid of these thirty thousand knights  that joke brought out a good laugh the boys troubles vanished away and they went gaily to their posts  ah they were a darling fiftytwo  as pretty as girls too  i was ready for the enemy now  let the approaching big day come alongit would find us on deck  the big day arrived on time  at dawn the sentry on watch in the corral came into the cave and reported a moving black mass under the horizon and a faint sound which he thought to be military music  breakfast was just ready we sat down and ate it  this over i made the boys a little speech and then sent out a detail to man the battery with clarence in command of it  the sun rose presently and sent its unobstructed splendors over the land and we saw a prodigious host moving slowly toward us with the steady drift and aligned front of a wave of the sea nearer and nearer it came and more and more sublimely imposing became its aspect yes all england was there apparently  soon we could see the innumerable banners fluttering and then the sun struck the sea of armor and set it all aflash  yes it was a fine sight i hadnt ever seen anything to beat it  at last we could make out details  all the front ranks no telling how many acres deep were horsemenplumed knights in armor suddenly we heard the blare of trumpets the slow walk burst into a gallop and thenwell it was wonderful to see  down swept that vast horseshoe waveit approached the sandbeltmy breath stood still nearer nearerthe strip of green turf beyond the yellow belt grew narrownarrower stillbecame a mere ribbon in front of the horsesthen disappeared under their hoofs  great scott  why the whole front of that host shot into the sky with a thundercrash and became a whirling tempest of rags and fragments and along the ground lay a thick wall of smoke that hid what was left of the multitude from our sight  time for the second step in the plan of campaign  i touched a button and shook the bones of england loose from her spine  in that explosion all our noble civilizationfactories went up in the air and disappeared from the earth  it was a pity but it was necessary  we could not afford to let the enemy turn our own weapons against us  now ensued one of the dullest quarterhours i had ever endured we waited in a silent solitude enclosed by our circles of wire and by a circle of heavy smoke outside of these  we couldnt see over the wall of smoke and we couldnt see through it  but at last it began to shred away lazily and by the end of another quarterhour the land was clear and our curiosity was enabled to satisfy itself  no living creature was in sight  we now perceived that additions had been made to our defenses  the dynamite had dug a ditch more than a hundred feet wide all around us and cast up an embankment some twentyfive feet high on both borders of it  as to destruction of life it was amazing  moreover it was beyond estimate  of course we could not count the dead because they did not exist as individuals but merely as homogeneous protoplasm with alloys of iron and buttons  no life was in sight but necessarily there must have been some wounded in the rear ranks who were carried off the field under cover of the wall of smoke there would be sickness among the othersthere always is after an episode like that  but there would be no reinforcements this was the last stand of the chivalry of england it was all that was left of the order after the recent annihilating wars  so i felt quite safe in believing that the utmost force that could for the future be brought against us would be but small that is of knights  i therefore issued a congratulatory proclamation to my army in these words     soldiers champions of human liberty and equality    your general congratulates you  in the pride of his    strength and the vanity of his renown an arrogant    enemy came against you  you were ready  the conflict    was brief on your side glorious  this mighty    victory having been achieved utterly without loss    stands without example in history  so long as the    planets shall continue to move in their orbits the    battle of the sandbelt will not perish out of the    memories of men                                  the boss  i read it well and the applause i got was very gratifying to me i then wound up with these remarks  the war with the english nation as a nation is at an end the nation has retired from the field and the war  before it can be persuaded to return war will have ceased  this campaign is the only one that is going to be fought  it will be brief the briefest in history  also the most destructive to life considered from the standpoint of proportion of casualties to numbers engaged  we are done with the nation henceforth we deal only with the knights  english knights can be killed but they cannot be conquered  we know what is before us  while one of these men remains alive our task is not finished the war is not ended  we will kill them all  loud and long continued applause  i picketed the great embankments thrown up around our lines by the dynamite explosionmerely a lookout of a couple of boys to announce the enemy when he should appear again  next i sent an engineer and forty men to a point just beyond our lines on the south to turn a mountain brook that was there and bring it within our lines and under our command arranging it in such a way that i could make instant use of it in an emergency the forty men were divided into two shifts of twenty each and were to relieve each other every two hours  in ten hours the work was accomplished  it was nightfall now and i withdrew my pickets  the one who had had the northern outlook reported a camp in sight but visible with the glass only  he also reported that a few knights had been feeling their way toward us and had driven some cattle across our lines but that the knights themselves had not come very near that was what i had been expecting  they were feeling us you see they wanted to know if we were going to play that red terror on them again  they would grow bolder in the night perhaps i believed i knew what project they would attempt because it was plainly the thing i would attempt myself if i were in their places and as ignorant as they were  i mentioned it to clarence  i think you are right said he it is the obvious thing for them to try  well then i said if they do it they are doomed  certainly  they wont have the slightest show in the world  of course they wont  its dreadful clarence  it seems an awful pity  the thing disturbed me so that i couldnt get any peace of mind for thinking of it and worrying over it  so at last to quiet my conscience i framed this message to the knights     to the honorable the commander of the insurgent    chivalry of england you fight in vain  we know    your strengthif one may call it by that name    we know that at the utmost you cannot bring    against us above five and twenty thousand knights    therefore you have no chancenone whatever    reflect we are well equipped well fortified we    number 54  fiftyfour what  men  no mindsthe    capablest in the world a force against which    mere animal might may no more hope to prevail than    may the idle waves of the sea hope to prevail    against the granite barriers of england  be advised    we offer you your lives for the sake of your    families do not reject the gift  we offer you    this chance and it is the last throw down your    arms surrender unconditionally to the republic    and all will be forgiven                            signed the boss  i read it to clarence and said i proposed to send it by a flag of truce  he laughed the sarcastic laugh he was born with and said  somehow it seems impossible for you to ever fully realize what these nobilities are  now let us save a little time and trouble consider me the commander of the knights yonder  now then you are the flag of truce approach and deliver me your message and i will give you your answer  i humored the idea  i came forward under an imaginary guard of the enemys soldiers produced my paper and read it through for answer clarence struck the paper out of my hand pursed up a scornful lip and said with lofty disdain  dismember me this animal and return him in a basket to the baseborn knave who sent him other answer have i none  how empty is theory in presence of fact  and this was just fact and nothing else  it was the thing that would have happened there was no getting around that  i tore up the paper and granted my mistimed sentimentalities a permanent rest  then to business  i tested the electric signals from the gatling platform to the cave and made sure that they were all right i tested and retested those which commanded the fencesthese were signals whereby i could break and renew the electric current in each fence independently of the others at will  i placed the brookconnection under the guard and authority of three of my best boys who would alternate in twohour watches all night and promptly obey my signal if i should have occasion to give it three revolvershots in quick succession  sentryduty was discarded for the night and the corral left empty of life i ordered that quiet be maintained in the cave and the electric lights turned down to a glimmer  as soon as it was good and dark i shut off the current from all the fences and then groped my way out to the embankment bordering our side of the great dynamite ditch  i crept to the top of it and lay there on the slant of the muck to watch  but it was too dark to see anything  as for sounds there were none  the stillness was deathlike  true there were the usual nightsounds of the countrythe whir of nightbirds the buzzing of insects the barking of distant dogs the mellow lowing of faroff kine but these didnt seem to break the stillness they only intensified it and added a grewsome melancholy to it into the bargain  i presently gave up looking the night shut down so black but i kept my ears strained to catch the least suspicious sound for i judged i had only to wait and i shouldnt be disappointed however i had to wait a long time  at last i caught what you may call in distinct glimpses of sound dulled metallic sound i pricked up my ears then and held my breath for this was the sort of thing i had been waiting for  this sound thickened and approachedfrom toward the north  presently i heard it at my own levelthe ridgetop of the opposite embankment a hundred feet or more away  then i seemed to see a row of black dots appear along that ridgehuman heads  i couldnt tell it mightnt be anything at all you cant depend on your eyes when your imagination is out of focus  however the question was soon settled  i heard that metallic noise descending into the great ditch  it augmented fast it spread all along and it unmistakably furnished me this fact an armed host was taking up its quarters in the ditch  yes these people were arranging a little surprise party for us  we could expect entertainment about dawn possibly earlier  i groped my way back to the corral now i had seen enough  i went to the platform and signaled to turn the current on to the two inner fences  then i went into the cave and found everything satisfactory therenobody awake but the workingwatch  i woke clarence and told him the great ditch was filling up with men and that i believed all the knights were coming for us in a body it was my notion that as soon as dawn approached we could expect the ditchs ambuscaded thousands to swarm up over the embankment and make an assault and be followed immediately by the rest of their army  clarence said  they will be wanting to send a scout or two in the dark to make preliminary observations  why not take the lightning off the outer fences and give them a chance  ive already done it clarence  did you ever know me to be inhospitable  no you are a good heart  i want to go and  be a reception committee  i will go too  we crossed the corral and lay down together between the two inside fences  even the dim light of the cave had disordered our eyesight somewhat but the focus straightway began to regulate itself and soon it was adjusted for present circumstances  we had had to feel our way before but we could make out to see the fence posts now we started a whispered conversation but suddenly clarence broke off and said  what is that  what is what  that thing yonder  what thingwhere  there beyond you a little piecedark somethinga dull shape of some kindagainst the second fence  i gazed and he gazed  i said  could it be a man clarence  no i think not  if you notice it looks a litwhy it is a manleaning on the fence  i certainly believe it is let us go and see  we crept along on our hands and knees until we were pretty close and then looked up  yes it was a mana dim great figure in armor standing erect with both hands on the upper wireand of course there was a smell of burning flesh  poor fellow dead as a doornail and never knew what hurt him  he stood there like a statueno motion about him except that his plumes swished about a little in the night wind  we rose up and looked in through the bars of his visor but couldnt make out whether we knew him or notfeatures too dim and shadowed  we heard muffled sounds approaching and we sank down to the ground where we were  we made out another knight vaguely he was coming very stealthily and feeling his way  he was near enough now for us to see him put out a hand find an upper wire then bend and step under it and over the lower one  now he arrived at the first knightand started slightly when he discovered him  he stood a momentno doubt wondering why the other one didnt move on then he said in a low voice why dreamest thou here good sir mar then he laid his hand on the corpses shoulderand just uttered a little soft moan and sunk down dead  killed by a dead man you seekilled by a dead friend in fact  there was something awful about it  these early birds came scattering along after each other about one every five minutes in our vicinity during half an hour they brought no armor of offense but their swords as a rule they carried the sword ready in the hand and put it forward and found the wires with it  we would now and then see a blue spark when the knight that caused it was so far away as to be invisible to us but we knew what had happened all the same poor fellow he had touched a charged wire with his sword and been electrocuted we had brief intervals of grim stillness interrupted with piteous regularity by the clash made by the falling of an ironclad and this sort of thing was going on right along and was very creepy there in the dark and lonesomeness  we concluded to make a tour between the inner fences  we elected to walk upright for conveniences sake we argued that if discerned we should be taken for friends rather than enemies and in any case we should be out of reach of swords and these gentry did not seem to have any spears along  well it was a curious trip  everywhere dead men were lying outside the second fencenot plainly visible but still visible and we counted fifteen of those pathetic statuesdead knights standing with their hands on the upper wire  one thing seemed to be sufficiently demonstrated our current was so tremendous that it killed before the victim could cry out pretty soon we detected a muffled and heavy sound and next moment we guessed what it was  it was a surprise in force coming i whispered clarence to go and wake the army and notify it to wait in silence in the cave for further orders  he was soon back and we stood by the inner fence and watched the silent lightning do its awful work upon that swarming host  one could make out but little of detail but he could note that a black mass was piling itself up beyond the second fence  that swelling bulk was dead men  our camp was enclosed with a solid wall of the deada bulwark a breastwork of corpses you may say  one terrible thing about this thing was the absence of human voices there were no cheers no war cries being intent upon a surprise these men moved as noiselessly as they could and always when the front rank was near enough to their goal to make it proper for them to begin to get a shout ready of course they struck the fatal line and went down without testifying  i sent a current through the third fence now and almost immediately through the fourth and fifth so quickly were the gaps filled up i believed the time was come now for my climax i believed that that whole army was in our trap  anyway it was high time to find out  so i touched a button and set fifty electric suns aflame on the top of our precipice  land what a sight  we were enclosed in three walls of dead men all the other fences were pretty nearly filled with the living who were stealthily working their way forward through the wires the sudden glare paralyzed this host petrified them you may say with astonishment there was just one instant for me to utilize their immobility in and i didnt lose the chance  you see in another instant they would have recovered their faculties then theyd have burst into a cheer and made a rush and my wires would have gone down before it but that lost instant lost them their opportunity forever while even that slight fragment of time was still unspent i shot the current through all the fences and struck the whole host dead in their tracks  there was a groan you could hear  it voiced the deathpang of eleven thousand men it swelled out on the night with awful pathos  a glance showed that the rest of the enemyperhaps ten thousand strongwere between us and the encircling ditch and pressing forward to the assault  consequently we had them all and had them past help  time for the last act of the tragedy  i fired the three appointed revolver shotswhich meant  turn on the water  there was a sudden rush and roar and in a minute the mountain brook was raging through the big ditch and creating a river a hundred feet wide and twentyfive deep  stand to your guns men  open fire  the thirteen gatlings began to vomit death into the fated ten thousand  they halted they stood their ground a moment against that withering deluge of fire then they broke faced about and swept toward the ditch like chaff before a gale  a full fourth part of their force never reached the top of the lofty embankment the threefourths reached it and plunged overto death by drowning  within ten short minutes after we had opened fire armed resistance was totally annihilated the campaign was ended we fiftyfour were masters of england  twentyfive thousand men lay dead around us  but how treacherous is fortune  in a little whilesay an hour happened a thing by my own fault whichbut i have no heart to write that  let the record end here    chapter xliv  a postscript by clarence  i clarence must write it for him  he proposed that we two go out and see if any help could be accorded the wounded  i was strenuous against the project  i said that if there were many we could do but little for them and it would not be wise for us to trust ourselves among them anyway  but he could seldom be turned from a purpose once formed so we shut off the electric current from the fences took an escort along climbed over the enclosing ramparts of dead knights and moved out upon the field  the first wounded mall who appealed for help was sitting with his back against a dead comrade  when the boss bent over him and spoke to him the man recognized him and stabbed him  that knight was sir meliagraunce as i found out by tearing off his helmet  he will not ask for help any more  we carried the boss to the cave and gave his wound which was not very serious the best care we could  in this service we had the help of merlin though we did not know it  he was disguised as a woman and appeared to be a simple old peasant goodwife in this disguise with brownstained face and smooth shaven he had appeared a few days after the boss was hurt and offered to cook for us saying her people had gone off to join certain new camps which the enemy were forming and that she was starving  the boss had been getting along very well and had amused himself with finishing up his record  we were glad to have this woman for we were short handed  we were in a trap you seea trap of our own making  if we stayed where we were our dead would kill us if we moved out of our defenses we should no longer be invincible  we had conquered in turn we were conquered  the boss recognized this we all recognized it  if we could go to one of those new camps and patch up some kind of terms with the enemyyes but the boss could not go and neither could i for i was among the first that were made sick by the poisonous air bred by those dead thousands others were taken down and still others  tomorrow  tomorrow  it is here  and with it the end  about midnight i awoke and saw that hag making curious passes in the air about the bosss head and face and wondered what it meant  everybody but the dynamowatch lay steeped in sleep there was no sound the woman ceased from her mysterious foolery and started tiptoeing toward the door  i called out  stop  what have you been doing  she halted and said with an accent of malicious satisfaction  ye were conquerors ye are conquered  these others are perishing you also  ye shall all die in this placeevery oneexcept him he sleepeth nowand shall sleep thirteen centuries  i am merlin  then such a delirium of silly laughter overtook him that he reeled about like a drunken man and presently fetched up against one of our wires  his mouth is spread open yet apparently he is still laughing  i suppose the face will retain that petrified laugh until the corpse turns to dust  the boss has never stirredsleeps like a stone  if he does not wake today we shall understand what kind of a sleep it is and his body will then be borne to a place in one of the remote recesses of the cave where none will ever find it to desecrate it  as for the rest of uswell it is agreed that if any one of us ever escapes alive from this place he will write the fact here and loyally hide this manuscript with the boss our dear good chief whose property it is be he alive or dead    the end of the manuscript      final ps by mt  the dawn was come when i laid the manuscript aside  the rain had almost ceased the world was gray and sad the exhausted storm was sighing and sobbing itself to rest  i went to the strangers room and listened at his door which was slightly ajar  i could hear his voice and so i knocked  there was no answer but i still heard the voice  i peeped in  the man lay on his back in bed talking brokenly but with spirit and punctuating with his arms which he thrashed about restlessly as sick people do in delirium i slipped in softly and bent over him  his mutterings and ejaculations went on  i spokemerely a word to call his attention his glassy eyes and his ashy face were alight in an instant with pleasure gratitude gladness welcome  oh sandy you are come at lasthow i have longed for you  sit by medo not leave menever leave me again sandy never again where is your handgive it me dear let me hold itthere now all is well all is peace and i am happy againwe are happy again isnt it so sandy  you are so dim so vague you are but a mist a cloud but you are here and that is blessedness sufficient and i have your hand dont take it awayit is for only a little while i shall not require it long  was that the child hellocentral she doesnt answer  asleep perhaps  bring her when she wakes and let me touch her hands her face her hair and tell her goodbye  sandy  yes you are there  i lost myself a moment and i thought you were gone  have i been sick long  it must be so it seems months to me  and such dreams such strange and awful dreams sandy  dreams that were as real as realitydelirium of course but so real  why i thought the king was dead i thought you were in gaul and couldnt get home i thought there was a revolution in the fantastic frenzy of these dreams i thought that clarence and i and a handful of my cadets fought and exterminated the whole chivalry of england but even that was not the strangest  i seemed to be a creature out of a remote unborn age centuries hence and even that was as real as the rest  yes i seemed to have flown back out of that age into this of ours and then forward to it again and was set down a stranger and forlorn in that strange england with an abyss of thirteen centuries yawning between me and you between me and my home and my friends between me and all that is dear to me all that could make life worth the living  it was awful awfuler than you can ever imagine sandy  ah watch by me sandy stay by me every momentdont let me go out of my mind again death is nothing let it come but not with those dreams not with the torture of those hideous dreamsi cannot endure that again sandy  he lay muttering incoherently some little time then for a time he lay silent and apparently sinking away toward death  presently his fingers began to pick busily at the coverlet and by that sign i knew that his end was at hand with the first suggestion of the deathrattle in his throat he started up slightly and seemed to listen then he said  a bugle  it is the king  the drawbridge there  man the battlementsturn out the  he was getting up his last effect but he never finished it
